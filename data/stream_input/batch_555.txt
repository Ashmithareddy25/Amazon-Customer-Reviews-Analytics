B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is another entry into today's trendy \\"new-wave-influenced-alternative-pop-rock\\". Their first self-titled album is full of fun and catchy songs, but they aren't interesting or thought-provoking enough to truly make it a classic and an essential own (the album doesn't seem to have much soul to it). I can't put my finger on it but there's also something about the songs that make it kind of cheesy (they don't sound...\\"serious\\", and this hurts the rating). A lot of the songs are memorable lyrically simply because they're simple and catchy (it's easy to sing along) - they're definitely not deep, though. The musicianship is occasionally interesting but in a generic kind of way. All things aside, however, there is a high probability that you'll like this album, so for that reason alone I'd recommend buying it. The bonus tracks help, but not by much. Not an essential album but worth getting if you have the extra cash. Recommended.  <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />the whole album!
B000AA305M|1.0|I was given this as a gift, told I would *LOVE* it, and couldn't wait to get it home and into my iPod's music rotation. Unfortunately, SonyBMG has made that \\"unauthorized\\". Imagine that...they've taken a device with a major share of the market and deemed it unauthorized. It seems that should be illegal, doesn't it? <br /> <br />I have thousands of artists to choose from...I can live without David Grays' music if Sony continues to try and strongarm me into supporting it's business partners. Buying this CD should NOT obligate me to use .wmf files or rely on Microsoft's MusicMatch Jukebox. <br /> <br />I might have been a fan, but I'm not going to go through any trouble.
B000002L5P|5.0|I'll be honest and admit that I like \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" a lot more than this, but I can still understand why this is also a classic. Morrissey sounds as inspired and fresh as he did on their debut, and he even tries to be experimental in a couple tracks (see \\"Miserable Lie\\"). He's not immediately likable at first (like he was on \\"The Queen Is Dead\\"), but he'll definitely grow on you. The lyrics here are all very well-written, deep and sometimes quotable - you'll definitely like listening to them closely (\\"I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear\\" is a personal favorite). Musically it has a sound reminiscent of R.E.M.'s jangle pop, but they manage to sound different even with these kinds of similarities - the musicianship is very well done, interesting and well-produced here. Most people probably only know the hit \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\", but every track here is good - I would argue that one song people will most likely hate for a long time is \\"Miserable Lie\\" because of Morrissey's seemingly irritating wailing towards the end (I hated it for a LONG time). However, if you can look past his singing for a minute and listen to the lyrics and the music itself then one can see how fantastic \\"The Smiths\\" is. Absolutely recommended (along with \\"The Queen Is Dead\\")!    Highlights include:  \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\\"  \\"This Charming Man\\"  \\"Still Ill\\"  \\"Hand In Glove\\"  \\"What Difference Does It Make?\\"  \\"I Don't Owe You Anything\\"  the rest are also good
B00070DK1E|5.0|I'm probably one of not too many people who are fans of both these bands. I've got everything both bands have done .Crest of a Knave is hardly a metal album but arguably is... a hard rock album. The fact of the matter is , Crest is a better album than  ...And Justice For All ( its no Kill Em All -MOP or RTL ). The musicianship ( save track 1 ) is better , the lyrical content is better , and the songs  themselves are more thoughtful and complex . The thing i have never quite understood is how a band like Metallica missed the Jethro Tull boat . Tull along with Deep Purple, Cream , Mountain etc. were at the very forefront of the hard rock scene in the late 60s - early 70s. Anyone who follows music can tell you that metal evolved from hard rock . So ...exactly what rock were  Hetfield , Hammett and Ulrich hiding under ? I've followed these guys from their inception - the Mustaine ,Mcgovney (and Burton )years . From the beginning, for some odd reason , the boys in Metallica thought themselves to be gods gift to music . However I've yet to hear anything as creative as Thick , Aqualung or the hard rock masterpiece Benefit from them. Even the so called critics don't seem to see this , citing the horrible injustice leveled on poor ,poor Metallica at the '88 grammys. Let's see the Hetfield ,Hammett , Ulrich team come up with a \\" Thick as a Brick\\". Until then , just pipe down , hold  those tears back and try coming up with a decent album - then some lame ass award show 'll be sure to kiss your butts . btw  - check out Raising Steam, Jump Start, Farm on the Freeway and Budapest -all great songs from the best \\" hard rock \\" album of 1988 .
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers are one of the few mainstream pop rock bans that actually have realy talent. They may not be the best lyricists in the world, but they definitely know how to create a GREAT hook and melody. Practically everything about the album is great, but there are two things that stop it from earning a \\"5\\" - its slight cheesiness and the lyrical content. The first part is due to the fact that the songs feel produced - they don't \\"feel\\" right for some reason. Perhaps this is due to the fact that they're just another band in a slew of similar ones (like Franz Ferdinand, for example). On the other hand the lyrics are also kind've subpar - they're definitely catchy and memorable, but they aren't deep at all. They're essentially tailor-made to make the songs more catchy (and this DEFINITELY worked). It seems like they were just trying to cash in on the new fad instead of making an actual artistic statement. However, with those two minor grievances out of the way, one will probably love this album! Every song here is great (not just the two hits), and the singer himself is also very likable. It's just an incredibly fun and energetic album. For those looking for a fun new wavish pop rock album to rock out too, then \\"Hot Fuss\\" will deliver in spades. Highly recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
1594830835|2.0|Baldacci joins a large rank of current authors who use their prose to spout the liberal view (over & over in Baldacci's case). While it is hard to tell where he stands in the book, I did skip the parts that went on & on about the poor muslim terrorists & what they have suffered. The story itself is plausible...a club that centers on conspiracy theories, an almost retired secret service agent, who is likeable...and several fanatics. I hope there is no truth in this story.<br /><br />  Basically it doesn't make a lot of sense in the end...just goes on & on with the violence & subplots. Baldacci can do a lot better than this one. From now on I'll read books written before 2000...just enough already of the liberal ideology.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The acting by Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt is nothing short of greatness. Everything about this movie is perfect and the ending will leave you in tears (I admit I teared up a couple of times). The Elephant Man should be shown in schools to promote tolerance for those who are different.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I've never seen the 1930 or 1976 movies, so I had nothing to go by entering the theater except Peter Jackson himself -- the director who brought The Lord of the Rings to the big screen in an excellent adaptation that stayed true to the core of Tolkien's tale. If anyone can handle remaking Kong, Jackson can. <br /> <br />The verdict is simple: Peter Jackson is officially the Michael Jordan of directors. NO OTHER DIRECTOR could have achieved this monumental creation -- a three-hour tale full of action, adventure, fear, love, fellowship, betrayal and poignancy. Is the movie long? Yes. Does it have TONS of special effects? Yes. Is it excessive? No. Here now, the good, the bad and the ugly of King Kong. <br /> <br />The Good: The acting. Jackson's decision to secure A-list quality actress Naomi Watts for the crucial role of Anne Darrow pays off HUGE. Watts' interaction with the immense gorilla is excellent -- indeed, I did not want to leave my seat when the two were on screen together because the development of their relationship and her reactions (from fear to gratitude to friendliness to love) is among the better acting work you will see. Remember -- Watts had to do all this in front of blue screens or Andy Serkis (6-foot tall, not 25+ feet tall) in a literal monkey suit.  And Jackson demanded more than just screaming on cue gawking in a particular direction (e.g., Jurassic Park).  Instead, he wanted her to fully interact on a variety of levels with an enormous, violent and inscrutable beast and she hit every note. <br /> <br />Additional kudos to Jack Black, who works the sleazy showman angle nicely without overplaying it; Adrien Brody as Watts' love interest who is smitten by the simple decency of Darrow and overcomes his initial haughtiness as a self-important playwright; Thomas Kretschmann, the German actor who plays the Captain of the tramp steamer Venture and does a fine job balancing his hard-bitten captain persona with a patina of heroic chivalry; and Evan Parke and Jamie Bell (the title character in \\"Billy Elliot\\") who put a new twist on the mentor and protege relationship in an homage to the 1930s-1950s templates (the twist = a black mentor for the white protege in 1930s America). <br /> <br />A special note for Andy Serkis, the career character actor who has donned the movement-capture suit to play both Gollum and Kong. Serkis did a fine job with the Kong movements, and had a memorable cameo in his own right as the irascible ship cook of the Venture. <br /> <br />More good: the effects, naturally. Jackson is simply better than any other director at making his effects seem real, although there were two uncharacteristic hiccups. The Depression-era NYC sets were fantastic; ditto the tribal village on the mysterious island. The screenplay, too, was solid. Credit the writers with NOT writing what need not be written.  Watts' Darrow barely speaks with Kong, yet they have tremendous communication. Jackson's direction hits its high points here, as does Watts' acting, while concurrently avoiding the usual trope of human speaking to beast, which becomes inane as the actor or actress just ends up talking to him/herself. <br /> <br />Best of all -- KONG. From happy to sad to defiant to angry, the computer effects captured everything and did an extraordinary job. You see his intelligence, his love for Darrow, his concern for her safety, his jealousy, and more. Best of all (although saddest of all), his confusion and despair when he tries to find her in NYC. Great stuff. <br /> <br />The Bad: a short list here. First, audio looping failed to catch about 3 or 4 times when Watts' natural Australian accent slipped out. Second, the Bell-Parke relationship may have been stretched. Third, Kong doesn't appear until 70 minutes into the movie -- some of the earlier chaff could stand a bit of pruning and a trimming of about five minutes here and there on the Isle of Kong wouldn't hurt. Fourth, and perhaps least important, two shots over the bow of the steamer when caught in a storm look fake. <br /> <br />The Ugly: Jackson does a great job of capturing the depravity of man, both during the immediate return to the US after Kong's capture when the great gorilla is made into a Broadway spectacle that a full house cannot pay enough to see, and after the great beast's fall. <br /> <br />Some notes: (1) King Kong, the origina 1930 version, is the movie that spurred Jackson's interest in movies; (2) catch the reference -- at one point showman Carl Denham is looking for a star for his movie because \\"Maureen\\" the lead actress had run out and he needs someone who can fit into her size 4 costumes. He runs through actresses with his assistant: Myrna Loy, Mae West and \\"What about Fay?\\" \\"No she's doing a picture for RKO with Cooper.\\" Fay = Fay Wray, Cooper = Merian Cooper and RKO is the studio that put out the original Kong. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the payoff is so huge that the buildup is worth it. Jackson's reputation is etched in granite at this point.
B00008DDSC|5.0|What an original movie that deals with sex, sadism, and masochism at its best! The quality of the film and its concept is excellent!  It's the story of a young woman named Lee Halloway and her boss Mr. E. Edward Grey who unexpectedly ,but purposely find themselves practicing these tabooed sexual rituals.  Lee Halloway is the sadist and her boss of course, enjoys inflicting pain, mentally, emotionally and physically.  They're romps together in the office are classic and extremely erotic.  Lee eventually finds love with her boss and he realizes that he's found exactly what he's looking for.  He's finally found someone to tame that sexual masochistic appetite that's been aching him.  The cinematography is beautiful at the end and Gyllenhaal's body is in perfect form.  I have no trouble seeing James Spader as America's most wanted man after this movie.  The soundtrack is great too; it should be Angelo Badalamenti had a lot to do with it.  This movie is original and fantastic, it will easily find its way into every lover's movie collection.  You'll also find yourself quoting the movie \\"One scoop of creamed potatoes. A slice of butter. Four peas. And as much ice cream as you'd like to eat,\\" like I do.
6304698682|2.0|As a big Clint Eastwood fan and a HUGE fan of High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales, I remember going to the theater in 1985 with high hopes for Pale Rider. And I was HORRIBLY disappointed. <br /> <br />More than anything else it seemed like a flimsy rip-off of High Plains Drifter. It was almost as if High Plains Drifter was such a good movie that they decided to make it again with different characters. You never really found out who the \\"preacher\\" was, or why he was there (aside from putting a bunch of bullet holes in the bad guys). The violence seemed random. I didn't even like the ridiculous hat he wore throughout the whole movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just adding my two cents to the numerous reviews in support of this fantastic movie.
B00005JLR8|4.0|\\"In America\\" surprised me.  I caught it on cable the other night, just looking for something to watch and not expecting much from it.  What I got instead, was a wonderful, mind-engaging, thought-provoking film, with great acting!! <br /> <br />The plot is pretty basic on the surface.  A family of 4 moves from Ireland to Manhattan and attempts to restart their lives after the death of their young son Frankie.  It turns out that it is much more difficult for all of them than they had thought, as they all struggle in their own way to move on.  The father is a struggling actor, who takes a job as a cab driver.  The mother works in al ice cream parlor and the two young girls are educated in a catholic school.  The audience is shown what daily life is like for this family and how they get through tough times.  They live in a junkie house, because that it all that they can afford.  While living there, they take up a friendship with Mateo, an artist, who is strickened with an un-named disease, which I believe to be AIDs.   <br /> <br />Truly a fascinating movie, not depressing, though my review may lead you to think otherwise.  Highly recommended, if not for the plot, then certainly for the superb acting displayed by no-name actors. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
6302752337|1.0|Well, it may have been representative of its day, but as of 12/27/05, it's grown pretty tedious.  It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the \\"message\\" out over way too long. The ending is truly shocking, and somewhat redeems the tedium of the earlier parts of the film that tend to drag, drag, drag.  Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it.
0553213105|3.0|this book is for three kinds of people:<br />1. people who think what so-called \\"classics\\" are all good. Of course, why would such book be called a classic if it isn't good?<br />2. People who are really really old and are adapted to the cultural and period ideas<br />3. people who like fairy-tale-like romantic stories<br /><br />That being said, I'm fair to not give this book a one-star. You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.<br /><br />The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits. Sounds selfish huh? Well.<br />All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.<br />They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned plays<br />I can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.<br />So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.<br /><br />Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.<br /><br />Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right. This is pretty much what I tell most people who are biased over \\"classics\\": classics may have that time-less fancy feeling with their wording, but story-wise, they are pretty silly and outdated.
B000001E18|5.0|Remember when in early 1994, Bono strolled onto the Grammy stage and spat out his infamous spill of how U2 was going to keep on f*****g up the mainstream? Well they pretty much nailed it with this album.  <br />The reason being is this: in 1993, grunge was at its height. Electronic and dance music had not been intigrated into the mainstream, even though it had a large following and was growing. <br />So enter U2, the arguably the world's biggest band and right right in the middle of possibly the biggest tour in world history. Instead of giving into what was hot in the moment, that being grunge, they went ahead and released this candy wrapper of a cd with a cosmonaut of a baby on the front. <br />I wish I could have seen the millions of faces that put this cd into their player and heard songs like \\"Numb\\", \\"DGTPFYCC\\" and \\"Lemon\\". <br />Honestly, I don't think the mainstream world was ready for what was hitting them at that moment. Not that U2 had invented this type of music and these sounds, but they what did was brought it into the living rooms of the mainstream listening world. <br />I honestly believe that this opened up the whole market for dance and electronic music. Yes, it might be a stretch to say that, but bands like NIN that had a massive underground before this in 1994 saw their success explode with \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  From the mid 90's on, there was a massive opening for this type of music also. Combine this with \\"Passangers\\", I think U2 opened alot of doors for many bands like Radiohead.  <br />While this album does have some weak points, one has to take into account that it was written and recorded during the middle of the tour!  <br />
0517123207|5.0|More important than the Bible and better research behind it! Just the facts please.
B0009S4IHY|3.0|If originality means 'unlike anything you've seen', Kung Fu Hustle certainly rates on top of the category. Unlike the hero-centered Hollywood tradition, the plot is evenly distributed among smaller-than-life characters that are least expected to be kung fu masters: a tailor, a pajama-clad landlady, a street bum, other menials in a Chinese ghetto, all of whom seem to remain thouroughly anonymous. Ordinary objects used as powerful kung fu weapons include laundry hooks, cigarette butts, a Chinese lap guitar (from which swords come flying out when strummed.) Yet, the movie also looks uncomfortably familiar. Steven Chow, the street bum, after beaten senseless suddenly resurrects and, unbeknownst to anyone, inexplicably becomes The One to face the Kung Fu Armageddon. The derivation (The Matrix) is so unscrupulous as to render all interpretation impossible: in-your-face plagiarism, mockery, self-mockery? Kung Fu Hustle offers a very different sense of humor, a very different kind of drama that requires us to suspend all usual sense of reality and plot development.
B000069AUI|2.0|This CD is boring. Not bad, just boring. It has all the musical adventurism of a beer commercial. A well-produced beer commercial, granted, But still, a CD that sounds like an hour of test-tunes for Budweiser's next Superbowl spot hardly merits the raves that have been showered on its head.    I wanted to give \\"Rush of Blood\\" a chance, even though I'd found \\"Parachutes\\" uninspiring. So I brought it home, put it into shuffle-rotation with Radiohead and the Libertines, and let it spin.    Folks, I cringed whenever Coldplay came up. I was reminded of nothing so much as the bloated pop epitomized by U2 and Sting.     Download a song or two if you need a fix. But save your real money for music that you'll care about in two years. Beer commercials don't age well.
B00005JOT1|3.0|A great cast.  A decent story.  Fantastic locations.  Great costumes.  Excellent, excellent dialogue.  But I didn't really enjoy this movie because the performances lacked a bit of snap and crackle.  I think it needed some kung-fu. <br /> <br />Without spoiling the story for anyone, the premise of the movie is as follows:  Mrs Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a (slightly) older New York socialite with a reputation for \\"preying\\" on wealthy married men.  Forced to flee New York she sets of for the Amalfi coast with her sights set on the newly married Meg (Scarlett Johansson) and Robert (Mark Umbers).  She quickly strikes up a relationship with Robert which sets tongues wagging and he is suspected of providing her with an allowance and beginning an affair.   <br /> <br />Meanwhile: Meg attracts the attention of a playboy Lord who sees an opportunity to make his move, Mrs Erlynne attracts the attention of old Lord Tuppy and the gossip starts to take its toll on any number of relationships. <br /> <br />Things come to a head at Meg's 21st birthday party when the motivations of the various players are revealed and some unexpected truths emerge.   <br /> <br />What lets this film down is the fact that not one character has any charisma and as a result there is none of the requisite spark between the characters that a story like this needs.  Meg and Robert seem dull.  I suspect that Scarlett Johansson was cast more for her visual qualities than any else; Mrs Erlynne is just not sexy enough or alluring enough to seem believable in the role of a vamp; the playboy Lord fails to make any real impact - and the whole thing is just a little bit too PG rated.  Or a little bit too proper perhaps.  As I say, what it needs is more kung-fu (if you know what I mean).   <br /> <br />The one decent performance is from Lord Tuppy who also seems to get all the best lines while he is trying to woo Mrs Erlynne. <br /> <br />Lacking enough substance to be good enough to recommend. <br />
B000BVEKO0|1.0|Okay first I'd like to point out that I have made this account for the purpose of expressing my oppinion on not only SYOTOS but Korn from the beginning <br /> <br />Korn... what can I say. Possibly (most likely) one of the greatest bands of all time.  Be it their musical talent, the emotion put into each song, or the great payoffs each song gives their fans.  At least, thats what I thought until Issues came out and ruined everything for Korn. <br /> <br />I'm sorry but it's true. Issues had 1 good song (Falling Away From Me) and it's not even that great.  Self-titled, Life is Peachy, and Follow the Leader are albums i have been listening to for the longest time.  I love each and every song on every one of those albums. <br /> <br />Now that this CD has come out I can't say i have any hope of the Korn that we, the true fans, love returning.  I know this maybe somewhat \\"stereotypical\\" but please just think about it.  They were the first industiral band... you can call it whatever but thats what they were, but now... just to return to TRL they are making music videos with lil' jon and sh*t and its completely bogus. Im sorry that maybe retarded to say but thats what they make it seem like. <br /> <br />Head leaving the band was very sad for two reasons... one he was a great musician, coming from a musician, trust me- he knows his sh*t. And two, him leaving seems to have taken a huge chunk out of the musicality of Korn as a band. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, those who say that Korn havn't changed havn't listened to Korn and those who say Korn has changed for the better don't know music.  To not like this CD does not make me not a fan... if that makes any sense. It makes me a fan of music.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a great movie!  Buy it!  I never watched the series until I purchased the boxed set after the series was cancelled.  I was interested, but local channels made it hard to locate.  The series was great, the movie is great.  We need more stories about this crew's adventures.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Don't listen to people who say this album is crap, or any Radiohead album for that matter. This album is simply different. <br />It follows along the lines of Kid A but has a much more upbeat overall sound to it. Upbeat for Radiohead isn't that upbeat at all, but it's still a much more upbeat album than Kid A. <br /> <br />If you're expecting another Ok Computer, than forget it. That was one album, and no album of theirs has sounded that way since. <br /> <br />Pick up this album after Kid A. It's a great follow up
B000BTJDG2|2.0|I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, as I am a big fan of the horror and suspence genre.  But after seeing this movie I have to say it was a HUGE dissapointment.  I was expecting alot more invovlved and the whole movie centered around the court case and nothing to do with an actual exorcism.  If they cut out the whole court case thing then I think I would have enjoyed it more.  Unlike everyone else I say it's not worth buying.
037571457X|4.0|This is a story about all the region surrounding Iran... Although I haven't lived the days when people were libral, but I did live the days afterwards, and we did suffer a lot because of living a different life inside our home, than the life we lived outside. <br /> <br />Marjane was very particular in telling the story of revolution from a child's point of view, as if it was written right at that time.
B000000JO3|5.0|I'm not going to bother defending this album against any possible criticism for one reason: in 1980 there was no such thing as hardcore straight edge until Minor Threat.  These guys had everything: simplicity, positive attitude, and ferocity.  Being a 12 year old with a shaved head and steel toes, ferocious music not only sounded great but helped in the process of survival.  Many didn't understand what straight edge was...you were easily mistaken for a skinhead or mearly another derelict punk.  But what the hell, after all the blood and tears, it was fun anyway.  Thank you Minor Threat!
0671015206|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door reports on the authors' studies of Americans with a net worth of $1 million or more, primarily collected through surveys over the past couple of decades. This isn't really a self-help book, but more of a summary of the distinguishing features of \\"prodigious accumulators of wealth\\" (PAWs, those in the top quartile of net worth for their income and age category) and \\"underaccumulators of wealth\\" (UAWs, those in the bottom quartile of net worth for their income and age category).<br /><br />The main lesson of the book is the extent to which annual income is separable from net worth--those in the PAW category may have incomes as low as $50,000/year, but they live below their means, typically investing 15% or more of their annual income and being extremely frugal in their spending. Those in the UAW category, by contrast, may earn extremely large salaries, but tend to spend all of it (and then some), with the result of having low net worth relative to income.<br /><br />The main beneficiaries of this book are people who are of average or above average income yet are unaware of the basics of accumulating wealth, those who have developed bad habits, and those who want to encourage their children to become financially independent.<br /><br />The book is somewhat repetitive, its advice won't help turn those of very low incomes into millionaires, and it doesn't directly address the question of whether PAWs are happier than UAWs (though it does argue that PAWs tend to have fewer fears and concerns than UAWs). It is an entertaining read, and contrary to some other reviewers, I enjoyed reading the case studies.
B00005JOI3|5.0|This movie blew me away. As an artist, I was captivated by the brilliant camera work, and as someone who has spent time studying narrative structure in film, I thought the plot was engaging and fulfilling, though difficult to follow (perhaps another reason I liked it so much). This certainly isn't a movie for people who don't like having to think too hard about the movies they watch, but if you're up to an exciting intellectual challenge this movie will deliver. I would urge you to consider the possibility that those who didn't find this to be a genuinely splendid and brave film, or were turned off by the 'lack of plot' may not have actually understood what they were watching. This is one of the best films I've seen in theaters in years.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|We just gave this as a Hanukkah gift for our two teen sons. We couldn't have picked better! Must say its a joy to see the guys roaring in laughter. lf you are a friends fan - it's a must. The case is very handy and posh. Careful...You will find yourself joining them in hours of laughter.

B00003CWPL|5.0|There's nothing to say about this film that hasn't already been said. It doesn't surprise me that there are some reviewers who've given it one star, any more than it surprises me that irons come with instructions reading \\"do not iron clothes on body.\\"  <br /> <br />To say that this film isn't for everyone is an understatement. But anyone who loves the art of filmmaking should have a proper viewing of this great surreal work. Turn off the lights, leave your expectations at the door, and let it wash over you. This film has its own inner logic that defies attempts at conventional explanations. It's like a dream, and it captures the feeling of a dream as effectively as any film yet made.  <br /> <br />If you're the type of person whose movies must have a conventional plot, a good guy and a bad guy, and who'd complain about a movie having \\"hardly any dialogue,\\" then stick with something from Blockbuster's \\"new release\\" wall. But if you want to experience a true work of art, the result of a gifted painter successfully translating his impressionistic visions to the screen, then go ahead and enjoy Lynch's masterpiece.

This thing is short, less than 50,000 words? But, what an impact, unforgettable. This is more than a book, it's more like a tutorial and apocalyptic post-millennium amorality tale. Brutal. Vivid. Extraordinary. Now I have to get my one-click finger working and get more of this man's work. He's the real deal.<br /><br />Ken Coffman is the author of Steel Waters and five other novels.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones did it first. The Ramones did it right. Classic stuff.<br />The Ramones are one of those bands that lasted a long time, due to the fact that they never changed face. Sure the lineups altered a little over the years, but the formula was always basically the same, and no matter what RAMONES record you listen to, it's gonna ROCK!<br />The first though, is still the best. Every song is a classic, and not to mention this was what changed everything and basically kicked off the Punk craze in the seventies.<br />No breaks anywhere on here, one two minute song to the next and we just get faster! BLITZ,BEAT,JUDY.....<br />This band defined an era. They were underground, yet universally well knowns. They were an institution, and yet never were that well off. These guys toured for years and years, not because they liked it (in fact, they all HATED each other) but simply because they HAD to. They played to survive, and OH the legacy they left behind. OH YEAH!
0553801503|5.0|I can't believe I waited years for this book, then didn't open it right away because of the negative reviews. This is a most excellent book. Sure, I wonder what Tyrion and and Jon are up to, but we'll find out soon enough, next year hopefully. In 2020 when the last book is published, we'll be able to objectively look back and judge whether George delivered on the promise of the incredible story arc we all imagine. Honestly, George is doing an excellent job with this series, we should thank the seven gods that he continues to amaze and entertain us. To the complaining knuckleheads out there, save up a few coppers and buy a clue, will ya?<br /><br />Ken Coffman is the author of Steel Waters and five other novels.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Just as a Doris Day romantic comedy doesn't apply just to blonde women, Brokeback Mountain doesn't apply to just gay men. In fact, the characters aren't particularly gay, certainly not in the sociological sense. What they are, is lonely, isolated--not just on the mountain, but in their inability to express their emotions--and when they find each other, it's like the fracturing of a dam.<br /><br />Yet, the walls of the dam remain. The time on Brokeback is temporary; unreal; in the real world, the men remain stifled. The Ledger character, in particular, is held back by his childhood traumas from allowing himself intimacy. So his marriage fails; his girlfriends leave; all he has to look forward to is the occasional return to the idyll of Brokeback Mountain with his friend. Both men need more from each other, but Ledger's character is unable, so fearful of intimacy that he uses the excuse of prejudice to deny himself the one relationship that means everything to him.<br /><br />A warning message and a wakeup call for all of us.
B000002IQW|5.0|Skid Row's self-titled ablum, 'Skid Row', placed them in our conscience, but 'Slave to the Grind' assured them a place in our hearts for ever!  This one, in my mind, is one of the best Metal albums released after Grunge was starting to litter the air!  Hard-Ass Metal laced with the kick-butt vocals of Sebastian Bach = One rockin' album with the balls to hang with the best of '80's-'90's Metal!  Purchase Now!!!
0553801503|2.0|After criticizing the latest Tad Williams novel, \\"Shadowmarch\\", as being a pale George R. R. Martin imitation, I am now forced to classify \\"A Feast For Crows\\" as...a pale George R. R. Martin imitation. <br /> <br />That same lethargic pacing, that same ambivalent suspense level, that same eye-tiring, can-I-put-this-down-now, how-many-pages-do-I-have-left feeling while reading it. <br /> <br />Recipe for this book: take the last few books of \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire\\", remove the most interesting characters, and in their place add reams of geneology (of minor persons), pages and pages of useless exposition, and endless paragraphs advancing obscure sub-plots. <br /> <br />Hopefully, fan reaction (and the lagging sales figures) will convince Martin to fix the problems. If not, let's hope his editor does, or this once-great series will fail to live up to the promise of its outstanding first three volumes.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a way of taking you back to a different time and yet warming your heart to this day. Anyone who likes the classics can't possibly pass this one up and it is worth watching all year round.
B0000004V2|5.0|Simply the best album ever to be recorded. <br /> <br />Please don't buy this version, though. This is the US version, which is different from the original release - the UK version has neither Fools Gold nor Elephant Stone. Buy the import version, as it flows much better than this version.
0790729407|5.0|To the person from the states who has reviewed this film stating Ireland was not a colony, Collins was a terrorist etc.  Your claims about the German cash etc relate only to the opening few minutes of the film.  Most of what is viewed comes after the end of WW1.  To call Collins a terrorist would be like calling Mandella, or even George Washington terrorists.  All rebelled against the government in power.  I think that the Irish soldiers who fought in WW1 (my great grandfather was one) for the British did so as much out of hunger as for any other reason. <br /> <br />The film itself is great.  Yes there are some inaccuracies (the character of Broy was based on 3 informants of whom Broy was one) but it is watchable and generally gives a good impression of Britsh rule and the uprising.
B00000745F|5.0|I have to say that this is my most treasured possession in the world. A real treasure of an album.    The UK version (which is the version that gets all the plaudits in the polls) includes neither Fools Gold nor Elephant Stone. The UK release is the original version - please buy that 11-track version, as this is how it was meant to be heard and flows much better.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is not a traditional blues album.  The purists who would argue that this is no Stevie Ray Vaughan would be correct; while SRV is one of Mayer's idols, he doesn't try to replicate his style of music.  I had the pleasure of seeing John play at the House of Blues on Sunset Strip, Los Angeles, and I was overwhelmed by how incredible the show was. His cover of Hendrix seemed to match well with his new material and I looked forward expectantly to the release of his new CD.<br /><br />I bought the album on the iTunes music store because it came with an included \\"making of\\" video, and it is this video that best describes Mayer's attitude.  He conducts a brief interview where he talks about how he fell in love with blues at an early age and wanted to incorporate it into his own music.  But his most important statement was this: \\"As a pop musician, I want to be the prism, for taking what I know is a very powerful style of music and somehow crystallizing it into something that is 2005 and is identifiable as being now.\\"  He then goes on to say how his heroes are those whom you cannot picture without the instrument in their hands, men like Vaughan and Hendrix; men who used their success to evolve and alter their music into the present.<br /><br />Having read this, I hope you have a clearer picture of what Mayer is all about. He is not the traditional blues musician we know he could be, but neither is he the glitzy pop star of the past 5 years.  He is an extremely talented musician using his success to bring the powerful style of blues to the attention of the public. In fact, we could guess that Mayer is hoping to be a miniature Hendrix to the world of 2005, but instead of mixing psychedelic with blues he used pop.<br /><br />I personally look forward to what Mayer has to offer in the years to come and will continue to support his efforts. Use this CD as a launching pad into the depths that blues has to offer, but do me one favor: don't tell anyone your favorite blues song is \\"I've Got a Woman\\".anyone your favorite blues song is \\"I've Got a Woman\\".
B000002KKK|5.0|This album may not be remastered yet on this edition but it's the only 70's record that wasn't 'futurized' when they made the transfer to CD for the first time.<br /><br />Soon there will be remasters of this disc and every other one from the 70's and most likely the 80's too up through 1990.  But this disc is the original mix.  It's the real thing!  You'll notice it never was included on the ZZ Top Six Pack.  They skipped this album but included 1981's El Loco instead.  Don't ask me why.  Or else it would have reverb added and had the drums redone and mixed differently to sound more like their 80's output. (Eliminator, etc.)<br /><br />So everyone out there listening to non-remastered versions of ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grand Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango, Tejas and El Loco OR The ZZ Top Six Pack, OR Greatest Hits or One Foot In The Blues are hearing futurized versions of the original vinyl.  Sad but true.  But this album has been pure all along on cd and will only get better on the remaster.  It'll be nice if we see it soon. :)<br />Long live The Top!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|It takes about two weeks to hear this album for what it is. NEVER REVIEW AN ALBUM AFTER ONLY ONE OR TWO LISTENS!  All I can say is this is some of the greatest MUSIC ever made. By the time Toxicity came out I said to myself they are awesome. But if you look at all the Legends of Rock (Beatles, Rolling Stones Doors, Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Eagles etc.) One great album ain't gonna cut it. Now SOAD has 3 full STUDIO albums (system of a down, Toxicity, Mesmerize/Hypnotize) and a nice collection of unreleased(steal this album) It took The Stones countless albums and 4 decades to make 40 hit songs. SOAD has 4 albums in 6 years with a total of 66 songs. that's not counting soundtracks(shame on a nigga, the metro, etc.) and in my opinion they have 40 songs that i love to listen to even more than the Rolling Stones \\"40 Licks\\" greatest hits album. I mean it's just great music guys.anyway... <br /> <br />Hypnotize and mesmerize are very close, i mean they made all the songs at the sametime...just released it in two parts. ya the songs sound different. that's what songs are suppose to do...sound different. this album is a 10 so let's just give all the songs an averagerating of 10... here is a feqw words that pop into my head, but you draw your own conclusions... just make sure to listen to album several times. it takes a while to forget what you thought you knew about music and then to realize that theseboys created a masterpiece like none before with this two-headed monster. <br /> <br />attack - heavily brilliant <br /> <br />dreaming - beautiful and genious <br /> <br />kill rock 'n roll - ridiculously great <br /> <br />hypnotize - meaningful and wonderful <br /> <br />stealing society - jesus h. christ, this song is layered with greatness <br /> <br />tentative - aggresively consuming <br /> <br />U-Fig - schizhophreniclly tremendous <br /> <br />Holy Mountains - rightously powerful <br /> <br />vicinity of obscenity - playfully harmonic and weirdly excellent <br /> <br />she's like herion - eerie and stange but very enjoyable <br /> <br />lonely day - superbly hypnotic and a f#cking great soft song <br /> <br />soldier side - thought provoking and epic... end it like it began... come full circle... mesmerize/hypnotize walks a fine line between classic and the best ever. what the hell is next? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MVT|1.0|First let me say that I'm a very big fan of ZZ Top. I've seen them live several times and they always put on a great show. Recently, I became aware of the fact that all the 70's records except for 1979's Deguello, as well as 1981's El Loco (same albums on the six pack) were remixed with lots of reverb added and new drum tracks as well. I'm told they thought people wouldn't re-buy these albums on cd's because they already had bought the vinyl. So, they decided to remix them a bit and make them more like their blockbusting MTV style 80's work.<br /><br />Now, I love 80's Top as much as the next guy or gal but I expect it to be in the decade where it belongs. There's something special about ZZ Top's 70's output, like an old comfortable shoe that just fits (sounds) perfect every time you hear it. Ladies and Gentlemen, as of the date of this post, if you have any of these albums (ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango, Tejas, or El Loco) on CD then you have remixed versions! People have been listening to these new improved versions for 15 or 20 years if they bought these albums on cd. Unless you had the vinyl, cassette or were listening to Best of ZZ Top/Deguello, you've been listening to these remixed versions.  Even the radio stations have been playing these remixed versions for years.  The other culprit is ZZ Top's Greatest Hits and ZZ Top's Six Pack.  These are all remixed on the earlier material.<br /><br />I'd recommend Rancho Texicano, Chrome, Smoke & BBQ or the remastered editions of Tres Hombres and Fandago if you want to hear the best ZZ Top you've ever heard.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I, too, was caught up in the hype: I had to see Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\"!Well, now that I've seen it, my opinion of the film can be summed up in one word: \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />It is truly a fitting homage to the 1933 classic, complete with situations and dialogue lifted straight from the first film. Even a brief musical tribute is paid to original composer Max Steiner's groundbreaking score, heard during the \\"opening night\\" appearance of the captured Kong. Obviously, Peter Jackson admires the black and white picture immensely.<br /><br />This may explain his reason for remaking the film but it can't salvage it from scrutiny. There are many points of contention that I have with this movie.<br /><br />Naomi Watts, even while wearing stilettos, gives the best performance. Considering that many of her scenes were played against a \\"green screen\\" with an invisible co-star, she acquaints herself fine in demonstrating a variety of emotions. I think Adrian Brody was just hired to provide some additional Oscar-winning clout to the picture for his part was nothing spectacular to begin with and he did his best with it.<br /><br />As for Jack Black, I didn't think much of him before the picture and the movie didn't alter my perception.<br /><br />The movie is just too long, much like Jackson's LOTR trilogy, filled with extended battle scenes, sweeping landscape images, and implausible escapes.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />C'mon! The stampeding brontosaurs should've taken out the entire search party.<br /><br />Watts is buffeted around during an elongated fight scene and doesn't get a scratch or a dirt mark of any kind???<br /><br />Black and Brody, along with another actor, are able to single-handedly hold off hundreds of insect beasties, while others in the cast easily become fodder for the monsters???<br /><br />During Kong's rampage through New York, people are just standing idly by, not trying to get out of the way of a 25-foot ape???<br /><br />I think not!<br /><br />One of the film's best sequences involves the initial discovery of Skull Island, a tense-filled one wherein Jack Black's ship is almost torn apart by rocks jutting out of the island seaside. This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />It's too bad that the majority of the film does not come up to the bar. The other action sequences were no more thrilling than a Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon.<br /><br />As I left the theater, I couldn't help but think of Gus Van Zant's shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" some years back.<br /><br />The same feeling of deja vu hit me and I'm still pondering, \\"What was the point of Peter Jackson's remake?\\"<br /><br />If you're just going to build a BIGGER mousetrap but not a BETTER one...ne wherein Jack Black's ship is almost torn apart by rocks jutting out of the island seaside.

B000001DYY|5.0|i'm not sure i could truly convey my emotional attachment to this record. it is one of their lesser known albums, but in my opinion it is their best. while \\"big chair\\" was full of quality hit singles, elemental is a flowing, layered, lush album from start to finish. it covers the spectrum of emotions, it's easily their most versatile album to date. i am completely biased towards this record because this was the band and album that made me obsessed with music for life. highlights: \\"elemental\\", \\"mr. pessimist\\",\\"fish out of water\\" and \\"brian wilson said\\".
B000002IZ4|5.0|Many bands who have a great debut are faced with the dilemma of making another album that will, by all costs, try to avoid the sophomore jinx. Some bands outdo themselves and make a great second album, but some end up falling flat and never surface again. In the case of Stone Temple Pilots second album (call it PURPLE or self-titled if you will), they avoid the sophomore jinx and make a terrific album full of sludgy, crunchy hard rock with some real surprises thrown in for good measure. Guitarist Dean DeLeo continues to throw out memorable riffs, and his brother bassist Dean DeLeo and drummer Eric Kretz continue to provide a great rhythm section for Scott Weiland's impressive vocal turn. He's lost some grit, but his voice is better on this album (he was still good on CORE) and he outdoes himself.    \\"Big Empty\\" is easily one of the best hard-rock singles ever released to radio, and the term \\"power\\" ballad might apply even though its dreamy hard rock makes it even more powerful (no wonder it was featured on THE CROW soundtrack). \\"Interstate Love Song\\" was one of the best songs released in 1994, and it demonstrates Stone Temple Pilots ability to craft a great song. And while the band still shows it's tough side on tracks like the thundering \\"Silvergun Superman\\", the percussion thunder of \\"Lounge Fly\\" and the thrashing \\"Unglued\\", they also show a melodic flair on the pretty acoustic \\"Pretty Penny\\" and the contemplative \\"Kitchenware & Candybars\\". Throughout this second album, Stone Temple Pilots have really crafted a very strong, memorable, and cohesive set that improves on the highly successful debut, which showcased a more raw, raucous sound. Other memorable cuts include the head-banger pleasers \\"Meatplow\\" and \\"Army Ants\\", and the very catchy \\"Vasoline\\". Not one bad song in this bunch, unless you want to count that incredibly cheesy \\"hidden track\\" which thankfully is left last so you can skip it.    So thankfully, Stone Temple Pilots avoided the sophomore jinx and PURPLE (or the self-titled album) was another huge success. Thanks to instantly memorable songs and strong attitude, this album is hands down one of the best alternative hard rock collections ever released. Strong from start to finish, you'll find tons of reasons to enjoy this second helping.
B000001ES9|2.0|I bought this on vinyl when it first came out.  At that time Rush sounded like a cross between Led Zeppelin and Bad Co.  Well, it was the 70's so what can you expect??? I find this CD and it's songs very unoriginal.  I don't really like any of the tracks except Working Man...Well, they had to start somewhere!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I recently picked up Nimrod and it is possibly the best album in my collection.  I have been reading reviews for this album and I read that some of Green Day's lyrics are anti-Bush and if so, right on!  GO TO HELL GEORGE W. BUSH!  AND EAT S*** ON THE WAY DOWN!  Anyways, I love several songs on this album.  There is definetely a difference between this and Green Day's older albums, but deep down, any fan can honestly tell you that it is still Green Day.  A perfect 5 in my book.  By far worth owning.<br /><br />P.S. If you haven't already, be sure to check out Nimrod!
B000000LZV|5.0|This is a great road trip cd to listen too while driving the long highway. Some songs will have you forgetting all the pressure of traffic while others will have the pedal matted to the floor. It flows like the scenery around you, different at every turn, and it's just long enough not to get played out. I hadn't listened to it in a while, but grabbed it for the ride & was glad I did! <br /> <br />Give it a try next time you've got a long drive ahead.
B000BNTM96|5.0|Ok ill start by saying i dont really like live cds that much but the cd on here is incredible! Not to mention the live dvd but ill get to that. QOTSA have always been on the list of my favorite bands since i first got R, right before Songs for the Deaf came out. This cd though shoots them up to my second favorite band ever. Which is hard for a band to bump off the Doors since ive liked the doors since i was a little kid when my dad played there music. This music though is incredible its a whole new beast of there music. Its like listening to these o so familiar songs for the first time. Its not raw its not like Nirvanas live music, The cd flows just like a proper studio cd and you only hear the crowd at the end of the songs since queens completly drowns out the whole audience. Every song is diffrent than how youve ever heard it before. They are true stoner james that jam out forever but they throw in everything to keep it intresting. Monster in the Parasol is totally diffrent, i didnt even reconize what it was untill it got to the chorus. Its just an awesome cd that might even be a good way to get people into Queens who have never even bothered to listen to them before. You throw this on and i garentee people will have there mouth hanging open in amazement. <br /> <br />The dvd is even better. It starts off with Josh in an alley strumming this lulliby and singing it and its so awesome! The movie really is like Led Zepplins but so much better since it dosnt have stupid pointless sh*t all throughout it starts out sorta normal but by the end of the dvd its on a full fleged trip mode throwing it all kinds of swirlly patterns and triangle sh*t and it really i think is meant for when your tripping you put it on in the beggining of the trip and by the end your brain will be oozing out of your ears. <br /> <br />Ok well i completly reccomend this its just awesome you really have to hear it beleive it. <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|Yes, Finally! The whole soundtrack for The Fellowship of the Ring! I have been waiting for this for four years. Now the listening experience is complete, with the complete recordings. Howard Shore's score for this film was simply amazing. Without the music the movie would not have any life to it. The music itself tells the story right along with the visuals. However, you can separate the music from the visual and still understand what is going on. These \\"complete recordings\\" have every note heard in the Extended Edition of the first film of the trilogy. And it is amazing to hear what we all missed on the original release. Hearing all this new music, alone by itself, has confirmed my belief that Shore's score for these films are the best scores since the original Star Wars films! If you are a film music fan, or a Lord of the Rings fan then I REALLY recommend these \\"complete recordings.\\"
B0002KVUKM|5.0|It seems a lot of people take this movie a little too seriously. It is a parody/spoof of all the Dracula/Frankenstein/Vampire movies. As such it was great entertainment with lots of action, outstanding music and good special effects. If you are looking for a serious movie about vampires, this is definitely not it. But if you like action, great music and understand what tongue-in-cheek means then you'll probably really like this movie.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I am so impressed with this young band. I too can't stop listening. They're great.
B00005J6UP|2.0|My husband and I watched the Goonies for the first time with our eight year old son the other night.  I would in no way call this a family film.  I know children will hear foul language from time to time but this show seemed to open with pointlessly foul and ugly humor; the kind I don't enjoy hearing from a child.  The references to sex toys and drugs serve no real family entertainment purposes.  While I found the adventure to be appealing, I could have done without the low class, tasteless humor of the spanish interpreter.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|Another loving restoration and one I'd been waiting for so I'm happy to get it.  Listening to it again after many years I'm equally struck by Lennon's candor and his loss of vocal authority.  Up through 1970 Lennon had been a powerful singer but he isn't here.   <br /> <br />Clearly the separation from Yoko Ono had hurt him badly but it didn't result in the kind of catharsis one heard in his songs from 1968-70.  Instead there were all manner of lyrical cliches and numerous melodies just short of really memorable.  The singles were easily the best cuts.  One song, \\"Beef Jerky\\", didn't even get a lyric.  Another, \\"Steel and Glass\\", borrowed quite a lot from the earlier \\"How Do You Sleep\\".  To sum up, this is the record of a big talent at the end of the road.  And of course Lennon hung it up for years after \\"Walls and Bridges\\".
B000BW7QX6|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" is outstanding! One of the best science fiction in recent history! Joss Whedon's directing and screenplay is excellent! The cast led by Nathan Fillion is excellent! The music by David Newman is excellent! The cinematography by Jack N. Green (who also has done the cinematography to many of Clint Eastwood's films) is excellent! The film editing by Lisa Lassek (who also was one of the editors of the tv show \\"Firefly\\", which the movie is based on) is excellent. The casting by Anya Colloff & Amy McIntyre Britt (who also did the casting to \\"Firefly\\") is excellent. The production design by Barry Chusid (who also did the production design to \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" (2004) & \\"Daredevil\\" (2003) is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to \\"The Village\\" (2004) & the upcoming \\"Lady In The Water\\" (2006) is excellent! The costume design by Ruth E. Carter (who also did the costume design to \\"Four Brothers\\" (2005) is excellent! This is a different science-fiction film is smart, brilliant, and absolutely different than any science-fiction film that has been done in recent history! This is well-made and well-budgeted too, at a very decent and small budget of $40 million!
0307276902|2.0|I've decided to give this book the benefit of the doubt and look at it more as an allegory of sorts.  I don't believe half of what happened in this book is true, for all the reasons listed in other reviews on here, but it's not a bad book if you don't take it too literally.  One thing about it that really bothered me, however, is James's incredibly stubborn aversion to the concept of a higher power.  I was especially struck when I read these words, which he uses to describe his feelings towards the Tao Te Ching:  \\"This little book feeds me.  It feeds me food I didn't know existed...  food that will nourish me and keep me full and alive...\\"  I hate to break it to James, but this sounds exactly like the way many people feel about their \\"Higher Powers,\\" and I must point out, every concept in the Tao that James touched on can also be gleaned from the Bible if it is read properly.  I got the sense that James thought he was too tough, too macho for something as weak as believing in a Higher Power, even as he either consciously or subconsciously applied the concept to the Tao. <br /> <br />

B0009W5JR8|1.0|This was an extremely disappointing sequel to the first XXX. The left leaning undertone to the whole movie that war is bad, US government is corrupt and the people have to stand up and fight the \\"MAN\\" and take back the \\"Power\\" is over the top.  It's like this was made to sell a political agenda and not a movie. So that's what you get. A terrible movie with known actors and celebrities. (Willem Dafoe, Peter Strauss, Ice Cube, Samuel L. Jackson)<br /><br />I could continue with reasons not to waste your time but I think you get the idea how bad this one is already.
B00004TDTO|5.0|\\"Gore\\" is the least interesting thing about this film. It's the humorous and believable characters that compel the story.<br /><br />The sheriff fearful of the water! The preppy marine authority! The old salt fisherman traumatized by his past... another \\"Ahab.\\"<br /><br />The dog and cat chase between these three characters and the monster shark will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The John Williams score is brilliant... who among us hasn't mimiced the \\"shark approach\\" tune on occasion?<br /><br />This film is timeless.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B0001DI0FI|5.0|It seems like it's not often, these days, that a \\"war movie\\" can be made without its characters devolving into introspective weepiness, riddled with self-doubt and prone to questioning the point of the conflict. Either that, or the protagonist is an abominable sort of character.    Master And Commander - The Far Side Of The World has no such problems.    Being something of an enthusiast for the whole \\"Age of Sail\\" genre - I grew up reading my Dad's Hornblower books - I made a point of seeing M&C in the theaters when it came out in late 2003. I was prepared to be disappointed, but I need not have worried. I was hugely impressed, and as soon as the DVD was available, I snapped up a copy. It may be that a better film about war at sea has been made, but if so, I've not seen it - and I've seen most of them.    Based on the Aubrey/Maturin novels by Patrick O'Brian, and taking its name from the first and tenth books in the series, the movie is a blend of elements of the entire series, rather than just one of the novels put to film. Those familiar with the novels will recognize the general plot outline as being from \\"The Far Side of the World,\\" with incidents and dialogue (including a fair amount of humor) taken in pieces from the full range of books and blended into a seamless whole.    Some further observations:    * The movie is rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, related images, and brief language. The language is in fact very brief. There are plenty of \\"damns\\" to go around, but only one very quick interjection of anything harsher; the use is apt, given the context. If someone had stolen two years of my work and burnt my ship, I'd swear, too.    * Master and Commander won two Oscars and was nominated for eight others. [Every one of those eight was won by Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.] The award for cinematography was well-deserved - this film is simply beautiful to behold.    * This is a man's film, about manliness and duty among men at war. There areno women in the featured cast. A few women appear on screen for a few seconds early on, but they are quickly passed and the film continues.    * The role of Dr. Maturin in the film is primarily that of Aubrey's conscience; unexplained in the film is that Maturin is more than Aubrey's best friend, a physician, and a naturalist - he is also an intelligence agent. The character, being a naval neophyte, also occasionally serves a useful purpose when nautical matters need to be explained for the benefit of the viewer, who might not be likely to know what the \\"weather gage\\" (for example) might be.    * There is a lot of violence, of course - it's war on the high seas. Blood, a bit. Lots more gritting-of-teeth than actual gore. Mostly, it's violent action without a lot of organs and limbs flying about.    * One thing I found particularly impressive was the portrayal of the midshipmen. The film does a astoundingly good job of presenting teenage boys as something other than trash-mouth self-centered whining snivelling little brats. This film should be mandatory viewing for all teenage boys.    * Max Pirkis, as the 12 or 13 year old Midshipman Lord Blakeney, is especially noteworthy. Despite suffering a grievous injury early in the film, his character soldiers on, and in the climactic battle is simply remarkable, demonstrating leadership, initiative and resolve far above the capacity of most people many years older. That Pirkis won two acting awards for his performance is entirely appropriate. That neither of those awards was an Oscar is a shame.    * The musical score is perfect. 'Nuff said.    Master and Commander is destined in years to come to be looked back at as a classic. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you don't own it, buy it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|<br /> <br />GERARD BUTLER'S PORTRAYEL OF THE PHANTOM IS NOTHING LESS THAN \\"MESMERIZING\\"..............BRAVO!!!!!!!!
B000060OFT|4.0|If you've scrolled through the reviews, you see that many are divided between thinking it is absolute garbage and thinking it is a masterpiece. The movie requires an open-minded person in order to appreciate it. Otherwise it will make no sense and seem like such rubish as to be worth dirt. <br /> <br />At first the contradicting dialogue really threw me off. When they called for everyone to \\"draw your swords\\" and instead pulled out guns, it bothered me. People wearing hawaiian shirts and shouting Shakespeare in a gas station look strange; they really do. But after the initial shock, I began to simply accept things and relate to them.  <br /> <br />Romeo and Juliet came to life for me, and I understood that Shakespeare's plays are meant to be seen, not read. <br /> <br />The entire modern setting is like a metaphor. You won't understand unless you alter your way of thinking. You CAN'T go in with any EXPECTATIONS. I think that's what gets people, is the expectations and the contradicting dialogue. <br /> <br />Leonardo did NOT play his part lifelessly or without emotion. A normal person with no acting skill does that. It is not easy to get before a camera like that and play out Shakespeare. The actors had to give it their own style in order for things to work, because there was no improvising and every line was essential and if the actors didn't like it- too bad. I felt that the two actors really brought the characters to life, and for once it seemed to me that Romeo and Juliet really were in love! When you're reading the play it seems ridiculous that two people could ever just suddenly love each other, but somehow it felt that way in the movie. It worked because of their expressions, their tones, and the atmosphere, all things that you simply don't get when reading it. Romeo and Juliet the book would never have survived so long, but Romeo and Juliet the play is a story that will go on and on through the ages and still inspire the same tragic awe. <br /> <br />Lastly,the ending was altered. In the script Romeo dies and then Juliet wakes, but in the movie she wakes just before he dies. The lines are all the same, except that two are switched so that the two lovers actually interact for a brief moment before dying. I am personally too wrapped up in frustration each time to care (it all just has to happen like one big and horrible coincidence), but I can see why that would bother people.  <br /> <br />All in all, the visualization was good and had a unique feel to it, like almost everything is candle lit, even on the beach. The water imagery was wonderful and added so much more signifigance to the story. The characters were well portrayed and I found myself seeing more into them than I did when reading.  <br /> <br />The movie is only confusing if you keep fighting against it. You can only appreciate it if you take it all in and accept it. Watch it once and then think it over. That's the least this movie deserves.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|He turns John Lee Hooker on his ear and then taps you on the third eye -- idealistic and cynical, loving and brutal, quaint and sophisticated -- so many things that Neil brings together through word and song -- ultimately though, it is fearless.   <br /> <br />This is a truly brilliant album that brings back the Rock Opera for 21st century consumption.  It feels largely unedited -- like Neil just let it come through him -- and so sometimes a bit ragged -- but laserlike couplets often burst through, illuminating many aspects of our modern drama in oh such a Youngian kind of way.  \\"No one could explain it, Just got great reviews.\\" <br /> <br />A good prep is to watch the acoustic dvd with the subtitles on -- have sight at the words once so they ring through the sound again and again.  This cd may be in your rotation for quite a while...
B0001YRVN4|4.0|So nice... to have these classics on DVD.<br /><br />But would you believe ...  Lucas CHANGED the \\"effect\\" changes of the original special editions??? The added \\"Jabba the Hutt\\" scene now has a larger, more detailed Jabba! My Lord, the man is obsessed... he can't leave these films alone!<br /><br />And yes, Han shot Greedo first. And he was justified in doing so... he knew the poorly constructed alien was preparing to kill him.<br /><br />These films were \\"stage 2\\" in a revolution first introduced by \\"2001.\\" They brought Sci-Fi into the blockbuster mainstream.<br /><br />They are full of exceptional music, swashbuckling adventure and sympathetic characters.<br /><br />But WHY does the original drag us along with droids for the first several scenes?<br /><br />Some complaints would be in the writing... especially the dialogue. After winning a Tie Fighter battle in the original,  Luke yells \\"We did it!\\" Much to my horror, Leah then yells the exact same sentence \\"We did it!\\"<br /><br />Or in Jedi, Han tells Lando \\"Good luck... you're gonna need it.\\" This old cliche would even feel tired in a comic book.<br /><br />Of the three, I believe \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is the most entertaining, albeit disjointed experience. The humor is especially sharp... like the repeated failures to go to lights speed.<br /><br />This version actually transplants pretty boy Hayden as the apparition of \\"Anakin\\" at the conclusion, but all in all it's not too annoying.<br /><br />A great trilogy, not perfect but great.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
1400031087|3.0|When this book rings true, it's quite good. When the writing style pays off, it's quite good. The problem was plowing through the 80 percent of the text that either rang hollow or annoyed the hell out of me. Was it worth it? Probably, especially since it taught me something about addiction, which I've never understood.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This \\"Disasterpiece\\" is a true work of art. This is a must for all Slipknot fans. They did a great job with the live performance & the music videos. This is a great party dvd to play in the background. Buy this, watch it, & love it.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I don't speak a lick of German. For all I know, Rammstein is singing about the violent overthrow of the United States. Regardless, they put on one hell of a show.<br /><br />The pyrotechnics are wild. For one song, the lead singer is on fire. For another, he's spewing flames from a flame thrower over the audience. But, Rammstein is so much more than pyrotechnics and theatrics. They can play. Rammstein keeps their audience in a frenzy for the entire show.<br /><br />They growl and sing. They pound and play their instruments. There's passion and anger. I was blown away. They put a lot of American super groups to absolute shame.<br /><br />The DVD itself is well produced. The audio quality is excellent. The visuals give the viewer an beautiful perspective on how massive a Rammstein show is. It's incredible. I sh-- you not. This DVD is worth every penny and then some.<br /><br />If you like heavy metal industrial... If you like KORN and similar groups...you will be stunned by Rammstein.

B00026WU82|5.0|This is it. The best record ever. IMO nothing can stand next to it. Its simply the best one out there. The ultra-beautiful ultra-sinister poetry of classics like Ballad Of A Thin Man and Desolation Row are undeniable. But the greats dont stop there, powerful rockers like Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues and the title track are also here, not to mention subtle brilliance like Queen Jane Approximetly and From A Buick 6. However, everthing on here in pale in comparison to the ultimate mastpiece of rock n' roll, Like A Rolling Stone.  <br /> <br />But It, its the best.
B00005JOIF|4.0|Steven Speilberg's Munich tells the story of how the Israeli government struck back at the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September who was responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic of 1972.<br /><br />Eric Bana lead the Israeli counterstrike team (made up of odd assorted characters) that goes after the terrorist organization, using any means possible to terminate their existence. Overall, the movie proves to be well directed and superbly acted by the entire cast. I have my doubts however on the script. It almost tries too hard to be fair to both sides of the fence. The movie uses Eric Bana's character, Avram as the moral compass of what the Israeli was trying to accomplished. Speilberg seem to be asking if the nation could compromised its morals and ethics standards to defend itself against her enemies. It would be nice if Spielberg actually answer that question but he does not. Funny how the man who directed one of the greatest movies on the Holocaust forget the past so easily.<br /><br />The movie proves to be well made, it could used little bit tighter editing if you asked me, the movie dragged from point to point thanks to Avram's moral self-doubts and interlude with his family. Inspired by a true story, I found the movie to be suspenseful, entertaining and overall, well crafted. Its flaws shouldn't bother most people who enjoyed this type of movie and the movie will leave you much to think about since the United States seem to be in the same position after 9/11 as Israel was after Munich Olympics.
B000667FN8|2.0|This recent trend in radio-friendly emo and pop-punk is getting quite annoying, and it couldn't be better exemplified than with Simple Plan. <br /> <br />It's not the fake punk image that bothers me since a punk-pop album of high quality has actually been proven possible with Green Day's \\"American Idiot.\\"  All the blame lies with the flimsy musicianship, and what flimsy musicianship it is.  None of the catchiness lasts past a few listens.  After that the songs get very tiresome and repetitive.  The vocalist is weak and sounds raspy when he heightens in pitch. <br /> <br />Another major fault is the lyrics.  None of the lyrics are at all original or interesting.  We've all heard the swill about teen angst and broken relationships too many times before.  Why do all of these rock lyricists today seem to have the same problems?  Not only that, but the style is so incredibly bland and is devoid of any subtlety or creative means of expression.  They just say what's on their minds outright and expect us to feel it.  A prime example would be the track \\"Welcome to My Life.\\"  Poetry is more than just meter and rhyme. <br /> <br />I will bump my rating up by one star for the surprisingly decent song \\"Untitled,\\" even though the rest of the CD doesn't deserve it.  I yearn for the days when MTV was a breeding ground for interesting new artists and not some corporate powerhouse that tried shoving this manufactured tripe down our throats.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I was looking forward to this film the second I heard about it since I'm a Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Brazil, 12 Monkeys) fan. I chickened out of seeing it in theatres since their was so many bad reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm glad I did because it's really not that bad. It's not as good as a lot of Gilliam's other films but it's still a fun movie. I have an active imagination, so a movie like this is a dream come true to me. It takes a whole bunch of fairy tales and turns it into one enchanting horror/fantasy. It's sort of how Van Helsing takes all the classic monsters and puts them in one movie.<br /><br />  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger star as two brothers who fake battles with friends dressed up like monsters just to make some money. Soon though, they find themselves up against the real thing. They are sent on a mission to rescue captured children. Not just any children though, most of them you may recognize from classic stories such as Little Red Riding Hood. Ledger is the driving force of the movie. He believes in magic and happy endings and his brother played by Damon, just thinks he's an idiot. When their mom was sick when they were little, he sells the cow for magic beans instead of money that would pay for her doctor. Before he can plant the beans, Damon knocks them out of his hands and calls him an idiot. So when they're older, Damon still holds that against him. Damon trys hard and is good here but surprisingly Ledger steals the show. Ledger had a great year, he showed the entire year that he's not just a pretty face but also an excellent actor. He does that here as well. He'll probably even be nominated for an oscar this year and he deserves it.<br /><br />  The movie is a little mean spirited with how each child is taken and it's sort of disturbing. It could turn-off some viewers. Plus the film doesn't know if it's a comedy, fantasy or horror film. So that can make it a bit of a mess.The violence is a little too graphic and mean to be funny. The kid being swallowed by a horse in one scene for instance, is just creepy. Still though, it is pretty creative. The whole film is creative and that's what I like about it. I respect all the work and thought that goes into a film like this. That's why unlike some people, I just don't give out one star or even 2 unless the film is just too horrible to sit through. In that case I don't think the film is even worth writing about. After seeing the Brothers Grimm though, I couldn't wait to write a review for it. It's a little clunky with how it's put together but it's still a fun movie. Plus if you could sit through Van Helsing and actually like it, then you should love this. This is a Terry Gilliam film we're talking about here...not a Stephen Sommers film after all.kid being swallowed by a horse in one scene for instance, is just creepy.

B00026WU7I|5.0|Bob Dylan's artful and gutsy portrait of the pain following a horrible breakup is masturful both in form and in substance. Except for Highway 61, its his best album. Its mournful and depressed without being pathetically drull. Classics include the fiery blasts like Tangled Up In Blue and Idiot Wind, not-to-mention the heavy-hearted gems like Simple Twist Of Fate, If You See Her Say Hello and Buckets Of Rain, and of course, the flawless blues of Meet Me In The Morning. <br /> <br />So pick it up, it might make you cry.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|i kind of liked nirvana but after this album I dont like the Foo Fighters. the lead signers voice is annoying. when I first heard DOA on trl I was disappointed. so i picked up the CD for the hell of it and realized it wasn't that good. album of the year? no way. kanye west's late registration or rent is the album of the year. i gave it 3 stars because I liked the second disc but the first one is rocking and the second one is like a pop CD which I think is better then the rock so if you can get this bootleg trynit out but I dont like it.

B000000W5L|5.0|When I bought \\"40 Licks\\" a few months ago I knew that I soon would have to buy some original Stones albums. Upon seeing this ablum was ranked #7 on Rolling Stone Magazines Top 500 Albums Of All Time list, I knew this would be the first one i'd buy.<br /><br />I gotta say it blew me away. With its Nitty-Gritty slice of the bluesy boogie feeling thats signature to the Stones.<br /><br />Some of my personal favorites are Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia, Torn and Frayed, and Happy.But the masterpieces of the album are Tumbling Dice and Shine A Light. These two I could bump all night.<br /><br />This album is great, pick it up!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|It makes my blood boil when I hear young people today insulting Phil Collins. I suppose if he went around bragging incomprehensively about shooting people over a monotonous beat like 50 Cents these hooligans might start liking him. Good on you Phil - you don't want that sort of following anyway.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have to say that begining to end this album is a masterpiece. A loud fast begining to a slower more emotional ending. I could not have asked for a better album. I love Tentative Holy Mountain Lonely Day and Soldier Side. Those are my main favorites but the rest of the songs are awesome. I have had this cd for over a month and its still in my cd player.It is the perfect ending to mezmerize and i hope they make an album like this again. But i mostly wrote this to address something most people are mad about. Daron's voice. People, i know Daron is not a perfect singer but he is a unique voice that sounds wondeful on disc. I myself like that daron decided to try something new and exciting. As for the fans that hate both mezmerize and hypnotze for this reason, apparently you are not really a system fan and completely hate change. I still do not understand why you people worry about trivial things. Daron is not replacing serj. if serj left or john or shavo it would not be system of a down no matter how many songs daron can throw on an album. Its called chemistry of a band and they have that in abundance. Totally reccommended(unless your like those mentioned above).
B0000AQS6R|4.0|I heard reviewers- claim that the movie is the best in the vacation series, I can't complain but this movie stands on its own. What are the holidays without caosis??? Every year we continually try to strive for a memorable Christmas.<br /><br />Well Clark GrIswols is no differant- but his good intentions go array in a hillarity of events from a physcotic squrriel to hillibily cousins-in-law to dried up turkeys and police busts. This Christmas IS hillarous. Clark Griswold sets out to make the perfect Christmas only problem is he FORGOT that means you also have to have family involved-dealing with the in-laws, and children is ALWAYS hard.He does his best lighting up the house so litterally it can be seen from outer-space. When Eddie his hillibee family show up things quickly go down hill. They have a disgusting dog, wildly children, and a bunch of character traits Clark can't stand. Making this Christmas HELL. But, even worse is Clark's fear that the pool he has already payed for will ruin him since, he hasn't recieved his bonus yet- making him TOATLLY on edge and unable to deal. But, what Clark dosn't realize is the imperfections in this Christmas are what are turning it into a Christmas no one will ever forget.<br /><br />Christmas Vacation exposes the crazyiness of the holidays and makes you realize that the imperfections in the holidays are what make it enjoyable. At the end when Clark says \\"I did it\\" you can't help but agree that this Christmas is one that will stay with you a long time. This movie is a great family Christmas flick to watch again and again especially during the holidays. All in all a great addition to your must watch Christmas list!

Records, more money than any other recording artist's record label.  <br />Madonna is the richest female singer in the world with an estimated net worth of over $850 million.  <br />Madonna has commercially released 53 singles in the U.S. While her first two releases, 1982's \\"Everybody\\" and 1983's \\"Burning Up,\\" failed to break onto The Billboard Hot 100, every commercially released single through 2004's \\"American Life\\" charted.

B000BI0WOA|5.0|Proper music made by proper men who aren't afraid to go out and graft for their wages. Listen and learn.
B00005NB8K|5.0|you love oliver stone or hate 'em but for this viewer The Doors defines rock music in the 60s better than any other movie. it's a stone trademark to get career-defining performances from people and in this case Val Kilmer gives one of the best performances of his career. Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison is uncanny. The music is used artfully and the editing is fantastic. The only false note is the casting of meg ryan as Morrison's wife. Otherwise a beautiful immersive movie.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This has to be Clint Eastwood Best Western movie! <br />There have never been a better cowboy. Also take a look at Outlaw Josey Wales and Pale Rider. The list goes on.
0446677450|5.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers, there is some information in the book that is a bit on the extreme. On the other hand, the book is inspirational and does work on your mind. His stories are great from the persective of someone did it. Yes, Kiyosaki has made alot of money writing his books, and some of them are great, while others are not. His advice and what he says to you is not to be taken lightly. He doesnt give you the \\"how\\", he simply tells you \\"what\\" can be done. For me, the book was inspirational and has made me think about things, such as money and the working world differently. Lots of other great books out there, but there is nothing wrong with starting with some enthusiastic and motivating words from someone who has already done it. If your not jaded by the words of others, look for the gems offered in this classic.
1594200106|5.0|Even though I read a lot, it doesn't mean that every book that I read is good. And because I'm a slow reader I felt that there has been a number of books that was not worth reading, but still had to finish.  Not this one though.  This one was pure joy reading from start to finish.  From the beginning, Zafon's writing (with Graves' translation) throws you into a world that is so captivating that you won't want to put it down.  Because its so addictive, The Shadow of the Wind should come with a warning label.<br /><br />Pick this book up, you won't regret it.
B00003CXDB|5.0|as with platoon (another stone classic), stone makes the \\"bad guy\\" pretty darn appealing in the character of Gordon Gekko. as with stone's best work, he gets career-defining performances from Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas, not to mention some great performances from supporting cast like Martin Sheen in a brilliant stroke at Charlie Sheen's cinematic father. <br />this, along with the doors and platoon, define stone's holy trinity.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I just bought this CD, and I could not stop listening to it!  The instrumental tracks are simply amazing, and the vocal performances are done by up and coming talents, accompanied by the classical voice of Willie Nelson in the rendition of \\"He was a friend of mine.\\" This soundtrack has amazing emotional impact, and ranges through the scale. This is a great collection of country/bluegrass music that totally sets the mood for the show.  I would highly recommend this soundtrack to any country fans!  This CD is well worth the cost and the time to go out and find one.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Whoever produced this album, I'd love to hear more. Of course Madonna gets most of the credit, but I know good production when I hear it. I like every track. Great energy, and soul through-out. I can't wait to hear all the remixes that are created and played through the clubs of the world. Although they'll be hard pressed to  improve on the originals. <br /> <br />I wasn't a huge fan of Madonna prior to this album, but I did enjoy  her classic stuff and the Ray of Light album. This album put her way up on my list of favorable artists.
B000000OAN|3.0|1975, Queen released their fourth studio album known as A Night At The Opera. It was a great succes, especially their biggest hit ever was well received by the crowd, Bohemian Rhapsody. Everyone loves this song, we'll I think it's great too, but I don't think it's essential. It's good, but after a while it's starting to bore. The rest of the songs is good as well, but songs like Sweet Lady, Good Company, Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rendevous just don't get to me. Such happy songs and simple is just typically Queen. They can make it good, but don't do it . There are always a few of those on every Queen album. But The Prophet's Song and '39 are just great and together with a few others they become essential in stead of Bohemian Rhapsody. Let's see how I rate the songs:<br /><br />Death On Two Legs: 8/10<br /><br />Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon: 6/10<br /><br />I'm In Love With My Car: 9/10<br /><br />You're My Best Friend: 10/10<br /><br />'39: 9/10<br /><br />Sweet Lady: 4/10<br /><br />Seaside Rendezvous: 6/10<br /><br />The Prophet's Song: 10/10<br /><br />Love Of My Life: 8/10<br /><br />Good Company: 5/10<br /><br />Bohemian Rhapsody: 8/10<br /><br />God Save The Queen: 7/10 (instrumental)<br /><br />Those remixes are almost exactly the same as the original versions, so I don't rate 'em. I recommend this item to every Queen fan, and to pop fan. Since I'm just a pop/rock fan, those happy and simple songs just don't get to me.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!!

B00005JMAH|5.0|I didn't care much for the HP series at first. While I liked the first two films, they didn't catch my attention. Then came the awesome Prisoner of Azkaban directed by the equally wonderful Alfonso Cuaron. I am a huge fan of this man's style, and he does not disappoint with this movie. Not only does the whole theme of the movie grow darker, but it's visually stunning to look at. Cuaron certainly knows how to bring out the best in young actors as well, giving more depth and emotion to the characters. And as a bonus, the growing on-screen chemistry between the actors really shines. Most especially the sparks between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. These two were made to star on-screen together. They light up their scenes.<br /><br />SIMPLY FANTASTIC!
0345298349|5.0|Gorky Park is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.  It's well written and everything comes together perfectly at the end. Once you start down this road, you won't want to stop here but continue to the other books in the series which are equally enjoyable.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I stumbled upon Kanye West in a store, the TV was on MTV. On, was \\"Jesus Walks\\", by Kanye West.  I thought it was amazing that someone could talk about god and Jesus that way. I knew the guy had talent so I picked up the album, The College Dropout. I found out that Kanye was a producer and produced Jay-Z hits like \\"Izzo (HOVA)\\" and \\"Encore\\". That made me only a bigger fan of Kanye West's music. Little did I know, almost two years later, he would be one of the most successful hip hop artist of 2005. <br /> <br />I like the whole college theme but I don't like the amount of skits.  If i were Kanye, I would only leave the school spirit skits and the Jimmy Skit (Those are hilarious) in the album. The album is about Kanye dropping out of college (as mentioned simeltaniously on the album) and not knowing what to do. <br /> <br />The album is amazing. Top notch production by Kanye and thoughtfull lyrics make a great album. From \\"We Don't Care\\", to \\"Last Call\\" it is all amazing. <br /> <br />Reccomended to all rap fans!
0788815490|4.0|This movie is a tasty eye candy.  The plot is awkward at best.  The original novel is not much better, by the way.  I am surprised that a sophisticated author like Henry James wrote this novel.  I have always considered him a great psychologist, who posessed great insight into human motives, but in this particular novel his usually precise psychoanalysis goes in every direction uncontrollably.  The plot reminds me of a high-school revenge thriller.  I wonder if he was influenced by Chorderlo Laclos' \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\".  Turn down the sound, so you don't have to bore yourself with the tedious dialogue, and enjoy the splendid costumes and the steamy sex scenes.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is one of my top CDs of 2005.  Perfect.  If you don't own it, you're missing out on one of the best CDs I've bought in years.  I don't care as much for anything they did before In Absentia (also brilliant).  Still good stuff, but more Pink Floyd-influenced that I cared for...I *liked* PF, but earlier PT was too similar for my taste (but if you love PF, by all means buy PT's back catalog!).<br /><br />Deadwing is phenomenal, though.  The PF influence is still there, but very much in the background.  Play 'The Start of Something Beautiful' LOUD, with the lights off, and no distractions.  Do this several times....it's an amazing song, and for me the highlight of an amazing disc.<br /><br />And it has no copy protection.  I've ripped it to MP3 using iTunes on my Mac (no problems), and also burned a copy to keep in the car using my stereo component CD recorder (a TEAC dual-bay CD-recorder).
B00005NIL9|5.0|This is it... the album that countless bands still refer to as the inspiration and starting point for their own musical efforts. If you have never heard of Free before or maybe you've just heard the huge single lifted from it - All Right Now - then buy this with confidence. This is Free's watershed album - it marks the band's shift from its blues roots and tackles the dilemma of popular acceptance versus critical acclaim head on. The band is at its zenith - Kossoff's playing is agonisingly great, Fraser's bass playing superb; Kirke's drumming deceivingly effortless; Rodger's singing - just brilliant, as always. Even your grandma would like this album... there's something for everyone on it. <br />Yes all the tracks appear on other compilations - go for it if that's your thing, but if you want to own a bit of rock history, get this album...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I thought the TV show sounded stupid when it came out.  I bought it later on DVD and loved it.  I thought the movie would be alright, but nothing spectacular.  It's now one of my favorite movies ever.  Do yourself a favor and see this one!
B000002BBY|4.0|I still remember being in middle school, and hearing random tracks from this cd playing over stadium PAs and on the rock stations I wasn't supposed to be listening to.  Years later, I've finally sat down with the entire album and heard it from start to finish.<br /><br />I've owned Standing On the Shoulders of Giants for several years now, and I generally consider it to be a mediocre to good album, depending on my mood.  Several of the songs strike me as solid, generally bland rock songs, and Morning Glory is not exempt from such anthems.  \\"Hello\\" and \\"Roll With It\\" are both good songs, but they don't provide anything new.  However, this potentially fatal streak is broken by the single \\"Wonderwall\\", a wonderful song apparently written to an imaginary friend (and not Noel's then-girlfriend).  Better than that is \\"Don't Look Back In Anger,\\" whose sweeping vocals (with lyrics lifted directly from John Lennon) and piano chords make it the best track on the album, if not the best in the Oasis library.<br /><br />\\"Hey Now\\" is unextraordinary, but still quite listenable, as is the short untitled track immediately after.  The first single from this album is next, and \\"Some Might Say\\" still strikes me as a little disappointing, as does \\"Cast No Shadow\\".  \\"She's Electric\\" isn't quite the power lift the album could use near the end of the cd, but it has a little bit of a different, lighter feel to it, that I find fairly welcome.  The titular, stream-of-consciouness \\"Morning Glory\\" is what keeps the tail from dragging.<br /><br />But last, of course is the epic \\"Champagne Supernova\\", the album's overplayed, yet fantastic track that you can still occasionally hear on lite FM stations.  Granted, its not as heavy as much of Oasis' material, but in the end, its their standout track for a reason.  It captures everything in one 7 and a half minute song.<br /><br />Is the album perfect?  Absolutely not.  Half of the tracks are forgettable and the music certainly sounds a bit dated.  However, its still one of those albums that you can put on at any party and receive at least one thumbs up from an aging twenty-something.  So if you're a fan of Britpop, or just enjoy a little nostalgia, this album belongs in your collection.bit dated.

B000002H33|5.0|The greatest metal album of all-time and one of the greatest recordings of all-time.  Few albums have blown me away like this one and even fewer have I listened to as consistently for almost 20 years.  Though all 8 tracks are flawless, (Welcome Home) Sanitarium, Disposable Heroes, Leper Messiah and Orion make up one of the most incredible four-song sequences ever laid to tape.  Orion, for my money, is the greatest metal instrumental ever written....possibly the greatest rock instrumental, period.  Anyway, what the hell are you waiting for......you should have bought this album at least 15 years ago!
B000031XCR|5.0|In 1999, the ever beautiful Celine Dion released her first greatest hits ever, \\"All the Way... A decade of song\\" The album includes not only 9 of Celines biggest hits, but seven entirely new songs!    The set includes \\"My heart will go on\\" The hugely popular theme to \\"The Titanic\\" This song finds Celine singing softly, and slowly building her voice, until a the amazing climax kicks in, with Celine belting the chorus out like only she knows how.           In my opinion, the best song the record is definetly \\"That's The Way It Is\\" This was the first single form \\"All the way\\" and it is an amazing, uplifting, inspirational tune that helps one through bad times in life.    Other songs include the slow and beautiful \\"Beauty and the beast\\", the mid-tempo ballad \\"Becuase you loved me\\" with its powerful vocals and \\"if you ask me to\\" A slow and wondeful ballad.    All of the songs are great; get this album for any Celine fan in your family! It is certainly worth every penny!
0684800713|3.0|Ernest Hemingway. We've all heard about him. I never had cause to want to read any of his writing. My wife was assigned this with a college english course. I decided I'd read it. I checked out reviews here first. Most of them sounded as if they had copied and pasted a part of their own english course review here. What the instructor wanted to hear. <br />Here's what I think. I enjoyed most of the book. The second half much better than the first. Was I blown away like I thought I would be? NO! Did I enjoy it enough to want to try some more, YES. Most of this book has the cast of characters bar hopping and talking, bad-mouthing, and generally treating each other like crap. That's the first half. The sceond half seems to slow down a little (not as much bar hoping/trash talking). More descriptive and more enjoyable, I thought. Enough to give the book a middle of the road review. I'm off now to try another Hemingway book. Probably \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\".

038541627X|5.0|I have been a fan of Isaac Asimov's short stories since I was a teenager and I have rarely found better since.  While I had already read most of these, to have them in one book was quite the treat.  Many of my favorites were listed here including some that previously were only available from some obscure sources.  Why read Asimov?  Because few writers, if any, deal with the great \\"What If\\" questions as Asimov does.  His explorations into human nature and what potential pitfalls our improvements in technology will bring us are central to his writing.  Some of these stories are dated now and in \\"The Dying Night\\" he even acknowledges that in the introduction to that story.  Even so, it makes for good reading...and entertaining.
0679745653|5.0|I had never read any of Capote's works, but after I saw the movie, \\"Capote\\", I realized I had a big gap in my survey of American fiction and I knew  I had to experience the writing of this interesting  and tormented person.<br /><br />Other reviewers have gone into detail about the stories themselves and I don't find that very interesting anyway, so I'll leave you to explore that for yourself.  I will tell you that if you like Hemmingway or Fitzgerald,  then Capote's observations and will strike a cord with you.  His writing - clear, emotionally invoking and efficient in word is perhaps not as poetic  as these two, but is their equal in impact.<br /><br />The stories are rather short and I found myself wishing they were longer if only to  prolong exposure  to his work.  If you have little experience with Capote, you  will not be disappointed.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Wil Smith delivered a knockout performance of The Greatest in Michael Mann's production. I had a chance to see this movie again in my collection.

B000003TAR|5.0|When you think bout it, its almost ironic that the last studio album Nirvana would release while Kurt Cobain was alive would be called In Utero , since utero represents the birth of life and less then a year after this album was released  cobain killed himself and took not only nirvana but almost an entire music genre with him. The same music that ushered in the 90s and held Nirvana as its own Beatles, pretty much sank under the weight of his death. The final piece of tragic irony to this is simply that this was really Nirvana's best album.   <br />Now I know Spin magazine and Rolling Stone,  will all hail Nevermind as nirvana at their best and that may appeal to people who reallt think the winners on american idol are all great singers. but the truth is  for all the claims that nevermind killed the hair metal scene,  there isnt a song on that album that doesnt sound as slick as a motely crue record and supposedly kurt realized this and wanted to come up with a harsher sound for the band  that would  separate the true fans from those who just thought it was cool to say they liked \\"smells like teen spirit\\"  <br />If you thought it was tough to understand what the hell kurt was saying before then listen to  \\"milk it\\"  \\"radio friendly unit shifter\\" or \\"very ape\\"  you will damm near make you ears bleed trying to find somethign that sounds like its spoken in english that you can understand and im sure kurt knew what he was doing, notice how  on \\"heartshaped box\\" \\"dumb\\"  \\"pennyroyal tea\\" and \\"all apologies\\"  the vocals are all  at least some what understandable, where u can at least make out the verses, these songs that im sure all would had been considered for singles had kurt choose to live, but even if they had been sent to radio,  I cant have seen the mall crowd taking to these songs just cause you can sense the menace thats lurking underneath. perhaps it was just the frustration of being turned into another piece of product by the record company , or the media intrusion into his personal life but kurt and the band seem to be working at either 2 speeds, rage and exhaustion. for me the best track on the alsum is \\"scentless apprentice\\" which marked the first time that the entire band was credited with the writing of a song as oppose to just kurt,  Dave Grohl even came up with the riff to the song and between this song and what he would do on the first foo fighter's album you can tell that had the band not imploded  that dave was not going to be delgated to simply being the Ringo Starr of the group.  <br />It goes without saying that its a total lost that kurt didnt see any point in hanging on, it would had be worth having him around in the post clinton scandel,  post 9/11,  post iraq war world, but perhaps instead of ponderign the could have been its worth focusing on what was, and that was, a simply great rock band  get down and dirty one more time before it all crashed and burned <br />BUY THE DAMM RECORD!!

B000002I27|4.0|Like most in my age range, I first became aware of The Doors via the oilver stone film in 1991, and well it may not had been entirely accurate on fact it did achieve its goal of introducing the band to a whole new audience, of course the only problem with that is u have alot of people who buy into \\"jim is god\\" myth and truth be told, when u really read most of the lyrics to the doors song  u find that some of the songs were average at best and really  jim morrison wasnt going to keep bob dylan up at night.<br /><br />That being said their first 2 albums are still their strongest, but while their self-titled debut sometimes seems alil dated in the 60's scene,  Strange Days can still pack a punch.<br /><br />Much like on their first album, much of the material that found its way to Strange Days had already been written and performed during the band's club days in L.A., so the band more or less knew them inside and out, in Ray Manzarek's book he revealed that \\"when the music's over\\" was done in nearly one take without jim's vocals but the band had gone through the song so many times live that they could just tell where his vocals would would come in and out.<br /><br />Robby's \\"love me two times\\" was one of the new addictions to the album  but just like \\"light my fire\\" on the first album, robby was capable of writing songs that meshed well with jim's songs and in some cases were perhaps better then some of jim's.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest strength of Strange Days is that all the songs  more or less work on one singular theme that being the sense dread and worry. It begins with \\"strange days\\" the song and the whole song with the way ray plays the keyboard it just sounds like the begining of a weird dream that u know is just not quite right.  \\"people are strange\\", \\"unhappy girl\\" and \\"your lost little girl\\" all deal with people feeling alone, out of place and going astray, while i dispute the claim that the Doors were THE dark band of the 60s and contend that The Velvet Underground really won that title, i will say that the doors took dread and uncertainity, added a lil sex to the mix and gave it a surreal california take to it that was pre-charles manson and pre-altamont. even the supposed ballads \\" moonlight drive\\" and \\"i cant see your face in my mind\\" give the sense that love will not last forever and that all romance is bound to end.<br /><br />Listening to this record is like listening to a dark rain cloud on a sunny day.<br /><br />so the next time its raining outside, kick back, relax, grab a drink and just throw on this cd, it may not make u feel happier but sure to feel something.<br /><br />BUY THE RECORD!

0425152251|5.0|Here we have a fun, eye opening trip through a good portion of western philosophy, starting with the Greeks and finishing just past Existentialism. Truly a fun ride throughout, we journey with Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, through Hume, Kant, Marx, finsihing up with a very nice explanation of Sartre's Existentialism. Perhaps the best section is on Darwin, an outstanding capsulation of Evolution, including the famous color mutations of moths in recent day England due to environmental changes. Sophie is never less than a wondrous curiosity seeker, and her teacher almost as good. The labyrinth trip through what is real and what may be be is near flawless with the addition of 2 similar characters. Plus short appearances  by certain fictional characters like Carroll's Alice make this book a real fun knockout for seekers of all ages and backgrounds!
0440217563|3.0|Was a fun read. Lots of characters and action.The romance part does not work for me neither does the \\"eroticism\\", i just jumped ahead,made the book a bit shorter.Hey, this is not litterature but well written anyway and since i am not versed in Scott-British history,was not bothered by factual innacuracies.Reading reviews about this serie was a Hoot. Especially a reviewer that goes as Cheap Scotsman who just loves to hate these books.Wow!! just go through his reviews of the first three books.Very plausible that this god fearing christian could submit himself to the punishment of reading these thousand pagers as some kind of mortification or atonement for some unspeakable sins.You can stop reading these books mr.scotsman, you have been redeemed.
B00008WT5C|5.0|THIS CHEST POUNDING BEAST OF AN ALBUM BELONGS UP THERE WITH A FEW MORE OF THE BEST HARD ROCK ALBUMS FROM FRONT TO BACK THAT YOU WILL EVER DESTROY YOUR EARS TO. IT IS COMPARABLE TO VAN HALEN 1, RUSH, AND MONTROSE. STRAIGHT AHEAD METAL UP YOU'RE ASS ROCK. AND THEY WERE JUST KIDS. GOTTA LOVE IT. GOTTA HAVE IT!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It has skullduggery.  It has daring do. It has romance. It has humor. It has danger. It has the archetypal folk hero, an outlaw smuggler and thief, Capt. Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds as the space western \\"Cisco Kid\\" (O'Henry's famous Robin Hood of the Old West).  It is a Space SciFi Western Robin Hood with dusty trails, gunslingers, and warp drives. Mal's \\"Merry Men\\" include Zoe Washburne is his Little John and second-in-command. Inara Serra is Mal's strong willed, beautiful, exotic, and sensual Maid Marian. Shepherd Book is Mal's Friar Tuck with hidden fight and semi-spiritual guidance. Kaylee Frye is Mal's Alan-a-Dale with a taste for the fancy that is just out of her reach.  Jayne Cobb is Mal's Much the Miller's Son and equally violent and strong enough to behead a monk's page. Dr. Simon Tam is Mal's Will Scarlett and like Will, dressed with almost foppish daintiness and has the law out to arrest and execute him. River Tam is Will Scarlett's sister Cecily.  In the movie version of Firefly, Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays \\"The Operative\\" or Sheriff of Nottingham enforcing a corrupt law.  As a senior citizen, I generally don't watch SciFi, but this series turned me, my husband, our sons, my in-laws into fans. Yes, we did  see Serenity on the first day of release, and the next day. Firefly the series could have surpassed \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Gunsmoke\\" combined with fans. Hopefully there will be more films and novels. In the meantime, we are lucky that the series is on DVD and not hidden is some network vault. Push \\"PLAY\\" for heart pounding excitement and knee slapping laughter.
B000BZISPS|5.0|Great Movie, but the beginning seemed a little shortened (im not really sure) and made the film seem like it was going too fast. But it is still a must-buy.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I've read a lot of the reviews here and I've found that most are either glowing praise or a stiff kick to the teeth.  <br /> <br />I'm more on the \\"glowing praise\\" side of the fence because if you can deal with the dizzying animation, maybe it'll get you thinking about something you haven't really thought about before.  If that happens, you've discovered something better than 99% of the existing films and tv. <br /> <br />For some reason, a lot of the negative reviewers seem to forget that fact. <br /> <br />What's interesting to me is that the vast majority of the really negative reviews accuse Linklater of being pompous and psuedo-enlightened or what have you while simultaneously spewing their own philosophical elitism AND avoiding the arduous task of recommending a better alternative. <br /> <br />That's kind of like someone abnoxiously telling me how qualified they are to tell me how bad my Pepsi tastes without telling me where to find a Coke....or RC.  <br /> <br />This film is not for everyone but for those who \\"get it\\" to some small degree, it will kickstart your imagination.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I came into Firefly late, thanks to a Tivo \\"advertorial\\" right before the Serenity movie was released. Since then I've been absolutely enthralled with the very smart writing, the interesting characters and the overall feel of the Firefly 'verse.  <br /> <br />I went to see the Serenity movie at the theater and my love for the whole thing just grew larger... and sadder, since I knew the series was dead... <br /> <br />But ya know what they say, is it better to love and lose than not to love at all. <br /> <br />I recently found an online petition asking HBO to acquire the rights of the series and bring it back. I have no idea how serious or effective this effort is, but heck - beats doing nothing.  <br /> <br />The link is [...] <br /> <br />If you haven't seen the series; you're in for a treat.

0393327655|4.0|Reading like a call-to-arms, Harris's book will no doubt stir the well-heeled convictions of many a secularist who have allowed their immense tolerance to subdue their own sense of righteousness.  In a nutshell, the book begins by presenting all \\"systems of belief\\" - whether religious or rational - as mere maps of reality, with the purpose of providing the believer with some means to make sense of their universe, and to help guide people toward a survivable future.  Once concrete example of this, certainly, are the laws of Moses - rules intended to stabilize a society.  Harris then take a logical step forward: if religions are competitive \\"systems of belief\\" intended to map reality, and if you agree that some maps are better than others, then you must believe that some religions are better than others - and others worse.  Interesting.  Hold onto your hat.  Harris is not shy.  You can guess the line of thought from here - and Islam doesn't come out well in his figuring.  The book goes on to discuss the need for a \\"system of belief\\" (a) to provide a standard of ethics and (b) assuage the appetite of the spirit.  He concludes with his belief that there are alternative approaches to dogmatic religious beliefs, and offers up eastern mysticism (Bhuddism) as one solution to satisfy the spiritual appetite.  And he declares that rationalism can likely provide a system of ethics to replace that of religion's. <br /> <br />The book does something good: it challenges the secular reader to travel down the logical consequences of their own beliefs.  It's easy to intellecualize ourselves into a hazy realm of pacifism and tolerance.  Harris accomplishes the uncomfortable task of helping the pacifist, the religious moderates, and the overly-tolerant secularist to see that for their vision of reality to survive, they must draw concrete lines and actively oppose intolerant belief systems which threaten their survival.  Any \\"system of belief\\" whose core tenets include the subjugation or extermination of non-believers (read \\"Islam\\") is dangerous, should not be tolerated, and should actively be opposed - whereas other systems of beliefs which lack this threat (e.g. Jainism) can be indulged.  Provocative, huh? <br /> <br />The seduction of his book is also it's greatest weakness: it simplifies to the point of misrepresentation.  Harris doesn't really understand the religious fundamentalist at all (read \\"The Battle for God\\" by Karen Armstrong for a much better review of this).  He acknowledges the need for a system of ethics but admits that rationalisism has failed to provide for this need - but he has \\"faith\\" that the science of ethics will develop.  The biggest failing, however, is that his own map, that of rationalism, renders a flawed world view too.   It may be the less flawed than religion in some ways, but it is still a flawed map, it offers only a narrow rationalized glimpse at the human pysche, it makes no allowance for the mythical dimension of human understanding.   Religion does a much better job.  (And, one pet peave here, Mr. Harris, c'mon, using a New York Times article as reference to your claim about crack babies?  In an otherwise compulsively endnoted treatise, that smacks of lazy research.) <br /> <br />Beware of any book, religious or secular, that leaves you feeling you've finally discovered \\"the answer\\" - history is rife with religious and secular belief systems that blinded people with their total explanation for the ways things are.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I thought this was going to be a good movie - I'm glad I waited to see it - instead of paying for it I saw it inflight on the way back from Tokyo. I watched it for a few minutes with the sound off (couldn't find the headphones) and even with the sound off, the garish colors were bugging the hell out of my eyes. I watched a few minutes of Nicole Kidman singing \\"Diamonds are a girl's best friend\\" before switching to another channel. I thought I was going to be transported to some sort of Moulin Rouge experience in the Paris of the 1800's, and all I got was an ignoramus version of a Gen-X history lesson, with too much snappy editiing and the poorest choices of music you could imagine for a period piece. I actually know a guy who did some artistic direction on this movie, and he apparently thinks it's great. I also know that he smokes a lot of pot, so maybe that's why. In my opinion, this is the most overrated crap to come out of Australia since Yahoo Serious. Like being stuck in an elevator with the circus.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Well... <br /> <br />This Album certainly has polarised the reviewers here. <br /> <br />Point blank, this is one of the 50 greatest albums of all time. The neocons seem to be out in force to slam it. What can I say? they are neocons - god help them. <br /> <br />You might not think that \\"the top 50 albums of all time\\" is anything great, but start populating that list, you'll realise that it fills up VERY FAST and Green Day's American Idiot deserves a high spot on it. <br /> <br />This album does speak to a certain politic, I've tried to ignore that, but what I cant ignore is the work of art they've created. This is a great album. Whatever your politics are, you cant deny the hypocricy and pain that exists in our world today. This album reminds us of how far we've come, and how far we need to go. It makes you think, and it is an absolutely brilliant musical experience. <br /> <br />As a Rock Opera, its perfect.
B0007TKNI8|5.0|Nothing short of excellent in acting, singing, choreography and scenery.  A true masterpiece.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|The tracks sound great, although the selections aren't much different than the European release of the 1991 greatest hits package. The only disappointment is that \\"Sexcrime (1984)\\" is missing here. However, the new songs are brilliant, blending technology and soulfulness as well as the Eurythmics ever have.  Hopefully a new album of new songs is in the works.
B000002L99|3.0|Taking David Lee Roth out of Van Halen is like taking the sugar out of a Pepsi- it's just not quite the same. <br />This is still better than the vast majority of hard rock out there, but to me, Van Halen was never the same once Roth left. <br />I also like Sammy Hagar's solo stuff better than his Van Halen stuff.
B000007638|5.0|Not so much anymore but perhaps one of the better secrets out there is how great a band Wings really was in their day.  Hindsight has allowed for a better perspective of Paul's post-Beatles output, since at their peak, Wings came too soon after the dissolution of The Beatles and anything Paul did seemed to pale in comparison (a truly unfair burden).  By 1976, the chains had come unshackled as McCartney and Wings had several blockbuster albums (Red Rose Speedway, Band on the Run, Venus and Mars) and even more hit songs (Live and Let Die, Jet and Junior's Farm) under their belt.  Everything peaked on the Wings Over America tour of 1976,  Paul's first live appearances in the United States since 1966 when The Beatles gave their last concert performance.    This double CD album captures the tour and is by the far the best live document of McCartney available today.  (Why hasn't this been remastered and re-released???)  The set list revolves mostly around the then three most recent Wings #1 albums (Band on the Run, Venus and Mars and Wings At the Speed of Sound) and some of the tracks become even stronger when in the context of a live setting.  (Venus and Mars was written with the idea of the songs being played on an arena rock tour.)  In fact, some major hits found here (Listen to What the Man Said, Silly Love Songs, Venus and Mars/Rock Show) are unique in that McCartney hasn't played them live in concert since.    The performances found on this album are tight, raw, energetic and tough.  The Wings lineup here was together from 1974-1978 and is probably the best roster the ever-evolving group had, and Jimmy McCulloch as lead guitarist really gives the songs a punch in a concert setting.  The vocals and harmonies by Linda McCartney and Denny Laine are great, and you can tell they are all having a good time, with Paul finally rocking out on his own, free from The Beatles.    Speaking of, Paul throughout the 1970s generally would not/refused to perform Beatles songs, but onthis tour he threw in a few of them, and you can tell by listening that the audience is clearly enthralled to hear \\"Yesterday\\" being sung live by an actual Beatle.      Other highlights include the Laine lead vocals on \\"Go Now,\\" a hit in the mid-1960s for Laine's old band, The Moody Blues, as well as on \\"Time to Hide,\\" a truly underrated Wings song.  Even McCulloch gets a turn on his own \\"Medicine Jar,\\" a highlight from the Venus and Mars album.  The final track, \\"Soily,\\" is a raw rock song whose studio version was never released, which makes its inclusion here an added bonus.      Bono himself recently said that the band of the year for him was Wings.  After listening to this, it's easy to understand why.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the most compelling 'verses ever created.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|I loved \\"King Kong\\" when I was a young child.  Every time my father took me to the video store, I either rented \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"King Kong\\".  But it had been probably seven years since I'd seen it.  After watching Peter Jackson's new \\"King Kong\\", I really wanted to watch the original once more.  So when I received this collector's tin as a Christmas present, I wasted little time in watching the movie. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the story: bigshot movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) recruits poor nobody Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his latest picture.  Carl has a map that will lead him to an island that no white man has ever set foot on.  But rumor has it that some sort of beast rules the island.  It sounds like native superstition ... but as Carl, Ann, and their shipmates soon find out, it's much more. <br /> <br />\\"King Kong\\" is one of the true cinema classics, and it doesn't take much to see why.  The cast is great.  Scream queen Fay Wray was a great choice for Ann Darrow, while Robert Armstrong really shows us what a cheapskate Carl Denham really is.  Of course, there's also Bruce Cabot as Jack Driscoll, the tough first mate who falls in love with Ann.   <br /> <br />Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack direct the film with a sense of wonder and intrigue.  (Look for the duo as fighter pilots towards the end of the film.)  The script, by James Ashmore Creelman and Schoedsack's wife, Ruth Rose, is still good, even by today's standards.  Creelman and Rose took a potentially fine idea and turned it into a grand screenplay. <br /> <br />And then there's Max Steiner's terrific score.  It switches from mysterious, maybe a little eerie, to horrifying and suspenseful, and then to romantic and dramatic.   <br /> <br />But, without a doubt, the true highlight of the film is Willis O'Brien's legendary special effects.  O'Brien's stop-motion animation revolutionized fantasy moviemaking.  His effects are still spectacular to this day; one can only imagine how terrifiying and magnificent they must have seemed back in 1933.  Especially fine is the classic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, as well as the crew's escape from an agrivated Brontosaurus. <br /> <br />It's taken many years for \\"Kong\\" to arrive on DVD, but at long last it has, and it was well worth the wait.  This 2-disc set is precisely what the film deserves.  The picture looks as fine as could be expected for a film that's over seventy years old.  There's a terrific assortment of special features, including the first audio commentary ever recorded for a film, featuring Fay Wray and Ray Harryhausen.  My favorite of the special features is the enticing documentary \\"RKO Production 601: The Making of 'Kong, The Eighth Wonder of the World'\\".  Another wonderful extra is a re-construction of the legendary lost spider pit sequence, by Peter Jackson (who directed the 2005 remake of the film).  The sequence almost seems like it was taken directly out of the original film, and it's as close to the original as it possibly could be. <br /> <br />\\"King Kong\\" is a classic masterpiece that has lost little of its magic over the years.  Now, a new generation can re-discover this sensational picture on this great DVD set.  The collector's tin also includes a reproduction of the original souvenir booklet, a collection of mini-posters, and a mail-in form for a reproduction of the 1933 theatrical poster.  This set is needless to say essential for fans, and very highly recommended for anyone has yet to experience the eighth wonder of the world.
0307263118|1.0|I was eager to read this book since it won the Man Booker Prize, but I was disappointed. The prose is elegant, but there is not much of a plot. This book did not hold my interest and I would advise others to be aware of the flaws of this book. The language was a bit too flowery for my taste. It seemed like every sentence was carefully written and rewritten to contain a simile, a metaphor, or some fancy word when a simpler one would have sufficed.
B000002OHX|4.0|I love this live set but just wish the CD sounded brighter and richer. Still highly recommended, but the mastering makes the recording sound a bit dated.

He can switch it up (remember the Stan preformance with Elton John?) and keep people on their toes.  Lyrically he can tell a story as he did with Toy Soldiers, he can screw around like in My Name Is, he can battle (Ja Rule situation), he can basically, do it all.  This CD shows it.  Nuff said.

B0000026VZ|4.0|Toto has often taken a beating from critics, but they were Grammy darlings in the early 1980s.  I started listening to pop music in 1982, and \\"Roseanna\\" was one of the first songs I truly loved.  So, I'll always have a soft spot for Toto, even if their overly glossy pop sound sometimes comes across somewhat hollow today.  The group was formed by established studio musicians, and they certainly knew how to make hits.  They scored four Top Ten hits during their peak (1979-1983): Hold the Line, Roseanna, Africa, and I Won't Hold You Back.  All of those songs are here, along with Top 40 hits such as 99, Georgy Porgy, I'll Be Over You, and Pamela.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Past to Present 1977-1990\\" does a good job at highlighting the group's biggest and arguably most memorable songs.  Unfortunately, Toto also decided to release four new songs on this CD, all by their new lead singer, Jean-Michel Byron.  These new songs aren't bad and would sound at home on any earlier Toto record.  However, none of them stand up to the hits and Byron sounds quite a bit like a Richard Marx clone.  For fans wanting to focus only on the hits from Toto's prime line-up, you can do better with \\"Essential.\\"  Byron didn't even stick with the group for long, making him pretty non-essential in the band's history.
B000003TA4|2.0|First off I want to make this clear. I have every Album by Nirvana including the box set. I even dressed up as Kurt Cobain during my schools homecoming week.I want you to know that this band is up there with The Beatles and U2 as the most overrated band ever. Most of Kurt Cobain's music sounds about as good as your alarm clock in the morning. The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of Come as You Are (the only good song off this album). Smells Like Teen Spirit is a terribly overrated song which should have left the radio over 10 years ago. The only reason this song is still around is because everyone feels sorrow for Kurt Cobain because of his suicide. If you want to listen to good Grunge music pick up Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt\\" or Soundgarden's \\"Badmotorfinger\\". Nirvana had some all right material. I do like their later album \\"In Utero\\". But this is bull. Nirvana is the band known to define grunge but there is so much better artists out there. here is my list of the best grunge bands. <br />1. Soundgarden <br />2. Alice In Chains (my personal favorite but I have to hand it to Soundgarden). <br />3. Black Crowes <br />4. Pearl Jam <br />5. Nirvana <br />(honoralbe mentions are Meat Puppets, STP, and Samshing Pumpkins) <br />So you can say my review is not helpful but just remember I'm not another fool dissing a band that I know nothing about. I probably know more about this band than you. But if insist on buying some Nirvana music pick up In Utero instead.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I spent the previous evening viewing the original RKO film of 1933, directed by Cooper and Schoedsack, from this Collector's Edition DVD. The print is gorgeous and contains the previously deleted scenes where Kong disrobes Ann, and stomps and chews on villagers and New Yorkers. Before you watch King Kong, however, you must first watch the RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eight Wonder of the World documentary on Disc 2, which will awaken you to the depth of Willis O'Brien's Kong characterization. For instance, in one particular scene, where Kong takes Ann to his cave situated high atop the environs of Skull Island, it points out a subtlety that has eluded me, and I would guess most viewers,for years. When Kong sets Ann down, he turns away briefly, unknowingly leaving her open to attack by a cave serpent. Her scream brings him back, and he quickly kills the creature. After numerous viewings of this scene, I did not realize, until the documentary, that Kong had turned away from Ann to pick a flower. It is while he is sniffing the flower's fragrance that he is interrupted by Ann's scream, which stops him from completing his intended action; ostensibly to give Ann the fragrant flower. Throughout the 1933 version, Kong is enraptured by Ann from the very beginning, and he does indeed treat her as if she were his intended bride. She, on the other hand, is not so enamored with him, and spends most of her time trying to elude him. This relationship dynamic is dramatically different in Peter Jackson's King Kong, and Kong himself is a different beast altogether. If you are going to see Peter Jackson's King Kong, you must watch the 1933 version first; and if you have already seen Jackson's version, you definitely must view it, as well as the documentary. Of particular note is the deleted spider pit scene discussion in the documentary, as well as the Willis O'Brien background information. You will come away with a deep appreciation for the artistry shown in this 1933 filmthat was ground-breaking in its special effects, scoring and scripting. <br /> <br />John ([...]

B000BKVQTS|3.0|This was a bad attempt at making a horror film into a fairy tale.  Had the story taken a more mysterious and enchanting turn like the Brothers Grimm meeting face to face with the characters of their own creation, then it would have been far more interesting. You get tidbits throughout the movie but for no cohesive purpose.  You simply go, \\"Oh, that's Little Red Riding Hood.\\"  \\"There's Hansel and Gretel.\\"  The plot goes in a very different direction altogether. But what else can you expect from the guy who made the movie \\"12 Monkeys\\".  <br /> <br />What killed the movie was the horribly unclear dialogue.  We have great actors in this film, and you just plain couldn't understand what they were saying.  Jonathan Pryce who usually delivers was barely audible with his fake French accent, and the worst was Heath Ledger with his very warbled, nerdy english accent for a German brother.  Ledger's Jacob Grimm was just plain annoying.  His character truly believed in magic and fantasy, and when his opportunity came in the enchanted forest, you just didn't get the wonder and awe you would have expected from him.  Instead it's manifested in a fight between him and his brother played by Matt Damon.  <br /> <br />Too many rushed events from beginning to end.  There's no time for the characters to soak in the mystery of the forest (probably because the forest was trying to kill them).  They are running from something, fighting something, chasing something, climbing something, falling off something and screaming at the top of their lungs the whole way.  Bad character development on a movie focused on two famous brothers. <br /> <br />But of all the acting, Matt Damon's was the best.  We only get one fleeting moment of emotional vulnerability when he claims to Lena Heady's Angelica that he fears he can no longer protect his bother.  Then it's off to more events again.  Just plain silliness.  Rushed events, unclear dialogue, bad character development makes this movie fall flat.  If you want creepy enchanted forests, a good story, some spookiness, with oddity and good solid characters, stick to Johnny Depp's \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".

A surrealistic but real world of sand, kaleidoscopic misery, severe economic restrictions, and above all moral poverty, where the time seems to have stopped for ever, because nothing happens.<br /><br />After watching this movie, something inside voice must be claming that the Neo Realism Italian has reappeared. And that the only difference between the stolen bicycle and the vanished father is simply a few inches in the map of the world and sixty years of delay.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|To be true to the spirit of this great film it should be noted that KING KONG hasn't been \\"released\\" on DVD...at last He has ESCAPED!!! <br />Escaped the ravages of the years of poor print quality and ill-conceived Hays Office deletions, and burst forth on this long awaited and surprising DVD package. <br />First, the print restoration: Some may wonder what all the fuss has been about, but although this is one of the best known and best loved films of all time, it has been very badly cared for over it's 72 year long life, and since original negative materials no longer exist, the restoration had to be done from existing prints of varying quality. Compound this with the fact that 4 and 1/2 minutes of \\"censored\\" footage has been lost, then found in inferior quality and \\"pasted\\" back into the film in video releases past, and you have a major nightmare on your hands, knowing the public will want nothing short of perfection in any DVD release. Well, the restoration technicians have done a SUPERB job here, having located better quality print material in England which allows not only the seamless reintegration of all the missing footage, but also a much sharper overall image than has previously been seen, with the added bonus of the long-lost OVERTURE to the original premiere release, that as far as I know has never been heard anywhere since 1933! The only way this could ever get better will be if someday, somewhere, someone unearths a nitrate negative or first generation nitrate positive print of KING KONG, but until then, don't hold your breath and enjoy the film restored in it's entirety on this Beautiful DVD! <br /> <br />Second, the EXTRAS: WOW!!!!!! What could have been simply a conceit on Director Peter Jackson's part (He is admittedly the Premier KONG enthusiast) is instead a virtual Stop Motion Animation 101 film course on the second DVD of the set. Jackson has drawn together many of the best technicians working in the film industry today (all of whom credit KINGKONG with the inspiration for their careers) and has challanged them to help him not only recreate the infamous lost \\"Spider Pit Sequence\\" using the same techniques that the Master Willis O\\"Brien invented in 1933, but also to unravel the many mysteries of the making of the original KING KONG using vintage models, storyboards and even actual projection equipment which Jackson has collected over the years, all the while paying homage to the many talents who contributed to the original film and finally giving O'Brien and his technicians their long overdue tribute for creating one of the greatest motion pictures ever made! <br /> <br />Lastly, The other films included with the Deluxe Boxed Set, SON OF KONG and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG are simply and effectively presented, each in it's own standard DVD case, and each looking and sounding remarkably good. Though SON OF KONG is admittedly far inferior to it's parent film, taken on it's own terms it is quite enjoyable (a sort of Kiddie Film version of KING KONG). <br />MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a classic in it's own right, and this DVD transfer shows it in all it's original glory with the tinted fire sequence at the climax presented as it was in theatres. Here Master Animator Ray Harryhausen, who worked alongside Willis O'Brien on the film before launching his own illustrious career, shines in revealing commentary and two newly created special featurettes brimming with more hitherto unknown elements of Stop Motion Magic. <br /> <br />The postcard sets of KONG poster art, both domestic and foreign are beautifully presented, and the much talked about reprint of the original Graumann's Souvenir Program (much reduced here) is an interesting curiosity showing just how films were promoted in 1933 (the stage show before the film sounds like a hoot!)  <br /> <br />In All, If you've been waiting for KING KONG on DVD FOREVER, as I have, wait no more! You won't be disappointed, and in fact are in for many delightful surprises! And if  for some reason you have NEVER fallen under the spell of KONG, now is your chance to experience it as it should be seen and to learn all about the great cinematic talents who created it and in so doing created the force that has led to every big blockbuster movie since. <br /> <br />KING KONG HAS FINALLY ESCAPED ON DVD!!!!!
0385507755|1.0|This book is yet another hopeless horror story promoted by Oprah! Why do I read what she recommends? They are all horrible stories with no redemption---nothing beautiful or good in them! Just depressing diatribes on the worst side of life! This book is no exception.  <br /> <br />As others have said, I doubt the truth of much of Mr. Frey's story, right from the beginning. What airline would allow this man on the plane? What person would sit near him, in his condition; and with his smell?! A bit far fetched. As is the rest.   <br /> <br />But, what I find most disturbing is Mr. Frey's attitude. Drug addicts are rebelling against society; against right and wrong. They seem to try and PROVE that they are much more \\"special\\" than everyone else; rules do not apply to them. They hate it when they are lied to; yet they seem to lie with almost every word, to get what they want! This book is a sad commentary by one of these sad people. When it ends, one is left with the feeling that Mr. Frey has not changed and is soon right back on drugs.  <br /> <br />I recommend reading an old book called \\"The wail of a drug addict\\" for a portrait of a true alcoholic/addict who found redemption and was reformed. Why saturate yourself in hopelessness?
B000ASATZ8|5.0|This DVD is by far a much better improvement in the way of audio and video.  <br />There was another review I read that said they aren't anamorphic and are the exact same transfers. I have no idea what DVD he is talking about because these movies are all anamorphic, all 5.1 (except tremors 2) and the first 2 have been remastered. They look brilliant compared to the earlier releases. I did a screen shot comparison and they are way sharper and cleaner.  <br />Get this set if you love the movies and are looking to upgrade your previous DVDs.
B000AGTPUA|3.0|This movie was just a 3 to me.   Lots of gorgeous landscape scenery (snowfall, northern lights) and an exciting rollercoaster ride (aka rollercoaster tycoon), Hanks made an appearance for at least 4 different characters, the computer generated kids were just disappointing (think claymation with each hair strand blowing realisticly through the breeze..) I could not get past them being CG, Pixar and Dreamworks are much better. It's a good attempt though.. Show this movie to the under 10 year old crowd. I'd be pissed if my kids got on a train in the middle of the night.. blah The high note was the ending song by Josh Groban what a beautiful song.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|Wow!  I heard the listen clips on Amazon and decided I just had to have this one!  I was not disappointed!!  The album is totally awesome and I could not listen to it once. Rod's voice is unmistakable and just hearing it brings back memories of younger dance days!  My husband and I danced in the living room and enjoyed ALL of the songs.  My kids enjoyed it as well and they are only nine!  I can now share with them memories of my dancing past.  Thanks Rod Stewart for a delightful CD!  Keep up the wonderful work and please don't stop expanding your role in the music world! It is appreciated more than you know!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm not going to waste anyone's time by going into detail, because there are several hundred other reviews which have already done that.  However, this was an exceptional movie, and I never watched the Firefly TV series.  I originally saw this movie in theater and the audience response was amazing.  People clearly loved this movie.  The only audience response I can compare this to was from the original star wars theatrical release.  Besides the love of those first three star wars movies I have never experienced such love and energy for a movie.  Rumor has it that if this movie does well there will be two more to follow and possibly after that a continuation of the TV series.  I truly hope so.
0553801503|4.0|George R. R. Martin, A Feast for Crows (Bantam, 2005)<br /><br />It took five years, give or take, for the fourth book in George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series to get off the ground. And off the ground it got-- it's topped just about every bestseller list in America, and hit the top 10 in a whole lot of other countries already. It's pretty obvious that the fans waited faithfully. The question is, was it worth it?<br /><br />I should start out by saying that it simply wouldn't be fair to compare this to A Storm of Swords, the previous novel in the series. It doesn't compare to A Storm of Swords, but then, few things do (including the first two books in the series). A Storm of Swords was a rare achievement, a novel that stands out both as a part of the series it's in and as, simply, a novel. A Feast for Crows is not; while it is integral to the series, the incredible number of page hits recorded by A Song of Ice and Fire concordances and plot summaries on the Internet in the past few weeks is testament to the fact that the book doesn't stand outside the series.<br /><br />This is not to say, of course, it's a bad book; Robin Hobb's absolutely brilliant Assassin's Quest, for example, would get a reader hopelessly lost unless he'd read the first two books, but it's still wonderful. Martin here continues on a number of storylines from the first three books, as well as getting us much farther into the stories of a couple of bloodlines who had previously been fringe players at best, the Tyrells and the Greyjoys. The sections dealing with making these fringe players into movers and shakers are, perhaps, the strongest in the novel; the characters practically pop off the page at you. It's likely that one of your biggest complaints will be that there's so much going on that many characters don't have nearly enough written about them (a complaint that has plagued the series from its outset).<br /><br />It is also likely that your biggest complaint will be that which has been nigh on universally raised since the book's release-- that it shouldn't have been split. Martin, with or without encouragement from outside, decided to split A Feast for Crows into two novels (A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book in the series, will now essentially be A Feast for Crows II: The Wrath of Khan), saving a number of storylines for the second book. I have yet to read an article, review, etc. that hasn't criticized this decision. I can't say I was all that thrilled with having most of the characters who have made the series so gripping-- Tyrion, Jon Snow, Stannis, and a large number of others-- here only mentioned, or seen in flashes. That said, there's more than enough meat here to go round, and there will be times when you forget that other storylines even exist. This is a huge, sprawling monster of a novel in a huge, sprawling monster of a series. If you've already invested yourself in the twenty-five hundred pages leading up to this point, of course you're going to read it, whether you're angry that Tyrion's not in the book or not. And if you haven't yet read the first three, what are you waiting for? ****h has been nigh on universally raised since the book's release-- that it shouldn't have been split.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|When you are involved with somebody, have you ever fantasised yourself being with other people?  Are you satisfied when you love somebody and that somebody love you back?  Do you yearn to have the feeling of love even when you know that both of you are living a pack of lies?  When the love is gone, do you let that other person go?  Isn't it that when you love somebody, you set them free?  Isn't love selfish, though?  When you can't have them or won't have them, do you intentionally wish to inflict hurt and emotionally scar to others?  Love is an intangible and subjective being.  It's not there and yet, it's there.  \\"Closer\\" is an autopsy (deliberately clinical in this instance) of love, loved, in and out of love.  Jude Law portrays a character, Dan that is a splitting image of his true self.  Can readers recall of him having a fling with his nanny when he was already engaged to Sienna Miller, and who he had a relationship with when he was not technically divorced from his first wife?  Talking about art imitates real life?  Then, there's Natalie Portman in her breaking or coming of age role as a stripper.  She does reveal a lot of flesh in this instance and I simply couldn't get over the fact that Princess Amidala was doing lap dance for Clive Owen!  Julia Roberts plays a photographer who captures portraits of sad and lonely people.  Perhaps, she sees her own self in their reflections and in this movie, she would bounce from one relationship to one another and back again because she doesn't wish to be hurt emotionally no more.  Clive's character as a dermatologist is the most lucid character here, brutally frank and honest or a straight shooter.  From outset, he might look like a brute but as the movie dwelves deeper, we start to understand that what you see is what you get from him.  To simplify the description here, ladies here in the form of Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are those that have built fortress around themselves so that their emotions become unscathed from any relationships that didn't work out their ways, Jude Law is a conniving and selfish lover who interprets love as he pleases and guys that rationalise their doings as the right things to do when they leave a lot of casualties along the way and lastly, Clive is those men that are caught in the crossfire, someone who is realistic about relationship and someone that differentiates between love and lust and someone who is there to ensure the relationship he commits himself into works.  A very intelligent and well-made movie from a veteran Director.  Highly recommended.  Not much extra in DVD other than subtitle and the MTV of the theme song.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Only because I am an unabashed proponent of political incorrectness did I set aside 90 minutes to watch this silly spoof.  Set in 1970s San Diego--trapped in Will Ferrell's \\"deer in the headlights\\" facial expression--ANCHORMAN gleefully basks in its irreverent male chauvinism, and makes no apologies along the way.<br /><br />But I've already given more meaning to this flick than its intentions.  ANCHORMAN is pure, 110-proof nonsense--some of it priceless, most of it annoying cornball.  Ferrell plays a shallow, arrogant, dim, conceited, slow-witted, predictable simpleton of a TV news anchor who suddenly must conduct a sack check when his station hires. . .gasp. . .a female co-anchor!  Blonde, glorious Christina Applegate stars opposite Ferrell, and she comes across as bored and wooden in her role (although I felt wooden while watching her).  Yet the shining moments of this movie were captured by Ferrell's beloved \\"news posse\\":  a sports reporter (David Koechner); a roving news reporter (Paul Rudd); and a weatherman (Steve Carrell, who easily steals every scene he's in).  When these guys broke into a rendition of Seventies hit \\"Afternoon Delight\\" I thought my pair of Depends could hold back no more moisture as I laughed sans consequence.<br /><br />Another plus:  ANCHORMAN boasts visits from several comedic actors in a plethora of cameos--Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Vince Vaughn, to name a few.  The news channel \\"rumble\\" amongst the various San Diego news personalities was simultaneously entertaining and irritating.  Which sums up this movie perfectly.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON
1575666286|5.0|The Gerson Therapy saved my life. <br />I was diagnosed with SLE ( Lupus), and there was nothing that the M.D.'s could offer me, except Prednisone...which was urged upon me. <br /> Through the fortunate advice of a friend, I read the Gerson book...and to make a very long story short, I decided to do the  program. <br />Let me just say here, in rebuttal to the first reviewer of this book, that NOWHERE in this book does it suggest that on should JUST do coffe enemas. Quite the contrary. If one is doing coffee enemas, it is essential that one ALSO be drinking the juices. <br /> In fact, if one is serious about getting well, it is absolutely essential that one do the program to the letter- not just some elements. <br />I stayed on the Gerson program for two and one half years. Hard? Yes. <br />But I came out of it healed. <br />I went into the program so very sick, hair falling out, skin sores, terrible joint pain, failing kidneys. <br />That was more than fifteen years ago , now, with no recurrance. And I neved did take the Prednisone. <br />I did the Therapy at home, with the Gerson book as my guide. ( The Gerson staff, in terms of support and more information, were my telephone angels.) <br />  So, while my experience was not with cancer, I most certainly will recommend this book to those who suffer from auto-immune disorders, and also to those those who simply are interested in knowing how bertter to preserve and restore health.

0307276902|3.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was written by an arguably talented hand. Others have debated its technical and creative merits. If it were fiction, I would leave that debate to the experts, and not be moved to write here.  <br /> <br />The problem is, \\"A Million\\" claims to be nonfiction. The first \\"Spotlight Review\\" above illustrates why that's a problem. \\"Prisrob,\\" a Top 500 Reviewer, heaps Five Stars and plenty of praise on \\"A Million\\":  <br /> <br />\\"I could feel and still can feel,\\" says prisrob, \\"a little of what his life was like. How horrible to be kept in the middle of nothingness - wanting that next fix, that next drink, not caring about anyone or anything . . . .\\"  <br /> <br />I have no issue with prisrob's review, which seems a correct reading of \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\" But speaking only for myself, as one ongoing work of nonfiction, I'm hard put to find many of Mr. Frey's million nonfiction pieces that fit remotely, anywhere in my real life.  <br /> <br />This review is not the place to discuss the philosophy, culture, and psychology of addiction, which have spawned many plausible studies and theories. Yet I'm not aware of one of them that supports the widespread, damaging, and in my experience false stereotype of current or former substance users as cold-blooded beasts who (to borrow from prisrob) do not care about anyone or anything except their chosen substance. This stereotype makes a user feel powerless and dehumanized, and friends and loved ones feel compelled to betray the user's trust, confidence, and human dignity. If reality bears any relation to the stereotype, I fear it is only a self-fulfilling one.  <br /> <br />These misperceptions and self-fulfilling dysfunctional relationships, which \\"A Million\\" widely perpetuates and reinforces, needlessly worsen the suffering of those with substance issues, as well as those who interact with them -- that is, of us all. <br /> <br />
B00005JO1Y|1.0|I realize Edgar Rice Burroughs' dopey King Kong story was written for  children & a young teen audience. I know it's supposed to be trite and two-dimensional! What I didn't expect was the blatant racism, the non-stop killing & gore, the pathological narcissism by one of the main characters, and the 1950's style monster movie drudgery, at the hands of an alleged genius, Mr. Jackson of Lord Of The Rings fame! I literally trusted that he would not pander to American society's lowest common denominator in order to make a buck.<br /><br />What a disappointment! I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when they did focus groups before making this movie. They must have impaneled a bunch of immature teenagers without any regard to either young children or grown-ups, which is a real shame!<br /><br />I was also a bit shocked by the disgusting racism shown towards a very dark skinned tribal community. It's now 2005, why were indigenous people portrayed as dangerous maniacs, and downright evil? This is a rather ugly stereotype the Western world has been carrying around for many centuries. To this very day, indigenous people are being run-off their land, or killed, because they stand in the way of the almighty dollar! Some situations are so extreme that organizations like Survival International from the United Kingdom, and Cultural Survival, out of Boston area, solely exist so this kind of mindless brutality will finally come to an end.<br /><br />This is a teachable moment. I hope Mr. Jackson makes amends for profiting off of a very White author's terribly misguided, and hateful, fantasies. Perhaps it's time to get Howard Zinn on the phone!<br /><br />The violence and gore caught me by surprise to the point it got rather tedious, and annoying! Besides being preposterous, for example, I don't care how strong a vine is, it's simply not going to hold onto a squirming, multiple ton dinosaur!  There was also a very disturbing message - that nature in its pristine wild state is, by design, an extremely dangerous place. Which, of course, needs to civilized by mostly White men!<br /><br />The attack of the giant cave bugs obviously reflects our childhood fears of the dark. But back in the real world most cave systems are occupied by some of the most unusually fragile endangered species on earth! Besides being fragile, they are blind, and totally harmless! How ironic! If this movie deters a single vandal from damaging an underground cave system, then hooray. But what most children, and plenty of older folks now will think is that caves are creepy, bad places instead of  biological treasure troves worthy of badly needed government protection!<br /><br />I could go on forever about why this film stinks. To sum it all up: The young child sitting behind me was constantly asking his father questions because he was trying to cope with the trash that was unfolding before his eyes. I had the good sense to walk out at the two hour mark. I dearly hope the boy's father had enough sense to do the same!s place. Which, of course, needs to civilized by mostly White men!

B000BOH8XW|5.0|Oral Fixation, Volume 2 by far is the best CD made by Shakira to date. Shakira sings in a variety of ways and shows that she does have an oral fixation, which is singing. The songs range from the soft songs such as, \\"The Day and the Time\\" and \\"Your Embrace\\" to the heavy songs like \\"Animal City\\" and \\"Costume Makes the Clown.\\" She gives other languages a try such as Arabic and Hebrew from \\"How Do You Do\\" and sings beautifully in French in the opening stanza of \\"Something.\\" Her vocals are by far better than that of 2001's \\"Laundry Service.\\" There is a song for everybody on this CD. I highly recommend this CD.
B0001611DI|5.0|Most of my favourite movies (like Die Hard and The Breakfast Club)are set in one building. This is one such movie. The hollow ,barron feel to this movie adds to the tension and the constant anything-can-happen atmosphere. If a movie ever had an affect on the real world, then this one is really bad for our health. Not only is it a bloody (pardon the pun) good zombie flick, it is - without a doubt - a beautiful celebration of the cigarette. Everybody smokes. Everybody talks about smoking. Mind you, if I was knee-deep in zombies, I'd be smoking a shed-load of ciggies too.    --- Ren ---
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a fantasy/comic book junkie.  Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between.  Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria.  Two examples would be \\"Hellboy\\" and \\"Daredevil\\"...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking.  This all leads me to \\"Sin City\\".  This movie is amazing.  You either love it or you hate it, I guess.  I loved it.  It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.  A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.  Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.  The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing.  I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is \\"why buy the cow...\\"  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying.  If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD.  It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it.  You get to see all 4 stories as they were originally meant to be AND the way it was released in theatres AND in a green screen version that lets you see what was real and what was CGI AND with an optional audio track from the premiere audience that saw this movie...not to mention tons of interviews with cast and crew.  This is the reason to buy a DVD!
B0000025RI|5.0|I can see why this was MJ's best album and best album in the world!!  Its really great and since early 1983 we are still giving good reviews about this jewel and if they do not think this is a great album (although do not like MJ), they got a real problem!  I love all the 7 singles.  My favorites are Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', PYT (the hit at many black college parties when they play old school music), the funky, but revolutionary Billie Jean (blend of soul and r&b plus one of the first heavy rotated black music videos on MTV), the beautiful Human Nature  ........DAMN IT, I love them all.  Baby Be Mine, excellent mid-tempo groove that should have been released as a single, but unlike most of the other poplike singles on Thriller, this one was as urban as Luther Vandross' early songs - very very soulful.  Nothing tops soulful like the other lp track, Lady In My Life, which was (and still is) a hit in Black Radio Stations.  Beautiful ballad (sampled 13 years later by Boys II Men and LL Cool J for Hey Lover) and should have been released as a single (probally #1 on Black Singles charts if a single). What more can I say, when they say \\"1983 is the best of Black Music or 1983 AND 1984 was the year of........\\" THRILLER IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!  Many awards won and I'm proud of him (after 23 years, the lp is still on fire!!).  50000000000000000000000000000000000000000++ Stars!!!  Not 5!
6304578458|5.0|If you're a child of the 80's and you love dark humor, this movie is not to be missed.  John Cusack plays a hitman with no heart who decides he wants to get out of the killing business, goes to his high school reunion, meets up with his ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver)...and (gasp) develops a concience.  Anyways, I own two copies (my wife and I both owned a copy when we met) and keep them both around.  I wish the DVD had more extras, but this DVD came out when extras were myth.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I love seeing Animatrix cause it's a Japanese anime, it had nine short films with stories about how it all started in the beging.

I love The Matrix Revolution when those guys were in the machines fighting those big machines.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|So I'm going to start out by ducking at the sucker punch that will inevitably be thrown at me by the Michael Keaton purists.  Yes, I thought Christian Bale was a better Batman.  In fact, I also thought this script was better than the original.  The Dark Knight is DARK.  Hollywood missed that boat.  They got darn close with the firt movie, but totally lost touch with it from there on.  This movie made you feel as if Bruce Wayne was himself a tortured man who fought with his own internal demons to become Batman, not just some glamourous playboy billionaire.  Great A-list cast and acting, wonderful effects, and for once true to the Batman roots.
0780626966|5.0|I love the Freddy movies since it was first maid in 1984. My favorite of the movies are when he fought Jason for the first time Jason had his head in the water and he was still alive. What freak me out in one of the Freddy movies was when his mouth got so big and I mean big enough to eat a kid. I thought the last Freddy movie would be \\"Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare\\" when his daughter brought him into the real world then put a dynimate on him and he explode.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Do you like to dance? Cause I sure do and this album definately caters to that! The album is solid, and its the type were individual tracks don't need to be rated, as each track just flows smoothly into the next. Madonna really hit it over the head with this one! <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" the infectious first single starts the album off, and my favorite track off the album \\"Get Together\\" follows. \\"Sorry\\" a total club banger is the next single off the album and it just goes on and on to good songs. \\"I love New York\\" and \\"Future Lovers\\" are both entrancing as is \\"How High\\".  <br /> <br />I definately recommmened this album because its solid, each track is awesome and you can shake it all night long! I am loving the throwback to the 70's disco. I give it 4 stars only because I am more so a Hiphop fan but whatever! This is still cool.
B00005JLYW|5.0|Charlie Angels Full Throttle is a perfect movie it has action like no other. Its the Matrix meets 007. Demi Moore looks hot in this film. I love seeing Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Barrymore but naked when they bust into the wall all three girls kick ass.

This little town thinks he is one of there boys from war that had died, but the body was not recovered. A great movie for the whole family.
6305972591|2.0|This movie ain't as bad as some people make it out to be, but it's pretty silly, definitely.  'Children of the Corn' is a pretty great short story, but it seems like it would be tough if not impossible to make it into a good film.  It's got a few decent moments, with a nice little massacre at the beginning, and the guy who plays Malachi is pretty cool, and that Courtney dudes 'Outlander!' speech is fun, but overall it's rather silly and uneventful.  Horton and Hamilton are incredibly dull as the leads, and they don't really get the kids right either.  They make 'em out to be like murderous Amish people, and while this may be a fairly reasonable interpretation of the story it doesn't really work.  They should be more feral, but whatever.  Also, 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows' is really extraordinarily poorly done, and is a sort of murder-cloud, or something.  Also, Hamilton didn't have her eyes gouged and tongue-ripped out and the holes crammed with corn silk and husks.  Weak.<br /><br />Whether or not you wanna see this depends on how much you like crappy horror movies.  I like them quite a lot, but I'm certainly not gonna tell anyone they need to see this movie, even if I can't quite tell you to avoid it either.  However, do check out 'Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice'.  I haven't seen that in years, but I distinctly recall it being a lotta fun, definitely better than this one.<br /><br />Grade: D+
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There isn't much I can add to the other reviews. But I don't intend to. I'm not trying to top what others wrote. All I want to do is plead with you to buy this CD. <br /> <br />On The Man Comes Around, the last album Johnny Cash recorded before he died, the 70-year-old legend unleashes some of his most personal songs, plumbing the depths of his soul and singing with such palpable emotion that every song draws you in, commands your attention. And your respect. <br /> <br />Overall, The Man Comes Around is more melancholy, more introspective than his previous three albums on Rick Rubin's American label. The pace is slower, and the feelings more obviously on his sleeve. <br /> <br />\\"Hurt\\" is a video that I can't watch without choking up. Ditto for the song itself. And \\"In My Life\\" by the Beatles. Maybe the legendary Man in Black knew his life was drawing to a close. Or maybe he was just in a sentimental mood.  <br /> <br />Whatever the reason, I have a hard time listening to The Man Comes Around without feeling waves of emotion wash over me -- made even more intense knowing he died a year after this album was released. <br /> <br />Thank you, Rick Ruben, for allowing Johnny Cash to shine on your record label. <br /> <br />To everyone reading this review, if you haven't done so already, please buy The Man Comes Around.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Incoherent and boring supernatural thriller that has the right pieces but does nothing with them to make a compelling or interesting film. Keanu Reeves has the charisma and the charm but his character is a wasted bore and he just comes a cross like an unlikable jerk than anything useful to the story. He just sticks out like a sour thumb and just does not engaged the audience with his badly written character. Rachel Weisz does far more for the audience and the movie with her way too good and superb performance in this film but you do end up feeling sorry for her after awhile because the script and the dialog does not do her valiant performance any justice. Her performance is so good in fact that she is single handedly holds this film together while its in fact falling apart by all around her. Tilda Swinton plays a pretty good angel but her character is way too lightweight to be taken seriously, especially with the revelation towards the end of the film that just blows apart the little creditably this film had going for it. Shia LaBeouf is a decent kid actor but his character ends up more annoying than useful and Djimon Hounsou does ok with a very limited role.  <br /> <br />My Thumb goes way up for Rachel Weisz's game and way too good for this film performance and a special nod goes to Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance at the end of the film does more for it than the whole bad script itself. <br /> <br />Thumbs, way way down to the bad direction and terrible script that made this film a real challenge to watch. <br />
B000002JS6|2.0|First off, I've never been a huge ACDC fan, I like few their 70's albums (none of them is anywhere near the best ever) but for me, anything the band did in the 80's and in the 90's is just crap. This is coming from a fan of any kind of rock music excluding nu-metal, emo/punk-pop and metalcore.<br /><br />ACDC is probably the most overrated classic rock band ever, like another person said they don't have 25% of the talent people believe they have, the guitars and the bass are decent on this album, the drums are nothing more than straight 4/4 drum beats, and Brian Johnson is one of the worst vocalists I've ever heard. Bon Scott (RIP) utterly kills him on that department. Brian is nothing more but some hack throat-shouter. This album rails from poor to mediocre, my actual rating is 2.25 stars, it really lacks melody and the production is poor. It got out in 1980, the same year as Iron Maiden's self-titled debut album, Black Sabbath's 'Heaven & Hell' and Judas Priest's 'British Steel' got out. How can you call this the best album ever?? The 3 albums I mentioned above clearly annihilate Back In Black. This album has 3 songs that really worth listening: 'Hells Bells', 'Shoot To Thrill' and the title track, that's it. 'You Shook Me All Night Long' and 'Shake a Leg' are okay and the rest are pretty much filler.<br /><br />I know I risk the flood of non-helpful votes but c'mon, have you even listened to the whole album before you mindlessly praise it?? Download the 3 songs I mentioned and move on. Buy it only if you're a completist.<br /><br />O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D!
B000002J2F|5.0|Duke is a great concept album that centers around a man who has lost his courage.  He is the fool of fate.  The greener grass dies in the winter and the bright future of freedom that Duke envisioned fades into mediocrity.  After the massively disappointing \\"And then there were three\\" this album renewed my faith in Genesis.  Yes, it continues their drawn out departure from the prog-rock that made them famous but that's just where their road without Peter and Steve took them.  These songs were introspective and arranged carefully to create an atmosphere of a man who is caught between his married, comfortable past and his frighteningly solo future.  In the end he realizes that he has to tear down the images of his past and his disillusioned fantasy of being a highly-desired \\"Man of our Times\\" and start anew.  \\"Duke's travels\\" and \\"Duke's end\\" are marvelous instrumentals that bristle with energy and complex counter-melodies, rising to a tension-filled climax that rivals any of the recordings in their repertoire.  The remastered sound is well done and keeps the integrity of the overall tone intact.  Genesis made a statement with this album and they never looked back.  And they also never reached this high again.  \\"Duke\\" is great from beginning to end.
B00079FUI6|4.0|Is this set supposed to have a booklet or episode list or anything in it?  (Mine didn't)
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I know we all love \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\". That song is reason enough to get this album, it's the best original christmas song to come out in the last 15-20 years! For the hardcore \\"lambs\\", this is a must have because of the videos, they're great fun for Mariah fanatics. However, the regular album is more than enough if you're just a fan of great holiday music. Mariah Carey created a perfect holiday gift and everyone should get this album and enjoy it during the holidays!
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I couldn't sit through the whole film because of the poor quality of the DVD -- poor picture and sound quality.  Why are manufacturers making such low quality DVDs now?  One more thing, so many of these reviews are merely judgments of the fans of the movie or the series, or of Joss Whedon himself, with nothing about the movie.
0553801503|5.0|I have waited for 3 years (since I first heard it was supposed to be out in November of 2002) for this book, and was only disapointed in the fact that it is the \\"whole story of half the characters rather than half the story of all the characters\\" as author Martin says in the back of the book. Otherwise, it was a definite \\"couldn't be put down\\" thrill ride. Not quite as much action as some of the first three, but the intrigue and character development is far and away better than anything else I've read.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next installment \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" to come out. I want to find out what happened with Tyrion, Jon Snow, Daenerys, etc. Get to writing, George!!
B000002UAO|5.0|To me this is the best Beatles album, it's the only one I would give 5 stars. After Rubber Soul they started to lose it and there was too much mindless drug influence. But this one hits the spot every time I play it. There isnt a bad song on the album, Beatles at their peak. Recommended.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I already liked Reese Witherspoon, now I am in LOVE with Joaquin Phoenix. They both did an awesome job! I saw the movie on Christmas Eve...am going to see it again this Friday. Can't wait until it comes out on DVD!
B0002OERI0|3.0|I know that mainstream music is terrible.  The current climate is what is leading people to believe that this album is some masterwork.  It isn't.  It's good, but it isn't great.   <br /> <br />Green Day basically re-wrote the songs on previous albums, with a common theme, and then threw in some tempo changes and a little continuity.  They made no attempt to explore any new musical styles or sounds. This album is actually VERY mainstream in its production and sounds.   If you look at the album credits, they used the same producers and mixers they have on virtually every other album.  How can you say you are being experimental if you do everything by the old book?   <br /> <br />So what you have is a typical Green Day album with some character developement, links between songs, and tempo changes.  That qualifies for brilliant these days?
0767847431|4.0|Ask any male who went through adolescence in the '50's and 60's for the one word that was synonomous with special effects and they will all answer, Harryhausen.<br /><br />'The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad' was the second in a series of three Sinbad movies highlighted by the clay models of Ray Harryhausen. It was also the best. Yes, it's true that by todays standards the stop-action techniques used back then to provide the illusion of movement by Ray's fantastic creations was slow and cumbersome compared to what we can accomplish today with computer-generated images. However for us old-timers who didn't know any better it was absolutely magical.<br /><br />'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' was a classic of the genre in '73 and can still be enjoyed by the younger, albeit more visually sophisticated generation if they are willing to overlook some of the inherent flaws from a time before computers forever changed the cinematic landscape.<br /><br />While somethings constantly change, somethings remain forever constant. No special effects are necessary to enjoy the ravishing Marigiana (Caroline Munro), looking better than any woman has ever looked on film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I never watched the series, but it didn't matter. I want to watch it now. I just rented this because it was there. Engrossing film, a little rushed but great effects, story, and acting. If you like scifi you'll love it, if you don't you should still give this one a chance, it doesn't forget to have a story like some sci fi does. Last comment: it served as great fix, with no star wars or lord of the rings in the future.
B000002UAU|5.0|I consider this to be the greatest album of all time although it's not my favorite. In fact it gets much less rotation than most of the Beatles albums I own. kudos to Paul, Ringo, and George but whenever I have a notion to dethrone this album from it's lofty position It only takes a listen to \\" A Day in the Life\\" to set me straight. I believe that every true artist strives to convey their thoughts in a manner that is comprehensive yet simple. The Sistine Chapel is remarkable but you don't necessarily need to see every inch of it to get Michaelangelo's point. Did Tolstoy really need 1000 and something pages to express himself with \\"War and Peace\\"? I believe that Lennon strikes a perfect balance within \\" A Day in the Life\\". \\"I read the news today... Oh boy....\\" Do any seven words in all the world of music convey as much as these? By the time the second verse comes around you realize that John has drawn you into a surreal world seducing you into contemplating your innermost thoughts on journalism, nationialistic pride, imperialism, death and the plain old daily grind. The thing that I find most striking about this is that he does it all while casually having his morning coffee and combing his hair.
B000001ES9|2.0|There is nothing about this album that would give a listener any indication as to what Rush would become. Horrible and typical crotch-rock (ie stupid) lyrics and a derivative hard rock sound reminicent of Zeppelin among others is what you'll find here. And while it's true that Alex Lifeson rocks out like on few other Rush albums (which makes this a 2 rather than 1 star album), the almost total lack of original or creative compositions make RUSH an album to get only if you're a completist. If you want to hear some of the songs from this album I'd get the live album All The Worlds A Stage. It has the best songs from the debut but with Neil Peart's drumming. Original drummer John Rutsey left after this album and Neil Peart joined for the next one, Fly By Night, and what a difference! Neil's drumming and intelligent lyrics gave Rush an huge boost, inspiring the band to reach unforseen creative heights. It doesn't sound like the same band, it's so much better. As for their debut album, I'd avoid it unless you've just got to have everything Rush ever put out.
0689865384|5.0|Every so often there's a book that sets itself apart from the rest and teaches you an undeniably good lesson. This book is one of them.
B000001FS6|5.0|Of all of U2's peak-era works, this album takes the bulk of the critical punches and I just don't get it.  No it's not Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, nor is it supposed to be.  Someone once described this as U2's \\"White Album\\" and I think that pretty well sums it up.  I mean honestly, who really wants to listen to \\"Piggies\\" or \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" again and again?  But these tracks give the Beatles' legendary sprawling double-disc masterpiece its unique and very human character.  As do the mis-steps that appear here.<br /><br />For all the complaining over the album's pretentiousness, this flaw comes through to a much stronger degree on the video than it does on the sound recording.  A few spoken intos by Bono here and there, but really these are small things.  And the weak tracks are outnumbered by some strong, even stunning performances.  Desire, Hawkmoon 269, Pride, Angel of Harlem, Love Rescue Me, Bullet the Blue Sky and All I Want is You are knockout performances that deserve acclaim and appreciation.  The use of horn charts and rootsy rhythms display U2's restlessness and creativity, even if these sounds were never to grace another U2 disc.  The rest of the tracks range from quite good (When Love Comes to Town) to charmingly weak (Van Diemen's Land), but never detract from the album's overall mood.  Overall the atmosphere is confident, spiritual and fun- yes a bit pompous but worse things have happened.<br /><br />Ultimately this disc's variety was a necessary predecessor to Actung Baby's focus.  U2 stretched out a bit too far, and decided to re-evaluate.  But what is documented here is a testament to this band's uncompromising spirit, energy, and willingness to experiment even at the risk of upsetting the critical bandwagon that had previously been afixed squarely to the band's collective backside.  And it sounds far more challenging than anything the band has released for the past few years.  A personal favorite and a meaningful listening experience.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|Into the Blue succeeds in showing off Alba and Walker, but it fails miserably as a movie about buried treasure.  The buried treasure seems to only be there to make the movie a little interesting.  The main focus is about the cocaine they find near the shipwreck and how much of a mess things get because of the greedy characters Scott Caan and Ashley Scott play.  It's all pretty shallow for a flick that takes place on the ocean (yeah, I meant that pun).    If you're looking for a buried treasure movie you're better off going with Pirates of the Caribbean, Goonies or Cuttthroat Island.  At least those movies fulfill the treasure hunter aspect.    This movie had beautiful scenery, but there was just something missing.  I can't stand annoying characters added to cause chaos.  And look what happened when Ashley Scott died, they shrugged it off like it was nothing.  Gah.
1400032717|5.0|Who is this young wise author that creates characters that are so lovingly real - with strengths and flaws that make you smile to see life in a new way. Haddon writes about an autistic teenage boy - normally a character difficult to tolerate much less feel great affection for, and has you caring about him in an incredible way. The story is painful, joyful, harrowing, and a beautiful lesson in true humanism. A very special book - loved it!
055380457X|2.0|This reads like a long paper compiled by an earnest and industrious high-schooler for extra credit, and published knowing that for a little while longer it is enough for a book to put a white cover and a Google logo around a shallowly adequate corporate history that it would take the reader longer to piece together from scattered sources themselves. As storytelling, journalism, analysis or entertainment it is uniformly undistinguished, and it will be a toss-up whether it is rendered moot more quickly by other more thoughtful books or the simple passage of time.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|whoever has negative things to say about this movie i really can't understand it.  The story is original and captivating, the acting is above average, there is plenty of action and suspense, and it is not predictable at all.  Overall this is a must-see movie for anyone i think.  Again, one of the better movies you will see in a while.
B000002UA0|5.0|If you're expecting this album to be ANYTHING like DSotM, WYWH, The Wall, and especially The Final Cut, you're going to have to change your expectations drastically, because the band who made those albums is not the same band who put out \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\".      You won't find any huge concept about a rock star who isolates himself and builds a \\"wall\\" here, instead you'll find Syd Barrett talking about his clan of gingerbread men and mice who don't have homes.  Weird, huh?  Yes.  Brilliant?  Most definitely.  This is the epitome of 60's psychedelia, and only one of the great psychedelic rock albums released in '67 (the others being \\"Are You Experienced?\\", \\"Disraeli Gears\\", \\"Satanic Majesty\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Forever Changes\\", \\"The Doors\\" and \\"VU and Nico\\").      Syd seemed to like childhood ditties, but since this album is filtered through LSD-induced lyrics, it makes them seem a bit...nightmarish.  This is NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING, like later Floyd, and it's not supposed to be.  My favorite songs on this album include \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Matilda Mother\\", \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", and \\"Bike\\".  The only weak songs on here are \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" and the second half of \\"Pow R. Toch\\".    The band never recaptured what they had with this album; the band's next album, \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\", was stellar but not nearly as brilliant as \\"Piper\\".

0307276902|3.0|A Million Little Pieces starts of well. Frey uses the language the way he uses everything else..with rebellious disregard for rules.This works well in describing the early days of detox....disjointed, confusing, wordsandthoughtsstrungtogether.I enjoyed the first half of the book and then the language seemed repetitive and contrived. Frey's central argument seems to me to be against the philosophy of the twelve steps. He also has disdain for anyone who doesn't think like he does, with an automatic rejection of every idea that is not original.The Tao Te Ching is a belief system,also, but Frey swallows that quite easily, this time around. Frey claims that the people in the meetings are addicted to the meetings, but he has traded in his addiction to self-destruction for an addiction to narcissism and self-approval. By the end of the book, I just wanted to get it over with. A good little read if David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\" is too weighty,as it would be for most. Ironically, Frey has no problem with the Oprah stamp of approval. Perhaps that is why he doesn't need a Higher Power. If he had read further in the Big Book, he would, ironically, have come across a little phrase by Herbert Spencer about contempt prior to investigation. Perhaps he is no longer in everlasting ignorance,and it doesn't much matter to me how he got well, I'm glad that he did. It is a story of redemption to be sure but I just wonder why he so adamantly rejects any idea that does not come from himself or from someone of whom he approves.He is a bit of an elitist, though he claims not to judge. In any case, let's not be too hasty with the literary awards just yet.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I have been a huge Mayer fan ever since watching Any Given Thursday.  I def. disagree with everyone in here saying he is not a good guitar player.  I've seen him in concert myself and have watched his playing closely.  This guy can jam, however, with this CD came my hopes that the rest of the world would see him the same way.  But, in my mind he didn't do very well.  I like all the songs, but the songs that he really gets down on are all the cover songs such as Wait Until Tomorrow and Out of My Mind.  So, my hopes of him creating his own great blues music was shot down.  I saw the Trio tour and thought it was amazing, but i expected much more.  I thought this CD and tour would begin to lift him up into a list with SRV, Hendrix, Clapton, Cray, and many other blues guitarists because he has the potential, but he just didn't make it.  Hopefully as he gets older more attitude comes out in his songs and the riffs start becoming more bluesy. Covered In Rain still remains his best song lyrically and instrumentally.  I hoped one of the new songs would replace this, but they didn't.  JM still has great potential though so don't crack the guitar skills.  The vocals need work, but he may be able to pull that off as well.
0307276902|4.0|When a friend handed this book to me I was already reading something else. But, bored on the train journey home, I decided to read just the first page.  <br /> <br />I missed my stop. I've never tried hard drugs and this book was a million miles away from anything I could relate to but it transported me to another world and made fascinating, if not disturbing, reading.  <br /> <br />I did feel it was slightly over-long however. We didn't need to know what he had for breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day! And I wonder if some of it has been embelished. I find it hard to believe Frey's mother, who clearly cares a great deal about him, would abandon him to travel with his father just as they were making progress.  <br /> <br />Worse, would his brother really drive him to a bar, give him money and then disappear to play a casual game of pool? I can only think this part is exaggerated for dramatic effect, and Frey actually went to the bar alone. Notwithstanding, I think  <br /> <br />Frey is extraordinary. Ignoring the professionals' advice, he turned his life around his own way despite the 'million-to-one' odds. And the fact that he takes full responsibility for his actions is admirable, even when offered a reason for his addictive behaviour.  <br /> <br />Underneath the tough exterior, Frey is a really decent guy. His appreciation for the small things, such as a borrowed jacket, or books sent from his brother are some of the most moving parts of the story. This book made me laugh and cry (in public!!) <br /> <br />

B000BW7QWW|3.0|Serenity is an extension of the Firefly TV series that was cancelled despite a rabid fan base.<br /><br />I never saw the series but the movie is right in line with classic scifi of the fifties. Characters and situations will be familiar to readers of Theodore Sturgeon, Jack Vance, Issac Asimov, etc.<br /><br />The one problem with the movie is a glaring internal logic error familiar to watchers of TV series, where they think no one remembers anything from commercial break to commercial break. this is the character of Summer, the 17-year-old psychic. It is revealed here that she is the product of conditioning, it seems on the world Miranda. At first it seems that she becomes a deadly fighting machine when triggered by a series of visual commands. She is turned off by an aural command her brother knows, having infiltrated the training base where his sister was housed. So far so good, and for most of the movie, this internal logic is followed. But at the end of the movie the Serenity goes to Miranda, and neither Summer nor her brother seem to know anything about the planet or its structures nor do they say anything interesting (like \\"this is where I lived\\"). Then, in the climatic fight scene, Summer just stands up, says \\"Now it's my turn\\", and goes out and fights all the bad guys, turning on and off her fighting skills at will. Sorry, you can't have it both ways, either her powers are out of her control or they're not. Either Miranda has meaning for her, or it hasn't. Brought down the movie for me, which otherwise was very good indeed.
B00005JOFO|3.0|<br />Okay, I went to see this 'gay cowboy movie'. I'll compare it with another Western I saw this year - AN UNFINISHED LIFE. First the good - this film is beautifully shot. You'll enjoy the scenery of the mountain locations, and Ang Lee even makes Texas attractive. The acting is good- there may be some Academy nominations for the leads. The sexual couplings are graphic but not pornographic, along with the language and some violence, earning the R rating.  <br /> <br />The story and setting is also very true to mid-20th-century rural life. The braggadicio, poverty, social strictures and prejudices are all there. These characters live on the knife-edge of patriotism, straight-laced religion and rebellion from it, and all the soul-shattering hypocrisy that results. And it's very 'white' - minorities are relegated to the periphery. Having lived through a similar upbringing it all rang uncomfortably true. <br /> <br />But unlike UNFINISHED LIFE, there are no lessons learned here. No forgiveness given. No reconciliation - just the spectacle of social norms broken and lives ruined all around. If you think this is anti-gay bias, do what I did - Substitute a female for one of the male leads, and you'll see this is one of several 'love affair' movies like AMERICAN BEAUTY that detail the desperation of loveless marriages and the devastation that follows from straying from them. The love depicted here may be 'true', but it is also VERY selfish, just as all extramarital affairs are. Watch the look on one wife's face as she realizes the truth. See her pain! The director does a very good job of detailing this tragedy.

0679422714|1.0|All you have to do is tell them what they want to hear.  They are really no different in this regard from the masses in any other part of the world.    This book is a compilation of vitriolic polemics against someone Chang hates intensely, and it shows through between the lines.  But it matters not to the ill-informed Americans (remember, these are the same people of whom more than 50% still believe Saddam Hussein did 9/11).    It is unfortunate that sloppy research and personal grudge pass as scholarship, and the clueless Americans swallow it whole.
B000000W3G|5.0|I would like to start off this review by saying this; unfortunately, I do not own an actual, manufactured copy of The Aeroplane Flies High.  Seeing as the box set is no longer commercially available (it went out of print in 1996, the year that it was released), and the price for used/new copies is very high indeed, I just don't have the money. <br />     Although this box set is worth $169.00, I'm just too cheap to buy it.  How did I get the music contained in this set?  The library.   <br />     The Aeroplane Flies High was compiled from the leftovers of the Pumpkins magnificent double album, &lt;Mellon Collie.  The five discs that are in this series are the five singles that were released from Mellon Collie (Bullet With Butterfly Wings, 1979, Zero, Tonight, Tonight, Thirty-Three).  The five CD's are packaged as if you bought them as singles.  They still are the singles, but they were extended; tracks were added on, and they became a series of five EP's. <br />     This box set is a perfect example of the intertwinement of Corgan's and Iha's musical brilliance.  These \\"b-sides\\" are all great songs, but once you listen to them, you begin to see why they never made the final cut of the double-album.  They just don't fit with the rest of the tracks. <br />     Here is what you should do if you're low on money, like myself: 1)reserve a copy of this at your local library; 2) Once it arrives, take it home and put the music onto your computer; 3) Pop each EP into your stereo and enjoy!
0060005696|4.0|This book is a worthwhile read. It defines the problem of too much choice and offers some ways to deal with it. Delineating the difference between \\"maximizers\\" and \\"satisficers\\" gave me a new frame of reference for determining decision making processes. Although this book is geared toward the life of the individual I think the principals in the book can be applied to many business situations. I have to admit I was waiting for him to make the point that the government needs to regulate the number of choices we have - he never does (thankfully).
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has produced another great book on a significant American political figure.  As in some of her previous works, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln provides a study in uncommon leadership.  This book is an easy read, it is a fun read, and it provides new information on one of the greatest Presidents in American history.  Not only is the book good, the audio book is exceptional.  Persons interested in leadership, early American politics, and the life of Abraham Lincoln would do well to purchase this book.
0307276902|1.0|This book seems like complete fiction -and bad fiction at that. I'm stunned that Oprah's group didn't do any research - no airline would let this guy on the plane covered in vomit and blood. No rehab facility would let meals be catered, patients gamble to televised football games nor, especially, let one of the patients lead a counselor into a crackhouse in search of a patient that left the facility.  James Frey is a failed screenwriter that came up with his best dose of fiction and a lot of desperate people bought it. Funny how the \\"people\\" or should I say \\"characters\\" that could have exposed him are all dead. I doubt that any really existed, particulary \\"Leonard\\" the mobster who says the author is the toughest kid he'd ever met. Pure, awful, dangerous fiction.
B0002S943O|5.0|I just purchased this DVD and I cannot believe I haven't bought this sooner.   <br /> <br />I bought the Paris '01 DVD a few years ago.  While the Paris DVD is good... Devotional absolutely BLOWS the Paris show out of the water.  Dave sounds awesome on this DVD because he doesn't over-extend himself like he does on Paris.  He just lets the sound flow... and he sounds great.  The song selection on this disc is fabulous. <br /> <br /> <br />Higher Love - The best intro to any DM concert I have seen.  <br /> <br />Behind the Wheel - The energy of the crowd when this song is played is something else.   <br /> <br />Condemnation - I have found a new love for this song after hearing it live on this DVD.  Dave hits every note perfectly.  The version he did of this song on Paris PALES in comparison to this DVD.   <br /> <br />Stripped - Best visuals for the entire concert during this song <br /> <br />I Feel You - The first time a drumset was introduced during a live DM concert was for this song.  Hearing those live drums go off is a memory I will never forget <br /> <br />Rush - Another song that sounds much better live <br /> <br /> <br />The two bonus tracks of Halo and Policy of Truth are both excellent.  I can't believe these were left off the original VHS.   <br /> <br /> <br />I can't say enough of this DVD.  The visual extras are real cool.  The SOFAD videos are nice as well (even though I already had them with Singles 86>98 DVD).  <br /> <br /> <br />Maybe I am a bit biased because the Devotional Tour was my first DM concert (I also saw Devotional Summer Leg, Exciter , and Touring the Angel tours).   <br /> <br />But trust me when I say BUY THIS DVD! <br /> <br />
B00005V4O5|5.0|I, like other reviewers here, didn't fully grasp this album at first. It was different, and therefore intriguing. But after about 7 or 8 listens, I filed it away in my CD case, not ever really \\"getting it.\\" <br /> <br />Fast-forward roughly a year. After finally getting tired of Spocks Beard and Dream Theater, I was hungry for something new. I decided to flip through my CD collection, and re-discovered POS Remedy Lane, and am I ever glad that I did! Remedy Lane has given me a renewed enthusiam for progressive rock.   <br /> <br />A few years back I was talking with a friend of mine, who is a very talented musician, about prog rock, and how Dream Theater was my favorite band. His opinion of DT was that they are a very talented band, but that their music lacked EMOTION. I didn't understand what he was talking about...until Remedy Land reached inside me and started pulling emotions and feelings out of me that I didn't realize were there. <br /> <br />To sum it up...what I have come to find with great albums, \\"masterpieces\\" as some would label them, is that on the first 3 or 4 listens, you find yourself saying things such as \\"what is this stuff?\\" or \\"man, what were they thinking?\\" But after some time passes, and you give the album a few more listens, it dawns on you that you have truly come across a \\"masterpiece.\\" Kind of weird how it works, isn't it? <br /> <br />This new masterpiece that I have discovered is called \\"Remedy Lane,\\" and it was just the \\"remedy\\" that I needed to cure my \\"progrock burn-out\\" blues. It is an emotional journey that I will continue to enjoy for years to come.
B000777J2S|4.0|I thought I was extremely cool when I picked up my Antony and the Johnsons CD.  The album's slate of guest artists alone is a who's who of New York indie chic, Devendra Banhart, Joan Wasser, Rufus Wainwright, Lou Reed, etc.  Then I realized that everyone else in the world liked them and my fondness for this band wasn't so unique  afterall.  Nevertheless, I still like them (or should I say \\"him,\\" since Antony is the star of the star).  I like this album because it isn't anchored down to a typical formula.  Antony describes himself as a collage artist, and I agree with that assessment.  The melodies are absolutely nothing new and taken at face value probably sound trite; they're merely scraps, and the power is not in the individual scraps but in the total collective effect that all these scraps interlaced together have.  This is especially apparent on \\"Fistful of Love\\" which uses one of the most infuriatingly overused chord progressions in modern music.  But in Antony's complex approach to music, the chord progression is merely the means to an end.  The buildup of horns and clarinets and the lyrics create the true effect.  As such, \\"Fistful of Love\\" is one of the most moving tracks I've ever heard.  It has reduced me to tears before.  The album as a whole is incredibly cohesive.  Songs are simultaneously to-the-point yet magnificently layered and complex.  Lyrically, the album is about the tortured identity of a gay man, yet Antony avoids overt references to homosexuality, so there is a much more transcedentant, universally human pain to the album that defies easy labeling as a \\"gay album.\\"  Overall, a very formidable unique work.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Amazon should not post a release date for this dvd until the day after they recieve the first shipment and place it in stock.  I am a lifelong fan. I was at 2 of the 3 foxboro shows in 1994. I have upgraded my home theatre system 2 times in 4 years waiting for this dvd. I am not getting any younger...what is the problem????!!!!   <br /> <br />    Amazon want's it releasesd so they don't have to listen to us wine anymore.  EMI wants it released because there is money to be made... lots of money. Pulse will easily be the best selling music dvd ever grossing hundreds of millions.  I am sure the band does not enjoy teasing their fans like this.. dangling a carrot and then ripping it away. This is not like them.  <br /> <br />    Maybe the outcry over the 4:3 aspect ratio has them trying to add a widesreen format or even an hd-dvd format. Not likely. Maybe the production company in charge is utterly innept.  Not likely either.  I think that with so much money at stake, the dvd is tied up in court.  Over half of the show is Roger's intellectual property. He is entitled to a share of the revenues generated by such property and the sticking point is how much.  It seems like they had a deal negotiated but it fell through  at the last minute. This is all speculative in the absense of any explaination at all for cancelling the release. Who is to blame for this.....who else.... LAWERS.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Degrading and down right horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book that has Keanu Reeves of all people playing the role of supernatural troubleshooter John Constantine, who with the help of a cop (played by Rachel Weisz) tries to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world. The script first off is so badly written that you can see the expressions on the actor's facese that they themselves can't believe on the things that they are made to say. The story makes absolutely no sense what so ever and it manages to go against itself in certain parts of the film and the climax literally destroys the entire film with one of the worse plot twist in recent memory. The direction lacks focus and certain scenes either go no where in terms of furthering the story along or are just so badly put together that you have no idea of what is going on from time to time. The acting is not very good either, with Keanu Reeves not only degrading the role of John Constantine with his stare into space demeanor but he manages to make it into a poor mans version of Dirty Harry with the delivery of his lines. He is either trying to channel Clint Eastwood into his performance or a he's a very slow adult who is the butt of a very cruel joke by the studio who made this film. The only decent piece of acting in this film comes from Rachel Weisz who gives way too much talent and grace with a performance that is way too deep and complex for a film that is this poorly made. Her haunting performance could have been the basis of a much better and complex horror movie and that would have been a film that I would have liked to have seen other than the train wreck that is this film.  <br /> <br />My one star goes to Rachel Weisz only.   <br />
B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith brings to the screen the story of a couple who after having spent 5 or 6 years (depending on who you ask) as husband and wife, they realize that they are not who they seem to be...  <br />The film does bring to mind True Lies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis; it combines romance, action and adventure making it highly enjoyable. <br />Needless to say, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!), but it's Vince Vaughn that really steals the show for me! <br />The only major setbacks are in relation to:  <br />1) Why is the wife's bureau made up exclusively of women?  <br />2) The poor choice of an actor to play \\"the Tank,\\" who is not all man, if you catch my drift... Any particular reason for that? <br />Aside from that, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful! <br />Overall, even though Mr. & Mrs. Smith lacks that extra something to put it over the top, it is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.   <br />

B000BW7QWW|5.0|The intro established the situation clearly enough that I could follow though I never saw Firefly. I don't watch that much TV.          So much was then introduced so quickly that I had to assume it would be explained further on and just go along with it. It was and it worked, as the presentation did make me want to get that explanation. On board ship, I immediately felt the connection to the Millenium Falcon. I was quite happy to spend some time with the fringe element, far from the bridgedeck. Now what's going on in those terraformed worlds? Wouldn't it be interesting to see how many ways that might turn out?         No bad make-up or improbable costuming...believable is good. The action flows well-the pace is quick and stunts are smooth; yet, there's room for spurts of decent dialogue to advance the plot and create some depth of character. Granted, in this amount of time, many are still a 'cartoon', i.e., a quick study.          The extras do give a bit of background. I will have to see more of Firefly on DVD, as I gather that depth was being developed there. How on earth did this NOT make it on TV?

0307276902|5.0|<br /> <br />I'm a little bothered by those who don't think this is a great book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />While I did not particularly enjoy the dental scenes, I did like the way frey writes and I do think he is talented. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The story is harrowing and insightful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />If you're looking for an \\"easy\\" fun read--this isn't it.  But if you want something truly original I can only highly recommend this book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the books:  East of Eden and the novel Catch 22. <br /> <br /> <br />A Million Little pieces would make a wonderful gift anytime of the year! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this great novel! <br />
1401207138|5.0|I first started reading Watchmen when the second issue came out. I had a summer job a few blocks from a comics store, and I would pass by every afternoon on my way to the bus stop. I was looking for the late issue of Dark Knight or the new Superman or GI Joe, and somehow I stumbled on Watchmen.<br /><br />I could pour over each issue for a month until the next one arrived. What is going on? How are the different threads connected? What does it mean? Three or four years ago, I cleaned up and moved my old comics collection and reread my old issues of Watchmen. It captured me the same way.<br /><br />Today, I see the same fascination with inscrutability in my friends' arguments over the week's Lost episode. I just watched Lost on DVD a couple of weeks ago; the whole season in about two weeks. Not bad, but it certainly didn't spark the same level of interest. I feel the same about Absolute Watchmen. It looks gorgeous, and the additional background material is very interesting. But I couldn't dive into reading it like the old issues. I wonder, when the mood next strikes me, am I going to read this big book or am I going to dig out the old, worn issues?
0385504209|1.0|The popularity of this book would leave me speechless if I were the type to become speechless at the human race's endless ability to enjoy tripe served up on a flashily painted tin plate thinly disguised as gold.<br /><br />The notion of a literary thriller peppered with arcane clues and historical mysteries sounded enthralling. I received the book as a gift from a friend who had read some highly favourable reviews of the book. Alas! Not two pages into the novel, I was shaking my head and muttering, \\"What on earth? This is supposed to be a book of literary merit?\\"<br /><br />Let's be clear: \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has no literary merit. Its chapters are short (in some cases, two pages long - you know you're in for something rudimentary and melodramatic when the chapters are this short); its vocabulary is largely monosyllabic and excessively simple; its characters are stock and written without any depth whatsoever; its plot is a rehashing of old dishes of conspiracy theorists the world over; its mysteries are ludicrously contrived and so simple a child could see through them; it owes much of its ideas to \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\" (a non-fiction book which is actually fiction, written by three men who unfortunately prefer the Rennes-le-Château hoax to the reality - but at least their book contains more originality than this dreadful novel!) and other sources; its situations are gasp, shock, horror, oh dear, BLAND beyond conceiving...<br /><br />What really sets the seal on this conglomeration of badly written material is that the author, Dan Brown, actually believes the nonsense he has written. At least half of the book's appeal has been (as you can see when you read some of the reviews below) the concept that this is all true; that a massive conspiracy has been in place, perpetrated naturally by that favourite modern villain, the Catholic church.<br /><br />If you're one of those convinced that there really is a secret society called the Priory of Sion, please do check the legitimate historical sources. The book by Putnam and Wood, called \\"Treasures of Rennes-le-Chateau\\" (pardon the absence of the accent mark - Amazon does terrible things with them!), sets the record straight; or just check Paul Smith's website, or the extremely thorough article at [...], which gives references, links and the irrefutable evidence that shows just how thoroughly debunked the matter is.<br /><br />If you are convinced that Opus Dei really is an evil Catholic organisation whose members include albino assassins and which advocates self-flagellation, check their website - you'll understand why Opus Dei is taken aback and offended by its ridiculous portrayal in the novel.<br /><br />If you truly believe that Dan Brown is correct in saying the figure of John in the painting referred to in the book is actually Mary Magdalene, you should check a good history of art; you'll learn that John is typically portrayed as a youngster - NOT A WOMAN, but as a beardless youth. This is simply how he is seen in Renaissance and later painting. To concoct a Mary Magdalene story out of that is... well, let's call it<br /><br />inartistic licence.<br /><br />If you think Dan Brown is right in claiming that the Mona Lisa is a self-portrait by Da Vinci, take a proper look at the substantiated, authentic history of the painting. The model is known, and surprise, surprise... it's not Da Vinci at all. It's actually a woman.<br /><br />None of this would matter so much in a novel (which is, after all, supposed to take liberties with facts!) if it were not for Dan Brown's own claim that much of what he wrote is NOT fiction... but fact.<br /><br />The recent debacle of the court case (Dan Brown vs the authors of Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, aka Henry Lincoln et al) in which Dan Brown was forced to admit that, although he claimed to have done intense research for the book, it's a case of \\"I left the research up to my wife, actually\\", demonstrates how shallow the actual research was. We can't really dignify it by the word \\"research\\" - not with Mr Brown actually believing the misinformation was legitimate and true.<br /><br />Some people have called this book a page-turner. Some have said that, well, it's not great literature, but it's a fascinating book, and they couldn't put it down.<br /><br />What can I say to this? I found the book a chore to read. I read it ONLY because it was a gift, and because I was grimly determined to finish it, hand it back to the friend who'd given it to me, and say, \\"Now it's your turn to read this.\\" She read it... and couldn't stop apologising all the way through, because it didn't take her many pages to realise the book was a thin, shallow, poorly written work with ridiculous characterisation.<br /><br />Its popularity must be due to its very clever marketing, to the love human beings have for an arcane mystery (especially when it's a mystery and conspiracy theory that declares Christianity is terribly deceived, the Church (capitalised as all good villains are) has been holding back \\"The Truth\\", and a secret society filled with luminaries through the ages has been handing on the bright flame of what REALLY happened), and to the inexplicable liking many people have for poorly written novels. I enjoy novels that are purely genre fiction as well - but there's just NOTHING of substance in the style of this book. Not even as escapist fiction does it work for me.<br /><br />The so-called codes or clues of the novel sounded like such a good idea, but Dan Brown clearly has no conception of the purpose of encryption. The clues are just silly; the encryption laughable (how could anyone forget the atrocious mirror-writing clue?); and the whole thing a badly cobbled-together series of one meaningless clue to another. This makes no sense at all; it makes ludicrous the very employment of encryption in the first place.<br /><br />If you're expecting a high quality novel, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting well-developed characters, you will be disappointed. If you are expecting original ideas, you will be disappointed. In fact... for what WOULD you hope when reading this? If you want some easy and not-too-demanding entertainment, try the thrillers of Tom Clancy; John Grisham; Jonathan Kellerman; Agatha Christie; Ngaio Marsh; Alistair MacLean; Ellis Peters; and so on.<br /><br />If you want something richer but also using the idea of historical mysteries, read Neal Donaldson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\", Umberto Eco's \\"Name of the Rose\\" or \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", or Arturo Perez-Reverte's \\"The Dumas Club\\" instead... unless you truly wish to swim in the murky mud of Dan Brown's badly researched imagination.wn actually believing the misinformation was legitimate and true.

B000002H97|5.0|Anyone who bashes this album needs to have their head examined. The \\"Black Album\\" is a turning point in the history of rock music. Rarely has a such a hyped up album lived up to the billing. Granted, the hits such as Sandman, Sad But True and Nothing Else Matters are played out by FM Radio. However, the album never stops delivering. The production of this album is flawless. I maintain that if Justice was recorded the same way this album was, it would be regarded as the best Metallica album in the catalog. Besided the hits, the album has underappreciated tracks such as \\"Of Wolf and Man\\", \\"God that Failed\\" and \\"Holier than Thou\\". If you want to get into Metallica, this is the first stop.

This album definitely shows how much SOAD has improved throughout their career. But oh, I forgot! SOAD has always been good! <br /> <br />1. Attack-10/10: Good beginner to the album. The ending is very heavy. <br />2. Dreaming-9/10: Good song! This song has fast verses and a slow chorus. A great mix! <br />3. Kill Rock n' Roll-10/10: Cool song! One of the best songs on the album! <br />4. Hypnotize-10/10: Very good song! A powerful song with a good message. <br />5. Stealing Society-8/10: Cool song! I love the guitar riffs in the beginning of this song! <br />6. Tentative-8/10: Good song! Like Dreaming, this song has fast verses(with wonderful guitar riffs) and a slow chorus. Once again, a great mix! <br />7. U Fig-10/10: Awesome! Crazy, heavy verses with a fast-paced chorus! <br />8. Holy Mountains-10/10: Like many other people, when I hear this song, I am reminded of Aerials. This song is just as good as Aerials, maybe even better. A heavy, slow and fast-paced song. I like this song. <br />9. Vicinity of Obscenity-10/10: I LOVE THIS SONG! This song is heavy and very fast-paced. One of SOAD's craziest and funniest songs ever! This song will make you jump up and down! A great mosh pit song! <br />10. She's Like Heroin- 8/10: Funny song! Not very heavy, but it's still a pretty good song. <br />11. Lonely Day- 10/10: Wonderful! A great song! One of the best songs on the album! <br />12. Soldier Side-12/10: This song concludes the Soldier Side Intro from Mezmerize. An amazing conclusion! This song is one of the best songs that I have ever heard! So emotional, so sad, so powerful this song is! Best song on the album, and one of the best SOAD songs ever! This song ends beautifully with a heavy, powerful conclusion, stating the words from the Soldier Side Intro. This song definetly has Grammy potential. I hope SOAD makes a music video for Soldier Side. <br /> <br />This album is wonderful! Hypnotize definetly has Grammy potential! The only set-back to this album is this. Mezmerize sounded a little more original than Hypnotize. I don't think it matters though. Hypnotize is better than Mezmerize and is one the best rock albums out there. Buy Hypnotize today!

B0001O3YEE|4.0|I have to start by saying that I saw the Chronicles of Riddick before I saw Pitch Black, so I already knew the character of the anti-hero protagonist in both stories. That said, I'm happy I did, because Pitch Black comes off as your everyday space horror that attempted to steal some of the success that the Alien movies had. The stand out in this movie is the main character, Riddick, and how true the writers kept that character through-out the story. You had your expectations for Riddick, and he goes just a little beyond them while never actually disappointing or become predictable.<br /><br />The story begins like most sci-fi movies, that being a view of the galaxy to let us know that this is a sci-fi movie. Soon after, though, the ship that all the characters are traveling in hits a small asteroid belt that tears the hull apart, and they are forced to crash land on a planet with three suns and a never-ending desert. Oh, and with strange creatures that hate the light, but these come later, after we understand what's going on with Riddick and the crew of unfortunate survivors that become his prey.<br /><br />When finally they do come, though, a sort of understanding comes between the other characters and Riddick, and they realize that they must get off the planet soon. Thus starts the heart-pounding run across the desert landscape to an abandoned ship. All the while, character infighting threatens to separate them, and does in some cases. By the end it becomes both a fight for survival and a fight to retain one's morals. The ending is obvious, somebody has to escape, but it's who ends up escaping that is the surprise.<br /><br />Another thing that separates this movie from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't even try to present a strange, alien world. In fact, you barely ever see the aliens that are in this story, and they are actually presented more as beasts than intelligent creatures. There are no made-up races of strange looking creatures (like Star Wars) or the never ending stream of humanoid, bipedal aliens (like Star Trek) that gets monotonous. This movie presents its own ideas on sci-fi, and does so successfully.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie, and its sequel, to anyone tired of Star Wars or Star Trek (I was never a really big fan myself). Its new ideas are refreshing. I'd also recommend this movie to horror fans who liked Aliens, as it has some similar moments. But most of all, I'd recommend this movie to writers or young screenwriters, as it has one of the best, well-written characters ever created in Riddick.s) or the never ending stream of humanoid, bipedal aliens (like Star Trek) that gets monotonous.

0307276902|3.0|This is a pretty entertaining book - and an easy read. BUT, there are lots of parts that do not at all ring true. Besides the plane, dentist, and other assorted obvious lies, the scene where Leonard convinces him to stay in treatment for 24 more hours seems very fictional. The dialogue is pure literature, not real life; I mean nobody really talks like this! <br /> <br />I think it's fine that Frey wrote an entertaining book that may provide some insights into addiction, but why sell it as non-fiction?
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I won't (and can't) add to the other 700+ positive reviews here.  Suffice it to say that for nearly 40 years, I have been a fan of Batman in comics and on screen, and for the first time ever, I feel someone (namely director Christopher Nolan, writer David Goyer, and actor Christian Bale) have brought the character that I have loved for so long to full three-dimensional life.  Someone finally GOT it. <br /> <br />As much as I liked Michael Keaton's take on Batman, THIS is the definitive version.  The previous four movies were, as Bale's Bruce Wayne would say, \\"practice\\". <br /> <br />Nolan takes a huge chance in spending a full hour of screen time introducing us to Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne.  We don't even see Batman until nearly halfway through the movie.  But this chance pays off in spades, because by the time Batman appears with his full costume and equipment, we are fully invested in his character, his motives, and his techniques, and we are 100% rooting for him to start kicking some a$$.   <br /> <br />(Let's face it: it's pretty much ridiculous for a guy to dress up in a bat costume to fight crime.  But the brilliance in this movie is that it not only convinces you that this scenario is possible, but that if you were in Bruce Wayne's shoes and you had access to all of his resources, you would not only want to do it but HAVE to do it.) <br /> <br />I have watched this movie a half dozen times and I have seen more in it every time.  It's beautifully written and acted by all.  All I can say is that if you have been put off by the previous four Batman movies or the campy TV series, give this movie a chance.  It really IS what Batman is all about. <br /> <br />
B00004Z400|5.0|i would first like to start off with a few things. If you are a piss-n-vinegar metal eletist then this CD isnt for you. Well, it kind of is, seeing as how it might snap you out of the \\"slayer is the only real reason to live\\" mentality, but if you're in too deep in that mentality, then this CD will fall on deaf ears. This CD has heavy, distorted guitars on all songs but one, but it isnt metal, per say. All of the riffs (with the exception of one here and there) show more of a dense sense of loss than a tough sense of rage. This is an incredible CD and is defidently up to the standards of innovation that the Deftones set with their prior CD, the extremely heavy with little let up Adrenaline, and their self titled CD that followed this, that has some extremely brutal songs tempered with very sad and soft songs, and some that have balls but are emotionally vague. But this CD, White Pony, is extreme in a sense that it is melodically extremely sad and dense. Heavy guitars, in most peopple's heads don't go well with sad songs, but if you listen to the songs on here (as well as Re Arranged and Boiler by Limp Bizkit) then you will realize that they can work out in the context of a soft song. <br /> <br />anyway <br /> <br />This CD is the soundtrack to a quick emotional decline. It isn't nearly as sad or \\"I've Hit the Bottom\\"-y as other CD's(Amnesiac by Radiohead is a good example), but it is a document of a decent sized bit of the trip down. The CD is full of big, wide texture in the form of innovative guitar sounds and keyboard sounds. It starts off with \\"Back To School\\" which has ugly, mean riffing in the verses followed by a dense, \\"inside I feel black\\" version of a Deftones groove. Actually, this whole song has that \\"inside I feel black\\"(not racially, but spiritually) and the feeling is really dense, and the song does come up for air from that feeling a little bit when Chino sings the \\"so transpose/and stop you lies\\" towards the end, but it doesn't stay above sea levelfor long. The rest of the CD feels like dropping to your knees in sadness in a really crowded public area but everyone around you doesn't notice you and just walks on by you. Not that i've done that, but you get the point. It is personal and emotional devestation but not at the most overbearing extreme that it could get, but is such a fantastic snapshot of one who has lost their way in a world that won't help them out. The whole CD, especially Pink Maggit, Knife Party, and Korea has that \\"I feel spiritually black inside\\" feel to them. Other songs, like Rx Queen and Digital bath, reflect on the hope you once had in the fact that good things get fixed that isn't there anymore. The only songs i feel on here are out of place is Feiticeira, because it isn't heavy enough to hang with the other heavy songs in the Deftones, as is Street Carp. They aren't necessarily bad songs, but they don't fit on this CD with mostly dense/sad songs. <br /> <br />there is one important thing i have to say about this though. If you love this CD, then scoop up the self titled debut by Team Sleep. Team Sleep is Chino's 100 percent soft second band that has stuff just as amazing on this CD, but from a totally different perspective. There is fantastic, uncliched  and inventive guitar playing, great drumming, fantastic use of atmospheres and keys, great use of beats, and Chino is doing amazing things on it. White Pony is more stripped down and emotinally sad than Team Sleep. Most of Team Sleep's songs are upbeat and very layered and not stripped down. There is a song called Live From The Stage that could be at home on White Pony though, so it all ties together. White Pony is a fantastic CD. If you wanna hear an uncliched and brand new exploration of how things normally found in metal can create something that expresses the total opposite of rage, then come here. This CD represents more the sadness under rage. I am not one of those people that thinks all metal bands are pissed off, or at least have to be pissed off to write metal because i know that is a totally false claim made by hippies or something. But get this CD if you are feeling down but up for great music, and get Team Sleep if you are up for great music that is really soft yet innovative but not sad. Either way, buy them both at some point. <br />That fact that this CD deserves a five star rating even with two songs that are a little out of place should say something as to how great the rest of it is.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Words just can't describe how incredibly talented Opeth really are, I mean these guys just straight up rock. Every album of theirs is just simply phenomenal. Their sixth album \\"Deliverance\\" being the band's heaviest outing, is a monster of an album, and it's also my second favorite Opeth album as well. Every song on this album is just awesome, the lyrics are wonderfully written, and ohhh man, the music just sends chills down your spine. On this album, you've got awesome drumming from Martin Lopez, great hearable bass lines from Martin Mendez, great guitar riffs from Peter Lindgren, and of course the incredible vocals, and the fantastic guitarwork from the man himself Mikael Akerfeldt. Not a single word can describe how incredible this guy is on the vocals. He can go from a bone chilling chaotic growl and switch to a great cool singing voice. Please read on for my song ratings.<br /><br />themetalbeast's song ratings:<br /><br />1. Wreath (11:10) - This opening song starts off with a barrage of double bass drum assaults, frantic guitar riffs, and Mikael's death growls. I really like this song alot. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />2. Deliverance (13:36) - My favorite song. Begins again with more great double basses and awesome riffs. Fantastic! Rating: 10/5<br /><br />3. A Fair Judgement (10:20) - Another great song. I really like the piano at the beginning, and Mikael's clean singing as well. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />4. For Absent Friends (2:17) - Nice short instrumental. Love the accoustic guitars. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />5. Master's Apprentices (10:29) What can I say? Another great song. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />6. By The Pain I See In Others (13:50) - Ahhh, the closing song on the album. Super Brilliant. Rating: 5/5<br /><br />Grade: A+ all the way!!<br /><br />Well there you have it. If you're new to Opeth, Deliverance is a great place to start along with Blackwater Park. Overall highly recommended for any Opeth and true metal fan like myself, buy it now. LONG LIVE OPETH!!
B000AY74OG|4.0|Yes, the penguins were great as everyone says, but the lemur king and his sidekick along with their \\"move it, move it\\" song was a concoction of pure, delightful genius--an unexpected bonus ingredient of sheer unadulterated fun. The humor in this movie works as well, if not moreso, on the adult level as it will for your children. And if you aren't uncontrollably compelled to get up and dance with your children during the \\"move it, move it\\" song in all the wildest fashions that feels free, then you're not human. Great fun, but unfortunately, on second viewing on the DVD, I knew the jokes coming and it didn't have the effect on me that some great comedies do--that they get funnier on each viewing--but I bought the DVD for my six year old daughter, not for myself, and she enjoys it just as much as the first time, and the dancing we do together, oh wow! that wild family dancing in the living room!--nothing beats that in the whole world! We got the soundtrack as well. We like to  move it, move it!

0440241413|3.0|This book is like a rollercoaster. First it gets way up and exciting, and then it shoots underground and it seems to take forever to get back up above to the top. Most of it is unbelievable. If her credit cards were that overdue they would have done something much more extreme, and Becky would not have been so calm. This is unrealistic, and there are some really boring parts in the plot. I also hated- no, not hated- disliked the way that everything worked out perfectly in the end. If it were any other person they would have been broke and on the streets, but Becky gets the huge hit career and the guy all in one day.<br /><br />I know this sounds like a bad review, but I can't say that it was so entirely horrible. It could have been better, is all I'm saying. I would still recommend this book, it's just not for me.
0783231202|1.0|Based on a true story, A group of west african slaves, Led by Cinque [Played by Djimon Hounsou], Forcefully take over the la amistad slave ship and they kill their slave owners. Just a day later, They are captured and bought to spain to stand trial on murder charges. A lot of very talented actors are in this movie. But, I truly think that Spielberg went too far with this one. I never thought i would be saying this about a movie, But this movie was literally too hard to swallow for me. It was much too violent, Much too ugly, And the story also fails to tell of what the supposed ''hero'' of the film did just a year after he was freed from slavery. Cinque actually became a slave trader himself. To me, That doesn't make Cinque a hero, That makes Cinque a traitor, As well as a sellout. Because so many extremely brutal things were going on in this movie, I was unable to make it to the end of this movie. To tell you the truth, Watching this movie can give a man bad dreams faster than any horror movie out there! Now, I know Spielberg had good intentions when making this movie, Being that he wanted to give moviegoers a vision of what black people had to put up with when this was all happening in real life, But this was too raw. I could never imagine anyone wanting to actually own this movie! How the hell would you watch something like this that's barbaric more than once? Although i am a fan of Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, And Matthew Mcconaughey, I am unable to ever attempt to watch this movie all the way through. And yes, It is true that Cinque did become a slave trader just one year after being freed. Look it up on the internet if you think i'm wrong. To me, This movie's focus shouldn've be so much on Cinque, It should've also gave a deeper insight to some of the many others that had to suffer with him on that boat. Although this isn't a bad movie, It's certainly a movie that you'll most likely never wanna see more than once. What disturbs me is that this movie is actually being used for educational purposes in schools! I know these brutal events really took place, But that doesn't mean that you have to attempt to reenact these violent events scene for scene in a movie. Again, This is not a bad movie, It's just much too hard to swallow, And that's why this movie gets only 1 star from me.
B0000060LT|5.0|While a good chunk of the groups choice moments appear on the \\"Horse Stories\\" lp, \\"Ocean Songs\\" is their most superlatively excuted and complete concept to date. Each composition has its own unique feel, while at the same time, builds on the ideas expressed in the track before it (without coming off as redundant....something many instrumental outfits rarely achieve). The end result is a somber, painful, yet beauteous experience that should be indulged as a whole. A tad pretentious, sure...but this record is too good to find any fault in that.     If you are a new Dirty Three listener, this is the record to pick up first. i promise it will grow on you very quickly.
B00005JNQS|5.0|I'm sure glad I rented Robots. I almost didn't after reading some reviews here that downgraded it and rated it lower than Ice Age, which I didn't find so great and which my 5 year old didn't like much at all. Aside from the fact that it's obviously got parts that are too dark and scary to make it apt for young children, I'm not really sure what those people found so fantastic about Ice Age. Other than the running slapstick gag of the squirrel chasing the acorn, the story itself is a somewhat hackneyed \\"good calms the heart of a savage beast\\" fantasy, scripted as a typical buddy-film with lots of adult-level comic banter between the motormouth wise-guy character and the serious, close-mouthed grump. From that standpoint, it's just a poor take-off on Donkey and Shrek. <br /> <br />But where Ice Age really fell down for me was in its animation. It hardly rises to the level of standouts like \\"A Bugs Life\\" or \\"Toy Story Two\\", let alone \\"The Lion King\\" from which it seems to have borrowed its idea of evil felines. In fact, the artistic rendering of the menacing sabertooth cats is quite static, boxy, unrealistic and ugly, with none of the visual subtleties of a character like Scar in the original Lion King. Then too, the truth is there's not much you can do visually with an endless landscape of snow, ice and fog and a white on white color scheme. Beyond that, the plot basically plods (literally, since the mammoth walks at that pace) through the snow to save the baby, who somehow survives sub-freezing temps totally unclothed and without food or water (right!), until the climactic fight which, as in the Lion King, my son found dark, scary and unpleasant, with not enough fun parts to offset it. <br /> <br />In contrast there's Robots, which thankfully I rented after all, and which the whole family found to be an exciting, funny, visually amazing, rip-roaring thrill-a-minute up-beat adventure story. It's got incredible animation of a Rube-Goldbergesque world where every othersecond there are a dozen visually arresting images and actions. The characters are great--funny, cute, engaging, complex (as opposed to the frozen cardboard ones of Ice Age), the story engaging, and the script is chockfull of musical and cinematic quotes and references. The Gene Kelly \\"singing in the Rain\\" fountain scene is just one of many such gags, and on top of that there's all the funny dialogue, which even when it's aimed at adults as in the case of Robin Williams' character, a 5 year old can have fun with as mere words without having to understand the meaning. For example, my 5 year old immediately parroted back Robin's bit about having to run in these \\"cha-cha heels\\". He found all this type of dialog funny on a basic verbal level, which in fact is what makes verbal comedy funny for kids as well as adults even though they have different levels of understanding of the underlying meaning. <br /> <br />All in all I highly recommend Robots as a movie which all the family will want to see again and again, because that is the only way one is going to catch all the visual and verbal gems in this whiz-bamg rapid-fire film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|...because so many people have said it already. In short, this film is absolutely superb. Its easily one of the best Sci-Fi films to come down the proverbial pike since \\"The Matrix\\", and I'm talking the first film, not the subpar sequels.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" has it all: great characters, superb performances, great dialogue, action, suspense, and a few laughs too. You don't have to be familiar with \\"Firefly\\" to enjoy it, but it will lend more emotional weight to the characters if you know them already.<br /><br />Buy this movie! If you're disappointed, well, then I have no clue what you could possibly be looking for in a film, because this one has it all in spades.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris book The End of Faith finally breaches that most basic problem of culture: that of tolerance. Western culture is teaching that to be a good member of the global society, we must be tolerant of others, despite their attitudes toward us. The idea is that if we can just become tolerant of everyone else, we will all live together in peace and harmony. To anyone with the least bit of common sense this idea is absolute rubbish. On the surface, toleration sounds like a very good idea. Until you delve into the reality and the absolutes which human nature deals. This is no more obvious than religious tolerance. This is because, although each religion attempts, none has a tactical advantage in number or world political power- yet. They cannot agree with each other, or even with themselves. There are currently over 2,000 different Christian groups; that is more than one sect for every year since Christianity was founded. Harris points out that these assorted holy books which claim authenticity by supreme beings are both poorly written and archaic in language and in their understanding of the world. Yet there are millions of people who will question everything else, but the truth in these ancient and archaic books. And those of us who place these books in the proper light, as very old and respected books, but not the work of some super being, are asked to be tolerant, to turn a blind eye, to the rabid and fundamental sects within society who would gladly convert us. Or burn us at the stake. Even a tertiary read of history provides countless examples of the true driving force behind religion. And by insisting in toleration of these religious groups we have given permission to be attacked, oppressed, and even killed.  Regardless of which religion we are speaking, there is the teaching that some are simply better, or \\"holier\\" than the rest. That some have are the special focus of some supreme deity, that they are chosen. When we inject a bit of human nature into this mythology, it is easy to see how wars develop. By my own estimation, religion has contributed directly to the deaths of over 1 billion people, through war, invasion, disease, pogroms, and genocide. My hope would be that Harris' book will find its way into the hands of those who need it most: the religious. Sure, this book will be called Blasphemous and Heretical but these are simply words used by the ignorant, zealous and tolerated to attack that which portrays them as they are. Hate mongering, intolerant, and dangerous.<br /><br />W. Sumner Davis, MS, Div.M, Th.d<br /><br />Author of Hereticsthology, it is easy to see how wars develop.

B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is the tale of a group of surgeons (more or less) at Seattle Grace Hospital. At the center of it all is Merrideth Grey, a new intern who begins the show by leaving her one-night-stand with the boss-she-didn't-know-at-the-time, Dr. Derek Shepherd. As you can imagine, this turns into a major plot line for the entire season (and the next). It isn't long until we are also introduced to Merrideth's mother, one of the best neurosurgeon's of our time, and a closet victem of Alzheimer's. Then Merrideth has her friends and coworkers: Izzy, George, Cristina, and Alex, who have their own woes and troubles.  <br />     The show has a sense of quick wit, and moves pretty fast. The patients and relationships keep it interesting, while the characters make it easy to relate. It has a rather large amount of sexual relations throughout (the first episode begins with a one night stand; the last revolves around an STD running rampid through the hospital, and every episode between dealing with some affair or another between the residents and interns), but there are always reprocussions. So while it's not for the sexually rigid, it is great for the masses. <br />
0451167716|5.0|The Webster's Reference Library Dictionary defines the word Godfather as `A male godparent, who sponsors a child at baptism, taking responsibility for its faith.' But Mario Puzo in his classic novel brings another dimension to this definition. What is it about Vito Corleone, the main character, that captures our imagination and gives him such a larger-than-life image? What is it about Corleone that makes him The Godfather?    Is it because he's so good in his chosen career? He gets a powerful Hollywood movie producer to `reason' with him when the man wakes up terrified to find the bloody head of his favourite horse in bed with him. He thwarts Al Capone himself, who tries to send men to fight in a war against him, by dispatching his own fearsome henchman, Luca Brazi, to meet Capone's men at the train station with instructions that liberate Brazi's wildest instincts. He builds a vast criminal empire, the reaches of which many times catch his enemies, and even his closest friends, by surprise.    Is it in the way he carries himself? With dignity and the deepest self-respect. He's faithful to his wife and becomes straitlaced whenever the discussion comes round to sex. You could say, ironically, that he has a certain moral rectitude. And yet we see in all his transactions that he's not your usual run of criminal. His motivation can't be said to be greed or money, but something else...something more profound.    Is it because he is influential and has countless friends from various walks of life? Friendship is everything, he counsels a protg. It is more than money. It is the equivalent of power...And Vito Corleone cherishes his friends deeply. He is generous with them and offers them his own `justice', whenever society fails them.    Corleone is all these things - a mastermind, honourable and influential - but a clue to what really separates him from the pack lies in a conversation he has with Tom Hagen, his consigliore (adviser), about the producer who refused to feature his protg in a movie. Does this man have balls? the don asks Hagen. Hagen, knowing the don's standards are different from everyone else's, ponders what the question really means before he attempts to answer. Does the movie mogul have a strong will? Does he wield immense power? (The CIA Director is his personal friend.) The answer to these questions is yes. Hagen then ups the stakes: Will this man risk losing everything, including his life, just to defend a principle - as a matter of pride? Hagen smiles and then gives the godfather his answer: No.    Pride...personal, family and `professional' pride...that is the undercurrent that runs through this book. It is this quality, and the bid to control his own destiny in a society of suspect standards, that drives a man of such positive attributes to a life of crime, Puzo tells us. And it is this same quality that Vito looks for as he seeks a successor. He considers his sons: Sony is too brash; too erratic (it is his brashness that kills him in the end). Fredo is too timid, and his fidelity is questionable (more than once he takes sides with strangers against his own family). It is Michael, who has the same high intelligence and cold fearlessness as his father, that the don favours. But Michael is just a gentle, unassuming university kid who prefers to become a maths professor. That is until his father is shot, his family besieged, and his face disfigured by a police captain. Then Michael himself undergoes the traumatic life-changing experience that sets him, like his father before him, on the path to self-realization - to becoming the Godfather.    Godfather - a male godparent who sponsors a child at baptism, taking responsibility for its faith - these days, thanks to Mario Puzo, the word conjures rather different images - images of extraordinary leadership, enormous influence and exaggerated power - at times bordering on notoriety. Mr Puzo writes a book that, though built around the Mafia (I read an interview once where he swore he doesn't have a thing to do with them), explores the traits that command influence and followership among men anywhere - courage, competence, character and community. Reading this book also makes us examine ourselves in the light of these virtues. The Godfather...It is one of the few novels I've finished in a single sitting - for its very absorption, and it must also be the book I've reread the most...A real work of genius.
0671042858|5.0|I cant say that Stephen King is my favorite novelist. I can take his mild novels, but pass on the hotter more graphic stories. He is an excellent writer though and this story is truly wonderful.<br /><br /> The story is about Tricia Farland, a 9 year old, from a recently divorced household whose mother tries to fill her children's time by embarking on weekend outings. One of these outings is a 6 mile hike on the Appalachian trail which Tricia has geared up for with a pack, poncho, some food, and a walkman. On her head is Tricia's prized possession, a Red Sox cap that her father got signed by her hero, famed pitcher Tom Gordon.<br /><br /> In the midst of the hike, Tricia's mother and older brother engage in a heated argument regarding the recent divorce and move when Tricia needs to take a bathroom break. Believing that she can catch up with them, Tricia takes a secluded route off the path to do her business. Then she makes her big mistake, instead of retracing her steps, she decides it will be quicker to walk into woods believing it would lead her to her family. What happens to Tricia afterwards is something out of well a King novel, but Tricia's love for Tom Gordon will prove life or death because he is the reason she finds the strength to survive.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|The movie was good, I'd recommend it.  I really thought the extra, Into The Blue  was an awesome addition also.  Jess Alba, who must know by now, that her star surpasses even Paul's, was totally candid and sweet.  The cast bonded really well, and it was a fun movie, I really recommend it and please watch the extras.  They're better than most.  Emma
0553801503|2.0|This is a tremendously disappointing book.  After looking forward to the fourth book ever since the publication of \\"A Storm of Swords\\" in 2000, I was very disappointed in this book.  Apparently Martin started writing, just couldn't stop and ended up with enough material for two books.  He then decided to publish what he'd written in two books.  Unfortunately he didn't write the material in the format in which it was published and it shows.  What resulted seems like the much too long middle section of a dull book. There is a beginning of sorts and then an interminable middle with no end.  It's a shame to demean and devalue the rest of the series with this poor effort.  I would hope that after he publishes the next installment, which one fears may be equally inadequate, he will then republish both installments together in what would be a huge book, but might be a much better read.   <br /> <br />If you are not familar with the rest of the Song of Ice and Fire series, do not start with this book.  If you are familar with the rest of the series, prepare for a huge letdown.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|The best album of 2005 is entitled \\"Sufjan Stevens Invites You To Come On Feel The Illinoise!\\" It is referred to in short form as \\"Illinois,\\" but I think that this abbreviation really cuts out what is special about the title. So I'm breaking with tradition by abbreviating it \\"SSIYTCOFTI!\\" The exclamation point is very important.    The reason the album is called Illinois (or SSIYTCOFTI!) is that all of the songs are about Illinois, or people from there. Sufjan's-- because we're on a first name basis, natch-- we're both Episcopalians-- anyway, Sufjan's stated purpose is to create an album for every state in the nation. The one he did before this one was about Michigan, entitled \\"Sufjan Stevens Presents: Welcome To Michigan! The Great Lakes State\\" and called his backup band \\"The Michigan Militia.\\" So you can see the level of brilliance we're working with here.    My favorite song title is \\"A Short Reprise For Mary Todd, Who Went Insane But For Very Good Reasons.\\"  And that's not even the longest title on the album.  The longest song title is \\"The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Gonna Have To Leave Now, Or, 'I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight...\\" The ellipses at the end of the title as it's listed on amazon.com suggest there may even be more to the song title than that!     (Please do understand that I'm getting my superficial delight with the album out of the way first, before I delve deeper. I do like it for more than its quirky song titles. However, the song titles, the \\"an album for each state\\" thing, and all that surface quirkiness is what originally attracted me to him, so I guess I'm hoping to reel you guys in with it like I was, before I drop the real science that blew my mind on about my 5th listening.)    Another superficial attraction for me was the SOUND. It's BIG. But somehow, it manages not to sound bombastic-- there's a certain humility to it, even with all its ambition. There's a string quartet backing him on many songs, along with a chorus of earnest-sounding singers, and he uses banjo and accordian and glockenspiel for accent. As Mike McGonigal reviews SSIYTCOFTI! here on Amazon, describing it thusly: \\"Illinois sounds like The Sea and Cake collaborating with the high-school band from a Wes Anderson film on banjo-driven, pulsing meditations on Vince Guaraldi's music for Peanuts.\\" And oddly enough, the description totally works. The first song I heard was one my brother played for me, entitled \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!, Pt. I: The World's Columbian Exposition / Pt. II: Carl Sandburg Visits Me In a Dream.\\" It has glockenspiel accents, sweet little wind and horn bursts, thick instrumentation backing his modest vocals. About halfway through the song (the Pt II about Carl Sandburg, I can only assume) the sound changes and the winds and horns move into a Cure-inspired riff, a lot like \\"Close To Me.\\" And yet, it all totally works seamlessly.    I mentioned earlier that Sufjan is an Episcopalian (also one of my initial attractions-- a Christian musician who doesn't Jesus up his music? Music informed by the three-legged stool of scripture, reason, and tradition? I'm totally there!). This becomes evident in the song \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.,\\" which manages to skirt the line between sympathy and contempt for a reviled figure, and encapsulate the spirit of the \\"People of Faith Against the Death Penalty\\" movement. I didn't listen to this song right away, because I was too busy listening to the three songs I was first addicted to, but based on my initial superficial listening I thought would be a lighthearted little ditty with double-edged cultural references, perhaps a clown motif. I was very wrong. It is heart-rending.     From the first verse:    Look underneath the house there   Find the few living things   Rotting fast in their sleep of the dead   Twenty-seven people, even more   They were boys with their cars, summer jobs   Oh my God     I've always had a problem reconciling my pity and empathy for serial killers (most assuredly disturbed, usually abused) with pity and empathy for their victims. That line about \\"boys with their cars, summer jobs\\" really got me, especially considering my little brother is about the same age as most of Gacy's victims. But the reconciliation comes later in the song:    And in my best behavior   I am really just like him   Look beneath the floorboards   For the secrets I have hid     Here's where my ability to express my gut reaction is going to break down. I just can't encapsulate it in a way that satisfies. I want to write a treatise on guilt, redemption, and how the light of Christ really is in us all, but is so often stifled by mental illness, abuse, and terror. This is when I wish I were a better writer.    Fortunately, Sufjan brings us back from that emotional trench with the very next song, \\"Jacksonville,\\" which manages not to mock the previous song by being too flip, but still uplifts. \\"Andrew Jackson, all I'm asking, show us the wheel and give us the wine. Colored preacher, nice to meet you! The spirit is here and the spirit is fine!\\" The upward trajectory continues with songs like \\"Decatur, Or A Round Of Applause For Your Stepmother!\\" (in which he rhymes \\"Decatur\\" with \\"hate her\\") and, what might be the climax of the entire album, \\"Chicago.\\" This is an sonally ambitious song with a sublime chorus:    you came to take us   all things go, all things go   to recreate us   all things grow, all things grow   we had our mindset   all things know, all things know   you had to find it   all things go, all things go     I don't know if his backing chorus is really made up of teenaged girls or not, but it has a teenaged spirit. There's an innocence and a wisdom intermingled here; the myopic idealism of youth, and the \\"it really is as simple as I thought it was when I was 17\\" idealism I hope I find with age.    In summation, this is quite assuredly the best album of 2005, and in my estimation, the best album to have come out for several years prior.  I haven't listened to anything this obsessively since the last millenium.  Buy it, love it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|i hate u people who listen to green day. it sucks and they have absolutely no talent. they go from songs about farting to all of a sudden political. i hope they suffer in Hell for this album. <br /> <br />you want good political music, get RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!!! u stupid kids u.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can't believe all the crap that has been written about this album... for good and bad. <br />This album is truly something new! I've never heard anything sounding like this. In a nutshell, it's a mixture of trippy eastern sounds, concrete block drop d aggression, clever lyrics, and some freakin amazing drumming, aided by some infectious bass grooves. It has a very weird aura about it, something I can't quite explain. It's like being exposed to a million different shades of grey. I wouldn't call it depressive, but it certainly is something u must listen to by yourself and think about. It's not the kind of record u would headbang to with your mates. And no, I don't believe in astrology, lachrymology, chaos magic, and all that crap. Still, it sounds amazing put together.  <br />   As for the songs individually, I have to say \\"the Grudge\\" and \\"Reflection\\" are the best in this recording. \\"The Grudge\\" has this industrial sound, topped by an insane drum solo at the end. Reflection is the \\"healing\\" track, it flows really nicely and is a remarkable departure from most of the other material. Just another example of how broad these guys' musicianship is. <br />   This is certainly a tough listen, very alternative. The guitar is very aggressive, the drums complicated, the lyrics dark and thought provoking. MJK's voice is truly something, whether u like all that new age stuff he has to say or not. Danny Carey is AMAZING!!! Adam Jones, I must say, is not a great guitarist, but what he plays seems to fit in perfectly with Danny's percussion. <br /> I feel sad that some people try to compare this to Iron Maiden. I love Iron Maiden, but not every metal song is supposed to have a 3 minute guitar solo. Rock/ Metal is not just about being able to play 27 notes/second. Some say that the songs sound all the same, but man, I have every Iron Maiden album, and I must say they sound very repetitive. <br />  Others diss the lyrics and say Good Charlotte is the best thing around. \\"Stacey's mom has got it going on\\"? U call these deep lyrics? Gimme a f****** break!!! U're not even worth the air you breathe. If you don't like dark, introspective music don't listen to it! It's not like u have to listen to Tool on the radio every 5 minutes. <br />  To sum up, if you're looking for something new to listen to, this is the album for you. Nevermind the overwhelming noise at the beginning, there is A LOT  of quality and good musicianship in this album. If u're the sort of person who loves RnB, hip hop, catchy punk rock and other sorts of unskilled, commercial and pointless music, then stay away from this. If you don't like music for ther sake of music, but more for the sake of a catchy, entertaining sound, avoid Lateralus. Actually, you might as well die, for all that I care. And NO, TOOL IS NOT SATANIC!!! Where the h*** did u come up with such an idea?? If you think Tool is satanic, do yourself a favour and file a lawsuit against your parents for giving you such a retarded, useless brain. <br /> <br />Peace out <br /> <br />PS: RnB sucks big time!! Let us join forces in a global effort to eradicate this filth!!! <br />
0792165020|4.0|A magnificient film with great music!! Anthony Minghella is a visual master and one of the best adapters of fiction today. His adaptations are great because he isn't afraid to add new things to the original. Even if you've read the original material you are still surprised by the plot turns. There is some great acting as well by Jude Law, Matt DAmon, Gweneth Paltrow, and Cate Blanchette. And Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano is one catchy tune!!
B000021YQV|5.0|This album isn't quite as good as \\"Steal this Album\\" or \\"System of a Down\\" but it comes pretty damn close. I hear X getting a lot of bad comments but it's actually one of my favorite songs. For me 'Atwa', 'Needles', and 'Forest' were the best songs on the CD, so if you buy it for any song, buy it for those. The only song that was weak was 'Psycho'.
B00001OH1S|2.0|Yes, yes, you get to hear Sting doing an adequate cover of the famous song from the original movie, but I can hear Sting doing adequate covers any time. What drove me to want the CD was to hear more of Conti's driving score and to hear it alone without the movie -- which is very well done. You get about a minute and a half of 5 pieces here. It's hardly worth it.
B000AWYOG4|4.0|With only a few ascetic deviations, Touchstone Pictures' US remake of Dark Water (2005), directed by Walter Salles, faithfully recreates the taughtly paced, frenetically climaxed plot of its Japanese counterpart, released by ADV Films in 2002, and directed by The Ring Two and Ring 2 director, Hideo Nakata. <br /> <br />Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly), and her five year-old daughter, Ceci (played by newcomer, Ariel Gade), struggle for stability, as they find their lives manipulated by Dahlia's estranged husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott), who is obsessed with regaining custody of Ceci through dehumanizing legal mediation and illicitly hired harassment. Dahlia's only comfort comes from an amusingly mobile lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth), himself a lost soul seeking refuge in an imaginary marriage and social life. <br /> <br />Settling for occupancy in a dank, rundown apartment complex that is more reminiscent of a turn-of-the (last)-century tenement than a modern, multi-unit dwelling, Dahlia assents to underemployment as an administrative assistant in a small medical clinic to pay the bills, while Ceci copes with her fear about starting over in a redoubtably good school, competently staffed by a concerned teacher (Camryn Manheim). New apartment and school are situated on absurdly over-developed Roosevelt Island, cowering beneath the Manhattan skyline. Ceci, showing wisdom beyond her tender years, consents to her bleak environs on the thwarted hope of gaining possession of an unclaimed red, Hello Kitty school bag, belonging to another girl. A slipshod property manager, Mr. Murray (credibly portrayed by Chicago [2002] veteran, John C. Reilly), and obstinate superintendent, Mr. Veek (in an eerily interpreted, Eastern European accented performance by character actor, Pete Posteltethwaite) exacerbate Dahlia's despondency, on account of their reluctance to repair her leaky ceiling and requests to do likewise for the building's puddling elevator and poorly maintained rooftopwater tower. <br /> <br />Ceci calls Mr. Veek on his lie about Hello Kitty's retrieval, after Dahlia discovers the mysterious red satchel in the building's laundry room. Despite her misgivings, Dahlia suspects there may be more to Hello Kitty and its absent owner than meets the eye. Can there be a connection between the mysterious red bag and Ceci's disconcerting, imaginary new \\"friend,\\" \\"Natasha\\" (Perla Haney-Jardine aka \\"B.B. Kiddo\\" of Kill Bill II [2004] fame, also playing young Dahlia in flashback), whom Ceci befriended shortly after their arrival on Roosevelt Island? After all, Natasha is the name that Dahlia sighted in Hello Kitty. It seems that Natasha may be turning the tables on Ceci, actually taking \\"possession\\" of her at home and in school! Realizing the serious nature of the situation, Dahlia investigates Natasha's mysterious disappearance and connection with the inexplicable voices and footfalls coming from the apartment above. The problems for Dahlia and Ceci mount in tandem with the expanding watermark on their apartment ceiling, recalling the videotaped image of young Samara Morgan's well from the US remake of author, Koji Suzuki's, companion Ring series. Along with Dahlia, viewers learn of Natasha's tragic history in the apartment building, conjuring painful memories and nightmares of Dahlia's own troubled past. We find Seattle ex-patriot, Dahlia Williams, on a bathroom floor on Roosevelt Island, in New York City--some 3000 miles away, and three years later (in storyline), from the one occupied by another Seattle ex-patriot, Rachel Keller (intriguing!), in Astoria, Oregon--facing the same difficult choices as her Ring counterpart, as she scrambles to protect her child from the predatory clutches of a ghostly young girl in desperate need of a loving mother. Similarities aside, each set of films successfully tells a different story about the real horrors of child abandonment and parental sacrifice, with a different outcome. Neither should be missed. <br /> <br />Like her Japanese and US counterparts in Dark Water and The Ring series-who include Hitomi Kuroki playing Yoshimi Matsubara in the Japanese version of Dark Water (2002), Nanako Matsushima playing Reiko Asakawa in the Japanese versions of Ring (1998), Rasen (1998, in archive footage), and Ring 2 (1999), and Naomi Watts in the US version of The Ring (2002) and The Ring Two (2005)-Jennifer Connelly soul-searches to communicate a level of sophistication and resolve in her roles that few actors and actresses can easily replicate-especially when plot and dialog challenge or suspend mainstream perceptions of reality. <br />
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Having read some very mixed reviews for this film, I wasnt sure whether to bother with it or not. I`m glad I did. <br />Jack Nicholson (Harry) is excellent as an ageing playboy, intent on keeping his love life hassle free, by dating under 30s without baggage. Enter Marin (Amanda Peet) with an awesome set of eyebrows. Harry and Marin take off for her mothers stunning home in the Hamptons, expecting a quiet weekend together. Until Marins mother Erica (Diane Keaton), who has also gone to the house with her sister for the weekend, unexpectedly finds Harry raiding the fridge in his underwear. I think the tone for this film is set as the mother realizes with horror, that Harry isnt a burglar but her daughters boyfriend! <br />As the title suggests, somethings gotta give. And it does, Harrys heart. Any 64 year old fooling around with Marin to the strains of Marvin Gaye, should ideally get a check up first. Harry is told he is not well enough to travel back to the city for a few days, so finds himself reluctantly marooned at the house with Marins uptight mother. And the love story unfolds. <br />The setting for this film is beautiful, who doesnt want a home in the Hamptons now? Diane Keaton sparkles and Jack is a hoot. I get the feeling playing this part was as easy for him as falling off a log. You can clearly see the chemistry between himself and Diane.  <br />I wasnt sure about the doctor, Keanu Reeves. He did seem to be wheeled in and out of the film, more as a prop than a real character. Which is a shame as he is a first rate actor. Those who disagree arent watching him properly. Watch again and enjoy his subtle handling of the restaurant scenes with Harry and Erica. Perfect! <br />If you want a classy film that will make you chuckle, try this one.
B000687M48|5.0|I'm a big fan of live albums in general for a number of reasons.  They strip the artist(s) of all the junk that studios add to songs - overdubbing, \\"vocal enhancements\\", orchestra effects (OK, the orchestra is still there, as are the piped-in vocals), extra musicians.  And they let some life versus the sterility and perfectionism of the music studio.    By any accounts this is a great live album.  First the sheer size of the thing.  You get: 1)One live concert on DVD.  2)The same concert on CD.  3)All four music videos.  4)And an hour-long behind the scenes home video.  All for about the price you would pay for the video alone.      The music is excellent. I think Amy Lee sounds even better live than on the \\"Fallen\\".  She really shows what she can do - on key, dominating, always interesting.  In short, she has great stage presence.  She did say \\"You guys rock\\" a few too many times, though.    The track which really stood out, and the one which I keep replaying, is \\"Thoughtless\\", a Korn cover.  And I hate Korn. Yet this song is outstanding.  You also get three other songs not on the \\"Fallen\\" album - \\"Father Away', \\"Missing\\", and \\"Breath No More\\", all nice but not really exceptional.    The addition of all four extant music videos was a nice touch.  They are all quite well made, and the band could easily have charged separately for them, instead of tacking them onto this album.  Thanks.    Some reviewers were annoyed by the \\"behind the scenes\\" video.  I liked them.  They put a human face on the band.      All in all, an exceptional live album, something you do not see too often these days.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Wow! I just bought and listened to this entire album, and I am absolutely blown away. I used to swear by Dream Theater and the likes of bands like Dream Theater, but now I have to say that I have replaced Dream Theater with Opeth. Dream Theater are good, but there is just something absolutely awesome about Opeth. This album shows me how great these musicians are. By adding a full time keys man it sounds just amazing!! I would recommend this cd and all of Opeths cd's to anyone who likes metal but also like a little callange when trying to transscribe and play. Purely awesome!!
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Simplemente impresionante, como ver a George Harrison con msicos de la talla de Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell y tambin a Klaus Voormann y Jim Keltner, para reunir en una causa muy benfica que fue para Bangladesh, el 1 de agosto de 1971. Un gran DVD, sin duda muy recomendable para cualquiera.
B0006A9IVQ|2.0|I had been looking for this film for years since it really moved me when I was a younger, particularly the beautiful musical score by Henry Mancini and the photography.  This DVD is an insult to the director and the consumer. <br />IF you know Italian you can buy 'I Girasoli'.  The quality does justice to the film BUT there are only RUSSIAN subtitles, not even English subtitles or dubbing.  Guess we'll have to wait for a re-release.
020161622X|5.0|...and normally, I don't use cliches. If you need to read only one book on programming methodologies - read this one.<br /><br />You can regard it as a \\"professional self-help\\" book. It really helps you to grow professionally. Even though it is pricey - in long range what you learn from this book will make you a better programmer (and, yes, better paid). Pragmatic Programmer is not only for coders; project leaders can benefit even more from it.<br /><br />The format is excellent and easy to read as well. While every claim is thoroughly explained, the essence of the advice is put in one sentence.<br /><br />Some of the stuff is a programmer's common sense; unfortunately, it is not taught in universities. And even though many people might think they know it - usually they don't.<br /><br />Seems like everyone has his own favourite part in this book; mine is DRY - don't repeat yourself.
B000002U82|5.0|A couple years back, my best friend was just about the biggest PF fan I had ever met(he went by Floyd throughout the whole fifth grade).  I never really got into it, but now I think I see what he likes about it.  First of all, it's nice and mellow, not scream-your-lungs-out rock.  Second, it's a lot more instrumental than other bands.  \\"Money\\" could easily be the best rock song I have ever heard.  Listen up, all you Korn or AC/DC junkies: pick up this album!  It is a breath of fresh air!  Songs like \\"On the Run,\\" \\"Time\\" and \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" really make you think, in a very good way!  Anyone could appreciate Pink Floyd, no matter what their interests are!  Anyone that talks trash about this album or the band in general just doesn't know what true music is all about!  Pink Floyd creates a completely new way to look at rock, and Lord knows it's good!  If you have any taste in music, do yourself a huge favor and pick up Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|For those genuine DT fans, this is definitely a must have.  For those who want to instantly become a fan, then definitely purchase this DVD.  Chalked full of music, this shows how incredibly talented musicians these guys are.  I would recommend this DVD to any music fan.  It's just impressive to watch DT perform live!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I had waited for this album like, three months before it was released. When it came out i didn't get it right away, i just watched it explode in poularity. Then i saw the music videos. It was sad. They were aged and wearing gothicy clothes, it was a disgrace. And as you can see this album is already lowering in poularity, it was a fad afterall! (who could've guessed??) Green Day, ya great, but you just bombed in retropsect on this one.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Honestly, I too viewed this movie musical with mixed emotions. As a phan of the original novel by Gaston Leroux, I had simply fallen in love with the cynical Meg Giry, and her dark countenance. When I saw the broadway show I was appalled. <br />Music and Lyrics: GREAT <br />ADAPTATION: HORRENDOUS. <br />Meg was now some sissy blonde who was scared of everything and had no self-esteem! The antithesis of Leroux's Meg! I went to the movie expecting no different. <br /> <br />But you know what? Jennifer Ellison completely redefined the role of Meg. Her previous roles and ballet skill were just what was needed for the role, and her acting gave Meg a more dignified, mysterious role. Plus it helps that Meg gets A LOT more scenes in the movie than in the musical, and plays a much bigger part. <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum is an ACTUAL operatic SOPRANO (worked with the Metropolitan Opera), unlike Sarah Brightman, whose voice was too low for my tastes. Patrick Wilson is on my favorite Raouls list, right below Wishbone. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler played a similar \\"dark angel/stalker\\" character in Dracula 2000 (the second thing I saw him in after Tomb Raider), so I knew he could act. And as for singing...Well, he's no Hugh Panaro. And Miranda Richardson was THE Madame Giry. <br /> <br />Overall, I give this 3 stars, mostly for the casting of Ellison as Meg Giry, costume/set design, and musical adaptation. <br />The two stars off were for faithfulness to Leroux (where IS that Persian?), something Andrew Lloyd Webber should have brought up during the making of the film at some point. <br /> <br />If you're going to buy the DVD, buy the 2-disc version, because there are bonus interviews with the cast (cough) Ellison(cough) and looks behind the scenes at what was changed, what was added, and why. Reccomended for Leroux Meg phans!
0679441018|4.0|This novel is divine speculation, and it's just plain sublime!  Obviously, Anne Rice has been working through her personal theology through this manuscript.  (Note: AR has recently vowed to write only for the glory of Christ Our Lord.)   <br /> <br />However, \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" has some what some may perceive as weaknesses.  Firstly, fundamentalists will find this novel pure blasphemy.  Also, some Anne Rice fans will even define Lestat's understandably awed condition as weakness that is not in keep with his character.      <br /> <br />The basic premise is complex.  Memnoch--who insists on not being called the Devil because it's a dated name--has chosen the grand vampire Lestat to be his right hand man on a humanitarian mission ... for all time.   It is, after all, the adversary's job to prepare souls for Heaven--chiefly by helping souls forgive God for being uncaring and not taking a more active role in the destiny of his creation.    Lestat debates Memnoch's offer.   He is escorted by Memnoch to Heaven (where Lestat speaks to God briefly) and to Hell.  Guided by Memnoch, Lestat also walks beyond the constraints of time to see the evolution of the world and certain crucial events (such as Christ's crucifixion.)  Lestat returns and heads straight for the mortal with whom he is deeply infatuated: the evangelist daughter of a drug lord. <br /> <br />I find \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" inspiring and thought-provoking, truly a memorable experience.  I recommend it to all agnostics, atheists, and those with an open mind.
B000002U82|5.0|I cant think of a better rock album than this apart from the wall and wish you were here.This album contains some of the greatest songs ever written like money,time and eclipse.This is one album which needs to be in your collection.highly recommended.
B0002858YS|5.0|This Band and CD is an oasis in the barren desert that has become the current musical landscape.  Lush in lyrics, beat and drive, The Killers are a sure bet for future success.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is way underrated in my opinion.It amongst their very best due to songs like ACHILLES LAST STAND,CANDY STORE ROCK and NOBODY'S FAULT BUT MINE.Highly recommended.Get it today.
0689859414|5.0|I've been looking forward to the release of this book for some time and am so happy that it lives up to my expecations. It's simply gorgeous and is now one of my most treasured illustrated books. It fits beautifully with the novels and I look forward to more books in this series.<br /><br />There are several fold-out pages which illustrate some of the fantastical creatures in the book. One of these pages folds upwards (vertically) instead of sideways (horizontally), and so you must be careful to hold the book flat, or the page will rip in the corner.
B000002J09|5.0|Led zeppelin is in plain and simple words the greatest hard rock album ever made.One listen to classics like BLACK DOG,ROCK AND ROLL and WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS will convince you.highly recommended.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|You buy the Forrest Gump soundtrack for the hits and you buy Good Boys When They're Asleep for some good, old fashioned rock.  It's a wonder why more poeple don't listen to these guys.  Another thing, that song in the Tiger Woods commercial? The Faces - Ooh La La: One of the great songs of the decade.
0312330537|5.0|Like most of the other reviewers of this novel, I too am a voracious reader and have read hundreds of novels.  <br /> <br />Nothing I have ever read comes close to Shantaram. I have never felt so compelled by a story, characters, or my desire after 986 pages for it to continue ad infinitum.   <br /> <br />Gregory David Roberts takes his readers on an emotional, physical and spiritual journey. You will taste, smell and feel Bombay and the worlds he inhabits. You will sympathize with him and his circumstances, despite the crimes and drugs and otherwise formidible circumstances he encounters.  You will be fuller and more complete by the end of this novel, but be warned: you'll be hungry for more.
0805047905|5.0|My boy liked this book enough to laugh out loud and tell me \\"Again!  Again!\\"  It's a simple book with repetitive rhymes, but it really is great.  It reinforces both colors and animals, which most 2 year olds are at least familiar with.  I expect this would be one of the first books that he'll be reading on his own since he already knows the animals and colors, and can remember the rhyme.  This is the best Carle book next to \\"Caterpillar,\\" which is REQUIRED for any child's bookshelf.  (The other Carle books, not so much.)
B0000508U6|5.0|I have different music for different days. This album is for one of those evenings when you dim the lights, break out the candles, and think about someone you've loved. It has a bitter-sweet feel to it. The music is simple and modest, but Chris Martin's vocals take control and bring things to a deeper level. I can feel what he's singing...I can sense it in his voice.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I love the Dark Side of the Moon, and I think everyone who is reading this review knows the music or they wouldn't be here. <br /> <br />However, I do have one complaint.  When I put this disc into my computer to upload it to iTunes, the disc isn't recognized.  It's possible that it's just my copy, but I think there's some kind of copy protection on it... <br /> <br />Now I have bought the music but I can't get it on my iPod, which was the main reason I bought the CD.  Be warned if that's what you've got in mind as well.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember buying this album expecting it to be similar to The Bends. I popped it in the old c.d. player and thought...what the heck did I just buy? Why do I love it so much? It was so different than anything I'd ever heard. I fell in love with it immediately and to this day my friends don't understand my obsession with Radiohead. Thom Yorke...is he an alien (I mean that in a good way)? No human being can sing like that. His voice goes from crazy beautiful to just plain crazy and I love it! I'm not quite sure I understand completely what the album is about, but who cares? It's amazing.
B0007P3582|1.0|Lets get two things straight:  50 Cent is a pop rapper - he is not a hip hop artist.  50 Cents fans are not hip hop fans - they're pop fans.  Ask your typical 13 year old purchasing the Massacre if he or she has heard of Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash or who their favourite writer or breaker is and you'll be engaged with as much depth as \\"Fiddys\\" album contains. <br />To \\"real\\" hip hop fans (and no, your 2Pac Greatest Hits CD doesn't qualify you as one), 50 Cent is an ugly blight on the culture whom has destroyed much of what the pioneers worked hard to build.  50, Eminem et al are a corporate monolith.  Together, they spew violent and explicit rhymes to an accepting public, while Interscope laugh all the way to the bank.   <br /> <br />The Massacre's subject matter covers guns, hoes and money.  Oh, and the listener is also reminded on numerous occasions how tough he and his crew are.  How utterly ground breaking and cutting edge of you Mr Jackson.   <br /> <br />This album is garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.  50 Cent and his lame crew of no-talent wannabes are garbage.  If you're a fifteen year sk8er boi with studded belt, or you're a clueless mobile phone wielding Jessica Simpson wannabe chick, this album will surely find pride of place between your Green Day and American Idol CDs.  And you're friends will think you're... \\"like, so totally awesome\\".   <br /> <br />G G G G G Unot! <br />
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I really don't want to give Sarah a bad review. I love her! I love what she's done for female musicians everwhere, but, and there is a but...I don't think too highly of her latest album. There are songs that caught my attention, Answer being one of the few, but the album as a whole seems so bland. I fell in love with Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing...Solace is a great album, and I guess after such a long break I had too high of expectations. Maybe her new life and family has brought her to a new level that I can't quite understand...I want the painful lyrics and passion. Hey, congrats to her on a happy life, but poor pitiful me misses her pain.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira, on this album, really takes over and provides me as a new fan a great mixture of old school rock with fresh Latin girl angst. Her voice on \\"Don't Bother\\" reminds me a little of Crissy Hind with smooth Latino heat and tremendous energy all rolled up into one. Could it be the new Punk? <br /> <br />This is a wonderful CD - you should get it if you like singers who write their own lyrics and sing their own songs. Shakira's performance on Letterman was superb (Dec 12, 2005) and truly wowed me to buy. <br /> <br />I hope soon she writes beyond the pop world of love and girls and ventures into songs with bigger ideas, but until then, I can wait.  It's her voice - it is just so wonderful and pure!
B000002J0G|5.0|This release comes after The Ritual, which was a great CD itself, and Testament comes back with a much heavier, much more thrashy release with Low.  They're definately still on a more commercial sound kick, but who cares, this is awesome metal!  I love \\"Low\\", \\"Hail Mary\\", \\"Chasing Fear\\", \\"Ride\\", \\"P.C.\\", man the list goes on.  Not one clunker in the bunch.  I miss Alex Skolnik's solos, but the fill-in guy does a fine job and does not disappoint. <br /> <br />Bottom line is, if you're a Testament fan or just a heavy metal fan in general, do NOT miss this heavy metal classic.
0307236722|5.0|Yeah, what can I say that hasn't already been said here? It's Martha. You can expect excellence. I have been wanting (needing!) a good baking book for a while, and when I saw that Martha had one out, I knew this would be the one. People can say whatever they want about her, but one thing cannot be denied: if the woman puts her name on something, you know you're getting quality. Martha doesn't mess around. <br />This is much more than just a collection of recipes. It's a book that you'll be proud to own and display, will reach for time and time again and will pass on to your children and grandchildren.
B000002ITM|5.0|No way this CD is weak.  Five stars all the way.  True, it's a more commercial approach for them, but there's not one average track on this release.  There's a few ballads, a few mid-tempo rockers, and a few thrash classics.  \\"Electric Crown\\", \\"So Many Lies\\", \\"Deadline\\" plus \\"Let go of my World\\", and \\"Return to Serenity\\", so many great songs.  Alex Skolnik's is in fine form and Chuck Billy sounding terrific.  The only small complaint I have here is the sound quality isn't really the best...sounds a bit muddy in parts, but don't let that stop you from getting this heavy metal classic.  Awesome band live as well! <br /> <br />
0321334876|5.0|Extremely well written C++ book; full of well argued, well presented, well discussed relevant C++ topics. <br />Both the student and the professional developer will benefit from this book. A must for the personal and the corporate book shelf.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|I enjoed this film from star to finish. the direction is good and it's a wonder to watch from begging to end. The story is fun but drags on at times. The visuals are great,a nd there is comadey, suspense and action in the film. The acting is not the greatest which makes the film not great. Overall I enjoed it and I think the viewer's will enjoy it also.
B00005JOFO|2.0|At the heart of Brokeback Mountain is a love between two people that can never be fully realized because of societal pressures.  Unfortunately, I never once believed these two people were in love.  We are shown very little tenderness and love between the two.  Mostly we see them rough housing, working or just hanging out together.  Their sexual encounters and make out sessions are full of aggressive desire but very little actual love and tenderness.  How this relationship lasts as long as it does is beyond me.  What draws them together besides lust is never shown.  In fact we never see a realtionship form, it sudenly and out of nowhere just comes to be.  People just don't have relationships like this.  Not even in 1962.<br /><br />The film is photographed beautifully and acted superbly, but without the central love the film revolves around I was left feeling disinterested.  Perhaps someday we will see a film that represents gay realtionships a realistic light, but Brokeback Mountain is certainly not the one.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|I enjoyed this film in many ways. First the story is good, Second all the underwater scene's could actually be done by normal people9except holding there breath under water for a very long time). The acting is ok I really enjoy Alba and I think she's the next big thing, paul Walker is alos good in the movie but his acting is not great. The bad stuff about the movie is it dose drag on at times and it drags on and on and on. The under water scens'a are good but some times it's to much under water. the stpry is predictable but it's fun.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|I had many reservations about King Kong before seeing it and unfortunately they were mostly all confirmed.  Peter Jackson doesn't add anything to the story besides a lot of CGI running and fighting.  It got to the point where I was just waiting for the CGI mania on Skull Island to end so that the story could continue.  On top of that the CGI compositing was very noticable in a few places, something that just does not pass muster in this day and age.<br /><br />The story starts off well in NYC and I was totally hooked until the cast boarded the ship and headed out to Skull Island.  The acting is fairly well through out with no one particularly standing out.  Sadly, the story is bogged down by unbelievable occurances (even for a story as outlandish as this).  A deserted Central Park and NYC streets without a single person walking by.<br /><br />This version of King Kong adds othing to the story or  characters except about an extra hour or so of running time.  If you like non-stop CGI creatures and effects, this will probably please you, but for those looking for a bit more substance, you should just rent the original film where Kong is actually sympathetic and you care for him.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|In the tradition of The Ring and The Grudge come Dark Water. The movie tanked at the box office and the trailers did not look good but I wanted to see it to see if it was scary and it was not. The movie is on the boarder lione of beeing a good movie and a bad movie. The good stuff the acting is good, the story is ok and it builds up lots making you think there will be scary moments and a good ending but your wrong. The movie builds up to nothing it's just a dissapointing ending. There are many pointltss parts and charactors to this movie. It's not scary and not worth the watch.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This frightening and gripping tale is based on a true story of a German student who, in the 1970s, died during an attempted exorcism.  The two German priests who attempted the exorcism were accuded of negligent homicide.  This film is based on the life of a young college student, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Suffering from horrifying hallucinations and bone-rigid seizures, it was believed that Emily was suffering from some sort of psychosis and epilepsy.  However, the family soon places Emily in the care of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson).  He has a totally different explanation for Emily's behavior; he believes that she has been possessed by the devil and he plans an exorcism to rid Emily of her demons.<br /><br />However, the exorcism goes terribly awry, and Emily dies during it.  Soon, Father Moore is arrested and accused of negligent homicide.  Scrambling for alternatives, Father Moore's parish hires defense lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend Father Moore.  A up-and-comer in her law firm, she just won a high-profile case before accepting the defense of Father Moore.  One more big victory and she will become a senior partner in her firm.<br /><br />Serving as prosecutor for the trial is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a church-goer and Sunday School Teacher who believes that religious beliefs are not above the law and intends to prosecute to its fullest extent.  After rejecting a plea deal of reckless endangerment which would have carried a six month jail sentence from the prosecution, the two sides go to trial.<br /><br />The trial is loaded with scientific explanations and religious theories about the cause of Emily's death.  From psychosis and epilepsy to demon possession, many theories are presented by both the prosecution and the defense.  Which side will the jury believe?  Will Father Moore be found guilty or innocent?<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely exciting to watch.  The trial scenes are riveting, and the cut-away scenes showing Emily fighting her condition are the high points of the movie.  The acting is first-rate.  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, and especially Jennifer Carpenter as the torn and troubled Emily are all excellent in their roles.  If you remember seeing \\"The Exorcist\\", this movie will scare you even more.  I highly recommend this movie.  The courtroom drama will draw you in, and the exorcism and possession scenes will keep you glued to the screen throughout.  Watch this true story and see how possession, scientific theory, and exorcism meet head-on in a clash of beliefs.the cut-away scenes showing Emily fighting her condition are the high points of the movie.

B00005GL0W|4.0|\\"line up for the magical mystery tour everybody step RIIIIIGHHT this way\\" says John in the opening title track, beckoning you on an utterly insane voyage through sixty pop culture. <br />MMT is highly regarded as the most under-rated Beatles album, I disagree with that to an extent, I think Help! is the moster under-rated, but still, who cares, this is fine, fine music. <br />The opening track is an under-rated adreniline rush, sure, the lyrics aren't much anything more then lines like \\"line up for the mystery tour\\" but the tooting horns and insanity going on gives the song a menacing yet childlike feel to it, not unlike Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite <br />things change drastically with \\"Fool on the Hill\\" this poetic piece is brilliant in its own way, it can be viewed as social commentary if you wish, but really it just paints a surreal picture in your head. <br />\\"Flying\\" is another under-rated song, much like the Yellow Submarine istrumentals, its far out and trippy, but really, isn't that what that albums all about? Now Blue Jay Way, this is an AMAZING piece of music, its George's utter creepiest song, its very un-nerving, and just, as I said, brilliant, stunning. \\"Your Mother Should know\\" meh, ho-hum. <br />I am the Walrus, probably the most famous song on the album, its amongst The Beatles greatest achievements, images of countless sureal situations, penguins kicking Edgar Allen Poe, a dead dog dripping custard from its eyes, policemen in a row, its just mind-blowing. Hello Gbye is a harmless, and un-memorable piece of Paul. Next comes Stawberry Fields, aka I Buuuuuriiiiied Paul, which is the best song on the album by far, for pretty obvious reassons. Penny Lane is almost (almost) equally as good. \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" is probably my least favorite track, followed by \\"All you Need is Love\\" which is a fitting finale. <br /> <br /> <br />So, why, you ask, did I give this album four stars instead of five? Simply because when I first got it I listened to itso much it kind of got repetitive, it does get repetitive alot faster then say Peppers or Abbey or even Revolver, but still, I rate it four and a half, one of their best.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I have basically found that there are just two groups of people in the universe: Those who find Mony Python funny, and those who don't. Within the group of those who don't are two subgroups:  Those who say its unfunny and stupid, and those who say \\"I just don't get it\\". Well the ironic thing is the people who say its stupid really just don't get, either.    I suppose it depends on your sense of humor. If you have a deep, layered, and intricate sense of humor, you will find Mony Python funny (and no, I am not kidding). If your sense of humor is less developed, more of a crudely constructed singular grasp of what 'humor' is, chances are you will not find Monty Python funny. Or, I may just not know what the hell I'm talking about.     The real joke here is that on the surface, it appears there is nothing to 'get' about the humor that runs rampant in the Monty Python sketches. It all seems so simple and juvenile. Well, that's the true genius of the Python troupe. Their comedy is actually QUITE complex, and works on several different levels.  The fact that they make it all look so easy is amazing to me. Holy Grail is the best of the Python movies, and has SO many classic moments its hard to remember them all. My personal favorite is Lancelot getting frisked at the end.     If you have never seen a Monty Python project, this is the one to start with. You will either find it funny, or you won't, and you will then know which group you belong to.      As an aside, is their ANYTHING funnier than someone proclaiming they have a great sense of humor, and then saying Monty Python isn't funny? Now THAT'S comedy!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|EASLIY 1 OF THE GREATEST ALBUMs EVER MADE BUY IT!
B000002INR|5.0|Wow. This really blew me away once I first heard this. Is it me, or are all debut albums some of the best albums? Ah, who knows ah? <br /> <br />So, I got this album in the start of Cross-Country. \\"18 and life\\" is one of my favorite songs right off the bat. It was quite a good song to listen too when we were getting ready for the big races. In the begining of that song, you heard that HUGE and HARD power chord. Wow, I've never heard anything like it. I love that begining. I just feel like I want to pick up a guitar and play power chords. <br /> <br />On the song: \\"Can't Stand the Heartache\\", it's quite a normal ballad. Except, they call their lover twisted. HAHA. See, on the bus to the meets, it's hard to listen to this song, since the person I \\"like\\" is on the same bus. Ugh huh? Otherwise, it's a great ballad song, it's hard, fast, and not slow. <br /> <br />\\"Youth Gone Wild\\"- oh baby, what a song. Was this ever an anthem? Well, it should've been, since it's hard, fast, and it throws the point out there. Ha, and I feel young. This song makes you fall out of your chair. <br /> <br />\\"I Remember You\\"- It's a good song indeed. I don't listen to it alot for some reason, but I have listened to it. It's very catchy. <br /> <br />Other songs- their just like \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" except not so hard, and loud.  <br /> <br />If you're a hair metal fan, this is a nessary ingredient to the hair metal equation. Also, I think we should go back to the hair metal/classic rock days. It's possible. Haha. Maybe one day, maybe one day. <br /> <br />Anyway, I hope you people have had a great Holiday. Remember, there is always a reason to celebrate.
0670033375|5.0|\\"Collapse\\" should be mandatory reading for all government officials, and I'd recommend it for anyone else, also. While Diamond has a pleasant, upbeat writing style, and professes to be optimistic about the future of a planet on its way to environmental destruction, one can't help but be filled with a feeling of dread while reading this. Simply put, the book makes a compelling case for the idea that man is slowly destroying the earth, and every living thing on it. And the pace of that destruction is increasing. <br /> <br />This isn't the best book I've ever read, but it's probably the most important. The message that you will receive is that man must change his ways, and change them now. This book is too important to be ignored!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|At first I felt a little apprensive getting this CD after I heard a very high-pitched voice in the music. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a music major or anything, but just the sound of the music and maybe certain parts of Jonsi's voice convinced me I couldn't go wrong with it.  <br /> <br />I've heard some recommendations, and that Sigur Ros sounded like Radiohead and Bjork, felt that I actually liked both to a certain degree, and just shrugged and decided what the hell. I probably shouldn't say that this is my favorite CD since I've only had it for about a day or two, but I can say that a lot of my favorite music makes me feel something, and Sigur Ros does that exactly without hesitation. <br /> <br />I absolutely love how there's no structure to their music. A lot of mainstream music, I believe, falls short of making me feel a connection, mostly because of the strict form each artist believes they have to follow. But as with Sigur Ros, their music is simply a flow of spontaneity. And that works perfectly. <br /> <br />Another thing I like about this album is that whatever song that has legible lyrics is sung in icelandic. I suppose these tracks would sound horrible if sung in English, just as how Japanese-to-English translations are always poor. I read that Jonsi uses his voice as another instrument of sorts, occasionally speaking in gibberish just to add to the sound - again, the sound - of the music. I also read that some of the songs have some kind of story behind them, like the last track, how it's about a man dying peacefully and happily. What's nice about this music is that the listener could create a story behind the music. And the icelandic lyrics keep it ambiguous. <br /> <br />Track 8, titled Gong, is my favorite of all the tracks. I feel a very strong connection to the sound of this music. I feel like I'm running away from something, or escaping from a past self, only to arrive at another facet of life. And especially that the lyrics are haunting... I don't even have to listen to the song to hear it replaying in my mind. Just goes to show how incredibly good music imbeds itself into my memory. <br /> <br />Other songs I feel a strong connection to: Saeglopur (because of the intense drum/guitar sequence about two minutes into the song), Glosoli (kind of brings me back. I feel like I'm back in a childhood without a society to suppress me), Andvari (the track that just goes perfectly with Gong. Just a track to feel calm and at peace with. Kind of a sad but lovely tune). <br /> <br />All the other tracks I love, don't get me wrong. They're perfectly...perfect, in my ears. <br /> <br />And because I love Sigur Ros so much, I ordered Agaetis byrjun, their previous album. I want to really get into their sound, just soak it all up.
B0000AM6IY|1.0|West Side Story if the best film ever made.  One of the reasons it is so great is the ensemble dance sequences.  You need a 2.35 aspect ration DVD to see the full granduer of this film.  This film won 10 Oscars.  It deserves the respect of seeing it the way Daniel Fapp shot the film and Robert Wise directed it.  The delux edition is in widescreen.  It has great extra features and a book with the script and photos.  The extra cost is definitely worth it.  NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SINGLE DISC FULL SCREEN EDITION ONLY BUT IS ALSO APPEARING IN DELUX EDITION!  NOTE 2: Note to Amazon - you should only show reviews and rating for the specific item only.  Offer to see reviews of other similar products (i.e. Blu Ray, Deluxe Editions, etc. but the reviews should be for this specific product.  If I bought this thinking it was the widescreen or had special features included on another version because of a review, I would be really upset.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series continues to pop up on various SCI-FI lists with other respected series' like BSG and STNG, so I watched a couple on SCI-Fi and was hooked. Like the new BSG, this series provides most of its entertainment through the interaction of its widely varied characters, not special effects.  I am in that long list of fans willing to pay Joss Whedon now for more internet/DVD releases later ;-)
B00003CXAE|3.0|I saw Grease on stage and hated it but when the film came out with Olivia Newton John (who I had a crush on), I had to see it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there was not a lot of improvement.  The film is set in 1959.  Rock n roll is just making its influence felt.  This film is about those who embraced rock n roll as their lifestyle.  A sort of bad musical version or the Blackboard Jungle meets Gidget.  <br /> <br />The only truely positive thing I can say about this film is a fantastic performance by Stockard Channing.  She proved early that she was a rare breed.  An actor that can be good despite the material! <br /> <br />The musical score ranges from very good to very mediocre.  If you like the songs, get the music videos from the film. <br /> <br />The book / screenplay is very thin.  This is not a film for the musical conneisuer.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I saw the film this past weekend for my first time.  I have seen the show 14 times and Sarah Brightman in concert also twice.  I have to say that I love Emily playing Christine.  She is the best thing in the movie.  I also liked Patrick Wilson.  When Patrick and her sing on top of the theater its great.  I think the weakest point initially is the singing of the Phantom.  Yes you do get used to him and he sounds great by the end but that initial singing calling her from the mirror after Christine's first triumph is just shocking.  He is no Michael Crawford.  But is does look great and like I said Emly Rossum is the second best thing to Sarah Brightman.  She is just amazing.  I liked the movie and will watch it again.  Just expect it not to be the soundtrack of the broadway show.
B000089RVX|5.0|Hey I'm sure you know this is a good album, they were overplayed but that's okay I guess. There are a lot of good songs on here. Anyway, I hate when people write a review like what I'm about to do, but I need to. This is about Kid's Reviews. They shouldn't be here. They shoudn't be allowed to write reviews because the local pop station plays a song on the cd and they like the way it sounds. So please. Stop with the Kid's Reviews.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|Yes....Johnny Depp...NO...not even close...BUD...its just that simple. The reviews can actually all stop here. Depp falls down....the remake with him...whereas Wilder PROPELLS the original!!

Not about other things. But isnt that wat music is about? expressing your emotions. thats wat kurt does and it tells a story of his life. <br /> <br />Or mabye u hate it cause of the perfectness or because of the raw tune that does not change during the solos witch actully have more than instrument so its not a freakin' solo.... <br /> <br />some people think kurt was a bad person because of the drugs and suicide. but if u look beyond that u will see that he was a fun loving guy that loved his life(until he got on drugs)Also he never would have got on the drug seen if someone would have taught him about about the harmful effects of drugs. <br /> <br />His mental ishues and abusive parents screwed him up.But his music was good... <br /> <br />n <br />ni <br />nir <br />nirv <br />nirva <br />nirvan <br />nirvana <br />nirvan <br />nirva <br />nirv <br />nir <br />ni <br />n
0060234822|5.0|HarperCollins' renumbering of the Chronicles of Narnia is a disgusting desecration of a great work of literature. As far as I can tell, Lewis never instructed his publisher to reorder the series, he merely mentioned casually in a letter that it would be okay to read them chronologically. That hardly constitutes a statement of \\"the original wishes of the author,\\" as HarperCollins claims. <br /> <br />The editors at HarperCollins seem to think that the children for whom these books were intended are so unintelligent that they would get too confused if they were to read them in the order in which Lewis wrote them. Never mind the fact that millions of children have thoroughly enjoyed them in the their original order for half a century. <br /> <br />Next thing you know, HarperCollins will be reordering the chapters in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey because modern readers must be too stupid to follow them as they have been read for over two thousand years. <br /> <br />If you are new to the Chronicles of Narnia, do yourself  a favor: get a permanent marker, blackout the numbers on your books, and re-renumber them back to their original order: <br /> <br />1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe <br />2) Prince Caspian <br />3) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader <br />4) The Silver Chair <br />5) The Horse and His Boy <br />6) The Magician's Nephew <br />7) The Last Battle
B00006RU5B|4.0|What makes me laugh is the constant argument between Rage Against the Machine fans and Soundgarden fans. Both bands were great. Both Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and Zack de la Rocha (RATM) were geniouses, but everything about them is so different, you can't compare. Zack de la Rocha was a crazy Mexican rapper obsessed with racial injustice against his fellow Mexicans and the political machine. Put him together with Tom Morello (whoever thinks he is not the best guitarist of our time should be shot) and Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk, and you got the best band of the 1990's. Soundgarden wasn't as good as Rage, but they are still great and one of my favorite bands today.    So goodbye Zack de la Rocha in 2000 and enter Chris Cornell. At first I didn't think Cornell would be a good replacement for Zack de la Rocha, but after buying their self-titled debut I was totally wrong. Most of the songs are great, like \\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How To Live\\", \\"Gasoline\\", \\"What You Are\\", \\"Light My Way\\", \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\" and many more. The album does start to slow down in the middle and the inconsistancy gets a little annoying but it is still descent all the way through. A good debut.    But for everyone who is arguing about this, it is time to shut up now. For Rage fans, it's over. Get it? Over. I am disappointed that my favorite band is gone too, but you know what, life goes on.  Audioslave's two albums are great, and if Zack de la Rocha would ever release his solo album, then that would be good. Will Audioslave ever be as good as Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden? No. But are they a solid band with a good debut and an even better sophomore album? Yes. Audioslave's two albums should satisfy you. They are not the best band in the world, but they are good. I recommend \\"Out of Exile\\" over their debut, but the debut is still a good album.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Amazing Movie!
B000AADYRQ|2.0|One of my favorite bands of all time has just gone major label and the outcome is just horrible. Anyways I shouldn't blame their major label jump entirely - I had a feeling that Transatlanticism was their first step downwards. May they rest in peace. <br /> <br />BTW, they have ruined the song \\"Stability\\" (one of my favorite DCFC songs of all time) completely with their new version \\"Stable Song\\".
B00081U7HC|5.0|The Pygmalion/Cinderella stories combined, with no pretensions of being more than it is: a Hollywood fairy tale. (It's even set in Hollywood.) Richard Gere is a super-rich company buyout whiz, cold and exacting, and Julia Roberts is a hooker he picks up. He dresses her up pretty, teaches her a few things, and the inevitable happens. He wants her to go back to NYC with him where he'll \\"set her up,\\" but she wants the fairy tale, kit and kaboodle. She gets her wish at the end.<br /><br />Unabashedly fluffy and light, with few surprises, but entertaining nonetheless. Gere plays his cold exterior role perfectly and Roberts is excellent, too - not once crossing over into bad taste, which would've been easy to do. Everything about the movie feels controlled, almost suffocatingly so, though Gere's character has a lot to do with that. Not a great movie, but a good one - and conceived within very meager, short-sighted boundaries, where it succeeds. Not bad at all; worth a watch.
0307276902|5.0|A memoir that reads like fiction (unbelievable?)in a number of places yet is griping, raw, bleak, hopeful and inspirational all in one.  Describes the hopelessness and the long odds of overcoming an addiction and the discipline and reconciliation necessary to do so.  This book is hard to put down although in many places it was heart wrenching and gruesome.  I read the Year of Magical Thinking (Didion) before this book and there is no comparison...AMLP is a page turner and will leave you thinking for years to come.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The film was truely adapted from the book, but just missing too much important information!! I think if the film was made in part 1 and part 2, will be a lot better! However, the scene of the dementors attacking Harry Potter and Sirus Black, then Harry Potter cased the spell in the opposite side of the lake, it was excellent! Exactly the same as the book and my imagination! (only that I imagined the lake was bigger)<br /><br />There was too much information missing in the movie:<br /><br />1) The ghost house they mentioned was in fact the house Professor Lupin hided during full moon when he was young. When he transformed into Werewolf, it was painful and he made some very terrible screaming, that's why people thought it was a ghost house.<br /><br />2) The magical map was actually made by Harry Potter's Father, Sirus Black, Lupin and the Wormtail! They were good friends when they were young in Hogwarts. They were very naughty, wondering around Hogwarts and found out all the secret passways, some even Dumbodore doesn't know! The four names on the map \\"padfoot, wormtail, moony and staghorn?\\" (can't remember exactly the names, but something like that) are their nicknames! Padfoot as a dog, wormtail as a mouse, moony and wolf and staghorn as a stag (male deer).<br /><br />3) The 3 friends knows Lupin is a werewolf, so they transform themselves into animals, play and fight with the werewolf in the ghost house during fullmoon. James Potter transforms into a stag. That's why Harry saw a stag on the opposite side of the lake.<br /><br />4) Prisoners in Azkarban normally turn mad because the dementors sucked out all their happiness. Only Sirus Black could survive because he had a strong mind and always keep guarding his happy memory, something like that, can't remember very clearly. In the book Sirus Black was very powerful and misterious, since he only appears in the last 1/3 of the book. In movie....<br /><br />5) Remember in Harry Potter 1, Hagrid rided a bike from the sky, carried baby Harry Potter to Dumbodore? in the book, (actually book 1 already mentioned, from Hagrid's mouth.) Sirus Black arrived the murder scene earlier, when Hagrid arrived, Sirus Black decided Dumbodore could protect Harry Potter better, so he gave his bike to Hagrid and let Hagrid take the baby away.<br /><br />6) Sirus Black found out it was Wormtail who betrayed James Potter, when he got the mouse guy, Wormtail shouted Sirus Black was the servant of You Know Who, cut his finger, transformed to a mouse and ran away. The Wizard Ministry arrived and found Sirus Black, and a finger, so they thought Sirus Black killed and destroyed the mouse guy. And locked him into Azkaban.<br /><br />7) Wormtail then hide as a pet in Wisley's family for twelve years...<br /><br />8) Harry Potter should received the new broom half way through the story, and didn't know who sent him the gift. Later found out it was Sirus Black.<br /><br />9) At the end of story, Harry should receive Sirus Black's picture and he became clean and tidy, more human again.<br /><br />10) In the scene of students practicing defense against Boogie in the cupboard, in the book Lupin's fear should be a silver sphere, which no one knew what it was in the beginning. In the movie it was too obvious that his fear was a full moon (with cloud!?)<br /><br />11) In movie it didn't explain why Hermoine went mad and frastrated, it was because she took too many lessons.<br /><br />12) Harry Potter fainted every time when he met the dementors. However, everytime before he faint, he heard of his mother's screaming before she died. This was the memory deep inside Harry Potter. He heard a little bit more each time he fainted, so as the story goes, he actually want to meet the dementors so he could find out more about his parents' death. Which was an very dangerous desire.<br /><br />I understand the movie is only around 2 hours and sacrifices have to be made, and since Harry Potter was the main character, the story of the previous generation had to be eliminated. But sadly that was the best part of the book, so I was terribly disappointed.<br /><br />Anyway, if you enjoy the movie, I strongly recommend you to read the book, you will not be able to put it down once started reading it!!was the main character, the story of the previous generation had to be eliminated. But sadly that was the best part of the book, so I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you enjoy the movie, I strongly recommend you to read the book, you will not be able to put it down once started reading it!!
B000066HI4|5.0|For an avid Will Oldham fan like me this album started as a surprise. It actually sounds good! The sound is now more polished, the music not recorded at once and the voice not as shaky as it used to be. You could say it's a more commercial touch but he certainly deserves more credit for his songwriting skills. <br /> <br />The first song 'A Minor Place' relies completly on melody, it's hard to think that the first 2,5 minutes are really the same but the melody is great and should therefor be part of the Oldham top 10.  <br />Second song 'Nomadic Revery' has a haunting chorus in the Appalachian style that could have been sung by David Eugene Edwards of 16 Horsepower. <br />Track 3 might actually be his most famous song but not in this version but song by Johnny Cash on his American Recordings III. Like so many songs (U2's 'One' for example) that version is actually slightly better. <br /> <br />The quality remains very high throughout the album. The lyrics still are not the most cheerful (Death to Everyone, which does have a lalala part). <br /> <br />I am not sure if I think this is Oldham's best album, I still listen to his Palace-work more, but it certainly is great album and he shows that he is one of the greatest indie songwriters, up there with people like Lou Barlow.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|1 star for Hollywood ALWAYS making ancient Greeks and Romans speak in English accents.  Whay must they also always make the leads blond hair and blue eyed Europeans and keep the dark-haired Euro/Afro-Asiatic Greeks who looke more like the real deal in the background?  They do this in all films.  In Egyptian movies, they make the leads white and have the Africans play the back.  Foolishness! <br /> <br />Not only that, but I hate it when Hollywood makes movies such as these and rewrites history and writes scripts to make the characters reference their places in history, as if they all knew it back then.  No wonder this flopped. <br /> <br />I don't even want to talk about the acting.  Pitt sucks.  People keep changing their accents all of the time, except for the British actors of course.  Greece and Rome is not Britain.  The British did not even know who they were or where they were when Greec and Rome were going on.
B00007AJF9|4.0|\\"Elizabeth\\" is a fine biopic that deals with the early reign of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. The film is full of elegance and pageantry, but the storytelling is kind of weak, and hard to follow at times. But these shortcomings are made up by good performances by a unique cast. Cate Blanchett (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" Trilogy) gives an immensely powerful and intimate portrayal of Elizabeth I, and Christopher Eccleston (\\"The Others\\"; TV's \\"Doctor Who\\") is menacing as the Duke of Norfolk. The supporting cast (Which includes Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Richard Attenborough) also give strong, solid performances.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good film that takes a unique and unrelenting look at the Queen who changed the history of Britain forever.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
0399245030|5.0|poignant in its subtlety, the gorgeous illustrations exaggerate scale (both small and great) to brilliantly accent the truth that a friend is worth the finding
B00005K3O4|4.0|The killer clowns may already be here. Can you see them? Go to your local circus the next time they come. But take a look, a close look. Great paced thriller is outstanding and a must see underground classic. Very moving and disturbing.
B000777J2S|5.0|Yes, this album isn't for those used to top 40. It may even turn off the most open of listeners. But what you absolutely cannot deny is that the emotion on this album is so rich, pure, and achingly heartfelt that if you listen a sincere ear, as if you were listening to a friend pouring his heart to you, your heart will break wide open right along with him. Some may be annoyed by the vibrato in his voice, but while others do it to be showy and technical, I can  feel the emotion behind his voice. Some sing to try and find their emotions. He merely sings what he feels. <br /> <br />This is not the emperor's new clothes. If it were, it wouldn't bring tears to one's eyes. Music is about heart, not song structure, not 100% accuracy, and certainly not appeasing the masses. Oh, and you may also notice that two reviewers that gave this album 1 star used very descriptive words such as \\"poop\\" and \\"turd\\", respectively. Nice job, guys. I suppose you want to give Antony a wedgie, too?
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This CD is catchy, fun, and very different than most bands out right now.  They have good flow and every song is a potential favorite. ...oh yes and the disco/techno flavor is pretty cool, mixes well.<br /><br />Top 3-<br /><br />The Only Difference..<br /><br />Time To Dance<br /><br />I Write Sins Not Tragedies
B00004XONN|5.0|I have been listening to Radiohead for about 3 years now, and this is without a doubt my favorite album by them (not to say I don't love their other albums). This album is beautiful (although somewhat cold and dark) and very unique, unlike anything you've ever heard. Unlike previous releases like Pablo Honey, The Bends, and OK Computer, this album is somewhat less guitar driven and more electronic in many areas. I'm not gonna say that's a good thing or a bad thing, it's a matter of personal preference. <br /> <br />There is absolutely no filler on this album, every song is very unique and absolutely outstanding. HOWEVER, if you are reading this and new to Radiohead, do not start with this album.... i'd recommend starting with The Bends and moving in chronological order.
0307276902|3.0|I just finished reading this book and decided to go online to google up information regarding any previous featherweight champion of the world who became a crack addict or was killed (as it was told in the book). I couldn't find any information on that but google did pull up an amazon reviewer that tried to do the same thing as I had. He has since stated that he feels this book is at least 90% fiction. After reading a few reviews I have decided to review this book as well.  <br /> <br />This book attempts to give readers a glimpse into the thought patterns of an addict and helps to rehumanize these individuals who are dealing with very tragic circumstances. And for that I applaud it. The book did make me cry and I did enjoy most of it until the very end. Because of this I think the book is worth reading. <br /> <br />The unfortunate aspect of this book is that it is billed as a memoir. There isn't even a disclaimer in the beginning stating that \\"all names have been changed to protect the privacy of others\\". People reading this book will honestly believe that this is the journey an addict takes albeit a special one. I don't believe this to be true. This book is sensationalized so that this particular story of addiction stands out (ie. sells) amongst the countless others that will never be retold.  <br /> <br />This book should not be passed onto a recovering addict or relatives/friends of an addict because the words on the pages will not ring true. Frey recounts his moments of overwhelming urges and how he manages to resist them with something as simple as a conscious decision. If addiction was/is as simple as that he would not have been an addict for 10 years. It will leave people who are going through (or have gone through) this type of experience feeling cheated over the way Frey chooses to showoff.  <br /> <br />I can relate to the hurt, pain, fear that Frey describes his relatives feeling. I can also understand the struggle that he faced in overcoming his addiction. But the road to recovery is not like the glorified one he depicts. Addicts do not leave rehab and go to a bar to buy a pint full of hard liquor to test themselves. Addicts who do that will fail.  <br /> <br />Recovery is for a lifetime and Frey belittles it. He tells us that people who need ongoing support for the rest of their lives are trading an addiction for another addiction. But he fails to say that that it is a small price to pay for recovery. He tells us that he is strong because defied the rules and did it his own way. But he fails to say that he is no stronger than anybody else going through this and that recovery is recovery. <br /> <br />If you never have to face or see addiction then this book is a good read because it won't matter if it rings true or not. For many of the readers of Oprah's book club this hopefully will be the case. <br /> <br />However, this book is very misleading and possibly detrimental to people who mistakenly believe it is a 100% true memoir and are reading it to understand and deal with addiction. There are too many reasons why this book could not be entirely truthful. Frey is NOT the \\"one in a million\\" who did it his own way and succeeded. Billing this as the truth affects the whole premise of the book.
B00009ATKS|4.0|i like to listen to this album at night when i am alone. it is a great album to just sit back and get lost in the moods of the music.... i often find my mind drifting between focusing on the music and my own thoughts. it isn't exactly \\"happy music for happy people\\" but it's not painfully depressing either.... it is music that might bring you down if you're happy, or bring you up if you're depressed.    one great thing about mogwai is that when you are alone it really enhances the enviroment you are in. i guess you have to listen to experience it, but there is nothing like a long walk at night listening to an album like this.     this isn't the kind of album i listen to everyday, but it is an album i will keep in my catalog for years to come.    out of 10, i'd give this album about an 8.5, therefore i highly recommend it.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A.  From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason.  In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three.  The result.  Fillers.  Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated.  Anesiac is almost the opposite.  It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as \\"I Might Be Wrong,\\" \\"Pact,\\" and \\"Hunting Bears\\" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions.  Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one.  I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning rock album! Since Pink Floyd has such a large and diverse catalog of music, it is sometimes hard to rank their albums, but i would definitely place this album towards the top of the list. My favorite on the album is the 17 minute long \\"Dogs,\\" which has one of my favorite guitar solos from Gilmour. Although this album essentially only has 3 songs (not counting the 1.5 minute opening and closing songs) they are 3 of the greatest rock songs ever made. To be perfectly honest I am not a huge classic rock fan, but whenever I'm in the mood to rock out this is the album i listen to. <br /> <br />Other than the length of the songs i don't really understand why this album never reached the status of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Although those are also great albums, I find that i get tired of them more often than I do with \\"Animals.\\" To me, this album feels more timeless than it's predecessors. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I have to say I loved the film, and understand the decision to make the three main characters younger than they were in the original stange production (having a 30 something Christine would simply not feel right when you think of how innocent and naive her character is) the Phantom is just a bit too hunky for my tastes. He looks like .grind in a g-string.  <br /> <br />Gerald Butler acts and sings the role well, but he's made to look like he's just stepped off the cover of a romance novel, all open shirts and smoking sexuality (I just can't see the phantom doing sit ups). Even the makeup has been cut back to the point that he's just not that ugly, I could actually have seen half the women in the audience saying to themselves \\"Yeah, so he's killed a bunch of people and stalked he for years, I'd still have him\\". <br /> <br />Apparently when they were filming the ball sequence an 85 year old lady who had worked on one of the previous Phantom films visited the set, when she saw Butler in full Phantom costume she said \\"Ohh, I'd drop my knickers for him\\"... scary, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UR7|3.0|this album has more of a generic pop feel to it than other radiohead albums. considering how amazing radiohead is nowadays, you would have expected a more powerful debut than this. yes, there are some good tracks on here (creep, you, thinking about you) but it pales in comparison to radiohead's later work. even the bends, which was released only 2 years after this album, puts this album to shame. i don't think this album is bad, i mean it's better than most (if not all) of the garbage on mtv nowadays. <br /> <br />if you are new to radiohead i recommend starting with the bends and moving forwards from there, and come back to this one later. if you were to buy only one radiohead album, i would go with kid a or ok computer. <br /> <br />7.0/10
B00079FUI6|5.0|I love the show, it simply shows the women out there what happens after you jump the fence of matrimony and family life. While in Sex and the City the girls were trying hard to find the Mr. Perfect to cure all their problems, here in DH they show that the other pastures are not always greener. I love the tagline: every family has its dirty laundry. It indeed has. <br />About the characters, Bree would be the most annoying and perfect housewife, but after a while you sympathize with her, she is really what she is, she is not out there to compete and make other women inadequate, she is just a perfectionist person. And though Gabrielle is a wretched and adulterous wife, it is hard to hate her, I found her to be quite cute in her schemes. But the one my heart sympathizes more is Lynette the burnout mother, though she needs to learn to spank her kids. She is the real portrait of the suburban mother that cannot rest a minute and is thinking about going back to work (I've been there, I know what is like). The only character that seems quite odd to me is Susan, she doesn't seem to have passed through real motherhood. Her daughter is more like girl friend, their relationship seems false or maybe her daughter never grew up at home, was shipped to some boarding school. The woman is pathetic, needs her daughter to advise about life and everything. <br />About the guys, the only husband that I found nice was Mr. Solis, he adores his wife though he is busy to keep company to her all the time, she needs to busy herself in a fulfilling work, not a lover, after all no husband or any man can fill all the hours of the day by your side, pampering you, whorshipping you, so get real.
B00006BTCA|5.0|i have been listening to this album for about 2 years, and it just never seems to get old. this is probably my favorite debut album of all time, right next to joy division's \\"unknown pleasures.\\" i became interested in interpol because i had heard \\"obstacle 1\\" in a skateboard video and after a while it got stuck in my head. i downloaded the rest of the album, and didn't really like it. a few weeks later, i listened to it a couple more times, and noticed the songs gradually became more and more stuck in my head. since then i have probably listened to the album over 500 times. this album really grows on you, so give it a chance. <br /> <br />my favorite song on this album is definitely \\"leif erikson,\\" but if you are new to the band try tracks like obstacle 1, pda, nyc, and say hello to the angels. i would rate the album above their second album \\"antics,\\" but give that one a shot as well, i'm sure you will find something you like. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! <br /> <br />9.5/10
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I loved the book when I was young, but never really got into the sequel, about the glass elevator. I don't ever remember watching the original with Gene Wilder - but then I don't remember ever watching the original Oliver, but I used to have it taped off the TV, so I guess I must have watched it at some point. It's probably the same for the original.<br /><br />Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Nicolas Cage, Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Michael Keaton were all considered for the role of Willy Wonka. Marilyn Manson also badly wanted the part. I could quite imagine Marilyn Manson in the part actually, but there's something not quite right about Johnny Depp in this. I dunno what it was. Maybe it was because he's not in the least bit attractive in this (you'd have to be of a sick mind to find THAT attractive), or maybe it just didn't work. Tim Burton & Johnny Depp made a pretty good team in other movies, but just not in this one. I think they failed.<br /><br />Also, there was way too many special effects. Not something you would normally complain about, but basically, Tim used every effect in the book. And it's just too glossy in the end. The Oompa-Loompas are very weird also, and the songs were slightly nauseating.<br /><br />However, I did like Freddie Highmore in this - hopefully he won't turn out to be a precocious child actor. I also liked the fact we got a brief glimpse into Willy Wonka's childhood, and how he came to be the master of chocolate. It was quite interesting, but the brace was a little freaky - but apparently, that was taken from Tim's childhood.<br /><br />Also, I loved how the grandparents were brought to life, all those years ago when I first read the book. They were exactly how I imagined them, and it was fabulous.<br /><br />I think the glass elevator was incorporated into this, simply so there wouldn't be a sequel. I'm hoping so anyway, but as I say, I can't remember much of the sequel, because I couldn't get into it. Some of the buttons on the glass elevator say: Incompetent Fools; T-Bone Steak Jell-O; Secretarial Poodles; Cocoa Cats; Mechanical Clouds; Stars in their Pies; Nice Plums; Up And Out; Fragile Egos; Black Box of Frogs; Weird Lollipops; Mighty Jam Monitor; Creative Dog Flip; Elastic Forest; Leaky Canes; Dessert Island; People Poo; Pie Cream; Spewed Vegetables; Naffy Taffy; Lickety Split Peas; Honeycombs and Brushes and Old Sneezes and Smells Dept.<br /><br />It was very faithful to the book, although I think, if I can remember correctly (it has been quite a few years), the ending is a little bit different, as that bit was all new to me.<br /><br />I'm still not sure about Johnny's portrayal of Willy Wonka, it's quite disturbing actually. But I won't let that distract me from an alright film. It was nothing special really, and the OTT special effects, could have been toned down.lass elevator say: Incompetent Fools; T-Bone Steak Jell-O; Secretarial Poodles; Cocoa Cats; Mechanical Clouds; Stars in their Pies; Nice Plums; Up And Out; Fragile Egos; Black Box of Frogs; Weird Lollipops; Mighty Jam Monitor; Creative Dog Flip; Elastic Forest; Leaky Canes; Dessert Island; People Poo; Pie Cream; Spewed Vegetables; Naffy Taffy; Lickety Split Peas; Honeycombs and Brushes and Old Sneezes and Smells Dept.

B00005QXXO|4.0|when i first picked up this album about a year and a half ago, i was a little dissapointed to find out that there were only 8 tracks on this album. i don't know why they didn't put in at least another 2 or 3 songs, as they most definitely had the material..... <br /> <br />that aside, this really is a terrific live album. the live version of \\"everything in its right place\\" is VERY different from the album version, so if you are a huge \\"kid a\\" fan like me you will be pleasantly surprised. i also like how the song \\"like spinning plates\\" translates onto piano, it sounds fantastic. however, the standout song on this album has to be \\"true love waits\\". it is a terrific acoustic song that is not available on any other radiohead album. <br /> <br />since this album now only costs 9 bucks on amazon, you can't really go wrong, it's a good deal. and although i complain about their only being 8 tracks, the album still exceedes the 40 minute mark, so i guess it's not THAT bad. <br /> <br />8.2/10
0743454537|5.0|I'll start by saying I've read all of Picoult's books, and I love them all. But this is by far my favorite. Without going into much detail, it's about a family. They have a daughter with a rare cancer, and are told without a match to provide donations of all types, they cannot save her. No one is a match. So they concieve another daughter to be her match. This girl is born solely to help the sick daughter. As the match daughter gets older, she realizes she doesn't want to be THE doner for her sister anymore. She goes to a lawyer to get medical emancipation from her parents.<br /><br />I found this book to be extremely interesting, as you get torn between the feelings of the daughter, the parents, and the sick child. It even had me calling up people, telling them the story, and asking what they thought. Jodi Picoult is an amazing writer and she really sets the scene and brings you into the book, along for the ride. I plan to read this book over and over throughout my life, because it puts life in perspective for you and makes you appreciate what you do have. I wouldn't hesitate to give this book to ANYONE to read....
B000B8QEYC|5.0|If you've never listened to Enya, shame on you!  You're missing out on some of the greatest tunes. <br /> <br />Amarantine is yet another succesful CD by Enya.  The music and lyrics are wonderfully simple and sound great.   <br /> <br />Stressed out? Having a tough time falling asleep? Pick up an Enya CD. <br /> <br />Another reason I like it is because it doesn't stick annoyingly in your head.  When it does, it usually plays somewhere undistractingly at the back of your mind.   <br /> <br />It's great and I recommend it for all.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|In 1977, Kraftwerk released the album, \\"Trans Europe Express.\\"  It's a good album overall.  I don't find this as fun as \\"Computer World\\" or \\"Electric Cafe.\\"  But there's still plenty of nice tunes here.   <br /> <br />The album contains seven tracks. It starts with \\"Europe Endless.\\" This tune is very happy-sounding and has great keyboarding. It's also danceable. \\"Hall Of Mirrors\\" is the next song. It's a soft song with the sound of echoing footsteps as the only percussion used. There's also the chorus, \\"Even the greatest stars  themselves in the looking glass.\\" (The verb varies.) \\"Showroom Dummies\\" is a funny song where the members of Kraftwerk are these mannequins who come to life. \\"We start to move... and then we break the glass. We are showroom dummies. We are showroom dummies.\\" They break out, go around the city, and find a club. \\"We go into a club and then we start to dance. We are showroom dummies...\\" Because they've entered a club, I'm hoping they got some good threads on. Hehehehehehehe. The \\"Trans Europe Express\\" single is the fourth track on the album. Now, this is a cool tune. It's got these funky beats that just keep me moving. Afrika Bambaataa sampled this song for his 1982 hit, \\"Planet Rock.\\" The music in track four continues through the start of track five, \\"Metal On Metal.\\" There's more percussion added to the song. Sounds like what's heard inside a factory. The two-in-one song ends with a train roaring by. \\"Franz Schubert\\" is track six. The keyboarding from \\"Europe Endless\\" is included. \\"FS\\" is followed by the final track, \\"Endless Endless.\\" Just like with the \\"Trans Europe Express\\"/\\"Metal On Metal\\" fusion, the music keeps going through \\"Endless Endless.\\" The music fades away while robotic voices repeatedly sing, \\"Endless\\" in this minute-long track. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an enjoyable CD.  I like it.  I'm pleased that I got this.
0975991477|2.0|No mention of the ground-breaking work of Dr. Candace Pert? <br />Oh yeah, and thanks for adding the Appendix which invites us to spend more money on your friend's program. I believe you could have explained your technique to the reader. Or, maybe it doesen't work. After hearing you SO excited and stimulating about your ideas on a certain well-known radio talk show program, I expected more from you than this. Your book is a disappoinment.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|\\"In The Zone\\" was one of Britney's most highly anticipated records. 2 years following the release of \\"Britney\\", fans expected a flawless record. With the hype surrounding Britney's new sound, and clips of some tracks off of \\"In The Zone\\" being leaked, fans were excited for the record. To me, this record was a bit of a letdown, but a good album nonetheless. There are some outstanding tracks on here, but there a few songs they could've done without, which kind of ruins the album. <br /> <br />1. Me Against the Music 3.6/5 <br />A good intro, but the song sounds like it has too much going on, including Madonna.  <br /> <br />2. (I got that) Boom Boom ft. Ying Yang Twins 2.8/5 <br />Again, too much going on. The song had the potential to be a great song, simple but danceable R&B beat, a somewhat catchy chorus, but the obnoxious whiny sound of the Ying Yang Twins weakens it. <br /> <br /> <br />3. Showdown 3.8/5 <br />This is where Britney starts to experiment a little. The song has a soft-uptempo beat, and Britney's sensual, yet subtle, lyrics, and the guitar riffs make it a great listen. <br /> <br /> <br />4. Breathe on Me 4/5 <br />Britney's voice seems to mix well with electronic tracks. The song is a perfect, and sexy dance song. <br /> <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin 3.1/5 <br />Still following the theme of the previous two tracks, a nice uptempo song, with a soft, slower melody. The lyrics are kind of cheesy, and the beat can get kind of bland after a few listens. <br /> <br /> <br />6. Toxic 4.7/5 <br />Perfect! This song is flawless pop! Great flow, Great chorus, Awesome production, the electro dance record of the millenium.  <br /> <br /> <br />7. Outrageous 2.0/5 <br />This is where the album sustains it's sloppiness. The first 25 seconds is enjoyable, but you keep expecting more, but it doesnt deliver. The beat is repetitious, and the lyrics are boring, it sounds like a crap demo. R.Kelly gave Britney one of his throw away productions. <br /> <br /> <br />8. Touch of My Hand 4.3/5 <br />This is where Britney tackles her most provocative subject, masturbation. The song doesn't come off as a sleazy, sex induced record. She handles the song with subtle lyrics, that paint a picture, and give you a kind of whimsical, yet sensual feeling. Very sexy, and the Asian strings, and Electronic beats, make this a great pop record. <br /> <br />9. The Hook Up 3.4/5 <br />A danceable song, with a Caribbean, R&B esque stlye, and Britney's pop vocals. The song is fun to listen to, and dance to, but nothing outstanding. <br /> <br /> <br />10. Shadow 4/5 <br />The most dark song on the album. \\"Shadow\\" is quasi Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm With You\\", faux alternative, with surprisingly decent vocals from the lacking Britney. A good record, one of In The Zone's finer records. <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl 1.3/5 <br />The crappiest Britney song to date (And no, I havent forgot about \\"Soda Pop\\"). It sounds like a Spice Girls B-Side, and that's not something to rant about. <br /> <br /> <br />12. Everytime 4.4/5 <br />Britney's most personal song. The lyrics kind of capture you emotionally, and the sentimental piano melody is very soothing. The vocals aren't quite present in the record, but the piano intro kind of makes up for the lack of vocal talent on this song.
B0000025C0|4.0|Boston became an overnight sensation with their self-titled debut album (1976) which was one of the best selling albums of 1976 (as of this writing, it has sold over fifteen million copies and remains the best selling debut album of all-time). Needless to say, Epic wanted an immediate follow-up album to capitalize on the band's momentum. Not wasting any time, Tom Scholz, (guitar) Brad Delp, (vocals) Barry Goudreau, (guitar) Sib Hashian, (drums) and Fran Sheehan (bass) started work on their new album.<br /><br />Released in 1978, the two year gap between the debut and the follow-up was considered a long wait. Despite working on the follow-up for two years, Scholz, always the perfectionists, was unhappy with the final result, especially the second half. He considered the album rushed and incomplete. Be that as it may, it was still a strong seller, debuting at number one on the billboard chart and yielding three hit singles, the title track, \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\", and \\"A Man I'll Never Be.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Don't Look Back\\" is overshadowed by the debut, it's still a fine album. It's essentially cut from the same cloth as the debut. The title track is more-or-less this album's \\"More than a Feeling,\\" \\"The Journey\\" is this album's \\"Foreplay,\\" \\"Party\\" is this albums \\"Smokin'\\" and so on. The downdraught semi-epic \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is probably the album's most ambitious song and the one track that separates this album with its predecessor. While \\"Don't Look Back\\" is more or less a carbon copy of the debut, it's not quite as strong. There isn't anything wrong with the album; the songs are catchy, the album is well-paced, there isn't any filler, the production is top-notch, it's just that compared to the debut, \\"Don't Look Back\\" plays second fiddle, in terms of memorable, great songs. Boston's debut is such a classic; it would be a hard, almost an impossible task, to try to top.<br /><br />While \\"Don't Look Back\\" isn't the classic that the debut is, it's still a great collection of songs. And while Boston's music hasn't aged as well as some of their peers and is definitely dated, their good-time classic 70s brand of rock n' roll is certainly worth a spin now and again.<br /><br />Why is this album out-of-print? What's up with that?And while Boston's music hasn't aged as well as some of their peers and is definitely dated, their good-time classic 70s brand of rock n' roll is certainly worth a spin now and again.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|This movie is awesome in its own right, but if you look at it from an anthropological perspective it's even better. It says a lot about human nature, where all the monsters are human, even the ones that don't look it, and no one is completely 'good' or 'pure.' The story has all the aspects of mythology. If you don't know what I'm talking about read some Joseph Campbell.  <br />I this movie twice in the theatre and it was even better the second time I saw it. It's fun if you don't want to think deeply about it, and it's deep if you do.
0393327655|4.0|I began reading this book a few months ago. I was initially turned off by the authors harsh tone. He devotes entirely too much time to illustrating the bloody history of Christianity. I think we are all already aware of things such as the salem witch trials and the like. He also refuses to recognize much of the good that Christian churches do such as provide a social network for people and community service. He argues that such things could be accomplished through secular groups. I disagree, the nature of religion seems to encourage good acts moreso than any club could. I got tired of the book after 70 pages or so and put it away on my bookshelf next to some other books that I felt offered nothing.<br /><br />The author did make some compelling arguments about the nature of Islam and the threat it poses to the west. I found myself pondering some of the authors insights and drawn back to the book. Eventually I was hooked. The authors discussion of Islam is worth the price of the book itself. While its true that he attacks most modern religions, he saves his sharpest barbs for Islam. He describes Islamic culture as backwards and possesing a set of ethics many years behind the rest of the world.<br /><br />Sam Harris also devotes much time to picking apart the work of Chomsky and others who blame the west for the Islamic terrorism and the  cultural failure of Islam. Sam Harris does a fine job of exposing the logical errors of Chomsky. I really loved his analogy of the \\"pefect weapon\\" to draw a distinction between morality of the west and the palestinians. As someone who hates Chomsky because he ignores all evidence contrary to his own assertions, I loved Sam Harris's attack on him. Harris clears up the myth that the poverty, terrorism and the general backwardness of Muslum nations is a result of the west. He presents a solid case that all of the problems and failures of Islam can be blamed squarely on their religion.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack is truly amazing! <br />The first song I heard was \\"Defying Gravity\\" and I was shaking uncontrollably , it's just an amazing song! <br />I love the whole album, and find Idina Menzel's voice is truly spectacular! Kristin Chenoweth's voice was a little annoying at first, but has definitely grown on me, and provides a fresh comparison to Idina's rock belt. <br />It's a great soundtrack to sing along to, and makes you feel like you're really there! <br />Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to see the show, but I can't wait! <br />This music is amazingly fresh, with wonderful lyrics and catchy tunes and I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to ANYBODY, whether they are into musicals or not. <br />Thoroughly enjoyable. 5 STARS NO DOUBT! <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I never liked Shakira a whole lot. I found her annoying and cheesy. When, Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 came out, i found \\"La Tortura\\" annoying too and i dismissed her again. But then, I heard \\"Don't Bother\\" from Oral Fixation Vol. 2. I fell in love with it. After my love for \\"Don't Bother\\" I decided to download a couple other songs from the CD on Limewire to see if it was worth buying. I tried \\"Animal City\\", \\"Timor\\", and \\"How Do You Do\\" and loved them all. Finally, I bought the CD. I won't lie. I was somewhat dissapointed with the other songs besides the ones I'd already heard. But overtime i ended up liking almost all the songs and it's still a very good effort.    1) How Do You Do 10/10 very weird beginning, but great start  2) Don't Bother 10/10 love the lyrics and is very catchy.  3) Illegal 9/10 a little slow, but still worth some listens  4) The Day And Time 10/10 grew on me, now i love it  5) Animal City 10/10 awesome lyrics, one of my faves, catchy  6) Dreams For Plans 10/10 took a while, but now i love it  7) Hey You 10/10 love the beginning a LOT. good verse & chorus.  8) Your Embrace 7.5/10 nice lyrics, but easy to forget   9) Costume Makes The Clown 7/10 my least favorite, hate the lyrics  10)Something 10/10 so nice and simple. love love love the chorus  11)Timor 10/10 one of my faves, great lyrics, amazing overall    shown in a few songs, Oral Fixation vol. 2 has some weak spots, but the best songs hold it all together.
B000002JEV|5.0|Man did Zeppelin diehards really have to wait seventeen years for a recording like the 'BBC Sessions' to be cleaned up for an 'official' release? Well it was worth the wait, just for the second disc alone. Although I had heard the legendary 1971 broadcast numerous times, to be able to possess one of the greatest live recordings of all time was too good to be true. The double shot opening of \\"Immigrant Song\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" has to rank with the greatest Zeppelin recordings ever and both blow away their classic studio versions. This was the band at their peak as a recording and touring act and quite possibly the greatest live act in the history of rock music. \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Stairway\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" are still fresh and powerful and these could be the definitive recordings of those songs as well.  The medley in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a killer combo of blues and Elvisabilly, flawless!! Not to neglect the first disc which is a series of BBC appearences in Zep's first year in business, but the 1971 sessions will always hold a special place in my heart. First disc includes essentials from the first two lps but also great rarities such as \\"The Girl I Love\\" and \\"Somethin' Else\\". Can't really consider \\"Riverside\\" a rarity since it was featured in Zep's first box set. End of disc one is a brief live set which shows a young, hungry band already set for world domination. Led Zeppelin freaks should consider this essential unless they have the bootlegs and novices might consider this their first live Zeppelin to justfy their naiscent worship of messieurs Page, Plant, Bonham and Jones.
B000001FS3|3.0|Their songs - known most for their political undertones and Joshua Tree sound exactly like that. There are some songs which evoke great emotion, and U2 do not have those songs on the album <br /> <br />There are some bands who have great musicality, for full range of expression. And U2 is not that band. There are some bands who write lyrics, poeticise, metaphorise, intricate, intelligent and powerful verses. Again, I have not experienced that with U2. <br /> <br />What is U2? Self-declared biggest band in the world, maybe. The mainstream audience will take care of the biggest. Music-wise - They are definitely above average, but they are by no means excellent. <br /> <br />Borne out of a harsh 1980s political climate, U2 stunned the world by their overt political stances (never for a rock band), that brought them fame and catapulted them to the top of the music...industry. <br /> <br />And yet many critics hail this as a masterpiece. Several reviewers here have called it the best album ever in all genres. Who are they to make such statements? Can you really trust them? How many albums have they listened to, a smattering or a collection of music industry (muzak) albums? I definitely think this is solid, worthy of a 60%...but nothing more. Music sounds flat to me, only charged with political undertones. <br /> <br />Is U2 that great? Yeah, twice as smart, and about as musically talented as that other 80s band, Bon Jovi. You decide whether that's good or bad.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|In order to listen to this album and fully appreciate it, you must know what Enya is and is not. Enya is the epitome of perfect music in that her music is what all music is supposed to be. Enya is often described as \\"New Age\\", but few people know what that means. \\"New Age\\" describes a genre of music whose sole purpose is to promote a higher level of consciousness, not through the typical method of speaking philosophical babble, but the guaranteed method of soothing you so that you can think about such things as love, world peace, compassion, etc. New Age music is supposed to put you in a meditative state that helps you feel pure pleasure 24/7/365. As another reviewer aptly put it, she produces harmonized Nirvana, and she is the only artist who does it consistently with every single song. Thus, there can be no such thing as the \\"best of Enya\\" since all of the songs achieve their goal: perpetual meditation. So, every song tends to sound like every other song, with slight variations, because once you start listening and enter sonic heaven, you don't want to leave. Any change would force you to leave the state of bliss she effortlessly enduces.  <br /> <br />Enya is NOT musician or a folk singer. Musicians and folk singers match music and lyrics to communicate a message, entertain, or advocate a purpose.  When this is done well, the music  becomes classic. You listen to be transported back in time, to the feelings and memories you had when you first heard the music. Enya does not transport you anywhere except into a meditative state. Her lyrics serve no other purpose than to help you experience love, compassion, togetherness, and peace in that state.  <br /> <br />In this regard, Amarantine is perfection, just like the Celts, Watermark, Shepherd's Moon, In Memory of Trees, and A Day without Rain. Every track will transport you to a blissful state. You will put on the CD and listen over and over again for hours, days, weeks, or months, never knowing that time has passed.Unlike other artists, Enya's music does not grow stale or boring. It is impossible because you cannot improve on perfection.  <br />
B00005JO1Y|5.0|In short,the best film of the year! <br /> <br />Peter Jackson,director of the well-deserved Academy-Award winning Lord of the Rings trilogy,tackles the incredible story of King Kong in this fabulous second remake of the 1933 original. <br /> <br />The story is pretty much the same as the original,with Carl denham(played by Jack Black,in a pretty spectacular performance)sailing to what is belived to be a deserted island to film a movie to gain back his reputation.Along for the ride is the ship's crew,including Denham's leading lady,Ann Darrow(Naomi Watts) and Jack Driscoll(Adrien Brody),a relunctant playwright.Over the course of the trip,Jack and Ann gain a sudden attraction to each other as they spend more and more time together.Eventually,they arrived on the island and are attacked b the natives.Eventually,they capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to the beast known to all as Kong <br /> <br />What happens after that are the reasons why movies are made! <br /> <br />King Kong is by far one of the best movies ever made!It improves on  the original,fleshing the story more,making it much more interesting than the original(and making you forget almost completely about the '76 film,if that's what you want to call it). <br /> <br />The acting is great.Naomi Watts is perfect for Ann Darrow.She shows utter affection for Kong in the emotional scenes and you completely buy it.Jack Black is a very good Carl Denham.While I thought Carl was a jerk,taking Kong away from his home,it takes a good actor to make someone who should be likeable like Carl and make him almost completely unlikeable.In short,a great perfomance.Adrien Brody was good as Jack in my opinion.He took a character from the original that wasn't particulary interesting and made him so.I thought he did well.All the minor actors(including Andy Serkis,The Lord of the Ring's Gollum,as the ship's cook)are great as well. <br /> <br />However,the movie belongs to the man portraying Kong.As I want you to know,Andy Serkis also portrays Kong and he does so wonderfully.He gives Kong true emotion in one look.It is breathtaking.This guy deserves an Oscar for his performances because he makes the character more interesting thatn the effects.You will love this performance! <br /> <br />The visual effects are wonderful.Weta,who did the Lord of the Rings,continue with Jackson on the effects and surpass their previous efforts with the trilogy.You will be amazed by what you see.These are the best effects of the year! <br /> <br />The score is great as well.James Newton Howard,a great and almost unknown composer,really shined this year,first with Batman Begins and now this.The score is emotional when it's needed and pulse pounding when needed.Amazing. <br /> <br />Flaws?Barely Any!The first twenty minutes were boring,but are neceesary for plot so it's okay and second,sometimes it was hard to take Jack Black seriously,but he shines most of the time so again okay. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has done it again.See this as soon as possible!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I recently purchased this CD/DVD being a huge Buble fan..so I have high expectations for everything this young man does, and he definately delivered.  <br />The Live concert is just amazing. The quality of it all is crystal clear and just breathtaking, you really feel like you are part of it all. <br />Buble just owns the stage and the crowd when he performs live. He jokes, runs through the crowd, graciously thanks his amazing band, and has a stream of guest performers to help him throughout and in between all the songs...which makes it very enjoyable to watch. (*FYI Josh Groban makes a guest appereance in a funny little \\"throwdown\\") <br /> <br />My favorite part of the entire DVD is when Buble jokingly states he is done with Jazz, and is switching over to pop..After *Groban exits, Buble goes on to sing (well..attempt to) \\"This Love\\" originally by Maroon 5. He still sounds amazing but doesn't really know all the words..but it's just so much fun to watch his creativity at work on stage!! <br /> <br />As you can see from all the other reviews you will LOVE this set. The CD is just a great plus when you are in the mood for some LIVE Buble in your car or around the house. Buble fans and non Buble fans will come to appreciate everything about this!
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Bad script, mostly. But NOTHING redeeming.
B000AGTPUA|1.0|I have never written a review, but I have to warn you all about this one. What a horrible, creepy movie!!!! I thought this was going to be some warm, feel-good Christmas classic, but instead I felt like I was watching a children's episode of Resident Evil at the North Pole. The creepy echoes, desolate villages, and scary elves are sure to give me nightmares tonight - and I'm 36 years old! And what was with the Steve Tyler (Aerosmith) elf singing at the end? Oh, brother. If I could give this a ZERO, I would.
B000AL730O|5.0|I will not pretend to have the writing skills of the many fine reviewers commenting on C&C.  I certainly can not improve upon them.  I will offer this ... I am a Beatle fan, as such I have a lot of respect and affection for PM but like so many I have often been very disappointed in his individual efforts.   <br /> <br />What is interesting to me about C&C is that the first time or two I played it ... well I thought it was to some degree more of the same Post Beatle Paul material ... but I was challenged by several friends to stick with it and very soon I was HOOKED.  And I invite you to do the same, get hold of a copy somehow ... play it ... play it a lot!  It will grow on you beyond any measure I can describe ... I believe.  Then please be sure to buy it!!! <br /> <br />It is simply wonderful, there are truly some songs on C&C I freely call GREAT.  You have heard Jenny Wren mentioned many times, very good ... I would add At the Mercy, Too Much Rain, Follow Me, This Never Happened Before, and truly one of the best Anyway(play it first if you like a nice start, who says you have to agree to the order they chose!).  And there is really nothing wrong with Promise to You Girl .... here is my promise to you ... get this CD, play this CD, several times, pick your favorites and play them again ... you will be very glad you did.  Jerry ... Melbourne, FL
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I echo all of the sentiments expressed previously regarding the excellence of this album. All songs are amazing - they could meld them all together in one long song and it would not miss a beat.   <br />Since I haven't seen anyone point it out, make sure you read the outstanding liner notes by Pete Hamill. <br /> <br />
B000BHHVPO|5.0|My lovely bride came through for me in a big way by giving me this DVD set for Xmas, and I had set my expectations relatively high, given the snippets I had seen of this concert on July 2nd looked great.  I decided to take a quick look at this my gift the day after Xmas, and spent the ENTIRE DAY mesmerized! The live concert video footage was tremendous, and the sound was simply astounding in Dolby Digital 5.1. <br /> <br />The best part for me was Disk 3: The Pink Floyd reunion after 20+ years since Roger Waters had left Pink Floyd.  According to a Billboard, the currently configured Pink Floyd had not performed live with Roger Waters since 1981, and had not performed live as currently configured since the release of their album \\"The Division Bell\\" in 1994. <br /> <br />David Gilmour and Roger Waters came together on the London stage as if they had never been apart, and their song set was clearly the highlight for me.  The set was performed at night, and the clarity and detail of the video was outstanding.  On Disk 4 is an extra of the reunited Pink Floyd rehearsing for Live8, where Roger Waters is interviewed and explains how they pulled off this one-time (as of now) reunion. <br /> <br />There were a few negatives, one being the camera shots when panning the audience on numerous occasions seemed blurred.  The other had to do with re-setting the audio to Dolby Digital 5.1 for each DVD before I listened to it.  The default was Dolby Stereo, which was still very good but not the same as 5.1.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is an outstanding collection of musical talent delivered in high quality sound and video.  Your biggest issue will be explaining to your \\"significant other\\" the amount of time you'll need to go through this remarkable collection! <br />
B000B8QF14|5.0|this cd/dvd combo was very good. i really like that green day made a cd incorporating all of there previous cds. i only wishthat the dvd didn't switch from color to black and white.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy interested me from the first episode.  This show is by far the best medical series that I've ever watched.  It provides dramatic and fun occurrences in the lives of the cast as well as insight into their medical cases.  The personal touch on the lives of the characters and exciting hospital scenes has kept me waiting impatiently for each episode.  <br /> <br />I absolutely love this show and can imagine that it would interest audiences of all ages.  <br />
B000002L7Y|4.0|Like Skee-Lo's \\"I Wish\\", I bought this CD totally on a whim that if the hit single was great then perhaps the rest of the album would be too. Lo' and behold it was (to an extent - although I think \\"Train Of Thought\\" and \\"The Blue Sky\\" are almost as infectious as \\"Take On Me\\")! The album is essentially an excuse to put out 6 great new wave songs because after the first six the rest are pretty horrible. For a Norwegian band these guys surely know how to craft a great song (unless they didn't actually write the songs, I don't know if they did). Morten Harket's vocals are also filled to the brim with emotion that definitely make the songs more interesting and easier to accept -  this band most certainly has gret heart and soul. The first six songs are some of the best new wave of the 80's and alone make this purchase worth it. Except for \\"Take On Me\\", though, I couldn't call the rest of them classics. If you like this album, I highly recommend that you check out Talk Talk's \\"The Colour Of Spring\\". Recommended to all 80's and new wave fans.     Highlights include:  \\"Take On Me\\"  \\"Train Of Thought\\"  \\"Hunting High & Low\\"  \\"The Blue Sky\\"  \\"Living A Boy's Adventure Tale\\"   \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\"
B00008VGL6|1.0|I had to at least give it one star because after all its Martin Gore and he deserves something. <br /> <br />However I was really let down by what I heard .The songs lacked emotion and were pretty much monotone.They sounded like a train wreck .Worse yet he had that same tone deaf sound of someone who had one too many at the local Karaoke lounge. <br /> <br />Im sorry Martin we all know you are capable of so much more than this.If this is what your career would be without Depeche Mode please stay the course with D.M. <br /> <br />After \\"Counterfeit-I\\" it should have ended.We all know that sequels usually bomb and this was no exception.To quote one of D.M.s songs \\"Its no good\\". <br />Now I think I will \\"Enjoy the Silence\\".This was not \\"Music for the masses.\\" <br />Okay I'll stop now.
B000002JS6|5.0|Every song on this album is just hard rock gold! Whereas \\"Highway To Hell\\" and \\"Dirty Deeds Done Cheap\\" had a couple filler songs on it, every track on \\"Back In Black\\" is great. They all exhibit a high amount of energy that anybody with an open mind will absolutely adore. The lyrics are admittedly subpar, but you won't care in the end - they're essentially just to make the songs catchier and more fun, and they definitely succeed there. Brian Johnson also does an excellent job taking over the vocals after Bon Scott's tragic death - he's my personal favorite hard rock singer next to Van Halen's David Lee Roth. If you're a fan of the history of rock or if you just like rock in general, you'll love this release. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the whole album!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This is how a sci-fi adventure should be. The lines are crisp, the action is great, the back-story helps establish the movie's environment, the CGI is effective and used wisely (meaning that we don't have old men doing back flips just to skip using the stairs and actors are not surrounded by awful CGI environments), and the acting is good for the kinda movie it is.  <br />What kinda of movie is it? FUN like Star Wars was, The Thing was, Body Snatchers was, and the countless other movies that helped establish the genre from the '50's and on. And just for note Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and it's series), Angel, and Fire Fly (which is the basis for this movie) also created Toy Story and yes wrote Alien Resurrection, which he still says what you saw on the screen WAS NOT what he wrote... my point they were FUN, this is TOO! <br />This is where the future of the genre should go... I for one hope Universal will allow this to become a franchise series, it is worth it.
B000084T18|4.0|This album doesn't really contain interesting lyrics (although some of the songs are pretty funny), but it's still great for the dancefloor. Every track has a great hook to it which is great for the clubs, but musically it's pretty lacking. The beats are great, of course, but there's nothing new here (standard fare). It's basically just I-make-more-money-and-do-more-ladies-than-you-so-I'm-cool gangsta club rap. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is that ALL 19 songs are great club tracks (that is indeed a bargain and contributes greatly to its mass appeal)! A must-have album for clubs and parties, but it doesn't really hold any other significant longterm value. Highly recommended for clubheads. (a funny sidenote: it was actually my white 60 year-old US History teach who recommended this album, if that tells you anything. He loved how fun it was)    Highlights include:  the whole album!
0440241588|1.0|This is a typical Grisham book.  Build up, build up, build up, get bored of writing and end the book as soon as possible any way you can.  Same formula for \\"The King of Torts\\", \\"A Painted House\\" and \\"The Last Juror\\". <br /> <br />However, this would work fairly well as a Tour of Italy book. <br /> <br />Complete waste of ink, paper and my time.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|2005 will be remembered as the year when an absurdly great number of classics and very good/good albums came out (hopefully, anyway - Spoon's \\"Gimme Fiction\\" and Beck's \\"Guero\\" are some good examples). The moment I heard this album, though, I knew it was going to be a \\"special\\" classic (most notably for its startling originality). The soul and energy that these guys and gals put into this album is obvious and magnificent. Every song is fantastic (though the weakest is arguably \\"Crown Of Love\\"), with some only marginally \\"better\\" than others (\\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" is my favorite and I think the best, but it's only a tad better then the rest). Win Butler's singing style isn't for everybody and he'll probably take a while to get used to, but that isn't too much of a problem (you'll see). He sings with genuine emotion and passion and has impressive range. The lyrics are almost all uniformly interesting, even if most of the songs aren't too memorable lyrically (\\"Rebellion (lies)\\" is the most notable one as it's the easiest to sing along with. The album generally holds mass appeal). Musically it's just a totally unique and fascinating album since it successfully mixes several different kinds of hardly-used instruments with \\"standard\\" rock sounds. If you like interesting or arty rock (or even music in general, really) you will no doubt love this album. I can't recommend this album highly enough!    Highlights include:  the whole album!
B000BKVQTS|3.0|If you think thst this one is good for a child, then think again. it's not! The cast members fit the part so varry well, and there wes a plot but it wes weak. I had to take a star off because I just thought that they could do more with Little Red rideing Hood, the Gingerbread Man and Honsle snd Grettel. i wood like to see 7 harts in it and the 3 bears too. I love how the storys tied in together. now for everyone fravert cat sceen, grow up it just a movie people.
B000005DQR|5.0|\\"Endtroducing...\\" is pretty much unparalled in the turntablist world, and rightfully so. Every song has a charm to it that rewards repeated listens and the album as a whole is very fun and interesting to listen to. It's also extremely mellow and definitely GREAT background music for whenever you're hanging out with friends. It's also pretty funny on occasion, and it does seem to cover several different styles throughout the album without getting too full of itself. For its day it was also a pretty experimental album - one that wasn't merely for hip-hop fans. Most people in the world will enjoy this album a great deal (like my father who only listens to classic rock and Radiohead). Basically, anyone who's interested in turntablism ought to check this out along with Coldcut's \\"Journeys By DJ - 70 Minutes Of Madness\\" and Kid Koala's \\"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\\" (though this one not as much). Absolutely recommended!    Hightlights include:   the whole album!
B00097DX3U|4.0|This album is OK, but I just wanted to point out that \\"A Kid's Review\\" is pretty lame, I'm sure his 1 star penalties are really going to hurt Audioslave's CD Sales.

0553801503|3.0|Man, I can remember being in high school and reading the first 6 Dragonlance books.  The Chronicles and the Twins series were so awesome.  But then the authors and the publishers spun off and spun off the series to the point of losing all relevance and interest.  The Dragonlance have been spun off to the point of novels contradicting each other.  It is unfair to the series and the reader to do that. <br /> <br />Then came Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time.  Again the first 3 or 4 books were great.  But then we were told of a \\"transition.\\"  A transition that took about 5 books of about 1000 pages each.  Again, unfair to the reader to never end a series and suck you through novel after novel.  The Wheel of Time started out so good and just for whatever reasons slowed to a grinding unreadable halt. <br /> <br />Then came Martin and The Fire and Ice series.  How awesome were the first 3 books?  What made the books so good in my opinion were the different points of view from all sides.  It chapter was its own little cliff hanger. <br /> <br />Now comes part 4.  And again I here this term \\"transition.\\"  I understand it, I see why some of it was needed.  But the question is: Is this a one volume transition or a Robert Jordan 5 books of 1000 pages transition. <br /> <br />For me the reader the answer is simple, like Jordan.  If you string me along too long, I am out. <br /> <br />Overall, the book at parts is better than any other fantasy I have read in the last few years.  The chapters with Jaime and his sister were great.  The stuff with Sam was great.  The rest....well could have been done in a lot less time. <br /> <br />I hope the series keeps moving and as much as I loved the other books, lets end this thing in our lifetimes.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I have been a Buble fan since. the beginning.  This man has grown into the cosumate performer.  He echo's visions of Darin & Sinatra, but his style is his own.  The person who stated that he copies Darin & Sinatra is way off base. Watch the DVD & judge for yourself. Buble is in a class by himself.  He sings, dances, and a teriffic sense of humor, but most important, he loves what he does, and thanks to him, this great music lives on.  Keep singing the standards, Michael, for these are truly America's songs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Bravo, Buble!!!!
0688101364|5.0|This is the only Christmas cookie book you need.  This book is always pulled out at the start of the holiday season.  Not only do the georgeous pictures put you in the holiday spirit but it also reminds me of the delicious memories of the wonderful cookies I have made from this book.  I know that the binding may crack(7 years and still whole) but wouldn't you rather have a well-loved book that you use or a perfect binding of a book that never gets a second glance.  Sequel Please.
B000059MEK|5.0|Ah, this is delicious music for moving the body and getting a great workout! This is my best walking cd thus far, I am looking for more that has the right beat. With my MBT's and this CD,I am set for a great power walk. I love Daft Punk! Okay some of the songs gather a minor blush from me because it sounds so disco but One More Time is simply an awesome party song! I just wish Nightvision was much much longer, very sexy and reflective! <br />I will definitely buy more Daft Punk! Vive Le France!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I have loved Enya's past CD's and this one does not disappoint.  I can be stressed (especially at work) and put in one of her CD's and my stress level is reduced.  <br /> <br />
B00005U2LM|4.0|If you are looking for a Wu-Tang album this is not one you should be picking up first. This CD is more for the Wu-Tang fan because they know their flows already and feel the sh*t that's coming out of their mouths. If you want to start off with a Wu-Tang cd then you must start with the first one, the greatest one, which is Wu-Tang 36 Chambers: Enter The Wu-Tang. But back to this review. I feel this cd is a good listen and it has a good amount of songs on it that have good replay value, like; In the Hood, Rules, Uzi (Pinky Ring), Ya'll Been Warned, Back in the Game, and Iron Flag. If you can count, that's half of the CD you can replay over and over, the other half are songs that you can listen as fillers between these songs. These songs aren't bad but they aren't as good as the other half of the CD. I believe if you can listen to half of the CD over and over it's worth the buy because the sh*t that's out now, you can barely listen to half of the CD. The problem is that they have other great albums and this is just looked over as not a good album. It is a good album it is just not a 36 Chambers album, and everyone needs to realize this.  They are not going to put out an album like that ever again, they will come close, but 36 Chambers is so amazing that you can put it up to any album out there now, whether old or new, and it will stand either victorious or at least one of the top 5 albums of all time. The only album I think they did that came close to 36 Chambers is The W, that CD was amazing and brought in different styles to make the CD work.  I think Iron Flag is better than Wu-Tang Forever just because they never should have released a double CD, they should have taken all the banging songs off of the double CD and turned it into one CD with those songs. Overall if you already have a Wu-Tang Collection you should add this one because it is a good listen, but if you don't have one I suggest you get their other albums before it, so that way you can get their style.
B000001E7V|5.0|I love Trip-Hop and the many artists that contribute to the sound. Tricky, with his debut album, showcases the grittines of the Trip-Hop sound. For sure, he pretty much perfects it. <br /> <br />Depression. Love. Loss. Anger. All shown in many forms of edginess. These subjects are greatly detailed in \\"Feed Me\\", \\"Hell is Round The Corner\\", and \\"Strugglin'\\" with beautiful rhythms, great vocalizations, and just an overall awesome feeling of knowing that this album gives a great contribution to Trip-Hop. <br /> <br />Sadly after 'Maxinquaye', 'Nearly God' was really the only other decent album that Tricky made. <br /> <br />Maybe if he got back with Massive Attack? No? Well then, he will just have to keep up with trying to reinvent himself.
B0007GAERG|2.0|This album is no good. Half of the songs sound almost the same and are frankly, just.... boring. <br /> <br />I know many disagree and she is doing extremely well but that is just me... <br /> <br />One of the boringest CDs of the year... <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor >>>> Emancipation of MiMi
0446677450|5.0|Wonderful book, great learning. <br />Robert is right that 99% population of the world are working for money and for only 1% population its money that is working for them. Every morning we go to office for 8 hours for money and creamy pay checks, but at the end of the day we end up with family of loans to pay. I recommend this book to all genre of professionals and students. Go get it. <br />
B00097DX3U|1.0|Poor compared to their last album. 1 star.
B00000J7SO|4.0|\\"Street Legal\\" is without a doubt Bob Dylan's most underrated album. Some would criticize the flawed nature of the production, but in most cases the glitzy yet rough sound of the album helps the songs. \\"Street Legal\\" is anchored by three of Dylan's finest songs,\\"Changing of the Guards\\",\\"Senor\\" and \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" The wordplay and sheer depth of these three tracks make the album well worth the price. Fortunately, the other songs hold up as well. \\"New Pony\\" is an excellent rock song, with some solid blues guitar playing. \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" features some humourous lyrics and interesting music too. Actually, I find it difficult to believe that anyone could truly dislike this album. The only less than great song is \\"Baby Stop Crying\\", largely due to its banal lyrics and lackluster backing. But one bad song is not enough to ruin the album. It isn't as classic as \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" or \\"Desire\\", his two 70s masterpieces, but its just a notch below. Basically, if you are a Dylan fan you need to get this album; you won't regret it.
B00025ETIW|2.0|'Ghost of You' is a great song. However, everything else on here is pretty bad.  I like MCR, they have a lot of potential to put together some good music.  Unfortunatley, not on this album. If you can get the 'Ghost of You' single, do so, but I can't recomend that you buy this album.
B000001FS3|5.0|Now that U2 is well into its third decade, it's time to take a look at JT, what many consider their finest album. The sonic shift that preceded this album, \\"Unforgettalbe Fire\\" offered key musical clues to their development.  \\"Pride\\" \\"Bad\\" and \\"Wire\\", in particular, hinted at a more expansive, but tighter sound.  Whereas the \\"War\\" U2 would bash away at a song with hints of punk and garage,  \\"UFire\\" U2 cast a wide musical net with Larry's polyrhythmic drumming, Adam's shuffling, gurgling bass, and most notably, Edge's echoey, soon-to-be-oft-imitated guitar.  U2 waste little time on JT throwing down the gauntlet, as a hymnlike keyboard intro gives way to a masterful Edge fade-in on \\"Streets\\".  Lyrically, Bono begins to expound further into the contradictions he had fought against on songs like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\"; on \\"Streets\\" he is alternately running, hiding, tearing down walls, and reaching out, all in the first verse. As the cities flame, and love turns to rust, in all the madness, he wants to show us a place high on a desert plain where the streets have no name.  This sets the tone for the album.  Simple ideas, many times contradicting each other in the fight between love, lust, faith and doubt.  \\"Still Haven't Found\\" may be the glue that holds this album together thematically.  Bono only wants to be with you, but he still hasn't found what he's looking for.  \\"With or Without You\\" says it all.  Even on \\"Bullet\\" we run into the arms of America as the bombs fall on us.  Another contradictory lyric is \\"Running to Stand Still\\" a haunting ballad about the dangers of heroin. Great lyric on \\"Red Hill\\" : \\"We're wounded by fear/Injured in doubt/I can lose myself/You I can't live without.\\" More contradictions, you get the idea.  Really, to sum it up, if you are just starting to get into rock music, purchase this album as one of the first twenty to listen to.

B000244FDW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice may very well be my favorite.  I can say that after recently seeing the 2005 version with Keira Knightly and the 1996 version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. <br /> <br />This version of Pride and Prejudice is very unrated.  And to think that I almost did not buy it simply because I did not like the picture on the cover of the DVD.  All of the actors are good and the actress who played Elizabeth Bennett is simply beautiful.   <br /> <br />This version is quite different from the others, so you don't feel that you are just watching the same movie with different actors.  But the reason why I like it the most is that it develops the later half of the story more.  For P & P fans, this  translates into more romance.   <br /> <br />Don't let the fact that it was made in 1980 bother you.  The actors are dressed in costume for the time period, so it does not seem that old.  <br /> <br />
0060751967|4.0|I'm a major romance reader and a major vampire fan. So when I read the synopsis on the back of this book at my local bookstore, I was a little hesitant.  I mean, come on - vampire loses fang and has to find a dentist? Sounded kinda lame at first glance.  But, seeing as she is a local writer here in Houston, I figured I'd support the cause and bought it anyway.  I'm very glad I did! I enjoyed this book much, much more than I expected to.<br /><br />The story is fresh and original, which is tough with so many vamp stories out there. Her original vampire mythology makes sense, which, again, so many do not.  And her characters are funny and lovable. Very quickly, I was drawn into the story, and engaged by the characters.  The heroine is real and despite her extreme circumstances, is someone most of us can relate to. Unlike so many other authors, Ms. Sparks made her heroine right where I like them - not so gorgeously perfect and supermodel-like that I can have no relation to her, nor so flawed and down on herself that I want to slap her.  This heroine is basically a smart, attractive person who, like most of us, is pretty attractive but still has a few things to work on.<br /><br />The hero is just vampirically gorgeous enough to make him interesting, while normal enough for us to believe that he's managed to survive in a human world for a few hundred years.<br /><br />The book includes lots of well developed and interesting side characters as well, and I will look forward to seeing some sequels that flesh them out.  But even if those don't appear, I will be keeping my eyes peeled for the next Kerrelyn Sparks novel, whatever it may be.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|To let you all know, yes I realise TNT and the australian version of high voltage were two seperate albums, but I'm reviewing this as America's first album. Let me start off by saying this is one of the strongest debuts ever. This album is rock at its dirtiest most raw and pure form. I love led zeppelin to death they are one of my favorite bands, but when it comes to strait forward nasty rock, AC/DC owns. That's why ac/dc is special, they never tried to be the best band or artsy, they always stuck to their routes, and it worked for them. The first track on this album is so strong and powerful it almost seems like it'd be impossible to top. <br /> <br />1. It's A Long Way to the Top-This is how albums should begin. This is a catchy as hell anthem that you'll be singing for weeks. The thing I admire about Bon Scott are his lyrics. People always cite ac/dc as being immature, crude, rude, etc, which is all true, but what people don't realise is bon scotts lyrics were actually really good without being all artsy or trying to hard, bon never tried, he just did it. What i also admire is how simple, and    true his lyrics were, he rocks everyday joe. And to top it off, this song has bag pipes, enough said. <br /> <br />2. Rock N Roll Singer-More simple yet great lyrics from Bon. It's about living a carefree life and rocking out, and this song is rocking. <br /> <br />3.The Jack-One of their blusiest songs, and it works really well. The guitar is almost sexy sounding, and the lyrcis are genious the way he uses metaphors of a card game and stds! This is what I love about Bon, the way he makes words mean something completley totally different. He is a lyrical genious. <br /> <br />4. Live Wire-I love how this song has a powerful buildup. STarts off with a pounding bass and slow power chords. Then when it kicks in it is f**king explosive. There are several riffs in here that kickass and great lead work from Angus on this track. One of their best songs. <br /> <br />5. TNT!!!!!!OI!!! OI!!! OI!!!    This song is what ac/dc is all about! Catchy as hell, awesome riff, and sing a long chorus. This would become one of their signature songs and is pure fun dirty immature rock. <br /> <br />6. Can I Sit Next To You Girl-This is an ac/dc you'll never hear again, this song is unique and has a really old school rock n roll style. It has several kickass riffs and you can't help but smile listening to Bon. <br /> <br />7. Little Lover-Another blues song that sounds similiar to the jack , but not quite as remorable. <br /> <br />8. She's Got Balls-ANothet song that proves Bon as a master lyricist. Fun enjoyable song. <br /> <br />9. High Voltage-The title couldn't be more appropriate. The opening riff is explosive and the song never lets down. You'll be singing along with the chorus and the solo kicks major ass. It's a great way to end an excellent album. <br /> <br />If I have any complaints about the album it's the fact that their cover of Baby Please Don't Go wasn't included as it is one of the best songs they've ever done. It's an ac/dc youll never hear again, it is very fast paced and has very few power chords in it. There is super sweet from angus on this song, anyways if you wanna hear that song buy the five track jailbreak album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Stella
0385338686|5.0|This book made you think about whether the things you THINK really matter, in fact do!  The character was well written, easy to identify with, and very likable.  Overall a very sweet romantic book.
B00004LN16|5.0|It isn't their best, but it is one of AC/DC's most solid album to date. Each song belongs on here and flows perfectly to make an easy listening album that never tires listening to the whole way through. On this album it's obvious ac/dc has gone back to it's roots for some old school sounding rock, this is most obvious on their title track \\"stiff upper lip\\" <br /> <br />1. Stiff Upper Lip-This song opens up very different from any other ac/dc song, its slow and very bluesey with Brian singing in a very deep and raspy voice, then the rthym section kicks in and it's classic ac/dc. This song has a killer riff and a great blues sound, once it's over you'll find yourself saying \\"i was born with a stiff            stiff upper lip\\" In my opinion this song belongs with ac/dc classics such as dirty deeds and let there be rock. <br /> <br />2. Meltdown-Fun song, solid, but not memorable. <br /> <br />3. House of Jazz-The lyrics can be questionable, but the riff and rhthym section is just spectacular. This song has a very powerful rocking sound with an awesome solo from angus. <br /> <br />4. Hold Me Back-I like the style of guitar playing in this song. It's the same style used on several other songs such as shoot to thrill and the intro to for those about to rock. It's a fun song. <br /> <br />5. Safe in New York City-YES! This is so headbanging fast paced rock. This song has an awesome bass and drum buildup that leads into a kickass guitar riff. This song is fast paced and catchy as hell, though it is repetitive, it is awesome to hear \\"i feel safe in new york citaaaaaaay\\", my favorite track on this album. <br /> <br />6. Can't STand Still-Good, but not to memorable. <br /> <br />7. Can't Stop Rock N Roll-One very solid song with a memorable riff and a great message. What I love about this album is all the riffs are unique from eachother, as ac/dc is accused of being unoriginal and using the same riff over and over. <br /> <br />8. Satelite Blues-This is a typical ac/dc sounding song that you'd be likely to find on any of their albums, which meanss it kicks major ass. Johnson and everyone performs great. <br /> <br />9.  It's a good song, but probably the weakest on the album. <br /> <br />10. Sweet riffage!! And a cool cheesy chorus. Johnson gives a good performance. <br /> <br />11. All Screwed Up-Action packed song, just listen to the damn thing. <br /> <br />12. Give It Up-Good song, all I have to say.
B00000DBXL|5.0|This album is amazing.  Cake is a great band with a original sound that no other band even tries to touch.  This CD is just as good as anything else in their catalog.  Just listen to Hem of Your Garment, Never There and Sheep Go To Heaven.  This CD will spend months in yout player just like all the other Cake CD's.  Ignore the bad reviews.
B000AP04FG|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  It turned into a kind of witty action movie that fit well with Pitt and Jolie's acting styles.  To see the domestic disputes and life right in the midst of their oh so private secret life was fun.  Vince Vaughn's character, although short lived, was a great addition to the movie. <br /> <br />Spoiler.  But, my only problem, is how is it possible to sit in a little shed and not have them pepper the thing with bullets?  Additionally, how did they escape alive?  I mean, there are thirty people surrounding this little tiny shed that is right in the middle of nothing.  The people are behind it, to the sides, above it, I mean they are everywhere, and yet they can't get them?  It fit together a bit to easily and could have ended in a much more feasible way. <br /> <br />Other than that, I thought this was a fun movie.  I would recommend.
1416905014|5.0|Matthew Reinhart has created \\"Cinderella: A Pop-Up Fairy Tale.\\" He studied with, and now works with, Robert Sabuda, the master of the pop-up book. His work doesn't eclipse Sabuda's yet, but it's very nice. <br /> <br />The book opens up to reveal a fairy tale cottage with lots of colorful details: a deer hides in the bushes, a rooster pecks the ground behind the house. Among the six main spreads there are lots of mini booklets throughout with additional pop-ups, all telling the story of Cinderella and her mean stepmother and stepsisters. Reinhart based it on the original tale by Charles Perrault rather than on the familiar Disney version. <br /> <br />It's magical. Before our eyes, a rat turns into a jolly coachman. Among the pop-ups are an impressive silver coach with six horses, dancers that spin as the pages open, and the most royal of royal palaces. <br /> <br />I am in LOVE with this book. I believe Reinhart's plan is to create a whole series of fairy tale pop-ups. Man, I hope so!
1573228737|5.0|\\"Affinity\\" is a well written, darkly intense novel about an extremely complex woman, Margaret Prior, and her singular love affair. It is also a tale of psychological suspense - a literary mystery with an ending that certainly caught me off guard. Author Sarah Waters paints a vivid picture of upper middle class life in Victorian London, as well as the period's grim women's penal system. She also writes with passion and sensitivity about \\"the \\"love that dare not speak its name.\\" The novel delves into Victorian spiritualism as well, and is actually a gothic ghost story of sorts.<br /><br />Ms. Prior is a not-so-young woman rapidly approaching spinsterhood. In 1874 London an unmarried female nearing the age of 30 is considered a spinster with the definite connotation of \\"old maid.\\" To be truthful, until about 40 years ago the same could have been said about an American women of the same age! However, a single American woman of the 1950's and 60's would have had infinitely more personal freedom than her cloistered, over-protected Victorian sister. Margaret is recuperating from a nervous collapse which resulted in her attempted suicide by overdosing on laudanum. Her family, with their typical Victorian morality, accustomed to repressing and denying unsuitable feelings and actions, thinks that Margaret's illness is the result of the sudden death of her beloved father. His demise has caused her pain, but not as much as her broken heart over a fickle lover. Her former love is now her sister-in-law, Helen, who married Margaret's brother, (of all people). Ashamed of the lesbian affair Helen impulsively decided to conform and lead the socially accepted life of a married woman. To do otherwise would have meant being totally ostracized by her peers. Her constant  proximity as a new family member has made Margaret desperate to get out of the house and away from everything that reminds her of her loneliness, loss and betrayal.<br /><br />Thus, Margaret is induced to visit the women at the local prison on a regular basis as a form of therapy - to involve herself in the wider world. She becomes a \\"Lady Visitor\\" at one of London's grimmest prisons, Millbank, where \\"murderers, poisoners and common thieves\\" spend seemingly endless days and nights alongside convicted debtors and beggars. It is a harsh and terribly sad existence which offers no hope to the inmates. Millbrook Prison epitomizes the Gothic edifice, with numerous towers, labyrinthine  tunnels, endless corridors laid out in geometric patterns leading to dank, dark cells where most prisoners spend each day in isolation. Long after I finished the book I was left with the image of the huge building looming over the Victorian landscape, offering meager shelter to those who dwelled within its claustrophobic confines. Ms. Waters creates an atmosphere that is downright creepy.<br /><br />Selina Dawes is an inmate at Millbank. A well-known spiritualist and medium in the increasingly popular subculture of the pseudo-sciences, she has been imprisoned for assault and fraud after a s&eacute;ance she was conducting went horribly wrong. It resulted in the death of her benefactor and an adolescent girl's nervous breakdown. Ms. Dawes, a seemingly gentle young woman, is filled with despair at her situation and honestly blames all that has gone awry on a ghost. Margaret finds herself drawn to the apparently innocent and enigmatic inmate, although she is initially quite skeptical of her story. Through a series of mysterious occurrences Margaret finds herself believing more and more in the shadowy world of the supernatural. As the secret relationship between the two women develops in intensity, Selina tells Margaret that she is her \\"affinity\\"- that together they are two halves of one whole. There must be a way for them to be together.<br /><br />From her three-dimensional characters, the clear depiction of bourgeois Victorian life to the Dickensian misery in London gaols and the thriving spiritualist movement of the period, Sarah Waters has created a compelling, powerful novel. I really cared about the intelligent, sensitive Margaret. Her isolation and stress at repressing her most intense feelings are palpable, as is her longing to love and be loved. Margaret's narrative, through journal entries initially undertaken to record her progress as a Lady Visitor, is juxtaposed with Selina's pre-prison story. An excellent read! Absolutely unputdownable!<br /><br />JANAement of the period, Sarah Waters has created a compelling, powerful novel. I really cared about the intelligent, sensitive Margaret.

0385338686|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has created quite a following of devoted readers in the past few years with successful books such as \\"Confessions of aShopaholic.\\" Now she has given us \\"The Undomestic Goddess,\\" and quite a gift it is. <br />  <br />Samantha Sweeting is an associate with the best law firm in London. As she bills in six-minute increments, she compares everything's importance to its comparable worth in time and money. At 29, she's already on the verge of becoming a partner, the goal she's worked for all her life, but she's really stressed out. When it's discovered that she has made an unforgivable error, her legal cohorts wash their hands of her. She wanders off aimlessly and, in a series of misunderstandings, she ends up as a housekeeper in the beautiful British Cotswolds -- a housekeeper who knows nothing whatsoever about how to clean, cook or manage a house. <br /> <br />Samantha is a lovable character. It's hard to believe that anyone could go through life and not know how to sew on a button, cook an egg or wash the dishes, but it's fun to buy into Samantha's hysterical fairy tale. <br /> <br />There are at least two plots here: mistaken identity and workplace perfidy. The first is a really silly laugh-fest and the second is a tension-filled page-turner. The dialogue is perfectly natural, and the action is all the more immediate because it's written in the present tense. If you've ever been treated unfairly at the workplace, you will absolutely relate to her stomach-clenching dilemma. <br /> <br />I loved this book and read it in just a few hours. The book has a breezy, easy style and it's very visual; I could just imagine it as a movie. And even though the ending was not un-soap-opera-ish, I found it to be charming escapist entertainment.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I for one do not watch any tv. When I saw the movie Serenity, I immediately loved the well developed characters, the settings, the story. Its been years where an ensemble cast is so likable literally. A friend actually informed me that this was based on a tv series. I immediately bought this dvd set and watched the whole thing incidentally in a matter of three days. It was excellant. I also learned that that this show was cancelled. I would say this is almost a tragedy because there is so much utter crap on tv that to have a show of this caliber cancelled is tragedy. I wish Sci-Fi or for that matter any company would pick up and restart this show. Please!
0689853637|5.0|The reigning master of the pop-up book, Robert Sabuda, has given us another masterpiece for Christmas this year. \\"Winter's Tale: An Original Pop-Up Journey\\" presents a beautiful winter wonderland filled with creatures big and small. It includes six main pop-up spreads, most with additional small pop-ups. Sabuda said he based this one on the snowy woods of Michigan, where he and his father used to walk when he was a boy. <br /> <br />Most of the pop-ups themselves are white -- after all, it is snowy -- but they are surrounded by bright colors and lots of glitter, foil and acetate to represent ice and special effects. <br /> <br />A bear, deer, squirrels, mice and an owl pop out as you read; an impossibly tall moose rises from the pages and salmon jump among spinning rapids. And on the last page, the colored lights on the snowed-in cottage light up. <br /> <br />It's wonderful!
B0001I562I|5.0|Imagine for a second that you are walking through the woods one night to go pick up your geeky little brother at his friends house, then BAM you get conked on the head and pass out. When you wake up you discover that its eight years later, and everything in the world has changed except for you. You also have been missing for eight years so now creepy scientists want to hole you up in some lab so that they can run numerous tests on you. This of course pisses you off a ton (even though a fresh, young Sarah Jessica Parker is your nurse- and she likes to listen to Twisted Sister alot) so you decide one night to sneak out of your room and suddenly somehow you end up in a spaceship piloted by a giant glass eyeball who seems at first to have no sense of humor at all but ends up being a complete smart ass. He says he can take you home, but you don't know what is home anymore. You want to go back to 1978 where you belong, but it seems that you are stuck in 1986, where your brother is now an older geek, and your parents look like their faces have been melted! YOU ARE THE NAVIGATOR!<br />This intense picture was one of the best things ever to come from Disney. I loved this movie when I was little, and I still am pretty fond of it now. Watch as David, and his glass eyeball, Max discover an intergalactic friendship while they try to find their way back home. Hey its the only movie where a robot sings I GET AROUND by the Beach Boys. Good stuff.
B0002OERI0|4.0|There are bad great bands that are unlistenable (see also: Steely Dan) and then there are great bad bands.  Green Day may be the best bad band in history. <br /> <br />I am 50 years old, and in order to get through the Bush years, I need my  daily dose of Green Day to help me get my anger on.  For everyone who's ever raged against the machine, especially those of us for whom the original ragers are all dead (i.e. most of the Ramones and Joe Strummer) Green Day is the only show in town. <br /> <br />This CD is the apotheosis of the winning Green Day formula, which combines aggressively bad drumming, mediocre bass work, lazy guitar playing (we know that Billie Joe Armstrong is capable of better musicianship), testosterone-fueled rage, some clever lyrics, and the catchiest pop hooks since the heyday of Tin Pan Alley.   <br /> <br />For better or worse, now that Elvis Costello has gone all soft and happy in middle age, Billie Joe is the last bastion of clever, angry punk lyrics, and as a result, Green Day owes as much to the late 1970's work of the Nick Lowe-produced acts (Squeeze, Elvis Costello, Dave Edmunds) as to the punk bands from which this band got its sound. <br /> <br />Green Day is the perfect confluence of punk and hummable, singable pop, which makes the deceptively sweet-faced Billie Joe Armstrong truly the punk Paul McCartney for the new century. <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|This is a very special album. Fantastic! It's so good I'll probably won't mind buying it many times to have a copy of it everywhere I go. All my compliments to the artist and production team that put this together. A new star was found.
B00003CWPL|3.0|I have enjoyed most of David Lynch's movies over the years<br /><br />and I do realize this is one of his first but man this movie(its<br /><br />hard to call this a \\"movie\\") its more a strange trip put to film<br /><br />thanks to drugs or whatever?  It does have so many images that are WAY off the wall, startling, yet its well worth a look. Loved the Lyle Lovett<br /><br />hair and that baby creature, the crying, the mysterious women<br /><br />paved the way for Blue Velvet/Twin Peaks and the many other<br /><br />movies David Lynch had his hands on. This is such an odd/arty black and white film, its hard to even discribe.
B000001ESP|5.0|Since everyone already seems to have raved about the songwriting and playing chops of the boys on this album, I'll tackle a different angle - The Production.  With Terry Brown Rush really seemed to hit stride which combined their awesome playing ability with some commercial appeal.  This seems to have peaked with Moving Pictures.  Perhaps it was isolating them for 4 months in Northern Quebec to record it (or the Maple Scotch).  This album truly belongs with the likes of Hotel, Apetite, Back in Black, and Sgt. Pepper for repeat listenings.
0975991477|3.0|This book begins well and introduces some inspiring thoughts such as how the cell is like a microchip with transistors and that we are like a computer etc. Bruce Lipton's credentials as a cell biologist does give some credibility with some thought provoking ideas. That said, in the latter part of the book it really begins to fall apart with some long straw proposals.<br /><br />On page 100 he talks about quantum physics with wrong dates (discovery of the atom), that the atom consists of quarks and 'photons' (heck no) and then with that he extrapolates to information flows. A bit of a long bow.<br /><br />As part of the all over the place, brain waves are introduced (p 162) but so what? It, like other bits and pieces just sort of sit there.<br /><br />To the layperson like me, Bruce introduces some interesting, perhaps profound suggestions about the integrity of the body, but  he lost me in his spurious detail and unsubstantiated projections resulting from his epiphany on that Caribean island.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars as there appears to be something profound but his credibility to me has been seriously undermined.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I have all four of the \\"Great American Songbook\\" CDs, and each is very special.  Anyone who says that Rod is not at the top of his game is blind and deaf.  The man just keeps putting out great songs, proving that he and the songs are timeless.<br /><br />What a combination: Rod Stewart and Clive Davis.  Wishing them great success in the years to come!
1559409002|4.0|This review is for the 2000 Criterion 2-Disc DVD package.    The film starts with a drag race with a pair of young men running against three young women.  The car with the women goes off a bridge into the river and finally one of the women, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), crawls onshore.  After appearing to be fully recovered from the wreck, she leaves her Kansas town to work as an organist for a church in Utah.  While making this trip, she is haunted by a pale looking man who seems to be stalking her everywhere she goes.  In addition, Mary seems to be drawn to an abandoned resort by a lake near the town she is working in.  This sets up the remainder of the film where Mary has to come to grips of what her attraction is to this resort and who this ghoulish looking man is.    First off, I'm not a horror film buff, but I do recall seeing this movie on late night TV in the late 1960's as a kid and recall reading about it more recently as a highly recommended cult classic.  I stumbled across this Criterion DVD at a local Hollywood Video and decided to rent it mostly out of curiosity.  First off, it is clearly low budget and none of the characters are recognizable.  But I was impressed with the production quality for a film that cost only $30,000 to make in 1961, which is dirt cheap by Hollywood's standards at that time, and believe me, I've seen some real duds from the sixties with low cost independent films like \\"Manos the Hands of Fate\\" and many of those cheesy monster movies.  Most of the acting in this movie is respectable except for Mary Henry's neighbor played by Sidney Berger who comes off a little too wierd and over the top.  The story itself did nothing for me and if carefully scrutinized, the plot didn't make sense, but I enjoyed this film just to see how well a bunch of people with virtually no training in dramatic filmmaking pulled off a well-done production.  Also for nostalgic reasons, I liked watching the people, the cars and the surrounding atmosphere inthis early 1960's small town movie.      The commentary by screenwriter John Clifford and director Herk Harvey is great for only the simple fact is that these guys had a dream and went after it and did it their way.  They also devote quite a bit about how they managed to do so much with so little money.  What's also more amazing is that most of the scenes were made with just one take.  I think any serious movie fan dreams about making their own movie, and it's a film like this that gives someone with some ambition and talent a lot of inspiration to make their own original project.    The DVD quality is near pristine.  The movie was restored but on occasion a few tiny specs of film deterioration could be observed.  The sharpness is just OK and the sound is very good.  There are plenty of extras in this double DVD package.  Personally, I can't see paying $36 for this DVD, but I recommend it for rental, especially if you enjoy independent, off-beat films like I do.      Movie: B-    DVD Quality: A-
B0000047EC|2.0|I absolutely love the Pat Metheny Group. Seen them live five times. Own four of their CDs and a DVD. I even like some of Pat's more mellow stuff. But man, this duet puts me right to sleep. It's not bad music, it's just lacking anything resembling spark.
0446677450|2.0|Maybe you're considering buying this book for the same reason I did.  I'm a 30-something professional who has never understood the world of finance and investment, but the realization has dawned on me that I need to get my act together now, or I'll be miserable in 30 years. <br /> <br />I'm also a bit turned off by greed and the desire to be rich. I've always been sympathetic towards some of the principles of socialism, and rankle a bit at consumerism, target marketing, and the other aspects of capitalism. Nevertheless, I enjoy having enough money to live comfortably, and I started a consulting company so that I could make my own hours and not be at the beck and call of a boss.  <br /> <br />So I bought this book on the recommendation of a client, and from page one I was feeling uncomfortable with it. I pushed aside the part of my mind that was shouting \\"This guy is trashing highly educated people and the working poor!\\" and I was able to actually become enthusiastic about the message of the book.  <br /> <br />Here is the message of the book, and as far as I can tell, the only thing of value in its pages: <br /> <br />* When you own something, it is either putting money into your pockets, or taking money out of your pockets. Owning a business or earning royalties creates income. Owning a house and a car incurs expenses.  <br /> <br />* Try to make certain that the things you have put more money in your pockets every month than they take out.  <br /> <br />* If you rely on earning a wage or salary to put money in your pocket, you will be forever caught up in the vicious cycle of needing money, earning money and spending money. <br /> <br />There you go. That's the big message this book will impart to you, and it will do it slowly and repetitively in the first three chapters, leaving the remainder of the book for the author to drone on and on about how turned $60,000 into $80,000 without ever going into specifics.  <br /> <br />Why do I feel like a sucker? Early in the book the author lists royalties as a form of income. Later in the book he disparages a young writer who laments that she hasn't been \\"discovered\\" yet. He tells her to take courses in sales, which horrifies her (as it would me). He goes on to explain that his best-selling books are best sellers because he knows how to sell them.  <br /> <br />I then saw the $10+ I dropped on this book as just another dollar in his pocket. He writes about 200 pages of repetitive, non-specific advice with only one interesting message (see above), and people line up to throw money at him because of a compelling title and a tough-love story. Towards the end, I felt embarassed to be seen with this book in public, just like I'd feel for responding to a \\"get rich quick\\" spam mail. <br /> <br />I'm taking a friend's advice and buying a book by the Motley Fools.  <br />
0060899190|4.0|I&#8217;m a huge PostSecret fan, so I was very excited when this book came out.  I have to say, overall I was not disappointed.  The book is high quality, and looks absolutely fantastic.  I always get a lot of enjoyment out of reading the postcards, so this is a nice way to have a bunch of them around whenever I&#8217;m in the mood to look at them. <br /> <br />Had the layout of the book been better, this would have been a 5-star review.  Unfortunately there are too many times when one postcard takes up a whole page, or even two pages.  Considering the scope of the project, I&#8217;d like to have seen at least 2 postcards per page, as they were still a very good size when done that way.   <br /> <br />I also would like to see the number of older postcards (that have already been on the site) decreased, and the number of new ones increased.  Knowing how many cards have been collected, I&#8217;d think this could have been accomplished easily. <br /> <br />Overall, however, I really enjoyed and highly recommend this book.  It is a fantastic coffee table piece!
6305079811|5.0|I have long waited for this title on dvd, and I have absolutely NO intention of buying it from either the crack smokers charging $90+ for an old, used copy, or from the Ebay scammers in Brazil, Thailand, and various other countries known for pirate DVDs.  I WANT THIS ON DVD NOW, DAMMIT!  Every week you see all sorts of obscure CRAP titles being released, why not this obscure title?!?!?!?!?
B000ASATYO|5.0|If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll find that I love Peter Jackson's work and his direction in film.  Again, I loved \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and although I was not fond of the new \\"King Kong\\", it was still enjoyable.  Before his two megahits, he made a few other small films such as \\"Bad Taste\\", \\"Braindead\\", \\"Heavenly Creatures\\", and \\"The Frighteners\\". <br /> <br />I saw \\"The Frighteners\\" when I was around 10-11 years old and didn't remember much from it except that it was cool.  Over the years, I always would catch bits and pieces of it on TV.  Finally, I decided to purchase the \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film.  I was a bit worried though.  As a youngster, I loved all the special effects in the film and that was like 6 years ago and technology has changed.  Thankfully, the film is not dated at all in its effects and I believe surpasses the effects of films today. <br /> <br />Well anyway, the basic plot is Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a con man in the town of Fairwater.  You see Frank has the 6th sense and can see ghosts.  Instead of helping them or aiding them, it's the opposite way around.  His three ghost buddies, Cyrus (Chi McBride), Stuart (Jim Fyfe), and the Judge (John Astin) go into a house, scare up some ruckus, and the residents call up Bannister (who's a psychic investigator) to clean up the mess.  Basically, it's bogus and finally Frank is pinned as a con man. <br /> <br />In the other part of the story, many of the people in Fairwater are dying mysteriously.  Their hearts are being crushed somehow even though no wounds can be seen on the bodies.  When Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) loses her husband to the same fate, she and Frank begin to unravel the secrets of the town - a murder that took place years ago, Frank's past, a warped paranormal investigator, Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), and even Death itself in the shape of the Grim Reaper.  The movie is an action-packed, mystery, special effects thrill-ride and it's perfect. <br /> <br />Okay, what I just said might have sounded like nonsense, but really the story is all over the place.  There are so many little subplots and twists and turns that it's too hard to explain.  Michael J. Fox after reading the script said that it was either going to be one of the most creative movies ever or one of the worst movies ever made.  Thankfully, it is not the latter.  This movie is pretty much awesome and the story may seem a bit confusing at first, but trust me, it all comes together at the end. <br /> <br />The acting in the movie is outstanding.  Michael J. Fox is believable as the widower with a troubled past and just trying to get along with life.  Trini Alvarado does fine as well as Lucy.  The standout performance goes to Jeffrey Combs though.  Seriously, this guy should have won an Oscar for his acting.  After listening to him or watching him, I would start to laugh or be a bit freaked out.  His character is messed up and Combs pushes it too the limit.  It's unbelievable.  Chi McBride, Jim Fyfe, and John Astin are all hilarious as Frank's complaining \\"business partners\\".  Other appearances include Jake Busey, Dee Wallace Stone, and even Peter Jackson himself (for a cameo) who all give fine performances. <br /> <br />Although the story is great (at least I think) and the characters are awesome (Jeffrey Combs), this movie is pretty much a special effects extravaganza.  Many shots include some sort of blue-screen or graphic animation in it.  Ghosts interact with humans, and the Grim Reaper is riding on top of a car.  Whatever it is, the special effects work and even to this day look as if the movie was new.  The ghost effects are nicely done and the Grim Reaper effects are solid (you just have to see the movie).  In other words, the special effects are jaw-dropping. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson did another awesome job with this movie.  His pacing, his direction, his animations, his story are all perfect.  There's nothing else to be said about it. <br /> <br />One more thing, many people should not be turned off because of the \\"R\\" rating.  On the back, it says for \\"Terror/violence\\".  This is true, but it's not a gory film such as Jackson's \\"Bad Taste\\" or \\"Braindead\\".  There are a few quick nasty parts - spoilers - such as the exploding head, but it's done sort of comically and doesn't look too realistic.  There is also some language though, but that's basically it.  It's a very light \\"R\\". <br /> <br />Overall, the movie was an enjoyable experience and definitely one that I will watch over and over.  The story is confusing at first, but it all comes together in the end.  The characters are great (just rent the movie for Combs' acting), and the special effects are neat.  It's a fun time and don't miss out on it. <br /> <br />Rated R for terror/violence and language
B0007P3582|3.0|It's just okay, nothing outstanding.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna should have saved the effort she put into \\"American Life\\" for this because \\"Confessions...\\" would have been better than it already is (she could have done without that CD!).<br /><br />I was hesitant about buying this CD (I always am with new music, whether it's a new singer or an oldie) but after seeing the sheer amount of reviewers give the CD such high marks here on Amazon, I decided to buy it (and seeing the video for \\"Hung Up\\" on Comcast's \\"Music Choice\\" sealed my decision).<br /><br />The CD starts off with \\"Hung Up\\" and it goes uphill from there.  Madonna, once again, has proven that she can keep up with the times and stay a few steps ahead.<br /><br />Though \\"Confessions...\\" has been panned by those all-knowing critics and laughable tabloids, the bottom line is Madonna has brought dance music back into the limelight after years of being saturated with corporate-produced slop (Spears, Simpson, Lohan, and music that's faux country, faux ska - just faux music).  The ball is now in the peoples' court whether or not to run with it (and I'm still anxiously awaiting the day when these critics and omnipotent tabloids can produce something better.  Matter of fact, I'm still waiting for them to produce something other than hot air).<br /><br />I watched an interview with one of Madonna's producers and he said the concept for the \\"Hung Up\\" video was to get back to the roots of dance - meaning going back onto the streets and into the clubs because the best dance moves aren't found in a dance studio, they're with everyday people (not his words exactly).<br /><br />Madonna has officially brought Kabbalah and yoga to the mass public through \\"Confessions...\\" and it's a good mix.  A minor gripe would be that the insert didn't include the lyrics - they're just pictures of her in one costume and different poses.<br /><br />In any case, Madonna has proven, once again, that she's at the top of her game and will step down from the pop throne when she's good and ready.<br /><br />Go, woman!
055380457X|5.0|I began this book at noon on day one and finished it the following day. I was captivated by the founders and their story, their guts, their tenacity to stay the course with their beliefs.  <br />Google is clearly a horse of a different color and I am happy that sticking to the core values of doing what is best for the customer has paid off in the long run for them. <br />They did not sell out, not to the dollar, not to the venture capitalists and not to Wall Street. I respect the determination and tenaciousness of the founders and their love of not letting go of the leadership of the company.  How many times have we seen a company change with new leaders at the helm, after it went public? I hope that Page and Brin remain steadfast leaders for a long time. I do believe they will change the world if they do. <br />This is an example of a company who looked long term, of founders who were not afraid to dream and believe and achieve. <br />It is inspirational and informative. If you have a positive attitude, an entrepreneurial spirit and a love of technology and the internet, you will love this book as I did. <br />It is wonderful to know the history behind the search engine I use daily.
055380457X|2.0|Overall, this book was disappointing because it reads as if Mr. Vise is stringing quotes together to get a story.  There is no real conclusions or insights and many details and facts that are conspiculously missing.   <br /> <br />However, it's addictive!  I attribute this to the engaging story of Google more than the writing of the book, but nonetheless, I'm glad I read it so that I can compare it with the other Google book, Search.
0689854684|4.0|I compared this large-format abridged edition (retelling by Timothy Mies, original Wyeth illustrations) to another large-format abridged edition, A Young Reader's Edition of the Classic Adventure, published by Running Press in 2002 (retelling by Steven Zorn, original Wyeth illustrations) and I chose this one.  For storytelling I preferred the Zorn version in the other edition because the language was a bit more salty and closer to the flavor of the original, although the Mies retelling in this edition is perfectly acceptable.  When it came to the illustrations, however, the quality of reproduction in this edition outshined the other to such a degree that this edition won out.  The Wyeth illustrations in this edition are simply electric -- large, colorful and very crisp, while in the other edition the same illustrations are dark and blurry.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Definatly one of the best indie movies around. This movie hit home for me since danvers is right next door along with lowell. Having ventured up to Danvers State myself...although I do not think I was supposed to be on their property...found this movie to be very creepy as I saw each place Id seen before. The movie's plot is very well written and the ending connected everything together nicely. I give it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Doctor: And where do you live simon? <br />Simon: I live in the weak and the wounded...The weak and the wounded...doc..
B000021XR5|4.0|I have this on cassette tape (anyone remember them?) and the more I listen to it, the more I like it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was released at the height of Scott Weiland's personal problems, which overshadowed the quality of this album.<br /><br />For shame because this is STP's strongest album.  They produced great melodies that were quite a welcomed contrast to corporate \\"rock.\\"  I especially love \\"I Got You\\" and \\"Atlanta.\\"<br /><br />\\"No. 4\\" is far from \\"Seattle-lite\\" and STP is definitely *not* the 90's equivalent of The Monkees (and though The Monkees weren't a real group, they were *way* better than the continuous stream of untalented garbage foisted upon the public since the 60's).<br /><br />\\"No. 4\\" is a return to good, enjoyable music.  It's too bad Scott Weiland had the problems he did because STP was a great band.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters is given a giant share of the credit for Pink Floyd growing from the psychedelic brainchild of Syd Barrett in the mid to late 1960's to attaining its status as a \\"super-group\\" in the early 1970's by right-minded observers. Dark Side of the Moon (1973) was the first of a succession of blockbuster albums throughout the subsequent ten years culminating with 1979's The Wall and 1983's The Final Cut. With each album, there were reflections of Waters' growing influence within the group while he cultivated his songwriting talents. And while there are points of reference in the group's earlier stuff that imply what was to come later on, it is from Dark Side on where Waters' focus on the struggles of modern society are most evident. <br /> <br />The horrors of war have long been a major theme of his writing along with the theme of alienation: of people from modern society, from modern technology, etc. Roger's father died in WWII when Roger was an infant and he grew up having no small degree of derision for government in general as a result. This is a condition which was compounded as he came to view the promises of the postwar period (on which his fathers' sacrifice along with that of countless others was to some extent initially justified) being betrayed by an increasingly materialistic, artificial existence. The album itself follows the pattern of every Waters project since Dark Side: having a concept to it that permeates the entire album. In the opening track The Ballad of Bill Hubbard, the album begins with a theme straight out of 1983's The Final Cut: the sound a station being tuned in: with the latter it was a radio, on this album it is a TV. <br /> <br />The Ballad of Bill Hubbard is mostly instrumental and Jeff Beck plays some very stirring soloing guitar while from the \\"TV\\", there is recollections being given by Alf Razzell about his last recollections of Bill Hubbard...having to leave him in No-Man's Land on the western front in 1917 where he died. From there, the \\"TV\\" changes and the first part of the What God Wants trilogy of tunes on this album. Jeff Beck makes another appearance with some very strident playing. (While Roger sings about how God \\"wants\\" all the contrary things various people claim He \\"wants.\\") The metaphor of \\"the monkey\\" makes its debut in this along with a reference to \\"the alien prophet\\" and \\"the alien comic\\" which seem out of place but they will make sense later on.  <br /> <br />Perfect Sense (in two parts) presents modern warfare as it is often utilized by the media. Waters underscores this by having Marv Albert in the second part \\"call the plays\\" as a submarine engages an oil rig and blows it up. The game fascination is summed up in the song The Bravery of Being Out of Range: an aggressive song, which underscores a scathing indictment of those cheer on each media exposure of war as if it is \\"entertainment.\\" The next two songs (Late Home Tonight in Parts I and II) are acoustic and look at families on both sides of the war divide -emphasizing the difference between engagement and detachment to some extent.  <br /> <br />From there, the album moves into Too Much Rope -the weakest of the songs on the album but still containing more food for thought than anything in the so-called \\"pop music charts.\\" From there, the second part of the What God Wants set comes up and this time it opens with a tele-evangelist trying to raise funds and listing the various denominations of money that \\"God Wants\\" among other things (poverty, wealth, etc).  <br /> <br />What God Wants in the third installment opens with musical and effects echoes from earlier Floyd songs (from 1975's Shine On You Crazy Diamond and 1971's Echoes respectively). Another mention of the \\"alien prophet\\" and several animals in the vicinity of money: some obvious and others not so. (Shades of 1977's Animals in some respects here.) And that brings us to two of the best songs on an album of very good songs: Watching TV and Three Wishes. <br /> <br />Watching TV involves Tiananmen Square and how Roger was affected by it. It is acoustic and the duet (with Don Henley) is moving. Showing that history is not for fools, Roger recounts some Chinese history before moving into a list of people whom this Chinese girl is different from throughout history building up to a depressing indictment of modern soullessness. The conclusion is...well...I do not want to give it away but it really hits like a hammer to put it mildly. <br /> <br />Three Wishes builds to some extent on the latter by showing that the artist himself is not free of admitted selfishness. It is a testament of sorts to the human condition and how we say we want to be altruistic but (when the chips are down) we often seek our own self-interests first and then feel the guilt afterwards. Jeff Beck plays a Dave Gilmour-like solo, which eases the tension a little bit but not much. And from there, the album moves into It's a Miracle recounting \\"achievements\\" of modern civilization by outlining the excesses in a somewhat sarcastic fashion. <br /> <br />The last song on the album is Amused to Death. The imagery is vivid and it is at that point where the alien figures referred to at times throughout the album are identified: they are alien anthropologists who found the remains of the human race around the TV sets and after trying to figure out why we died out conclude that \\"this species has amused itself to death.\\" The fadeout finishes with the voice of Alf Razzell spotting Bill Hubbard's name on a war memorial and recognizing finally the humanity of his fallen comrade from many decades ago. <br /> <br />The album as a whole as well as in its individual parts (the songs) paint a very vivid picture that provide plenty of food for musing. Much as Johnny Cash's final video Hurt showed vividly what an artist can do with pictures, Roger Waters with music, sound effects, and various spoken voices paints a similarly compelling picture with this album.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Director:  Christopher Nolan <br />Cast:  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Russ Fega, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris. <br />Running Time:  113 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, language and some drug content. <br /> <br />There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" are two good examples).  \\"Memento\\" deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.  \\"Memento\\" looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until is fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.  Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller \\"Memento\\".  While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought-provoking pieces of the past decade.   <br /> <br />From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). While attempting to save his wife during the attack, \\"Lenny\\" sustained a head injury and has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, \\"Teddy\\" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.  Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard. <br /> <br />Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (\\"How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?\\"); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.  Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.  While \\"Memento\\" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.  Of course, the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.  Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the senseof fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.  An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.  One of the best films of the decade thus far.
0141439513|5.0|Even though the Darcy has a personalities that are unacceptable throughout this story, this character attracted me a lot because of it's peculiar persona that he had. This sense might be derived from the sense of value that I have personally. It is certainly a true that external features of a certain person predispose a people to estimate his general personality traits, however, this should be a thing that ethically discouraged. I like to recommend this book to person who would like to ponder over fundamental matters of human relationship. Pride is thing truly made by Prejudice.
B00008S2VF|5.0|I would not usually listen to this type of music, but when an artist releases a recording that has audio merit, how can I refuse? Basically what attracted me to the clean version is partly because I myself have not used any expletives since acquiring proficiency in English as a second language.<br /><br />Overall, this audio CD has a lot of musical and artistic merit on the mixing and the producing aspects. The tunes are creatively mixed with synthesizers and vocoders.<br /><br />How can I justify my reason for enjoying this audio CD? I really can't other than to say that sample the music from Amazon.com and on iTunes and make your **own** decision whether or not to purchase this CD. I ignored the ugly comments about the CD and have not regretted the acquisition.<br /><br />My humble opinion, no need to take my word for it. Two thumbs up to \\"American Life\\" [Clean Version].
B00005JOIF|4.0|Much has been said about this film before it has been release. Some critics say this is film sympathies the PLO, I honestly do not see that . But it does portray them as humans though. Others say this a \\"pro Zionist\\" film I do not see that at all (despite the fact that one of the script writers Tony Kushner IS pro Palestinian and a harsh critic of Israel) . This film does have a slight tilt for Israel though. Anyway lets get to the review               Munich of course is the story about how Israel strikes back against the PLO after the tragic events at the 1972 Olympics.      It is one of the most well acted films in recent years Something that recent films has been lacking.            THe Film mostly concerns about the emotional stress of the mossad agents that carries out the operation. It is more of a spy thriller than a preachfest film that some people have been complaining about (I will concede that the film becomes a bit preachy at the end though hence the 4 stars.). Some intersting things occur in the the film for example one of the targets has a friendly chat with the films main hero Avner in a hotel balcony (not knowing who he is of course) a chat that Avner tries so hard to avoid since the target is going to die very violently in 5 minutes that is just one of the interesting things about the film. THere are many more but you will have to see for yourself.    Some things I do not like about the film is a subplot with the CIA dealing with BLack September. and the preachy cycle of violence things. If it werent for that then the film would have been a great masterpiece.    TRivia:       In those days Most of the extremist were not islamist, they were in fact Radical Left Wingers. Islamist did not appear  until the 1980s (HAMAS, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah etc).    Look for a cameo appearence of Ehud Barak in drags (Yes THAT EHUD Barak who becomes the Prime Minister of Israel from 1999-2001)    A film which Spielberg FINALLIES portray Germans other Than WAFFENSS Neo Nazis we see in his other films.     A more serious trivia the film is based on a book Vengeance by Jonas which has been descredited so do not take this film as full fact.    Hope this review helps
B00005JKC3|5.0|this movie brung in a lot of green, I bet y'all anything. this is the best movie I bought. no cussing in it and no stupid pop stars in it. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who becomes the Hulk after a lab accident. he was injected with nanomeds as a young child and then saves the life of a labmate by absorbing gamma radiation himself. Nick Nolte plays David Banner. David becomes a different creature by breathing in the chemicals and then exposing himself to the same gamma rays. later on, he gets electrified and therefore able to mesh with the environment. this is a good movie. why was it not called \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" like the TV series of the seventies?
B00008YLV2|4.0|Director:  Ridley Scott <br />Cast:  Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Ewen Bremer, Tom Hardy, Ron Eldard, Charlie Hofheimer. <br />Running Time:  144 minutes <br />Rated R for extreme war violence, gore, and language. <br /> <br />When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 1970's, four of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\", Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\", and Steven Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". These few movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that \\"Gladiator\\" director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, \\"Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War\\", filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.  The film is set in Somalia during the country's civil war and valiantly depicts the Battle of Mogadishu on which \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely awry as two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. Things go from bad to worse as the rangers find themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal is to shoot any American soldier that invades their space. After \\"stirring up the hornet's nest\\", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the rangers motto, \\"Leave no man behind\\". <br /> <br />As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.  Ridley Scott organizes a fantastic cast in discreet fashion, not diving into the personalities of each of the characters, explaining their family situation, or boring the viewer with petty dialogue.  The director sets the stage for the mission, thrusts the cast into the eye of the storm, and allows the horrors of that October afternoon unfold.  The performances form the ensemble cast are very solid, with Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett as the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best scenes in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant as a coffee intern turned soldier, but his \\"Trainspotting\\" compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief. <br /> <br />As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood.  \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.  Although \\"Black Hawk\\" may not have the superb screenplay of a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" or the irreplaceable performances of \\"Apocalypse Now\\", but if there is anything that the film has over all of them, it is its near perfect, truthful rendition of the horrible events that took place on that fateful, horrific day. <br />
B00000IQMT|5.0|This isn't Joseph. I am his oldest DAUGHTER. <br /> <br /> <br />This soundtrack is awesome. Congrats John Williams. <br />My favorite has to be \\"Anakin's Theme\\". Just listen to it and you'll know why. It's so beautiful and it always seems to make me smile.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I really like this film. However, I have to disagree with Burton ,that the guy who plays the oompa loompa is a very interesting person. he isn't at all. The songs are awful and hurried. Especially the teleport TV song. It was the worst..and that creepy little oompa loompa was just awful in that number.<br /><br />The only decent loompa song was the squirrel song.<br /><br />They should have found a better songwriter for the film.<br /><br />The first puppet song was cute though, and when the puppets caught on fire, well that was splendidly twisted...<br /><br />For some reason, Willy Wonka reminded me of the woman from \\"Strangers With Candy\\"
0201721481|5.0|This is a wonderfully well organized and well written book. The writing is clear; the examples are well thought out; the extra notes, warnings, hints and other sidebars are illuminating. For anyone with previous C/C++ programming experience who wants to improve their understanding of the language, this book is the one to read.<br /><br />I found the order of topics to be a little unconventional, but before I finished reading, I became convinced that this is one of the book's strengths. How to use a feature is presented before discussing how to create that feature. For example: How to call a function is discussed before the presentation of how to write a function. Similarly, how to use the template classes in the standard library is described before talking about how to create a template class. I found this to be an effective presentation technique. It reflects the reality of programming in most modern development environments. All developers use encapsulated components that are provided by others and appear as black-boxes to us.<br /><br />This is a high quality book. The authors should be commended for their accomplishment.
B0000062Y2|3.0|The emotive nature of the songs is nearly lost in the movie (which I am watching again as I type for about the 100th time), in part because there is a lot of movement to account for. In the London concept soundtrack <a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002P4H/ref=pd_sim_music_3/104-6648111-9562303?v=glance&s=music\\"> here </a>, you get it all from the music and lyrics alone. it makes a huge difference.    Yvonne Elliman was divine as Mary, Ted Neely was visually perfect, if you buy into the \\"Jesus as benign hippie\\" thing.    If you're buying it for the movie, then buy the DVD. If you're buying it to listen, by the London version.    Watching this time around, though, the lawyer can't help but wonder about whether there would have been compensation due for detroying all the goods in the temple...the healer wonders how the son of god can run out of healing energy...the dreamer wonders whether Pontius Pilate had a massive \\"deja vu\\" before launching into his tirade... sigh. Getting old.
6305428220|2.0|Director:  Robert Rodriguez <br />Cast:  Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris, Josh Hartnett, Shawn Hatosy, Elijah Wood, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick. <br />Running Time:  104 minutes <br />Rated R for for violence/gore, strong language, drug use and some nudity. <br /> <br />With the success of \\"Scream\\" and \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" it's become common to see teen horror films. Mix that in with a Kevin Williamson (who wrote both of these remarkably fresh late 1990's slasher yarns) script, and you have a film aimed at the teen market, but the first thing to come to mind, is that the whole teen horror market has become watered down. \\"The Faculty\\" may entertain the demographic for which was created for, but others will find this \\"The Breakfast Club\\"-on-acid science-fiction romp to be utterly humorous more than it is atmospheric or entertaining.  \\"The Faculty\\" may remind many of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (A similarity acted on by some of the movies young heroes), in that the aliens use human bodies as a host. After the teachers become infested by the creatures, the faculty tries to take over the student population. A few students get away, and begin to try to figure out what's going on. Using the \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" plot, they determine that there is probably one leader alien, and if that one is killed the human hosts will return to normal. That's what they hope will happen. They develop a type of weapon that they believe will battle each alien, but throughout the film they find it harder and harder to trust each other, unsure of who really isn't possessed by the small worm like aliens. <br /> <br />The principal, Ms. Drake (a funny Bebe Neuwirth), is \\"converted\\" by the football coach (Robert Patrick), who is in cahoots with the drama teacher, Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie). The body snatching is accomplished by some creepy-crawly organisms that enter the host organism through the ear. No cumbersome pods to worryabout. Our hero turns out to be the nerdy Casey (Elijah Wood), pure bully-bait, who is brutalized by just about everyone on campus except the sickly sweet Marybeth. She's a transfer student from down south with a mint julep accent. Casey's eventual allies are punky Stokely, campus queen/cheerleader/school-paper editor Delilah, star quarterback Stan and flunky drug dealer Zeke, who just happens to be a closet rocket scientist. In the beginning, it's kids versus adults, but then the aliens start looking for younger blood. It's disappointing that \\"The Faculty\\" degenerates into a routine game of alien hide-and-seek, with a familiar special effects display as back up. The fertile themes of peer pressure and teen alienation are swept away with the appearance of drooling monsters, Sigourney Weaver-rejects. Director Robert Rodriquez, who burst upon the Hollywood scene with the energetic \\"El Mariachi\\", provides some pep, as does the likable cast. Maybe Williamson, the screenwriter du jour, should spend a little more time on his homework.
B000301YY8|5.0|I just learned of James Blunt not too long ago. When I first heard his music, it caught my ears instantenously. His voice is haunting and the lyrics are beautiful. This is a great new artist. You won't go wrong with this purchase. My favorite track has to be \\"goodbye my lover\\".
B00005JO1Y|3.0|The original KING KONG has withstood the test of time so that it stands as one of the top 100 films of all time.  The inferior sequel with Jessica Lange was not even good enough to make a ripple in the pool of cinematic greatness.  Now with the third remake, director Peter Jackson has come close to blazing its way as the stuff of legends--close but there remains yet a significant gap between KK I and III.  In this third go-around, Jackson has decided to go the special effects route, which are often so spectacular that by the second half, these effects encroach on the developing bond between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  The battle between Kong and a trio of vicious T-Rexes achieves its Ooh-aah effect.  Further, the gooey attacks of humongous bats and slime worms both repel and attract at the same time.  Yet, even during these eye-popping scenes, I found myself marking time until Ann Darrow resumes her courtship with and of Kong. During those scenes when Kong and Darrow play out their push-pull romance, I could very nearly visualize that if Kong were shrunk to normal human size, then his relation with her would have taken on more of the Beauty Beast syndrome, with Darrow gradually growing more attracted to him.  And that brings me to the function of Jack Driscoll.  In the original he was the romantic lead and was believable enough in his aw-shucks goofy way.  But Adrian Brophy is here seriously miscast as Driscoll. There are more sparks between Kong and Darrow than between Darrow and Driscoll.  And that makes the supposed attraction between Watts and Brophy fall flat.  I also had a problem with the way the natives were portrayed.  Every one of them rolled their eyeballs white as if they were in attendance at some Haitian voodoo festival.  The original inhabitants of Skull Island were models of decorum by comparison.  KING KONG III is a treat for the eyes, but less so for the mind and soul.  I doubt whether I will watch future reruns of KK III with the same fervor that I do the original.  That to me suggests the difference between a good remake and the infinitely more enjoyable original.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|Director:  Eric Bress, J. Mackye Gruber <br />Cast:  Ashton Kutcher, Melora Walters, Amy Smart, Elden Henson, William Le Scott, John Patrick Amedori, Irene Gorovaia, Kevin Schmidt, Eric Stoltz. <br />Running Time:  113 minutes <br />Rated R or violence, sexual content, language and brief drug use. <br /> <br />\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye GruberEvan's attempt at the time-travelling, life-altering thriller.  At times the film succeeds as a compelling drama, but the film is not supported by solid acting, a complete, cohesive script, and formidable direction and execution.  Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher in a fairly sedated performance), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (played eerily by Eric Stoltz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become and it isn't always pretty.  As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to \\"redo\\" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life.  <br /> <br />The main problem with \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. The chain reaction of events thatresult from Evan's actions may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about them. He affects crucial events in his life and the result are straightforward, logical consequenced, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent the Eric Stoltz character from abusing his daughter by simply threatening him on one occasion, a scene that again misses the point. It's not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself. <br /> <br />The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of \\"Bedazzled.\\"  Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I sort of stumbled upon Madeleine Peyroux and this is the first album of hers that I have purchased. Sometimes when I listen to this music sometimes I forget who I'm listening to and I think it is Billie Holiday reinvented. She has a similar sound, but more melodic maybe. Sweet Jazz for sure. She has a beautiful voice. It is so nice to stumble upon singers who can actually sing well these days!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|what can one write after so many reviews have been written? a review through overview of some aspects of other reviews written. that being said, i was really surprised by how many, in my opinion, misleading reviews are written here. <br /> <br />1) first of all: why compare it to the \\"original\\"? (the only possible \\"original\\" here would be the book, not the first movie). but also - why compare it to the book either? books, as well as movies, as well as art altogether is meant to inspire, meant to make one think, interpret and so on. \\"being true\\" to the \\"original\\" in strict sense of this phrase (and that is how many reviewers took this) means nothing - actually it pretty much guarantees that your own view of the work is going to be very dull, lifeless, depersonalised, meaningless. when thinking about this, think about your relationship with any work of art - the viewer necessarily re-writes, re-arranges, re-makes what's being viewed. in other words- there is no \\"object\\" abstracted from \\"subject\\" in the world of art. the viewer is the viewed and the viewed is the viewer and neither of those is an abstract of their own selves. that is the very thing that makes interpretation, as well as knowing and meaning, possible. <br /> <br />2) second of all, this is clearly not a \\"children's film\\". and following what i wrote under \\"1\\", why should it be? BUT, it is completely untrue that is IS NOT for young children as one reviewer has stated here. the truth is just that children won't be able to understand quite a few things in this film, but will still enjoy it on their own, simpler level. and there are many things for children to enjoy here, for sure. <br /> <br />3) the jokes. i REALLY enjoyed all the jokes, sarcasm, irony in this movie and no, it's not misplaced - it's completely appropriate for our times. it's funny how a few reviewers here have turned things upside-down and said that this vision of willy wonka is misanthropic, primarily because of this attitude of his. in fact, it is completely filanthropic, since it bashes the inhuman in humans. it is not spineless in its manner, it is not watered-down, it is sassy, it is true, it is honest - and i like that VERY much. by the logic of those reviewers, saying \\"you're an idiot\\" to an idiot, makes YOU an idiot (or misanthropic, or whatever). quite strange logic indeed. the character of burton's willy wonka and how brilliantly johnny depp portrayed it is truly incredible. also, it's incredibly meaningful in almost every sentence and gesture. it IS warm. humanly warm. and also, in the world of terrible, stereotyped movies, media mediocricy on every step we take and pretty much nothing with character on our screens, i see how there is place for many people to think depp's and burton's wonka is \\"weird\\". <br /> <br />4) some reviewers talk about \\"modern\\" and \\"untrue to the \\"original\\"\\" characters, like mike teevee. the thing is, those characters are completely well thought through and well realised, and their meaning is to provide a platform to make a critique of certain things that are specific for this age - in case of little mike, scientific naivety when it comes to interpretation of the whole of being. also, it is a celebration of imagination. of course, you won't be able to see this if all you're looking for is to see a \\"modern brat who plays video games\\". how about the little english girl's father and his typical capitalist exploiting worldview? how about american little girl and her mother and their crazed competitiveness and \\"dog-eat-dog\\" worldview - just the way westerners in general are today. it is all completely in place and this is what this movie is truly about - critique of the inhuman. <br /> <br />lastly, i do think that this film may be a shocker to those people who approach it purely as a \\"children's film\\", when, in ESSENCE - it isn't, and requires it's viewer to actually think.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|I suppose if your mind is only capable of making a simple dichotomy, electric Neil Young and accoustic Neil Young, then this album would remind you of Harvest.  Beyond that the comparisons end.   <br /> <br />This album has a psychedelic tinge that is more reminescent of his first, self titled album than it is of Harvest. <br /> <br />Good songs throughout.  Neil employs his atonal melody making to full effect, making a dark brew of meloncholy.  Right when the depression threatens to overwhelm, he comes to the rescue with Far From Home, a rollicking journey complete with horn section. <br /> <br />My only objection is the production.  Neil's voice, as well as the high end of his guitar seem pushed to the back of the mix, making the album sound faux low budget.  If you've complained that some of his work sounds too slick, this is his answer.
6305718954|3.0|Director:  Rupert Wainwright <br />Cast:  Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Bryne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Thomas Kopache, Rade Serbedzija, Enrico Colantoni, Dick Latessa, Portia de Rossi. <br />Running Time:  103 minutes <br />Rated R for intense violent sequences, language and some sexuality. <br /> <br />Stigmata\\" is a very strange film. It takes a real hit on Catholicism, and at times, religion in general. Obviously, \\"Stigmata\\" isn't a film for all audiences, people with strong religious beliefs, for instance, and is certainly not appropriate for younger viewers. The production has so many good qualities, it's a shame to ultimately conceive that the flaw that sunk the motion picture is not its story or characters, but the individual scenes themselves.  Director Rupert Wainwright succeeds in making a very intense, engrossing picture; however, \\"Stigmata\\" is a jigsaw puzzle in which there are many interestingly shaped and colorful pieces, but, unfortunately, they do not fit together to create a final piece of work. <br /> <br />The film opens with an acclaimed and dedicated Priest/scientist named Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Bryne in a fine performance) investigating a bizarre occurrence in a Brazilian church where a religious statue bled from its eyes. After noticing a few unique things in this town, however, after he returns home to Cardinal Daniel Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), Kiernan pleads to be sent back to this area to investigate further, but his requests are suspiciously denied. \\"Stigmata\\"; however, centers on a young atheist woman named Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives an independent life in Pittsburgh where she is occupied as a hair stylist with her fellow coworkers, including close friend Donna (Nia Long).  Things drastically heat up for Frankie after she receives a rather significant gift from her mother who was shopping on vacation. This is an item from a salesperson off the streets whom himself stole from a dead Brazilian priest. Soon, Frankie begins to suffer violent, disturbing visions and appearing on her afterwards are wounds resembling the ones suffered by Christ, a symptom called the stigmata.  <br /> <br />After more and more stigmata attacks are inflicted on Frankie, Kiernan is sent to Pittsburgh where he investigates. It is when Frankie explains to Kiernan that she does not believe in God when he then denies the occurring stigmata attacks on her. You see, usually the stigmata happens to deeply religious Catholics, and Frankie is anything but; on the other hand, never before has each one of the five stigmatic wounds taken place on one individual person, and by the time this film is over, guess how many Frankie will have suffered. \\"Stigmata\\" contains the kind of plot that I liked to experience; a deep, involved and revealing storyline that focuses on touchy subjects. The characters are lost in their dialogue, but if the audience buys the premise, they allow themselves to be sucked in the events that transpire. The person who I saw this movie with found the plot too absorbing for her, and I have a feeling that this is how the majority of an audience will feel, therefore, although it is a close call for me, I am not recommending the film. I do feel, however, that there is a group of individuals out there who, like I somewhat was able to do, will happen to enjoy this production for what it is worth. If the film fit together a bit more, I think there may have been much potential here. But in the end, \\"Stigmata,\\" gets lost in its controversial atmosphere and forgets that movies like this need explanation and a through-line, not brief grizzly scenes that repeat themselves over and over again.

Then do whatever you have to do to track down the boots that have these tracks laid out in instrumental and a capalla formats. The beats are timeless and hold their own against anything that anyone has recorded, and the lyrics flow so smoothly it's hard to believe there's 8 brothas like no othas lining up for the mic. Simply put, the Wu will never top this effort, and it's doubtful that anyone else ever will.
0689865384|5.0|i just finished reading the uglies and it is definitely one of the best books i have read this year (2005) and once i started reading it i couldn't stop. A must buy especially if your into sci-fi/futuristic societies and utopias.
0553801503|4.0|As you may or may not know, this book is just half of what was originally intended.  Because of this, we only had half of the characters, and in my opinion, some of the less interesting characters from the South (Jaime, Cercei, etc.)  For that, it does not get 5 stars.  However, some interesting plot seeds are planted for the second half of the series and I cant wait to see what happens. <br /> <br />The events of this book take place in the South where this is much political maneuvering going on between the southern houses.  The Iron Island folks are also a focus and from here we see the bulk of the battles this time around.  All in all, we have a complete story of the folks in the bottom half Westeros and it was a good read. <br /> <br />I think the main problem with this book is that it lacked a lot of the \\"high fantasy\\" that the other books had.  All the the cool magical stuff is in the Jon Snow, Bran and Dany storylines.  Because of this, I think the next book will certainly get 4.5 to 5 stars.  Why?  Because it will have all the most popular characters in it - Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany, Bran, and more Arya!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Director:  Michael Gondry <br />Cast:  Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Gerry Robert Byrne, Elijah Wood, Thomas Jay Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, Jane Adams, David Cross, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson. <br />Running Time:  108 minutes <br />Rated R for for language, some drug and sexual content. <br /> <br />One of the most unique and heartwarming films of the year, \\"The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is remarkable in its delivery and supreme in its scope.  Joel (Jim Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet).  She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click in ways even they can't pinpoint, but from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.  However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind. <br /> <br />The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is \\"technically brain damage\\", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision, wanting the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completelypowerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind. <br /> <br />\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed \\"Human Nature\\". He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.  Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.  There is a very deep message in \\"Sunshine,\\" and it is arguably screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's (\\"Adaptation\\") deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies of the year.
B00005JOFO|5.0|In this movie, both main actors portray characters which come across as completely believable.  Willingly or not, you are drawn to the difficulties they encounter and find yourself immerse and fully identified with both characters and the dilema that rules their entire lives. <br /> <br />A must see movie this year!!!  Definitely an Academy Award contender!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is my first Orson Scott Card book. I picked it up finally after hearing over and over and over again from everyone I'd meet that its the best book ever.  So out of curiosity, I decided to read it and yes, it really is that good.  The book is fast paced and the characters are engaging.  Card is very good at portraying inner turmoils and character motivations.  I was so engrossed in this book that I was reading it in traffic until a truck driver yelled at me and threatened to report me....thank goodness for audiobooks, which btw, the audiobook versions of all the Ender series is fabulous.  They use the same cast for the whole series and they are the best cast of readers EVER.  <br /> <br />
B00005JOHI|2.0|The mid-90's deluge of Jane Austen adaptations left little room for improvement. The definitive versions of all six of Austen's major novels have already been made, leaving me to wonder why any new adaptations should be made. Movies like \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" and books like the \\"Bridget Jones\\" duo (based on \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", respectively) have managed to reexamine the timeless stories with modern infusions of wit, romance, and tragedy.  <br /> <br />The new \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", however, offers nothing new except its mediocrity. The fault lies mainly with those behind the cameras, who appear to have do little research into the time period, and with the two main love interests.  <br /> <br />The costumes and hairstyles are from twenty years before the movie is said to take place (in 1797) and certain musical instruments did not exist in 1797, but these glaring errors and their fellows pale before the complete failure of Matthew MacFayden and Keira Knightley to do justice to their characters. MacFayden, as Darcy, spends his time pouting and being sulky in corners of beautiful houses, and Knightley snarls her way through her scenes as Elizabeth Bennett. Her perfomance was an insult to the character -- Lizzy was never malicious, never cruel, and most of all, never a tomboy. She was firmly a woman who was resigned to her role as such, but was nonetheless clever enough to find ways around her predicted role. Keira Knightley was probably drowning in testosterone from her next abortive cinematic endeavor, \\"Domino\\". <br /> <br />Without any interest in the two main characters, the movie must rely on its secondary characters. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods as Jane Bennett and Charles Bingley are sweetly romantic; although their love is purposefully bland in its characterisation (the better to clash with Darcy and Lizzy!), their affection for each other is never in doubt. Pike in particular is a lovely, expressive Jane. <br /> <br />Judi Dench is a welcome addition to the cast as Lady de Bourgh, Darcy's aristocratic aunt, and as the fluttery Mrs. Bennett, Brenda Blethyn is a quieter, more sympathetic version than the 1996 characterisation. The viewer begins to appreciate her plight: the job of making sure her five daughters make good matches is hers, and she has no money with which to do it. Is it any wonder she's a little crazy?  <br /> <br />For all intents and purposes, this movie tells the story adequately, but the lackluster, inaccurate production and the leads' lack of acting talent ruin any changes of making this an enjoyable viewing experience. The 1996 version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" remains the standard by which all Austen movies will be judged, and if you can't watch that version, don't believe for an instant that the new, sexed-up, Hollywood-ized version could ever be a decent replacement.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|Director:  Scott Derrickson <br />Cast:  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, Jennifer Carpenter, Colm Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, Duncan Fraser. <br />Running Time:  119 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for thematic material, including intense/frightening sequences, and language. <br /> <br />Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter, \\"White Chicks\\") is a young, naive girl, eagerly heading off to college. Upon arrival, Emily is seemingly attacked by demonic forces, which leave her on the brink of sanity. After her mysterious death from a botched exorcism, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is put on trail for her demise, leaving exasperated defender Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) at a loss as to how to approach the case. As Erin probes deeper into Emily's alleged supernatural behavior, she begins to feel evil forces are following her, and puts her job and reputation at stake as she moves forward with her controversial defense that Emily was not mentally ill, but possessed by a demon.  The marketing of \\"Emily Rose\\" shows frightening images of a young girl violently possessed, a sweaty priest battling thunderous malevolent forces, and an inquisitive woman persistently trying to find out who Emily Rose was and what happened to her. To the surpise of the initial theatrical viewing, this is not the film you get with \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\\"  The film is more a courtroom drama that examines the theoretical differences of medicine and the Church, exploring how the belief of God and His work (and the work of the Devil) has diminished and society is outwardly focused on facts, results, and money.  \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is certainly no \\"Exorcist\\", but the film succeeds because in no shape or form is it even trying to be. <br /> <br />In many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie of the genre in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson seems content to makeus think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner.  As for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly anxious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie clich of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clichs. <br /> <br />It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. Unfortunately, the characters of Campbell Scott (as the faithful, yet assertive prosecutor) and Colm Feore (Erin Bruner's boss at the firm) were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless.  While the film does achieve an excellent feeling of unease and suspense, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise made in being such a unique perspective on religious suspense with a strong cast. While it is indeed a unique film and possesses strong performances, it fizzles out due to a lackluster climax in which the verdict of the case is presented.  An interesting take on the horror genre worth seeing, but no classic by an stretch of the imagination.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|First of all, those reviewers that believe that this is album is terrible...your wrong.  In my opinion this is Enya's best album.  On this album, Enya focuses more on amplifying the lyrics with the music, and the meaning and emotions behind the lyrics.  The lyrics on Amarantine are very moving.  After listening to this CD, at first I was kind of dissappointed.  But after listening to it again, I realized that Enya poured her heart and soul into this album, I can tell it by the emotions portrayed. <br />     Any person that is a TRUE Enya fan will love this CD, and those so-called \\"fans\\" that are criticizing her work are clearly not true fans and should be ashamed of themselves. <br />     I love this CD!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I saw a little bit about the Broadway show on a TV show, and I thought 'I have to get that CD'.  A week or two or I saw an ammatuer performance of it put on by 15 girls, and was very impressed by the music.  I got the CD about two months and loved it.   <br />There are about twelve great songs on it (some of my favourites being 'What is this Feeling?', 'Defying Gravity', 'Dancing though Life', 'For Good' and 'No-one Mourns the Wicked) but there are quite a few (in my opinion) duds.  There are a lots of songs that sound very similar, and a few of the songs are less than a minute.  I would have prefered to have less songs on the CD, and less rubbish.   <br />As the singers, Idina Menzel, or course, is fantastic, but Kristin Chenoweth's voice is slightly annoying and whiny sounding sometimes. <br />Apart from some of the negative things I've said, I've really enjoyed this CD and would recomend it to anyone.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is the best and no one can challenge that if you have heard it. Nas brings you right to the streets of Queensbridge, New York. Every song is a classic but my personal favorite song is \\"Ny State of Mind\\", the best produced song.  The lyrics take over though. <br /> <br />If you don't have this classic, get it right now.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Director:  Sydney Pollack <br />Cast:  Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Michael Wright. <br />Running Time:  129 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for language and some violence. <br /> <br />Who knew Sydney Pollack still had it in him? Pollack, the veteran director behind \\"Out of Africa,\\" returns to the thriller genre that served him so well with hits like \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" and \\"The Firm.\\" In recent years, Pollack's output has repeatedly flatlined (\\"Random Hearts\\"), but that changes with \\"The Interpreter,\\" a relatively, smartly mounted thriller.  A 71 year-old man in what has unfortunately become a young person's business, Pollack uses his years of patience and respect for the audience to help maintain his picture's pace and reluctance to spell things out; \\"Interpreter\\" isn't some gaudy, ridiculously half-baked piece of pop film-making. While it clearly relishes its thrills, the picture is a much more restrained experience that leans heavily on character exploration and tension than on goofball money shots. <br /> <br />One late night while retrieving some personal items, United Nations African interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) accidentally overhears an assassination plot involving a controversial African dignitary in town for a visit. Calling for protection, Silvia meets F.B.I. Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), who initially sees Silvia as a threat, but quickly comprehends that there is more to this story than she's letting on. Fearful for her own life, yet reluctant to give Keller all the facts, Silvia finds herself in a hurricane of intrigue as the days count down to the dignitary's volatile appearance.  As Keller gets closer and closer to the truth behind Silvia's estranged past and the essence of her involvement in the U.N., he must also determine the best course of action to keep Silvia alive and ensure the safety of the United Nations all at once.   <br /> <br />Kidman has one ofthe best opportunities in her distinguished career to shine; shifting from being a possessed, driven woman who wants to ensure the safety of the U.N. and a paranoid schizophrenic whose prime concern is her own personal wellbeing.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, plays a Keller a man suffering from insomnia. He gives a mannered reading to this man that can't accept what fate has dealt him and appears to be sleep walking in most of his scenes. While being not one of Penn's most felicitous appearances in front of the camera, one wonders if it was because of problems with the director, or just a lapse in Mr. Pollack's judgment about this character.  The international cast put together responds well to the director. One casualty is the enormously talented Catherine Keener, who has little to do. Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron and George Harris are seen in minor roles.  Pollack has always constructed films beautifully and \\"The Interpreter\\" is no exception; however, the film lags frequently and the innuendo between Silvia and Keller seems fairly redundant and below the standard of such a fine director.  A good, yet not great film from a director the film industry is glad to have back on board. <br />
B0007OCG56|1.0|This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't romantic, and it wasn't entertaining.  I watched it with my girlfriend.  She hated it too.  The only reason we watched it to the end was that my girlfriend enjoyed watching me squirm uncomfortably while we watched it.  This movie made me want to scratch my eyes out.
B000002NAK|3.0|I have never seen the stage show, but a few months ago got the Original London Cast recording of it, with Elaine Paige and David Essex as Evita and Che.  I loved it and listened to it non stop for about a month or more.  Then I got the DVD of the Madonna Evita out and thought it was the dullest film I've ever seen, (but you can read the reveiws of the movie if you want to know about that) and Madonna didn't quite live up to Elaine Paige.  Her voice is not quite as rich and beautiful as Paige's, and Madonna seemed to make everything so...'pop'y.  For example 'Buenos Aires'.  I loved Paige's version of that, but Madonna turned it into an awful, tacky, Latin-American pop song.   <br />The material is great, but not the artists.  I'm not sure about the Broadway recording, but I would recomend that people buy the London cast, rather that this one.

0790729628|4.0|Director:  Ridley Scott <br />Cast:  Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, Brion Jones, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy. <br />Running Time:  117 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />\\"Blade Runner\\", directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", is a science-fiction/noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to \\"retire\\" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as \\"Replicants\\". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.  Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind. <br /> <br />The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his \\"Chariots of Fire\\" score), consisted mainly of jazz and blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.  The special effects and cinematography are exceptional, with much of the set was pulled off using models. The sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worka, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford is his usual self, doing a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helps the audience along, and was yet another feature conducive to the film noir of the 1940's.  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense and his lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical, while Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today. In a sense, the ambiguity of \\"Blade Runner\\" is the culprit of its success.  A great spectacle of a film that is much more than just its resounding effects, but an intriguing glance into a world that may not be so futuristic after all.
0553801503|4.0|Mr. Martin can write horror (see his short stories), and there are horror elements in this book.  The title refers to the dead, and there is a LOT of death and suffering in this book.  But isn't that appropriate?  Isn't that what comes of war?   <br /> <br />Many readers are unhappy that their favorite characters are not in this book.  But I truly enjoyed seeing the more common folk and the consequences of war in THEIR lives.  And I also liked how life goes on despite what those in power do.  <br /> <br />And come on, the storyline of Cersei Lannister alone is worth twice the price of this book. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because I do think the Brienne sections were mostly a waste of time (except for the travelling priest and his speech about broken men).  She was the one character in this book I felt was on a bit of a treadmill.   <br /> <br />And I loved the ending.  I wondered how Martin would give this funny half-book any kind of satisfying ending, but I felt well satisfied closing the book with two characters I like meeting up.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Don't go into this expecting the level of seriousness found in \\"Batman Returns\\" or even \\"Spiderman.\\"  This film is terrific for what it is: a spoof of comic books and comic book films (particularly the goofier ones like the Batman TV series of the 1970s).  The film pokes fun at the genre and at itself.  It's action sequences, costumes and much of its dialogue are supposed to be over-the-top.  Apparently, some Amazon reviewers don't get that. <br /> <br />The performances are, for the most part, great.  Kurt Russell, the films only big-budget star, seems to be having a terrific time hamming it up as The Commander.  The kids all do a fine job, as well.   <br /> <br />Some have said this film is \\"The Incredibles\\" meets \\"Harry Potter\\", and that's fair, but I found \\"Sky High\\" to be much wittier and more entertaining than those films - particularly script- and performance-wise.  It's a shame it was poorly marketed and failed at the box office. <br /> <br />
B000C4SHRW|4.0|_Sabriel_--understandably popular--is one of the most original YA fantasy books that's been written lately.  _Lirael_, the second book in the trilogy, is also wonderful--perhaps less cohesive as a novel, but it's full of truly fascinating details and even better characters than appear in the first book. <br /> <br />After those two, _Abhorsen_ is a bit of a let-down.  One of the most common problems in fantasy novels is that authors try to make the scheme of things too grand.  It's hard to write about the potential destruction of the world; you run out of adjectives, and the things that are supposed to be the most meaningful end up feeling sort of empty.  Unfortunately, that happens here--what ought to be the climactic pintacle of the series comes across, instead, as a mere conclusion. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong; the same, wonderful characters and fascinating world are present.  But Nix gets swept up in his own prose, and moves too quickly to the climax.  All the little details that made the first two books so wonderful, strange, and unique--and that made it so easy to picture yourself right there with the characters--are elided, abridged, and shoved out of the way to make room for an exciting moment that doesn't mean much when it happens.  _Abhorsen_ reads more like a chapter, chopped off the end because _Lirael_ was getting too long, than a full novel that coudl stand on its own. <br /> <br />I gave this book 4 stars because it's the end to a really excellent story arc; in that sense, it works.  The series, as a whole, is truly wonderful.  And the characters are still fascinating, as is the mythology of the world (intersecting worlds?) Nix has created here.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this book tells a complete story, or rises to the level of its predecessors.  Younger readers probably won't be bothered, but if you're expecting a really superior,  well-written fantasy novel, you may be disappointed.  (If you're looking for something else interesting in a similar vein--though nothing really stands out in my mind as similar to this series--try _Juniper_, by Monica Furlong, or _Spindle's End_, by Robin McKinley.) <br /> <br />Don't choose this one to read if you haven't read the other two--read them first instead.  Incidentally, this is also one case where reading the books out of order actually will spoil it for you, plot-wise.  On the other hand, if you've enjoyed the series so far, don't skip the last book.

Myers escapes and is nursed back to health by an unlucky farmer. After a year, Jaime (Danielle Harris) is living at a children's hospital and is rendered mute by the previous year's ordeal. Occasionally, stepsister Rachel (Ellie Cornel) and her friend Tina (Wendy Caplan) visit, but as Halloween approaches, they get word of a party not far out of town. Tina's friend Samantha (Tamara Glynn) and their boyfriends, Michael (Jonathan Chapin) and Spitz (Mathew Walker), respectively, decide to join in. however, Jaime begins having day-mares that Myers is still alive, something Dr. Loomis knows too well. After Rachael has been killed, Loomis is convinced they are real, and he and Police Chief Meeker (Beau Starr) decide to play it safe and keep an eye on the party. After some practical jokes, Myers strikes, killing Samantha, Spitz, and nearly killing Tina, using a disguise borrowed from a newly killed Michael. Snapping out of her mute state, Jaime and Loomis attempt to bring Myers back to his old house for a last showdown.<br /><br />Horror veteran Pleasance, who has been in an inexhaustive list of horror films , is exceptionally eerie once again as Loomis. Throughout \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\", Pleasance appears quite fatigued which adds weight to his portrayal of Loomis, a man who has suffered a lot. It is odd that anyone would let Loomis near a children's hospital, he is as obsessive and as freaky as Myers. The only person he can relate to is his former patient, his worldview narrowed(cf. the `mad' scientist of most horror). His relationship is quite paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.  While Pleasence is solid in one of his final screen roles, the rest of the lackluster cast seems to be going through the motions.  The direction by Dominique Othenin-Girard is mediocre, bracing the audience with only moderately scary murder scenes and only a formidable climax.  What began as one of the most celebrated horror series has been sliced down to exactly what the horror genre became in the early to mid 1980's:  a chip off the old block that wasn't nearly as effective as its predecessors.paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.

What began as one of the most celebrated horror series has been sliced down to exactly what the horror genre became in the early to mid 1980's:  a chip off the old block that wasn't nearly as effective as its predecessors.
B00007G207|3.0|\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" (1989) was a great and much loved movie, written and directed by  Giuseppe Tornatore (Mal&egrave;na). The 2003 \\"director's cut (\\"Cinema Paradiso: The New Version\\") shows that the cutting, credited to Mario Morra (Battle of Algiers, Burn!) was work of genius. That is, what was cut, primarily the story of the film-maker's lost love with a girl from an elite family, swamped the story of the boy Toto and the town's misanthropic film-projectionist Alfredo (the Basset-hound-faced French actor Philippe Noiret dubbed into Italian, as in his other greatest screen triumph, \\"Il Postino\\") and the magic of movies. Young lovers torn apart has, um, been done before and done better, and those who loved the version of \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" that won shelves of award may be curious about the postadolescent story of Toto, but 29 of the 30 interim years is not in the 47 minutes that had been put back either. The longer story turns Alfredo into a darker (not to mention meddlesome) character. As the adolescent Toto, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) is pleasant to look at, but the compelling performances are those of Noiret and of Salvatore Cascio as the child Toto.<br /><br />5 stars for the released version, 3 for the director's uncut one. The DVD has both versions. For anyone who has not seen the movie, I would strongly recommend starting with the 1989 version. Then, a viewer who wants to know more will likely discover or relearn that \\"less can be more,\\" and, more specifically, that a masterpeice was cut out of a fairly mediocre love story.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Another testimonial why I think when people are married it's better not to have loaded guns in the house. Okay apart from that, I loved this movie. Especially the ending scene. The acting sux, but then when two of the most beautiful people in hollywood are in a movie with explosions and sexual tension, was anyone really paying attention to acting? <br /> <br />I'd wait till the price hits $12.99US to buy it. <br /> <br />What's is about? A hubbie and a wifey who really don't know each other. Talk about unoriginal. <br /> <br />Action - 4/5 <br />Acting - 1/5 <br />Angelina - 5/5 <br /> <br />Total - 4/5 <br />
0226264211|5.0|It is amazing how little has changed in our political dialogue in the 40+ years since this book was written.  Friedman had chapters about social responsibility of business, taxes and incentives, free trade, vouchers and the role of government in the education system, and \\"fair\\" distributions of income, and trade protectionism to protect domestic industries and workers from \\"unfair foreign competition.\\"  <br /> <br />Friedman compellingly argues that Capitalism is the best means of promoting freedom man has yet devised.  He observes that \\"underlying most arguements against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.\\"  People who speak of failures of the market are generally actually referring to market outcomes that are inconsistent with their views of propriety. <br /> <br />He makes the telling point that politics forces conformity in decision making.  Some form of majority decides issues, making that decision binding on all.  Market forces \\"reduce strain on the social fabric by rendering conformity unecessary.\\"  It seems obvious then that the more decisions we leave to individuals, the more free we will be as a society.   <br /> <br />I found it interesting that much that Friedman is criticized for is done on fallacious grounds.  He very clearly sees a role for government.  Government should do the things the market can not do for itself.  The most important of which is enforce the rules of the game and adjudicate disputes over the interpretation of those rules.  Further, government can be profitably involved when neighboorhood effects, or externalities are present.  He rightly cautions against the continued extension of neighboorhood effects, often just an excuse for a group looking for a special dispensation. <br /> <br />He cautions us that one of the things we should fear most is the concentration of power.  This is especially relevant today, given the continuing expansion of our Federal Government. <br /> <br />He makes the interesting point that high marginal tax rates are impediments to becoming wealthy rather than a tax on being wealthy.  This is right on the money and may help to explain why Americans of all income groups are opposed to very high marginal tax rates on income groups above their own.  This is something the left should take note of.  I also found his point that very high tax rates caused the wealthy to be much more risk averse to be quite revealing.  The wealthy of the time properly perceived that with high marginal tax rates the wealth they had was all the wealth they would ever have.  When Washington took 91% of your marginal income the odds were low that you would ever recoup a significant capital loss.  I don't think it is a coincidence that as those rates have dropped the American economy has grown faster and become the premier innovator and new business developer in the world. <br /> <br />Finally he has some interesting observations on the motivations of the egalitarians in society.  He draws a great distinction between equality of rights and equality of outcome.  The left insists on the latter, he feels the focus should be on the former.  The conversion of the American intellectuals to communism/socialism has always puzzled me.  How could people seemingly so intelligent espouse a system that has never been effective anywhere it has been tried.  Friedman suggest that the \\"conversion of the intellectuals was achieved by a comparison between the existing state of affairs, with all its injustices and defects, and a HYPOTHETICAL state of affairs as it might be (emphasis mine).  The actual was compared with the ideal.\\"  It now seems fairly well proven that the ideal is unattainable and also undesirable.   <br /> <br />For those of a libertarian bent this will be a great read.  For those of a collectivist bent but an open mind this is well worth the time and may change your mind just a bit. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006J28KU|5.0|Director:  Michael Mann<br /><br />Cast:  Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, William Fichtner.<br /><br />Running Time:  171 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, language, and brief sexual situations.<br /><br />Few films come along that are as extravagantly produced, perfectly performed by the cast, and emotionally draining as is Michael Mann's epic crime drama \\"Heat\\".  The film brings two of the most formidable actors of the last quarter century and juxtaposes them into a intense battle of good versus evil, right versus wrong, and life versus death.  The wonderful casting of Robert De Niro (playing the brilliant criminal Neil McCauley), and Al Pacino (playing no-nonsense detective Vincent Hanna) is perfect. What is so intriguing and entertaining about \\"Heat\\" is that it goes inside the lives of each of these men, showing us the personal feelings of Neil and Vincent, which adds much needed depth amongst all the flying bullets. We simply see their lives. It is as if we are watching two movies, about two different people, who happen to have a connection to the same crime.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is one of the best expert thieves around, bearing the philosophy  become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from if the situation arises. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino). But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter (Natalie Portman) is falling apart, and, as wife Justine (Diane Venora) says, he lives his life more among the \\"remnants of dead people.\\" A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann (who also wrote the script) shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.<br /><br />Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose blemishes prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. Equally fine are Venora and Portman, while Amy Brenneman, is an equally strong companion of DeNiro.<br /><br />Michael Mann's direction of the film keeps moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly, switching between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. The action scenes are handles crisply but grittily, with the gunshots loud, the blood abundant, yet Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic, ensuring that the action never becomes more important than the drama. Intermixing an excellent musical score by Elliot Goldenthal, Mann adds a gripping, yet soft eloquence to the picture and enhances the cinematic chess game with each and every move.  Certainly hightly-respected and stupendously well-made for the genre, \\"Heat\\" is one of the most powerful, enthralling modern crime dramas of all time.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I actually really like Coldplay. The Radiohead comparison will always be there because they sound so much like Radiohead. As for the reviewer that wants defining songs, what are you 13? Van Halen - Jump, KISS - Detroit Rock City, Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit ? and the Mysterians - 96 Tears and many, many, many more (Did I mention Crazy Train? Intro to Clocks doesn't even touch Crazy Train). Coldplay sounds like Radiohead, but they aren't nearly as experimental, and their lyrics make sense for the mainstream radio. Who really cares if they sound like Radiohead? Talk sounds exactly like a U2 song, but who cares. They're a pop band and they write great pop songs. This album is another great example of music engineered for commercial success. And guess what? They got my $18.00!
B000AP04OM|5.0|This IS what a musical is all about. Drama, comedy, conflict, suspense and of course LOVE. This is the main reason why this flick is soooooo successful and i can't get any of those d@mn songs out of my head! <br />Warning: It is very addicitive ( the songs ) and you will be humming it loudly at the office the next days.  <br />Good movie to buy, but I'd wait till it reaches the $10 mark before buying it.

B000068FXR|5.0|Most of Supertramp's big hits ended up on 1974's Crime of the Century or 1979's Breakfast in America. Indeed, Crisis? What Crisis?!? doesn't contain any of those fun hummable and singable tunes that made those other albums such huge sellers. That being said, this album has something both those albums, lack-- CONSISTENCY.<br /><br />While it lacks the big hits, it also lacks the clunkers that often fall victim to the \\"skip\\" button.<br /><br />Every song on the album is trademark Supertramp, with Roger Hodgson's soaring tenor and Rich Davies' more somber melancholy vocals gracing every track.<br /><br />There aren't many albums I can say this about, but Crisis? What Crisis?! is an album I never tire of. As much as I love Supertramp's hits, this album seems to have a little something extra their other albums lack. They start the album firing on all pistons and they don't let up on any song.<br /><br />Why songs like Sister Moonshine and Soapbox Opera never got the airplay or acclaim that songs like Bloody Well Right and The Logical Song received is beyond me. The songs on this gem of an album are as good as anything else Supertramp has ever done.<br /><br />If you're familiar with and enjoy Supertramp's hits, I dare you to take an excursion into this gem of an album to hear 10 pieces of aural candy that remain largely undiscovered outside the circle of Supertramp's more dedicated fans. And if you're already familiar with this album, maybe it's time to take a trip down memory lane by giving it another spin or two. You won't be sorry you did!
B0009KA7BS|2.0|Director:  Francis Lawrence <br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeuof, Djimon Hounsou, Max Baker, Pruitt Taylor, Gavin Rossdale, Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare. <br />Running Time:  121 minutes <br />Rated R for ghastly violence, gore, and language. <br /> <br />The success of the \\"Matrix\\" films shot \\"Speed\\" and \\"Point Break\\" action hunk Keanu Reeves into another stratosphere of stardom.  His depiction as Neo Anderson in the celebrated trilogy showed more depth and ability than any other role that he had attempted in the past.  \\"Constantine\\" does not showcase his talents much like the \\"Matrix trifecta, but manages to vividly extract every ounce of respectful acting that was once apart of him.  Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels.  Constantine, a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking, and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets.  He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. <br /> <br />Decent yet very incoherent adaptation of the \\"Hellblazer\\" comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very poor performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two \\"Matrix\\" films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. Director Francis Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it.  Overall, \\"Constantine\\" had a good concept, but fails with its execution. To those who want intelligence in a movie, this film certainly strained a lot of the foundation from the comic book and crammed it with religious theories and random babble. Those who want mindless action and dazzling effects, \\"Constantine\\" succeeds by giving them just that. But in the end, there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention, and the depth the film supposedly had never really showed up. <br />

B0009XNUK0|4.0|Here we have yet another attempt at collecting Michael Jacksons greatest hits - the FOURTH in a mere 10 years! Ironically, none of them succeeds. Personally, I don't care too much for the Jackson 5 period - but if they wanted to include the songs, at least they could do it properly and include ALL the hits. Ditto for the Jacksons period - arguedly Blame It On The Boogie, Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground) and Can You Feel It was their best three tracks, but a more comprehensible coverage would have been nice. They should have made 1 full disc only of Jackson 5 and Jacksons material. <br /> <br />From this point, it gets better. All 4 singles from Off The Wall is included - Working Day And Night would have been a nice add-on, but it wasn't a single, so that can be excused. All SEVEN singles from the Thriller album is here - good job, that's how it should be in a real 'essential' compilation. EIGHT of nine singles from the Bad album is included - the omission of Liberian Girl can be excused from the fact that it was an UK only single - it was a nice song, though, could've made it onto here. SEVEN cuts from Dangerous is also a nice representation -  they left off two single tracks (Gone Too Soon and Give Into Me, both UK only singles) and included instead title track, which I applaude, since I think it's one of the best dance tracks he's done. <br /> <br />And this is where it goes completely wrong. The US release has only 1 (ONE?) single from HIStory, the European version has three, which is better, but not good enough. FIVE songs were released from this album as singles - Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song (UK only) and You Are Not Alone. All are excellent songs. All should have been included. Blood On The Dance Floor had 3 single cuts (title track, Ghosts and HIStory remix and also Is It Scary which was out on promo singles) - none of them are included here. From Invincible, You Rock My World is included, while Cry isn't - which was by far the better of the two tracks. Also, Butterflies was a US hit, but isn't included here - I never liked the song, but it still should be here. Single from latest release #1's, Another Chance, isn't included as well. <br /> <br />The near complete omission of material from 1995 and later is rediculous, and makes this compilation totally incomplete. They should have made it a 3CD compilation instead: Disc 1 - Jackson 5 + Jacksons + Off The Wall. Disc 2 - Thriller + Bad. Disc 3 - Dangerous + HIStory + Blood On The Dance Floor + Invincible. Then we would be talking. <br /> <br />But don't forget: This music is some of the best that was produced during the 80'es and 90'es.
0790729393|4.0|Director:  Barry Levinson <br />Cast:  Jason Patric, Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Billy Crudup, Vittorio Gassman, Minnie Driver, Ron Eldard. <br />Running Time:  147 minutes <br />Rated R language, graphic violence and two scenes of strong sexual content. <br /> <br />\\"Sleepers\\" is an extremely disturbing, effective film existing out of two parts. The first part is a drama that involves four young teenagers in the sixties, Hell's Kitchen, New York. They make a stupid mistake that sends them to a reformatory, the Wilkinson home for boys. Here they are sexually abused by the guards including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The second parts is about the revenge the four boys have when they are grown up. If you do not want to know what they're plan is, read no further. <br /> <br />Two of the boys, John (Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup), have become killers and one day, 1981, they see Nokes in a restaurant. They walk up to him, shoot him, and leave. The District Attorney who handles their case is Michael (Brad Pitt), one of the four. He has asked for the case, not to win, but to lose. It is time for revenge. Together with Shakes (Jason Patric), the narrator of the story, they come up with a plan to expose events at Wilkinson. Key figures here are John and Tommy's lawyer Snyder (Dustin Hoffman), the girl they all like Carol (Minnie Driver), the Mafia boss from the neighborhood King Benny (Vittorio Gassman), and a priest who has been friends with the four forever, Father Bobby (Robert DeNiro).  <br /> <br />The first part is very good with four kid actors who are not annoying and a Bacon who is close to pure evil. The way they set up the story is very good as well. We learn to know the kids, King Benny, Father Bobby, the neighborhood. We feel we understand how things work in Hell's Kitchen which is pretty important to make events plausible when the kids have grown up. The second part is not as good but as least as interesting. There are more question we could ask here, but fine actors like DeNiro, Hoffman, Pitt and Patric know how to create believable characters. Although what they do might not be the right thing, we somehow hope they pull it off.  Director Barry Levinson has made a good film, yet with nearly two-and-a-half hours of film, \\"Sleepers\\" is perhaps a little drawn out. He finds the right way to tell this sad story, with a perfect set-up and with interesting courtroom scenes in the second part. The star power probably does the rest. Hoffman and De Niro are great as always, Bacon is perfectly creepy, Pitt, Patric and Driver are effective, and John Williams' score is great.  \\"Sleepers\\" is most definitely worth watching, but only if you are able to stomach some of the horrors of abuse that erupt from its seams.
B0007OCG56|1.0|We rented this movie thinking it would provide a great deal of humor and entertainment but it didn't.  We kept waiting for it to suddenly become funny but all of the clever lines were used during the out takes before the film's premier.  When this movie started skipping and then stopped it was probably trying to self detonate because it just was not funny enough to be worth the cost of renting much less purchasing and storing in your own home until the end of time.  It was painful to watch and I certainly would not recommend it for purchase.  The movie critics may say it was a fantastic work of art but I wanted to be entertained and I wasn't.  This story line had a lot of potentional but sadly it missed its mark.  I only gave it one star because a zero was not available.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I liked how the movie started and that's about it.  I could not believe just how boring this film was!  The reviewer \\"Can't believe some people\\" should not have critized others like the way she did.  My friend, who is an english major pointed out that they were lot of errors in her sentences. She should have just made her point and left at that.  Bottom line, you may like this movie if you liked the t.v. show Fire Fly.
0393327655|1.0|This is a silly book. Harris makes valid criticisms of fundamentalists and religious fanatics,but his arguments are ir-relevant because these are precisely the people who will ignore them. His attacks against the faith of more intelligent believers are simplistic. Faith ultimately is a question of how one interprets the evidence and atheists as well as believers ultimately rely on some type of faith based on subjective considerations. Islam is currently suffering from a fanatic death cult  among a minority of its believers and it would be a disaster if such monsters obtained weapons of mass destruction. There is no reason to believe that a belief in an afterlife contributes to human violence in this world.  Most of the disasters of the 20th century had nothing to do with such beliefs. Nazis slaughtered Jews, Communists massacered \\"Kulaks\\" or \\"revisionists\\". World Wars I and II certainly didn't have much to do with any belief in an afterlife. Today the more mature organized religions(excepting Islam) decry violence and many base their criticisms precisely on a belief in God and an afterlife. Harris is pursuing his own agenda, he should be more respectful or at least more careful in attacking the beliefs of others.

B00008S2VG|4.0|4.5 stars out of 5    <br />    I will admit this from the start--I came on to this album very late.  The time it came out, I wasn't that big into Madonna, and I didn't buy the album because I'd heard so many horrible things and never saw any videos or heard the songs on the radio much.  However, I got a new boyfriend who listened to it all the time.  It took a few listens, but if you give it a try, you will find that it is a great album, from beginning to end, with some of Madonna's most beautiful  and heartfelt songs (Nothing Fails, X-Static Process, Mother and Father), satirical pop (American Life, Hollywood) and two masterpieces of dance/electronica (Nobody Knows Me and Die Another Day). <br />     Now, the critics and even some so-called Madonna \\"fans\\" will spit at posters of this album and go to no ends to bash it.  Well, knowing a great many Madonna fans myself and having what I consider to be genuine good taste in music, I can tell you honestly that the critics who bashed this album either hate Madonna outright, or were just bashing her for being controversial with her unreleased \\"American Life\\" video which questioned Bush's motives in Iraq and lamented the wastefulness of war and the tyranny of political leaders.  Some others also complained that the album is too \\"political\\"--it is really not, and only \\"American Life\\" has slight political undertones...it is really more introspective.  Madonna is taking a critical eye to American standards, and anyone who has stepped foot onto a college campus should realize that learning to look at things with a critical eye is the true purpose of education in the modern day.  This is what separates logical people from fundamentalists, bible-thumpers, and jingoists. <br />  And as for all the Madonna \\"fans\\" who hate this album, most of them are probably drugged up twinks who wanted more bassy-thump-thump dance tracks so they could peak on their X in clubs.  Well, excuse Madonna for trying to become more artistic and creative.  And for those who think this album was too non-clubby, check out the remixes.  This album, in my opinion, has had the most amazing remixes of any album of hers---period.  Any avid clubgoer would agree--American Life, Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Mother and Father, Die Another Day, Easy Ride---all have been brilliantly remixed into massive club hits. <br />   As for the media, MTV, video networks, and radio completely ignored this album because of all the bad press.  Meanwhile, in today's political climate, Madonna would be cheered if she came out with this stuff or with the American Life video today.  During her Re-Invention tour, American Life was a show-stopper and people went nuts over it.  Not only that, but Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, and Intervention were radio hits just waiting to happen, but were never released or received airplay.  What a shame...if Warner Brothers had been more agressive and just shrugged off the media lunacy, then more people would have given this album a chance. <br />   So don't be fooled by the hooplah that surrounded this album or the negative reviews.  Give it a chance and judge it by your own standards.  While most critics bashed it, there were many who also loved it, based on its merits.  It is, for me, one of her top albums.
B000BO0LLS|3.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is one of Mariah's best albums since \\"Buttefly\\". After her breakdown in 2001, an awful album \\"Glitter\\", here is Mariah, back in action. <br /> <br />I've been a fan of Mariah Carey since \\"Daydream\\" came out. Since then, I have all of her albums. The only album that I didn't get was \\"Glitter\\". It was Mariah at her worst. \\"Loverboy\\" was ridiculous. \\"Never Too Far\\" was not that good either. Then \\"Charmbracelet\\" came out. I liked it. But too bad, it didn't manage to revive her career. <br /> <br />Then there was \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\", after listening to \\"It's Like That\\", I knew this was going to be a good album. Bought it after it was released. I even bought it on a Limited Edition set mind you. I truly enjoy this album, not skipping any song. Seriously, the only other Mariah album which I do not skip any song was \\"Daydream\\". \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" was truly great. Then came \\"We Belong Together\\" that top the Billboard Hot 100 for a massive 14 weeks. Already the best selling CD in US for 2005 (beating out 50 Cent), \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is truly Mariah at her best in years. This is also the greatest comeback in music history after numerous predictions saying that her career was nothing but over after \\"Glitter\\". My favourtie song from this album is \\"Say Somethin'\\" which features Snoop Dogg.  <br /> <br />Songs to look out for: <br />1) We Belong Together  <br />2) Shake It Off <br />3) Say Something <br />4) One and Only <br />5) Joy Ride <br />6) Fly Like A Bird <br /> <br />After debuting at No.1 on the Billboard 200, and selling over 4 million copies in US alone, Mimi and company decided to repackage the album into \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi: Ultra Platinum Edition\\". It comes in two forms, one with 4 bonus tracks and another with 4 bonus tracks and a DVD with 4 videos which features videos like \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\". It also features \\"Get Your Number\\" previously unreleased in the US. <br /> <br />The repackage also includes Mariah's 17th No.1 Single, \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", a song that sounds like a mix of \\"Shake It Off\\" with \\"We Belong Together\\". The DVD includes a link to the sexy video (which I can't access and I don't know why). \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is my all time favourite on this album. To date, I've been playing that song for almost 1000 times according to my i-Tunes play count.  <br /> <br />The other 3 bonus tracks are: <br />1) \\"Making It Last All Night (What It Do)\\" <br />Great song. I just love this song. It's catchy and definitely <br />a potential single material. If it comes out as her 5th  <br />single, it should be her 18th No.1! <br /> <br />2) \\"So Lonely (One and Only Pt. II)\\" <br />Another good song. Great rap from Twista. Another single  <br />material. <br /> <br />3) \\"We Belong Together (Remix)\\" <br />This remix was good. It's \\"We Belong Together\\" in a different <br />mood.  <br /> <br />Recently, Mimi was also nominated for 8 Grammys including Album Of The Year for \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" and Song Of The Year and Record Of The Year for \\"We Belong Together\\". This is really a comeback! Mariah had only won 2 Grammys since her career. Let's just hope this album will increase that number. <br /> <br />Overall, I was quite dissapointed with the repackage of \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\". They should have included \\"Secret Love\\" and \\"Sprung\\", two tracks which can only be found in \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" in Japan. Besides that, they should also include other materials in the DVD because the DVD is quite boring since I've already seen and downloaded all the 4 videos. <br /> <br />If you still don't have \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\", then this Ultra Platinum Edition should be worth it. If you already have, then don't bother buying it again (which I did) because it's not that worth it after all. <br /> <br />Like I said, not that Ultra Platinum after all. <br /> <br />Note: 3 Stars for the repackage album (if you already have the <br />original album) <br/> <br />5 Stars for the repackage album (if you do not have the <br />orignal album) <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMCT|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie before I saw it.  Unfortunately, it falls short of the hilarity of the first two (the second one was my personal favorite).  It's not terrible (hence, three stars).  It's just not up to par with it's two predecessors.  I think the reason I didn't like it as much was simply the lack of \\"Michelle\\" in the movie.  Oh, sure, Alyson Hannigan was in the movie.  However, for a movie that was supposedly about her wedding, she didn't have very much to do and her part, except for the hilarious proposal scene, wasn't written nearly as funny as it was before.  I guess that's my main objection to the movie.  Everything else was pretty similar to the other two movies.  This one just had less of the funny, wacky \\"Michelle\\" that we had come to know.  I really missed that.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|The charm and charisma of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors, and Diane Lane, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood, saves what would be a total waste of time otherwise. <br /> <br />Two recently divorced 40-somethings are brought together via online personals, and the usual, albeit formulaic hilarity ensues. Suffice it to say, this film is very predictable, and follows too many of the same oft-used premises we've seen a million times before----Diane Lane's gay male friend for a shoulder to cry on----Cusacks wise-cracking buddy who's desperate for attention himself----we've seen it all before, but it's the appeal of Cusack and Lane that keep \\"Must Love Dogs\\" from being a total re-hashed disaster. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is very strong: Christopher Plummer, looking great in his mid 70's, as Lane's playboy widowed father, the always reliable Elizabeth McGovern as Lane's sister, and Stockard Channing as one of Plummers paramours, all lend a nice hand in making this film (barely) work. <br /> <br />A light, fluffy little film worth the price of a rental, if not a theatre ticket....although I'd pay to watch Diane Lane read the phone book!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTLY THE #1 BEST MOVIE BASED ON A GAME i HAVE EVER SEEN. THE ANIMATIONS ARE EXEMPLARY AND THE STORY LINE WAS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST....AND COME ON NOW...IT IS A FINAL FANTASY VII PRODUCT.
0743243153|2.0|I found this book to be a challenge, and in some ways helpful; but I would advise the reader to read this book with caution; in other words: do not take what Peck says as gospel.  <br /> <br />For example, Peck advises: \\"The only way that we can be certain that our map of reality is valid is to expose it to the criticism and challenge of other map-makers.\\" (P. 52) <br /> <br />I think this is a dogmatic and biased statement. At times, yes we can get feedback from others with regard to \\"our map of reality\\" being valid; but I also think that one can validate their map of reality by observing reality and trusting their own capcity to criticize and percieve correctly rather than exposing our map, or way of seeing things, to other \\"map-makers.\\"  <br /> <br />Peck also seems to imply that if a person has a problem in psychotherapy, it's \\"their\\" problem, not that of a poor psychotherapist, or the fact that a person may not need psychotherapy at all. <br /> <br />The book does present some challenges that stimulate further thinking and discovery. For example, on page 282 Peck states: \\"In other words, mental illness occurs when the conscious will of the individual deviates substantially from the will of God, which is the individual's own unconscious will.\\" I asked a psychiatric resident about this, who replied: \\"Hmmm, an interesting perspective.\\" <br /> <br />Sometimes I felt that Peck was trying to make a treatise for people to enter psychotherapy and giving the psychotherapist an almost godlike status, as if they are always right and never wrong.  <br /> <br />I think the best way to read this book, is to read it with a skeptical mind, yet respecting that it's one doctor's way of seeing things.   <br /> <br />
B00008S2VG|3.0|reading all the other reviews, it seems that most people either loved this album or despised it. To give a fairer chance, this LP was not bad but does not stand out as one of Madonna's best efforts. <br />Maybe her biggest mistake was to have had the whole album produced by Mirwais who might be a good songwriter (Music, Die Another Day, Don't Tell me) but has no enough talent to sustain the audience's interest to the full length of an album. <br />And yes, we all know now that the album flopped in the US because of its political message at the time it was released. But the war issue was not an oversensitive one in mainland Europe, so how come the album shifted half amount of copies over here than the previous Music? By the time Madonna released the second single, she must have given up promoting American Life. This did not leave any credit for a song like Nothing Fails which falls into the ballad category like Take a Bow released 10 years ago but is acoustically of a much higher standard (and yet did not chart). <br />It would have been a better accomplished work if she had mixed the songs with another producer (what happened to William Orbit?)and added a couple of extra songs with less vocoders and a better hook-up tune... something she has partially managed to achieve in the new album Confessions with tracks like Sorry and Jump
6304498969|5.0|See the slow hand on an acousitc guitar. This is the kind of music DVD that should be the standard for everyone else to follow. Great song selection, great sound, awesome quality. It just does not get any better. Buy it. Buy it now.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|wow...this soundtrack is super....the instrumental showings are very warm and inviting....emmylou harris song-\\"a love that will never grow old\\" is her best delivery ever...hopefully she will be recognized come grammy time...rufus wainwright has an incredible voice that is haunting as well-as he conveys on-\\"the maker makes\\"...i could go thru and mention them all but sometimes less is more....i can hear the soundtrack and see the visuals in my mind, now that is what a soundtrack should do!! This soundtrack comes from a beautiful film that weighs heavily on beauty....beauty between loves lost and beauty of what is around us as we continue on a journey to find ourselves and how others find us....hopefully this film will gather much attention come oscar time...
B000AARKOO|4.0|We recently rented this movie and, to our surprise given the reviews, really enjoyed it.  While it is \\"hollywood\\", there is enough historical fact and genuine character development to keep it from being just another battle-scene movie.  The romance, while a bit fanciful, added an interesting spark to please \\"everyone\\".   <br />I say watch it and enjoy. It is a very entertaining movie with some excellent acting and a few grains of historical fact.
6305364648|5.0|If you want to see an entertaining movie with lots of action and laughs,then you should most certianly watch True Lies.Any movie in which terrorists gets their a** kicked ,is a movie worth watching too,won't you say?.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis were just wonderful in this hit.You should definitely get this dvd for your collection.
B00005JNX0|3.0|I thought the concept was interesting if obviously co-opted from a number of different books (Pi, Not Wanted on the Voyage, etc) and movies (too numerous to list).   While we did get some good chuckles, this movie never fully manifested itself the way that it could have.  Most of the humor was borrowed and the humor not as clever as it could have been.  That said, it was enjoyable and I must stay, in all honesty, that my spouse laughed out loud more than a few times. It's a pleasant enough way to spend some time even though it disappoints when you realize how much more it could have been.
B000850IHW|5.0|\\"Free Hand\\" has long remained my favorite Gentle Giant album. While \\"Octopus\\", \\"Acquiring The Taste\\" and \\"In a Glass House\\" all are among my favs for some reason this one appeals to me the most. Derek's vocals never sounded more confident and the melodies are among the richest they composed with great intricate interplay between the musicians.<br /><br />From the opening finger clicks of \\"Just the Same\\" to the folk electric violin part that opens \\"Mobile\\" the band are tight, focused and deliver some of their best music. This reissue sounds terrific. I saw someone else complain about pops and crackles on their CD. Perhaps I'm losing my hearing buy my edition sounded perfect. How does this compare to the previously issued CD's? It's much, much better sounding than the original CD with better depth and presence. The BGO issue sounds very good as well but I have to give this edition the edge because the clarity is better throughout the CD.<br /><br />This DRT reissue (which is, by the way, Derek Shulman's indenpendent label)features a single bonus track a good sounding live recording of \\"Just the Same\\" with the band in top form. The recording features Derek's vocals upfront in the mix (my guess is that it's from a mix board cassette which might explain why it's flat sounding compared to more modern recordings that and the age of the original source tape). It still sounds good and although the mix is a bit muddy at times, it sounds as if there was considerable clean up done improving the overall sound. While it can't compare to something recorded for professional release from the same time period, it's a solid sounding effort with the band playing with fire and intensity. The performance always wins out in my mind over sound quality and the sound quality is pretty darn good all things considered.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed seeing as how this is Derek's company that he didn't include any personal reflections (pun intended)on recording this album. I am happy that the original lyrics and a simulation of much of the art work (redesigned for CD)is included. A pity that Derek didn't incluce a couple more live recordings from the same concert (it's from the tour to promote \\"Free Hand\\" performed in New York in 1975). Other than those minor quibbles this is definitely worth picking up.he original lyrics and a simulation of much of the art work (redesigned for CD)is included.

B000002U82|5.0|This was an album born to be underground and yet it became so comercial. Anyways I'm not gonna lie to you, this album is something really amazing. Best and Strongest Album of Pink Floyd, Hands down.  <br />Songs like \\"Us and Them\\" gives a romantic side to this album and songs like \\"Any Colour You Like\\" make this album so great. What about the voice solo on \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", man what a great solo this woman made on this song. \\"Breathe\\" is worth a mention too. \\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\" may be the strongest on the album, but to be honest I would say evey song is worth your 11 dollars.  <br />If you're making a collection in all Rock \\"Aspects\\", you should start with this one. <br /> <br />I would also highly recommend Meddle, Animals, Wish You Were Here and Ummagumma.
0743454537|3.0|I won't write a summary since so many others here have.  I loved the buildup to the end, and was very disappointed.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but those who have read it know of what I speak.  It was a lovely, thought provoking story.  I was up late for several nights reading; I could not put it down.  The surprise ending was not that surprising to me, and was a major let down.  The characters were beautifully described, and developed greatly, over time.  To have these people's lives unfold before my very eyes, switching from past to present, was a real treat.  I was attracted to the sense of ambiguity about moral right and wrongs, if they exist, here.  That is the best part.  I recommend this with reservations.
0689878451|4.0|This is a sweet little story about relationships, about a couple who wants a child and gets to adopt.    OK, so they are penguins.  OK, so they are MALE penguins.  It still seems to me a book about loving families.    Little children won't care that they are penguins--how many anthropomorphic families do they read about in a year? And the \\"alternate lifestyle?\\"  Puh-leeeeze! This book is targeted for young kids--so young most of them don't know yet what makes us \\"male\\" or \\"female.\\"       I wish \\"regular\\" families in books were so sweet! And the illustrations are lyrical and easy on the eyes. You get a sense of personalities but the characters are not too cartoony.    One star deducted for writing that's just a bit uneven in quality, switching at times from a nice fairy tale-ish narrative to \\"educational.\\"    I've read that since the book was published, the penguin couple had a painful break up, one of them leaving for a female.  WHO CARES?  This isn't the Chronicles of Narnia; it's a picture book.
0312330537|5.0|I know there isn't anything new I can say, but this book inspired me to write my first review. What an amazing story and how alive it was. How can anyone quibble over his writing?  This isn't someone who went to college to be an English major, for heaven sakes. He lived this story, and I find his ability and perserverance in completing it admirable. It was wonderfully descriptive--he made the scenes and people come alive. It made me think on so many levels. I will never forget this story, and I feel like I am preaching to people to get them to read it. <br /> <br />The movies rights are acquired. I read that Johnny Depp was going to play Lin in a movie expected out in 2007. Couldn't think of a better person for the part.
B0009ML238|5.0|For all the people saying \\"they sound too much like Dream Theater,\\" I have one thing to say:<br /><br />So?<br /><br />I can *definitely* hear the DT influence in this disc.  GREAT!  The *style* is fairly similar to DT.  GREAT!  You see, DT is one of my favorite bands, and if someone wants to put out a CD that sounds like it could have been a Dream Theater disc, I'm OK with that, as long as it's done well and there are no blatant \\"rip-offs\\" (ie. half the songs sound just like songs by another band).<br /><br />The opener (\\"Sin\\") gets my vote for song of the year.  It grabs you from the opening note, and never lets go.  The vocal melodies and harmonies are great, musicianship perfect, and it's almost CATCHY (well, for a prog-metal song).  The lyrics tell a story of a murderer and his crime, from 5 different perspectives (murderer, victim, victim's loved ones, God, and Satan), and actually give me chills.  Well-written, and delivered with great emotion and range.<br /><br />Further, \\"The 1st Chapter\\" is my vote for prog-metal CD of the year.  I've bought about 40 CDs this year (own over 1100), including Kamelot's \\"The Black halo,\\" DT's \\"Octavarium,\\" Porcupine Tree's \\"Deadwing\\" and Redemption's \\"Fullness of Time\\".<br /><br />All those are also excellent CDs, and if originality is your main requirement, you're welcome to pick another CD for your \\"CD of the year.\\"  But if you love great prog-metal, played by top-notch musicians, with one of the BEST vocalists I've ever heard (equally great live, as are all the musicians), then you OWE it to yourself to check out this CD.<br /><br />And yeah, *especially* if you like Dream Theater.  :-)
0307276902|5.0|Yes, there is hype. Yes, some of it is embellished. So what...it is still a great book! Just because there is hype does not mean he's a bad guy!  SHOCKER: the guy was messed up for a long time. It would be like trying to remember, in detail, a party you were at last year when you were drunk the whole time. You do the best you can and then you fill in the blanks for the rest.  You won't be disappointed and you won't want to put it down.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|Mr. Lucas...you have a problem.  Why would fans want to buy the same set one year later without the 2 and a half hour documentary that we (I don't think I'm alone here) had a blast watching?  When I saw the new box with the original artwork, I thought to myself, wow, he finally came to his senses and released the original trilogy the way it was in theaters; I was very disappointed to find out that it wasn't.  Why mess with a classic?  I know you and Spielberg have a competition to see whose movie (Star Wars or ET) will get rereleased the most times, but man, come on now, this is getting re-freaking-diculous!  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed seeing all the new stuff in the special editions on the big screen, as I was not alive in 1977 and did not get see New Hope or Empire in the theaters, but please give it up and release the original pictures the way that every genuine child of the 70s and 80s has been waiting for ever since the inception of DVD almost 10 years ago.  My patience is wearing thin, get your act together.
0671027344|5.0|I thought this was a great book. It was a quick read, but still had substance. I cared about the writer of the notes and I really wanted good things to happen to him. The reason I kept reading was simply because the writer drew me in. Excellent book for young adults or for adults, looking for a break from the heavy literature of \\"adulthood.\\"
B00003CXXP|5.0|I've read many fine reviews of this movie here at Amazon but none that look at the religious aspect of AI. The young mechanical boy is looking for the blue fairy (Mary mother of Jesus) to make him a real boy (give him a soul).  The irony of his situation is he was created to last (live) forever a promise Christianity preaches in the afterlife yet he is unable to become mortal as a real boy. The failure of the blue fairy to make him mortal and the crumbling of her statue towards the end of the movie is a strong cynical view of the promise of religion and its icons. The film is packed with contrast and the reality of what it is to be human and aspirations and hope are a very big part of all our lives.  There is no happy ending for a general audience here and hopefully in the not so near future the masses or part of will come to appreciate the achievements of this future masterpiece.
B000059HAI|5.0|This review is dedicated to the memory   of S1c Robert E. Clarke, from my home town   of Great Bend, Kansas, who was among the men lost   aboard the USS ARIZONA on December 7th, 1941.   I had originally requested a DVD of 2001's \\"Pearl Harbor\\" for Christmas this year, but I had a change of heart and requested - and was given - \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" instead.   I served in the Navy as a Yeoman at COMSUBPAC Staff on the Pearl Harbor SUBASE in the early 1970s, and had made numerous visits to the USS ARIZONA Memorial during my two-year tour there. I looked down into the water and saw the outline of a once-powerful and proud United States warship. I touched the rusted stump of the ARIZONA's mainmast, to which is welded the flagpole from which the flag is flown every day over the USS ARIZONA Memorial. I read Walter Lord's book \\"Day Of Infamy\\" and made myself very familiar with the types and vintages of ships that were in the harbor on December 7th, 1941, and where they were located when the attack took place.   In later years I finally saw \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" on TV, and in 2001, when I saw the film \\"Thirteen Days\\" in the theaters, it was preceded by the trailer for the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\" - all of which prophetically preceded our generation's own Pearl Harbor on 9-11.   \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" stays brilliantly on-topic, as any film about the attack on Pearl Harbor should do, and it goes to great length to stay true to what really happened on the Day That Will Live In Infamy.   Unlike the 2001 film, \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" stayed true to the vintage of ships in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the actual relative locations of those ships in harbor on the day of the attack. There were a couple of glimpses of 1970s frigates in a couple of background shots in \\"Tora\\", but these views were forgivably brief, unlike the attempt by the latter film to openly pass 1970s-vintage Navy ships off as pre-World War II warships.  Maybe it is because I served in the Navy when those Knox-Class frigates werein service, but the \\"Continuity break\\" of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" passing them off as Pre-World-War-Two ships just jumped off the screen at me when I watched the 2001 film.  And the famous sortie of the USS NEVADA in her heroic dash towards the open sea, as the one and only battleship to get under way during the attack, was well captured with full accuracy in \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" while being completely ignored in the latter film.   To most men in the harbor on December 7th, 1941, the NEVADA's bold drive down the harbor, with the American flag proudly waving from her fantail, was the finest thing they saw that day. One man who saw this remembered that the \\"Star- Spangled Banner\\" was written under identical circumstances during the overnight bombarding of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812, and he understood better the words of Francis Scott Key.   While Japanese Admiral Yamamoto probably never really uttered that line \\"I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant, and fill him with a terrible resolve\\", that line does capture Yamamoto's awareness that the United States was NOT a nation to be attacked without consequences. He knew full well the meaning of \\"Don't Tread On Me!\\"   While it covers in detail the multiplicity of errors and blunders in the months, weeks, days, and even hours and minutes leading up to the attack, \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" also takes you inside the mind of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, who planned the attack, but, having been in the United States, knew of America's war capability, and of this nation's character.   While Yamamoto's \\"Sleeping Giant\\" speech at the end of the film may be apocryphal, it captures his awareness of what Japan was getting itself into. His prediction that he could run rampant in the Pacific for maybe six months to a year after the attack, but could promise no further victory for Japan beyond that, proved true.   In this viewer's opinion, the best war films are always those that blend the points of view from both sides.   \\"Tora!Tora! Tora!\\" takes well the sage advice \\"Know Thy Enemy\\".   In light of \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"'s adherence to historic accuracy throughout the film, it earned that bit of artistic license with Yamamoto's fictional - yet dramatic - \\"Sleeping Giant\\" speech.   If you really want a good accurate movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor, make it \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\".   You'll be glad you did.   Doug Peschka
B000BJS4OY|3.0|This box set contains one CD and 2 DVDs.<br /><br />Let's talk about the DVDs.  The first one I watched was DVD Live at Hammersmith Odeon. This is great stuff.  It shows the E street band at the height on 1970's NJ Fashions. In another words they look like a bunch of cheap hoods. I mean that in a good way.  And then there is Bruce . I had forgotten this Bruce. Bruce as a young, skinny, badly dressed ball of rock and roll fire.  As the show started the English audience must have thought \\"who is this guy? By the end of the set the crowd was on it's feet begging for more.<br /><br />  Watching this set brings back so many great memories of seeing Bruce in the 70's.  In fact the only thing this set is missing is Bruce doing one of his stories. If they sold this DVD alone in would be a must have 5 star DVD<br /><br />  The 2nd DVD is Wings for Wheels. While the Hammersmith Odeon show made me feel young again the making of Born to Run made me feel old. This DVD is Bruce and E Street looking old and talking how hard it was cutting the LP.<br /><br />  Besides the fact that I found out that they used a glockenspiel on Born to Run it is not a lot of fun seeing an older Bruce talk about what it was like 30 years ago. What happen to the Bruce that was Born to Run?  I must say after watching Wings for Wheel which seems like a VHS special I felt Bruce is Born To Sell.  Five Star for the Hammersmith Odeon show. Minus one for the other dvd. Minus 1 for making me buy BTR again.. Total three stars<br /><br />If you don't already own Born to Run on CD then this is a 5 star bargain.  Then again, if you don't already have BTR on CD why are your reading this ?
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|So, I started reading some of these reviews, and I had forgotten that normal people (non-metalheads) listen to A7X.  You know, people who don't know what \\"death metal\\" and \\"black metal\\" actually refer to and are repulsed by all manners of screaming.  This is that hazy area where good metal meets the mainstream.  Also, you misguided souls who think City of Evil is a better album can stop reading right now.  Go listen to Bat Country or watch The OC or something.  All we'll do is piss each other off.  But I digress.    Waking the Fallen is fantastic.  Absolutely amazing.  Not a bad song on the album.  The guitar work is impressive and pretty.  The screaming is solid.  The singing is decent (I don't understand why he forgot how to sing after this album). The two combine very well on a few tracks.  If you like epic music (be it Blind Guardian, Killswitch Engage, or Nile), you should find plenty to enjoy here.  Dragonforce fans, stay away.  This isn't the absurd, seizure-causing level of epic you're used to.  It's dark, it's beautiful, and it's catchy.  If you like metal, check it out.  It may feel like a guilty pleasure at first, but you'll get past it.  If you don't like metal, then I honestly don't know what to tell you.  I don't know how your brains work when it comes to music.    There are heavier bands.  There are softer bands.  It doesn't matter who they sound like or who can do certain things better.  It doesn't matter what music sub-genre these guys fall under (metalcore).  Just listen to the album.  It's damn good.  I've accepted that no A7X album before or after this one will ever be good enough to lick Waking the Fallen's shoes.  They've decided to start making crap.  And that's okay.  There are a lot of people out there who like crap.  I feel that Avenged Sevenfold have already left their mark on the world.
B00007KWHN|5.0|THE YES ALBUM is the best album of Yes' progressive/art-rock phase, before the group's indulgences got the better of them. It's true that \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" hasn't aged particularly well, but \\"Starship Trooper\\" expresses the opinion that isolationism leads to such behaviors as intolerance for regionalistic speech, and the songs \\"Perpetual Change\\" and \\"A Vision\\" contain cautionary lyrics that inspire me to look at pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to self-indulgence and/or complacency. The band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|This CD was made not for hearing, but a torture weapon of true pain. As the CD cover itself shows. Worse then the water-drip-on-your-forehead that is promised to bring anything out of your enemies. Celine Dion was a true genius in giving mankind the ultimate weapon of all time. <br />  <br />Chain your enemies to a table or tie them to a chair. And find a radio and put in this horrible device inside. Now is the time that the torturer puts on the heavy duty earmuffs included with the package. And make sure the radio will last for as long as needed. Now play the CD and the person getting tortured or the \\"torturee\\" will have his ears and his mind probed and will be destroyed by the unspeakable evil from the CD. Play for as long as needed until the enemy tells you what you need to know, playing for more then 24 hours WILL induce insanity, blindness and of course, the unfortunate benefit of deafness, for the torturer of course. Enjoy this evil torture device! <br />  <br />  Other uses for the CD is frisbee, frisbee thrown at someone that you strive to kill, a drink coaster, cook it in the microwave for the cheap person's Star Trek effects. Do not rip this CD to your computer's sensitive hard drive, for the infinite viruses of darkness that lurk around in the tracks of evil, will infest your weak HD's memory and not only destroy the memory, but cripple it forever and send an electrical surge to the monitor that is intended to explode in your face and KILL you! Playing it in your CD player will cause unspeakable consenquences that are worse then anything. Possible exploding with the power of a 1 megaton bomb. A weapon to destroy the Terrorist's country, such as the Taliban, and blare it across the countries and it will kill Bin Ladin eventually! He has to be somewhere in Afghanistan, he will be dead eventually or lose his mind and show himself to the US.  <br />   <br />The origin of this CD is easily found and it is of course, created in Hell.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer is stepping out in a new direction with this disc. Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan are unarguably world-class musicians, and they have contributed thier always-stellar playing here. John Mayer's guitar playing is certainly technically proficient, and I believe it has real soul, too. \\"Wait until tomorrow\\" is a good example of that soul. I don't expect him to be Buddy Guy, though Buddy himself has endorsed John. The CD isn't that well mixed, but no worse than 75% of albums released these days. Before you believe the 1-star reviews, take a closer look.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|For pop music this is pathetic. For blues music, its even more so. So i dont care what he is trying to \\"crystallize\\" , the point is he has taken dispirate styles and melded them into something that does justice to neither. Combining styles can be done effectively, but is not done so here. Nobody will remember of care about this guy decades from now, while this may impress some of those who dont know any better,,, time will close the book on this travesty , and nobody will care about john mayer any more than they will about britney spears.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|When I popped \\"Into the Blue\\" into the DVD player all I remembered about the film was that it featured Jessica Alba in a bikini.  This was the main thrust of the advertising campaign, although I am sure there were plot points of some sort in the trailer.  Once the film started the title started to make more sense because normally the words \\"Into the Blue\\" are associated with my \\"Off we go into the wild blue yonder.\\"  This instead this 2005 film is about the \\"deep blue sea,\\" at which point those of us who remember \\"The Deep\\" are seeing the similarities and understanding why this film was given this particular title.<br /><br />Alba plays Sam, who is living with Jared (Paul Walker), a dive bum in the Bahamas who wants to start looking for buried treasure on the ocean's floor because he just got fired from his old job.  However, he does not have the money it takes to do things right, so when his friend Bryce (Scott Caan), an American lawyer, shows up for a visit Jared thinks he is bringing financing.  But even though he has access to an estate his law firm ended up with after defending a rich criminal, all Bryce brings is Amanda (Ashley Scott), who he met on the plane.  At least they have access to a sweet boat, so Jared and Sam take Bryce and Amanda scuba diving.  On the ocean floor Jared discovers evidence of an ancient shipwreck and the airplane full of drugs that crashed at the start of the movie before the credits.  This coincidence becomes key to the entwined conflicts the drive the film.  Jared and Sam are excited about having found a treasure ship and want nothing to do with what is in the airplane, but Amanda and Bryce want to sell some of the drugs, even if it is to get the money they need to do the salvage business right.<br /><br />Of course you can tell people like Amanda and Bryce \\"no\\" all you want, they are going to try and sell those drugs.  After all, what is the worst thing that can happen to two neophytes attempting to sell drugs in a foreign country?  Further complicating things is the question of salvage rights, because even though Jared and his \\"partners\\" have found something, apparently they cannot get the rights to it unless they can identify the wreck in question.  There are shady types poking their noses into what is going on and Jared thinks that Bates (Josh Brolin), the king of salvagers on the island, is behind what is going on.  Or could it be who ever the drugs belong to that is checking them out?  Once you see the roster of characters that part is relatively easy to figure out by process of elimination if nothing else, but there still ends up being some suspense to the proceedings.<br /><br />The underwater sequences, shot by Shane Hurlbut and Peter Zuccarini, hold up the first part of the movie even though pumping up the music every gets to be a bit much after a while.  Back on on shore things progress inevitably towards the part where things get bad, and that is where what happens under water becomes more important.  So there is actually an argument to be made here that the big irony is that the best parts of \\"Into the Blue\\" are not when Alba is wearing a bikini (even though that is the first shot you see when the menu starts up on the DVD).  There are so many things set up by the screenplay by Matt Johnson (\\"Torque\\"), that as director John Stockwell (\\"Blue Crush\\") works out the end game things get fairly interesting.  The fact that much of the action takes place underwater works to the advantage of the film because we are spared some of the inane dialogue that often runs rampant during the big action sequences.  But the action and the underwater setting taken together are certainly enough to justify rounding up.untry?

B00003CWL6|1.0|I feel sad that people see \\"depth\\" in this flick. The only thing that lurks below the surface of American Beauty is hate... <br />skillet-deep, self-indulgent HATE. Similarly, the film does nothing to show what \\"looking closer\\" (its mantra) does for anyone aside from turning them into pitiful/pitiless scumbags. Example: after their epiphany with the paper/trash and Spacey's death, the two kids look coldly at the dead father and then turn to belittle the cheerleader (Suvari) on their way out the door. What sort of humanity or beauty is there in this? Suvari turns out to be the only humane character in the flick, and these two droids tell her SHE'S got problems and is essentially trash? Please. According to the director their actions are supposed to be the closing of a circle of sorts. I.e. The boy again sees beauty in an unlikely place. Again, please. The kids are vampires, sucking on beauty with no intention or ability to pass it on, much less radiate it. This is only one example of the utter lack of depth and humanity of American Beauty. I cannot think of a worse failure than this film.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|I actually saw \\"Honogurai mizu no soko kara,\\" the 2002 Japanese horror film  (2002) that director Hideo Nakata made from Kôji Suzuki's novel I saw this 2005 American remake.  Things have been breaking even for me in that regard when it comes to the recent spate of Japanese ghost stories, what with the \\"Ringu\\" films and \\"Ju-on.\\"  Of course it is a crap shoot as to whether or not you get to see the better version first.  With \\"Dark Water\\" I think the American version by director Walter Salles (\\"Diarios de motocicleta\\") is a slightly better made film, but I really liked the coda to the Japanese version more than the \\"happy\\" ending of this one (\\"happy\\" being very much a relative term under the circumstances).<br /><br />Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias succeeds in Westernizing the story so that viewers unfamiliar with the rules of Japanese ghost stories can get into the spirit of things.  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is recently divorced from Kyle (Dougray Scott) and in a bitter custody battle for their young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Grade), so she moves into an apartment on the ninth floor of an rather dilapidated building on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia tells Kyle it is because the place is too blocks from a good school, but it is really because it is all she can afford.  Maybe she believes all the shameless salesmanship of the landlord (John C. Reilly) because she has to, but one look at Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), the building's super, and we know that the place is a hellhole.<br /><br />Kyle claims that Dahlia is an unfit mother because she is mentally unstable.  Does he really think this is true or is it simply gamesmanship?  For that matter, does he really want his daughter or is it payback because Dahlia did not like the fact he is living with another woman?  This is vitally important because divorce in America is the norm, whereas in Japan it is much rarer and has decidedly different cultural significance for the characters.  So \\"Dark Water\\" plays off against our personal reservoir of divorce horror stories, cinematic or otherwise.  But Dahlia has a more immediate concern: there is a leak in the bedroom ceiling that is dripping black water.  Veeck refuses to fix it and Dahlia begins to wonder what is happening in the apartment above her own that would cause the water spot on the ceiling, especially as it grows bigger and more ominous.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ceci's new teacher (Camryn Manheim), is concerned that she is ignoring the rest of the kids in class to play with her imaginary friend whose name is Natasha.  Dahlia becomes concerned too when she learns that a young girl named Natasha lived in the building.  Kyle is moving ahead with suing for full custody, forcing Dahlia to hire a new lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth), who works out of his car.  By this point in the film everyone and everything is a potential threat to Dahlia, both in terms of her sanity and with regards to her protecting her daughter.  However, in the end, \\"Dark Water\\" comes down to Dahlia having to make a choice, and it is only in the shift in her motivation that the climax of this film loses some of its power compared to the original (the prologue does not come into play as much as it should at the end given the story changes)..<br /><br />For what would still be considered a horror film even if it is more psychological than supernatural for the most part, \\"Dark Water\\" has a first-rate cast.  Connelly's best moment usually involve the look in her eyes and nothing she has to say, and casting Grade as her daughter was extremely fortuitous.  Postlethwaite is creepy from start to finish, Reilly does a marvelous job of playing against his previous roles by being so positive, and the almost unrecognizable Roth turns in an outstanding character study as the surprisingly compassionate and competent lawyer.  When a cast can offer the likes of Scott and Manheim in minor roles, you know there is a high bottom to the talent level.  Cinematographer Affonso Beato and composer Angelo Badalamenti create the atmosphere for the horror film, more so than the special effects with all of the titular fluid at the climax, which also speaks to this being an above average horror film and therefore worthy of being checked out.onso Beato and composer Angelo Badalamenti create the atmosphere for the horror film, more so than the special effects with all of the titular fluid at the climax, which also speaks to this being an above average horror film and therefore worthy of being checked out.
B00008DDSC|1.0|How in the world can you give this movie more than one star.  I rented this movie and the only reason I watched it is because James Spader was in it and I figured that it might be okay.  Well, I was dead wrong.  This movie is very \\"weird\\" from beginning to end and it makes no sense.  The only people that gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are probably sick in the head and should seek professional help.   <br />Do yourself a favor and skip this trash!
B00003CXD0|5.0|Hoffman really shines here as the bitter, tempermental actor who alienates the entire showbiz world.  From the beginning, the audience is shown that his life is empty and he's pursuing something that he can't yet lay his hands on.  Becoming a drag queen allows him to abandon his tarnished image and reinvent himself as a star.  Along the way, the development of his alter ego causes him to see the flaws in his personality that have driven people away.  It sounds very Lifetime Network, but the comedy potential is explored to the fullest as Hoffman really plays up the inevitable uncomfortable moments that arise. <br /> <br />Plus, how can you not love a movie with Bill Murray as a struggling playwright putting on his newest work, \\"Return to the Love Canal\\"?  Genius.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Let me start off by saying old korn fans are proabably not going to like this album. If you liked untouchables, most likley youll love 'See you on the other side\\" because its an untouchables type album. Being a big fan of 'Take a look in the mirror\\" I was dissapointed by this album, but its not horrible. It definitly grows on you.<br /><br />The standout tracks are Liar, Hypocrites, Twisted Transistor, For No one,and Coming undone which has an awesome beat. The thing that changed most on here was the way jon sings. Its more higher then usual.<br /><br />Bottom like you should check this cd out because even tough its not great, its interesting.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Ok this cd has to be one of the most unique ever released. The new Gorillaz cd is a little more catchy, a litte easier to digest. But this one is far more interesting one you delve into it. <br /> <br />Re/Hash ooozes with beck style beats and accoustic guitars. Love this track. 5/4 also fits into that category, although there is a little bit of a nine inch nails style to it. After the first two songs you almost wonder if you picked the right cd for your player. Neither sound like the gorillaz on the radio. <br /> <br />This theme is continued throughout the disc. Despite a few skippable tracks (Tomorrow Comes Today and New Genius) this cd flows well and rocks all the way. <br /> <br />Top Tracks are Rock the House, Double Bass, and the Pink Floyd-style M1A1. <br /> <br />Outstanding disc, a must buy to experience the many different sounds that are expirimented with.
B000B8QF14|5.0|<br />I recieved the dule disk set (dvd/cd) for Christmas and I was very impressed.  I dont have all of Green Day's Alubums, but I have been a fan for a long time.  I have heard that they have been good w/t other bands, too. <br />But, going back to the set, I thought it was preaty good.  I know how people like there older music, better than there newer music,  but GD fans like me, like both.  If you like the newer stuff, Buy this dvd.  If you like both, you still should buy this dvd.  If you like the older stuff, I sugest that you check this dvd out from like a friend, to see how well GD is doing.  So, I think that this dvd is really worth buying. <br />On the cd, it has live tracks from the two summer preformances in UK,which is preaty awesome.  The dvd shows the preformance w/t interviews about the American Idiot cd.  I really enjoied this dvd.  So yeh.  Thats why I gave it 5 stars.  GD is awesome!
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites, even despite the hype that surrounded it.  The story of the ill-fated lovers and the ship that suffers the same fate is one that is truly spectactular.  James Cameron did his homework for this film, cross-referencing all of the information and actually diving to the wreck many times to make sure he made a movie that was true to the actual sinking.  The way he puts it, it deserves it and owed it to the passengers and crew of the Titanic to do so.  This set includes many, many extras that are all fascinating.  It includes 3 commentaries, including historical - which I found the most interesting, lots of cut scenes that explain things that may have been unclear (like why Rose was so upset when she wanted to commit suicide), and featurettes that include interviews with actual survivors.  All in all, it is a great set.  My only complaint is that the movie is split into two discs.  I would have prefered it on one, but that's okay.  Overall, a great movie with great features.

B000B8QEYC|1.0|It may be heresy, but I have to say it: honestly, Enya's Amaratine is a disaster. <br /> <br />Maybe she should get out more. Maybe she should meet some new collaborators. <br /> <br />Whatever she does, she cannot continue to make records like this and expect to hold on to her fan base. Amarantine is end to end nothing more than a derivative, self-referent, self-important tribute to the staling of a franchise. <br /> <br />If you took all Enya's albums to date and averaged them together, Amaratine is what you'd hear. An average Enya album. No highs, no lows, nothing sharp or quirky, not even an extension of an idea or two. Just unceasing witless repetition of her patented lush, dreamy chords backed by excruciatingly uninspired rhythms. You could cut entire sections out of songs and transplant them into yet other songs and never know the difference. <br /> <br />As usual, her lyrics absolutely suck. If I hear the words \\"night\\" \\"stars\\" \\"river\\" \\"forever\\" or  \\"blue\\" in the next decade I might have to start drinking again. Enya seems to believe that she can simply pull her words out of some pseudo-intellectual pool and, by stringing them together, create fully-formed poetic objects heavy with validity. It doesn't work that way. I'm afraid she thinks the mere idea of an idea has merit, regardless of how well or how poorly it is expressed. Not so. <br /> <br />And what, for goodness' sake, is this \\"Loxian\\" language thing cooked up with Roma Ryan? Once again, expecting us to stand in awe of what is essentially a schoolkid's silly study hall time waster, complete with adolescent backstory, is arrogant as hell. Perhaps if they had deigned to give us a clue as to how the \\"language\\" works we could have at least found some reward in studying it. As it is, it is simply annoying. Not profound. Annoying. <br /> <br />I'm not even keeping this one in my collection. I'll probably trade it for an old Doobie Brothers CD. Amaratine is nothing more than average. Enya's fans deserve better. <br />

B0002TX4QQ|3.0|First, The Good Stuff: <br />  <br />1. Compuslively readable (once you get past the wordiness and snobbish tone of the narrator, that is.) The book kept me reading. I wanted to know what happened next. Although I predicted the ending after getting about halfway through the story, I still wanted to know how the characters got there. <br />2. Unusual main character. I really liked the idea of reading about a woman who really, truly, may not want to have children. It seems like a taboo subject in society. \\"Oh, you'll change your mind\\" is often the response to a woman choosing to exersize her right not to give birth. And what happens to such a woman after she does fulfuill the role of mother? That drew me in to the story. <br />3. Compelling topic. That's what got me to check the book out of the library in the first place. However, this leads me to... <br />  <br />The Bad Stuff: <br />  <br />1. I did not get any answers, or even any attempt at answers, as to why Kevin went ballastic on his classmates and teacher. It appears that little Kevin was a complete devil from conception. Did the kid have one happy moment in his life? Did he ever smile, did he ever laugh? The book would lead you to believe that no, he did not (and yes, I know old unrealiable narrarator bit, but I still don't buy it.) Which brings up <br />  <br />2. Why in the world was this child never given any therapy??? Yes, you certainly do need to talk about Kevin. You need to talk about sending this boy to a doctor. But neither the mother nor father discuss this. This was my main sticking point with this book. I couldn't get over it. Which contributes to my main critique of the book-- <br />  <br />3. As another reviewer stated, the book is just NOT believable. No, I do not believe any of the other high school killers behaved this way at home. Furthermore, if they did, I don't believe this kind of behavoir would have gone undisciplined or ignored. These are educated parents. Would the author really expect us to believe that they would not have realized something was really wrong with Kevin, other than him just being a miserable person? And, not only that, would they really sit by and let someone like this baby-sit their daughter? The thought alone sickens me. <br />  <br />In the end, I give the book a marginal recommendation. It was interesting to read, but I don't think it comments on the high school violence epidemic of the last decade in any real way. <br />  <br />*** One other good point of the book is that it mentions Peter Balakian's Black Dog of Fate. Now THAT is a terrific read. <br />
0316172324|1.0|Gladwell begins with a story about a supposed Greek statue that some experts, using scientific testing, could not detect as a fruad, while others were immediately suspicious. (So, some people look at the forest for immediate clues, before examining the trees in detail.)<br /><br />Another example involved a single tennis expert with an uncanny knack of foretelling when someone was about to double-fault. (The bad news is that he could not relate how this was done. Thus, what this proves is beyound me.)<br /><br />Still another revolved around an officer playing a \\"rogue MidEast commander\\" vs. the regular Army. Anyone who has been in government knows that it moves at glacial speed, and can easily be outdone by much smaller groups with a modicum of intelligence and speed (eg. Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works,\\" and Burt Rutan's \\"space ship.\\"). So the rogue officer's success is hardly suprising.<br /><br />To say that quick decisions - based on a few KEY VARIABLES - is better than studied analyses that include a multitude of minor issues is hardly surprising either.<br /><br />Finally, readers need to keep in mind that there will always be statistical abberations - eg. someone who correctly predicts the flip of a coin 50 times in a row. However, that does not prove that they have any special talent, and they are just as likely to be wrong as right on the next toss.<br /><br />Similarly, finding snap judgements superior to supposedly sophisticated statistical models does not necessarily support a conclusion supporting snap judgements - many statistical models are poorly specified and have embarrasingly large errors.<br /><br />Finally, would Gladwell ride a 747 designed in a manner he describes, buy a car similarly designed, invest in a corporation investigated in a style he supports here?<br /><br />Not worth reading.
0316096199|5.0|This memior begins with a horrific scene that I read just before bedtime. I had nightmares that night, and when I woke up the next morning, I considered picking up something else, something lighter, more appropropriate, perhaps, for the week before Christmas. Lucky for me, I decided to return to Alice's story, and finished the book that same day. If you are looking for an author who sugar-coats, apologizes, or sentimentalizes, this book is not for you. If you want to read a true, no-holds barred account of rape and its aftermath, I would recommend this to you in a second. I don't think I've ever read such an honest book.
0684824906|5.0|The audio download version of Team of Rivals is available via audible.com (see link in the listing of the different versions of this work that are available). It is among the top 3% of all audiobooks in my opinion. There is no unabridged version as there is with No Ordinary Time (Goodwin's coverage of FDR) but still this is a great listen. It is around nine hours long. The narrator is Richard Thomas (JonBoy of the Waltons TV show) and does a nice job.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I had never heard of Sufjan Stevens.

B0007OCG56|2.0|This movie is advertised as a comedy, and it isn't one.  The plot, or the lack of it, is silly.  The movie is told from an essay, an essay Flor's daughter writes.  I don't see a real point in this movie.  The ends aren't tied well, and after the movie is finished, I am left with questions.    The script is bad too.  One part in the movie, Leoni (who plays the wife of Sandler) hires a woman (Paz) to work in her house when the woman speaks absolutely no English and has a complete language barrier?  It makes no sense.    Adam Sandler is the big-name in this movie, and I like his movies, though this one isn't one that I enjoyed.  If you want to watch a movie that really has no plot, then this one is for you.  For the ones who do want an enjoyable movie, skip it.
0307276902|4.0|Frey writes like Hemmingway on speed but you'll only notice if you're looking: the story is so compelling that I'd read it if it were scribbled on the sidewalk with chalk.<br /><br />Stereotypes are both bolstered and destroyed as Frey narrates the story of his recovery from complete and total addiction (an oxymoron?) I put the book down thankful that none of my children have become addicts knowing that, in some cases, only one exposure to a drug creates a lifetime downward spiral. I went to the grocery store knowing that everyone there - the moms in their BMWs, the box boys, the men looking at wine - any one of them, however perfect they looked, were only a pipeful away from holding a \\"Will Work for Food\\" sign at the freeway entrance a year from now.<br /><br />This is what a good story does: it takes you into a foreign land and expands your horizons. It makes you a bit more tolerant and a bit more understanding. You see things from a new perspective and not everything looks the same.<br /><br />There's no sugarcoating here but I suspect there's plenty of self-aggrandizement. Frey paints a credible picture of the horrors of addiction and I especially like how he tip-toes a fine line between responsibility for addiction and circumstance. He takes full responsibility for his choices - a lifelong series of decisions to choose to abuse. He doesn't blame his parents, his lousy teachers, or the street where he grew up. But in the end it's his recognition that he has a choice that marks him as a recovered addict. Still, though, he doesn't judge other addicts and recognizes that their victimhood is as valid for them as is his choice.<br /><br />There are much better books to read if you're looking for help in understanding addiction and recovery - in many ways I think this book is another step in Frey's process of recovery. But I don't think he is trying to explain anything other than his own experience. I don't know how accurate a portrayal he gives of rehab and the book at times seems blotchy - a lot is skipped and left out. Maybe that's an effect of his writing technique. Still, though, it's a fascinating book that can't help but make you think.d the book at times seems blotchy - a lot is skipped and left out. Maybe that's an effect of his writing technique.

0515123447|5.0|It is rare for me to finish a 520 page novel in a couple of sittings, but that is what Lee Child and Jack Reacher can do for me. There is never a dull moment and I, for one, am totally hooked on Reacher, his way of dealing with things, and his most unlucky co-incidences. <br /> <br />Written in the first person, with a single linear plot progression, the story is easy to read, easy to follow, and I must admit it was great that there were enough clues along the way that it was possible to work out what was going on before the hero. Whilst this was a very enjoyable aspect of the book, it did have the reverse effect of making otherwise intelligent detectives who did not work it all out look a bit stupid, but that is a minor point. <br /> <br />Sure .... I agree that the sequence of events in this small town would have bought just about every law enforcement agency down in their hundreds ... but what the heck? You have to suspend belief in most book genres or else your intention must be to read a book to criticize it, rather than enjoy it. I know if I have just paid for an adventure / thriller novel with a big nasty ( but very likeable ) hero I expect him and the author to thrill and captivate me with an exciting, complex, and interesting story. Killing floor does this perfectly, and I am not at all bothered that the story does not meander off into sub stories involving new characters. I want to know what JACK REACHER is doing!! <br /> <br />Violence ?  you bet .. I love it. Jack \\"zero tolerance\\" Reacher is my sort of hero. The action scenes are fantastically well written, OK, not perhaps with the cultured prose and flowery writing of a Booker prize winner, but superb writing in order to portray the events taking place. Fast paced, all the details but not `detailed', jerky, nervous, graphic.  <br /> <br />After reading \\"Die Trying\\" I can see a pattern building with Reacher's love life .... But at least we are spared salacious details of the sex scenes. Not that I am averse to salacious details, you understand, but Lee Child knows that in HIS books they would be padding, and there is very little if ANY padding in these books.    <br /> <br />Great fun, and if you don't mind your action adventure spiced with violence ( some of which does border on sadism, I suppose)  and bloody scenes then I thoroughly recommend Child's books. If you want action adventure where there is very little real blood and guts, I suggest Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler.   <br />

He expicitly stated that he predicated his work on the premise that mankind would use technology rationally. <br />His \\"I, Robot\\" stories explore the relationships and conflicts of the \\"Three Laws\\" he postulated. <br /> <br />There is very little action or movement in his stories or novels.  <br />The movement is often intellectual, by sleuth, logicical deduction or extrapolation. <br /> <br />For example his Foundation Novels is a history describing logical development of processes, not action or individual heroism.. <br /> <br />He was primarily facinated by mystery stories. Asimov said Science Fiction \\"considers the nature of the changes that face us, the possible consequences, and the possible solutions.\\" Issac's stories were idea-driven not action-oriented.  <br /> <br />.. <br />So even to see the trailers for this movie had me tossing my cookies.  <br /> <br />I just feel so offended myself, to see Issac's name on it.  <br /> <br />I know nothing is sacred to the Hollywood Money Machine. <br />But why do they have to promote lowering the IQ of this continent? <br />.. <br /> <br />It is classical revisionism. <br />The flavor of the world Asimov really created has been buried and revised to suit the popular idiom. <br />--------------------------------------------. <br />As far as a \\"Will Smith Action Movie\\" (trying very hard to forget the name Asimov), I only liked a bit of it. <br />For one thing it was mostly a CGI-cartoon. one could see it was nothing but actors and blue screen. The illusion did not carry. one gets the sense that Will Smith must have felt very lonely making it. <br /> <br />As far as the CGI action goes, not only could humans not withstand those physical actions but also machines themselves could not withstand and do the physical actions depicted. The action was unrealistic. <br />.. <br />There were glaring absurdities such as the \\"riot\\" betwwen humans and robots. The robots were depicted as too strong and indestructible, there could be no human defence.  <br />This is a common fault in creating stories where the monster is made so powerful that there can be no real conflict. <br /> <br />The street scenes being \\"blue screen\\" were too simplified.No illusion of reality was carried for the viewer. It failed to deliver that element of story magic. It might as well have been done on a stage. <br /> <br />Finally Will's character was unbelievable: <br /> <br />This kind of \\"hip-cartoon character-policeman does not even exist in our modern day let alone he could not exist in a sophisticated future world. <br />It is a character type made for fans but it is not a real type.  <br /> <br />A street wise type of character modified by future circumstance could be written in a much more realistic manner. This character here was written for children. <br /> <br />I listened to the directors commentary on the DVD. I got an impression of a superficial person without a deep character...very much like the movie that was produced. <br />.. <br />There are some enjoyable parts to the movie as others have mentioned but for me they do not redeem its faults for me. <br />... <br />I rate it Two Borg Thumbs down. <br /> <br />Additional comments: <br /> <br />  <br />Bottom line for myself: This film  was not worth watching nor worth reviewing.  Only Asimov's name rooked me in.  <br />To add to my review: plot over-simplification, weak ending, cartoon-like CGI. The climactic action sequence and the foregone conclusion, I could barely keep awake. <br /> <br />But , Yes it is Hollywood Slick, it's a good 3.5  or 4.5 movie for kids or teenagers, not adults. And it should not have Asimov's name nor his title on it. Talk about total irrelevance! <br /> <br />This movie violates the Fourth Law of Robotics..\\"Do not take Asimov's name in vain\\"!  <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />
B000A3DFZE|5.0|After one listen, particularly after the jigging \\"So Tired,\\" I started liking this album immediately. <br /> <br />It's an easy-listening/bluesy album about love, introspection (\\"Back Home\\" comes to mind), family, and belonging.  I don't understand why people only listen to just Eric Clapton's guitar and not his vocal.  The singer's vocal, as well as his/her instrument, is what sets the mood for the song.  Just like that saying in \\"Death of a Salesman,\\" it's not \\"what you say.\\"  It's how you say it.  And here, Eric Clapton says it well.  He's happy, he's living life to its fullest, and he wants his audience to know it.  A person doesn't always have to be depressed in order to make good music. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton is one of THEE best musicians that have ever lived, next to Bob Dylan.  Give the man a break. :-)
B00005JLKB|5.0|Having received the Season 1 box set of Smallville for Christmas, I have mentally revisited the early days of the WB hit-show. This season was undoubtedly the best! The DVD is a worthwhile purchase (even at $115 Australian), with my favourite additional feature being a glimpse into Chloe's personal computer files. I was disappointed that her \\"Wall of Weird\\" was not exactly like the cluttered noticeboard in her Torch office, but, rather, a series of profiles and data. However, I enjoyed searching through her \\"Recycling Bin\\" and picture files. There are also numerous TORCH articles, which I intend to read. As for the episodes, they are virtually impossible to tire of! Neither the anticipation nor vibrance wears off, and every single scene is highly entertaining! I have found that with comedies, sitcoms in particular, episodes are one-off affairs, where the novelty wears off after the first time. This is also the case with serious dramas, where you lose the sense of expectancy and suspense. Other shows are just plain boring after seeing it once through, especially when the dialogue is dull. Smallville has a consistently captivating script with wit and sentiment. Every scene has a point to it and the viewer is kept incredibly interested until the issue at hand has been resolved. I, personally, have found that watching re-runs is an insightful pastime, as you can pinpoint clues that you may have missed the first time. You also begin to realise the reasons for the characters' actions and behaviour. It is always a pleasure to revisit the humourous one-liners, often delivered by either Chloe or Lex. Here in Australia, we have just commenced Season 3, which has definitely heightened the action-element of the show and it is perhaps more interesting than ever. I feel that there is a certain poignancy, though, correlating only with Season 1, which brings it a sense of nostalgia that is irreplacable and inimitable.
B00003CXCW|5.0|There were a few things which drew me to \\"Sunset Blvd.\\".  For one thing, it's one of David Lynch's favorite films, and he is my favorite director.  Second, it has a five-star rating on Amazon.  Not even \\"Casablanca\\" has a five-star rating!  And thirdly, it sounded like an interesting film. <br /> <br />\\"Sunset Blvd.\\" forever shattered the general public's idea of what the movie business was really like.  William Holden is great as Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter who's in debt and without much chance of success.  Until chance takes him to the estate of Norma Desmond (brilliantly played by Gloria Swanson).  Desmond is an aging silent film queen who believes that she's still just as popular as ever.  She has an idea for a film, and she wants Joe to write it.  Before he knows it, Joe's in over his head. <br /> <br />One of the highlights of \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" is Billy Wilder's masterful directing.  The performances are all top-notch, and everyone knows exactly what they're doing and how to do it.  There's also fabulous cinematography from John F. Seitz, and great score by Franz Waxman.  To top it off, the script (by Wilder, Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr.) is very well-written.  For most of the film, you'll have a hard time taking your eyes off it - particularly during the end. <br /> <br />From the opening frame until the unforgettable closing, this is filmmaking at its best.  \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" is an undisputed masterpiece that still ranks among the very finest films ever made.
0471267554|5.0|Every nutritionist, MD, chef and charliton has a diet theory.  \\"Low Fat\\" is good.  \\"Low Carbs\\" is good. \\"Balanced (whatever that means!)\\" is good. Loren Cordain also has a theory. His theory makes as good or better sense than most of the others: Our body and mind are probably better off if we eat the foods we evolved with over a couple of million years of evolution.  What makes Cordain's approach different is that he backs it up with real science, that is, testing his theory with real research and real tests on real subjects using the scientific method.  If the tests don't show that the one or another part of the theory is working it gets cut out and the theory modified.  I'm tired of trying out untested theories which are politically correct or sound good.  I want science.  Cordain delivers. <br /> <br />By the way, just because I've lost wieght, feel great and really enjoy my food is just anectotal evidence, not a double blind test with statical significance, but it got me to write this review!
B0007N1AI6|1.0|I'm sorry Priest fans this CD sucks big time, this coming from a huge Priest fan. I've been to over 20 concerts & have all their LP's...yes LP's and CD's.But be forewarned even with Rob back he could not save this effort alone,yes he can still hit a high note,but he needs a little help from the rest of the band.Scott Travis drumming is great and as a matter of fact is about the only thing that is worth listening to. Hello KK & Glenn? Their are no signature guitar riffs,no twin harmony leads,it sounds like there is only one guitar,the leads sound like...oh it's my turn, let me bend a string here ok i'll play down the neck here awhile.You should get & expect more from \\"The Heavy Metal Kings\\" Ian is Ian, a bassist caught in a wild garb of confusion & mud. Here are the reviewed titles: Judas Falling/  <br />Deal With This Dissappiontment/Sucolution/Worth Surrendering For/Demonizer (The only one on the CD that is good)Wheels Are Falling Off/Angel (intro ok... then the Angel falls from the clouds)Cruleulogy/Training Wheel Rider/and finally LOCHMESS.The song that never ends! Now I see why Judas was kicked out of Heaven. If you need this to fill out your Priest collection then get it but other wise don't even accept it, even if it's free. P.S.The bonus DVD is ok but are'nt you tired of hearing \\"Suckin' After Midnight\\"
B00007AJF9|5.0|this film beautifully shows how young Elizabeth takes the thrown of England. Not only does she need to learn how to rule, she needs to know how to keep her thrown secure, but needs to struggle to keep her life. This is one Academy Award Blanchett deserved but was snubbed by the Academy. It sickens me that the Academy does not know who to give their awards to. I've watched this film over and over again and i'm always blown away by the scenery and by the actors themselves. this film really deserves more than the 5stars.  <br /> <br />Well known is the story of the Virgin Queen, this film depicts Elizabeth beautifully. Costume design and make-up bring to live this beautiful drama. Highly recommended
B00005JO1Y|4.0|It was good, Expect the romantic parts with the woman and the Big Monkey! But there really was some awsome parts. The Guys are beeing chased bY THE Brontosuars which they are being chased by what look like rapters. But I though It was good. I don't why it was like Watching Titanic all over again
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna needs to learn how to sing..this blows!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie continues the amazing and dynamic Firefly story, which has still not achieved the greatness it deserves.  <br /> <br />Serenity defines the interlocking, highly-interesting characters of the Serenity crew in a stunning and seat-gripping sci-fi world that only Whedon can accomplish in the sci-fi genre. <br /> <br />Serenity is an amazing, must-see, sci-fi experience what will leave your mouth open and create chills up your spine.
B00005JNJV|4.0|After the first batman that came out, Each of its sequels failed to live up to the original.  Batman Returns was probably the worse comic based movie I have ever seen.  Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were a little better, but still pretty bad.<br /><br />First I must dispell all the talk that this movie is a prequel to the other movies.  This is not true.  This movie is not connected in any way to the other movies.  Take for example Bruce Waynes parents who were killed, when you watch the first Batman you will see that Joker (pre Joker) killed them, in this movie the person who kills Bruce's parents dies.  Take this as a new beginning to the whole Batman story, hopefully there will be sequels, but only if they are good.  I would hate to see this story ruined like Blade with Blade trinity, and of course the first Batman that was ruined.<br /><br />The story starts off with a young Bruce watching his parents be murdered.  The anger and thirst for revenge drives him throughout most of his young life.  He eventually meets up with a guy that encourages him to to channel his anger before it consumes him.  This guy teaches him many things in addition to the physical and martial arts training, like compassion for enemies could get him into trouble..............<br /><br />Bruce eventually returns to Gotham and this is where he becomes Batman to rid the city of crime and corruption.<br /><br />This movie was beautifully written and directed.  As I said before, I wasn't expecting much out of the movie which is why I didn't rush to the theatre to see it.  I ended up with it on DVD which is when I decided to watch it.  Christian Bale makes a wonderful Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Morgan Freeman also makes an apperance in this movie as Batman's source for all of his gadgets and suit.  It goes without saying that Freeman was very convincing in his role as well.  Overall the storyline was great, the fight scenes were as well and not overdone and not littered with pointless special effects.  This was a great movie I was plesantly suprised.  This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again.<br /><br />The ending of the movie leads you to believe that there will be more battles for Batman to fight.  I just hope that any sequels will continue to follow this movie's lead and not turn into some special effects laden crap.  If this can't be done then I would perfer that it be left as is.ie I was plesantly suprised.  This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again.    The ending of the movie leads you to believe that there will be more battles for Batman to fight.  I just hope that any sequels will continue to follow this movie's lead and not turn into some special effects laden crap.  If this can't be done then I would perfer that it be left as is.
0142000663|5.0|The main charachter gets politicized.  Great concrete story telling.  People you can relate to.  A journey that makes sense.  And as they go, you learn the situation so far from suburban Overland Park (or wherever you are).  The progression of Tom Joad from not involved to opinionated speaking out angry man is well motivated, completely believable.
B000002L9J|5.0|Though I would have to say that \\"Meat is Murder\\" is my favorite Smiths album there is no denying that \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is a masterpiece. Some essential Smiths classics are included like \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\" and \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" but the track that made me fall in love with this album was \\"I Know It's over\\". I think the track displays every band members talents flawlessly. Marr's delicate guitar strumming, Rourke's smooth jazzy bass, Joyce's precise drumming and Morrissey's emotionally raw vocals.(When Mozz screams \\"Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head\\" I always get goosebumps) From begining to end the album is amazing. The Smiths were a musical phenomenon that happens rarely. There will never be an other band like the Smiths and this album is one of their grandest works.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am not a Joss nut.  I have yet to watch a single episode of Buffy or Angel.   <br /> <br />This movie stands on its own, There are things for Firefly viewers and fans, but the story doesn't need them. <br /> <br />Unlike a recent review suggested, there are no major plot flaws, just confused viewers, which is ok.  Watch it again.   <br /> <br />Spoiler: <br /> <br />River was never on Miranda, she learned of it by being a psychic in the room with the Alliance high officials who did know of it. <br /> <br />Just because she can be triggered into an \\"out of control mode\\" by an implanted message does not mean she can't also access her talents when she chooses. <br /> <br />See... no flaws at all. <br /> <br />It is a great movie, that takes risks few other Science Fiction francises have dared to take.  It is one of the few movies that left me wondering how it would end. <br /> <br />What you need to accept to enjoy: <br />Guns with bullets are more reliable and cheaper for the common folk than laser guns. <br /> <br />People living off the land in the future will not be wearing shiny silver cloths. <br /> <br />People in the future will be good and evil, kind and cruel, greedy and giving.  They will be humans as humans have always been. <br /> <br />In the future there are still nine words that should terrify you: \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\\" <br /> <br />Accept those aspects of the future 'verse and it all makes sense. <br /> <br />
B00006J9OT|3.0|I was disappointed in this particular CD because I felt that, instead of amplifying the Diana Krall experience, it just pandered to the \\"I'm on tour so it has to sound different\\" school of thought. Her CDs/voice are always an intimate journey into jazz but this CD found me, even after numerous chances, fast forwarding to see if the next one was better. I love Diana Krall and this CD is fine but it is not her best work, by far.
0140288503|5.0|Having seen the movie, I decided to read the book.  And it is much more detailed and provides a lot more background info than the movie had time for.  With close to 100 American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers involved in the early hours of combat, the book does a surprisingly good job of covering each fighting group's experiences.  Unlike the movie, it also provides background info on and perspective of some of the Somalian fighters engaged. <br /> <br />Essentially, the American contigent of Delta and Rangers was given the White House-initiated mission of capturing the de facto ruler of Mogadishu (Mog) and former Somali general, Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  Over the preceding two months in Mog, this team (led by Gen. Garrison) had completed five other snatch and grab missions.  They managed to capture some of Aidid's key lieutenants, but always missed collaring Aidid himself.  On this, their sixth, mission things went badly wrong.  I have a very strong suspicion that Garrison's team fell into a monstrous ambush orchestrated by Aidid. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to the other reviewers to describe the frantic and relentless combat that the Delta/Ranger team had to face.  This team had a nearly impossible mission recklessly dictated by policians ignorant of the extremely adverse odds in Mog.  The team's ability to extract itself from a potential overwhelming disaster confirms the strength of their moral and mental discipline.  Also vindicated is the use of their body armor and ceramic plates.  Less reassuring was the political leadership, unit discipline, and inter-Allied coordination.  With over 12 years of hindsight, it is hard to imagine why the US ever placed  troops in Mog in the first place.  (Read the Weinberger Doctrine that should have been followed.) <br /> <br />I highly recommend the book.  Mark Bowden, the author, did an outstanding job in capturing the personalities, the frenetic combat, and the unremitting danger this brave, elite team faced.  (After readingthe book, I am truly in awe of the Delta Force operators.)
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Party Monster is an ambitious fictionalized account of Michael Alig, James St. James, and the Club Kid scene of the late 1980's.  There is mesmerizing dancing, partying, drugging, debauchery, and then, of course, murder (of course you can get away with murder when you are the coolest kid in NY, right?).<br /><br />Seth Green really steals the show as James St. James.  McCauley Culkin, in his return to the big screen, is a bit stilted playing Alig, and never really convinces the audience why Alig rose to the top.  Cameos by Marilyn Manson as a beautiful drag queen and by Wilmer Valderamma (of That 70's Show fame) are excellent, as are supporting cast members Chloe Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne, and Wilson Cruz.<br /><br />If you can handle it, pick up his delicious power trip of a mix of glitter and blood.  For more information on this true-life story, try the book Disco Bloodbath and the early documentary Party Monster:  The Shockumentary.
B000056NX5|5.0|I have been a huge fan of JCS since seeing the stage production in the late-1970s. Everything about this updated version is brilliant: the music, the set, the choreography, and even the lighting. Crank up the music!  Gale Edwards has done a fantastic job of recreating a dated 1970's play/film into an edgy contemporary film.  The extras provided on the DVD which describe the making of the film are also very interesting. Highly recommended.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is an epic and powerful tale, both an international political thriller and an interpersonal drama about the amazing character T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that manages to impart an important history lesson in addition to some outstanding cinematography, brilliant acting by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness, beautiful landscape vistas, many quotable exchanges, and an intense character study of the conflicted T.E. Lawrence.<br /><br />Lawrence of Arabia is famous for its length, and having heard so much about the duration of the film, I was concerned about my own attention span.  To my surprise and delight, the movie was never plodding or drawn out.  Every scene served an important function.  Even the long desert-passage tale was purposeful, conveying to the viewer just how arduous and trying the journey was.<br /><br />Despite its well-deserved critical acclaim and historical significance, Lawrence of Arabia is not without its drawbacks.  It has a mediocre soundtrack, some laughable special effects (the quicksand scene), and night scenes that are fuzzy due to the lack of proper lenses and equipment.  I think the film is even greater due to these warts and imperfections.  Some reviewers have commented that the lack of any credible female characters (outside some tribeswomen in a group shot) is a drawback, but I couldn't disagree more.  The lack of a female lead makes the movie great, because it is realistic, and not contrived to some Hollywood standard movie formula.  Where do women fit into an early 1900's war, into a culture that oppresses women, and into the life of a homosexual military man?  The filmmakers should be applauded for not trying to fit a female lead into a movie which is about men.<br /><br />This is one of the all-time best movies in American cinema.  Don't miss out on this outstanding DVD release.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I know I really liked and was very moved by this film, and I'm equally sure that the performances were superb. However, all through it, I just wanted to yell out...  \\"Guys!....I know it's 1963 and you're in WYOMING, for gosh sake, but....PLEASE, go West young man... to San Francisco! Just hang in there a couple of years,  you can buy a soon to be trendy Victorian for a song, convert it, open up a bed and breakfast, and have a fabulous life together!\\"  Of course, life does not always turn out this way.  This is  a very touching, tragic film about circumstances and events which have happened to many lives, I'm sure, and I feel I'll be better able to write an honest review of it after I've re-watched it . In the meantime I will garner negative votes for this frivilous but well intentioned attempt at humor.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is every bit as powerful as it was upon its original release twenty years ago.  Is there really a need to recount the plot?  (A group of misfit kids embark on a treasure hunt for a lost pirate ship, battling some really bad guys along the way.)<br /><br />If only modern movies had plots as well-crafted as this movie!  I would label this as a family movie with the caveat that the children are a little older than 8 or so.  There is some foul language, but nothing that hasn't been overheard by little ears before.  The action (and the deformed chained-up beast Sloth) can be a bit terrifying to younger children, so this should be watched by the entire family, parents included.<br /><br />The Goonies is a movie about friendship, family, and the triumph of hard work when you really apply yourself to a goal.  It's the realization of every kid's fantasy.  Everyone will find one of the Goonies to identify with.  This is a must-own DVD.
B000002B35|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT double-album.  As a long-time Pink Floyd fan, this has everything on it that I enjoy listening to, and I can't wait to own Pulse on DVD.  Yes, I still have the original Pink Floyd Pulse album with the blinking LED and have replaced the battery I think about three times since I've owned it.  If you're a big Pink Floyd fan, buy this, you won't be disappointed.  Contrary to the aforementioned reviews, these CD are of excellent quality and are a tremendous joy to listen to, whether it be on a recliner in a darkened room, on a busy highway on your way to or from work, or even on a long road trip.  A+++
B000060K4O|5.0|My true confessional is that when I first saw this movie in the 1980's, at the tender young age of seven years, I thought it was a horror movie.  As an adult, I've learned to appreciate Ghostbusters as one of the best comedies of all time.  How can it not be, with the ensemble cast of comedic masters Rick Moranis, Bill Murray, and Dan Ackroyd?  Dr. Peter Venkman (Murray) is one of the all-time best sleazy womanizers, while Moranis plays the quintessential nerdy accountant in love with his beautiful neighbor.  The lesser-known Harold Ramis portrays the prototypical absentminded professor, Egon, much to the audience's delight.<br /><br />It's been said before, but I must reiterate--this is a plot-driven movie.  All special effects are minimalist and only done to accent the plot, not to drive it (which is good, since 1980's technology limits the effects that can be accomplished).  Why can't modern film take a hint from Ghostbusters and focus more on the plot and less on neat-o CGI trickery?<br /><br />Ghostbusters' brilliance lies in the complete sincerity with which it treats the absolutely absurd plot. Of course there is a slimy green ghost called Slimer, of course experts can trap ghosts in little boxes, of course you shouldn't cross the beams of unlicensed nuclear accelerators, and of course ancient demons haunt New York apartment buildings.  The Ghostbusters \\"do believe you\\" when you have supernatural trauma.<br /><br />If you are a Ghostbusters fan, your other must-see 1980's movies are Gremlins, Spaceballs, The Goonies, Beetlejuice, and Back to the Future.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I surely hope they don't keep pushing the date back to release this double DVD.  There shouldn't be any legal tape involved because the VHS is still available and this is just the DVD version, so all legal red tape should have been resolved with the release of the VHS.  I guess I'll just have to watch the PULSE concert on VHS until the DVD comes out, WHENEVER that will be.  I don't know if this is going to be an authentic DVD, if someone is playing a joke, or if EMI is trying to guage how many people would buy it by pre-ordering it.  Maybe not enough people have ordered it yet and they're waiting for more people to pre-order.  I don't know, but I WANT MY PULSE DVD NOW!
0790729393|4.0|Sleepers is a long, well-crafted tale about four reform school friends who grow up in the hell of repeated sexual abuse and sodomy at the hands of a group of depraved guards.  As adults, a chance for revenge on their childhood tormentors is presented.  The movie grapples with moral issues surrounding revenge--is vigilante-style justice acceptable when there is no way to pursue a legal course of justice?  Should people in the public trust (a prosecuting attorney, a priest) lie to achieve their ends if they hold the moral higher ground?  Some have claimed the mafia-style justice in the film is flawed.  Whether you agree with the course of action taken by these neighborhood boys or not, the film is a powerful tale and a great starting point for debate about justice and revenge.
B00005JNEW|3.0|H.G. Bissinger's book \\"Friday Night Lights\\" was gripping, entertaining, and thought-provoking, so I was pretty excited to see the big screen version. I found the casting, lighting, camera work, and music thrilling. Unfortunately, the people who made this movie decided to Hollywoodize a story that would have been much better had they stuck to the way things were in real life. The film did not include a single scene about Ivory Christian's conversion to Christianity or why he was called \\"The Preacher\\", yet it includes a completely made up scene where Mike Winchell has a sexual encounter at a party. Winchell is portrayed as morally unstable and afraid of everything, wheras the book explains he was a pretty good kid who just got a little nervous on the football field and who missed his dad. Instead of running with this positive father-son relationship, the filmmakers made up an abusive father for Don Billingsley. Tim McGraw does a good job of looking the part of the father, but his character is hard to take seriously when you know he's Tim McGraw.  <br /> <br />I'm not saying the movie had to be lovey-dovey. In fact, the book contains hard-hitting commentary and criticism of the economic, political, racial, historical, and social factors behind why Permian's fans were so obsessed with their team. However, these issues received little or no mention in the film. <br /> <br />If you like football, you'll probably still like this movie; however, don't miss the book at any cost. Unfortunately, reading the book makes it sad to think of what this movie might have been, but wasn't.  <br /> <br />A final note: If you like movies about high school football, don't miss 'Radio'.
B0000AOV85|2.0|There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD.
B0006IIKS0|2.0|This Movie is a must see for any metallica fan. It is really that horrible. Why, oh why!, did Dave Mustaine agree to show up for this. I never wanted to know that he would cry like a baby in on camera, i never wanted to know that Metallica was so far down the path of selling out they needed therapy to be METAL!  <br /> <br />And if you are wondering, YES you do need beer to make metal!
B000957O7S|3.0|Last week, I got the chance to see Hitch, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, and Amber Valetta. In this movie, Alex Hitchens (Smith) serves as a \\"date doctor\\" for men looking to impress the women they love. Alex helps men show themselves off to their best advantage during their first three dates, because he believes that the first three dates, and particularly the first kiss, become a yardstick by which women measure where a relationship is going. \\"Hitch,\\" as he is called, primarily tries to help (mostly bumbling) men put their best foot forward with his advice, although his specialty seems to be getting women to notice their admirers for the first time. He even helps shy accountant Albert Brennaman (James) catch the attention of famous actress Allegra Cole (Valetta).<br /><br />All of Hitch's advice seems to fall flat when he meets Sara Melas (Mendes), a gossip columnist for a local newspaper. After two disastrously bad dates, however, the two seem to develop a mutual liking for one another. Once Sara begins to suspect Hitch's profession, though, the relationship goes steeply downhill. It will take all of Hitch's charms, as well as a (literal) leap of faith, to find out what love really is all about.<br /><br />I thought this was a light, fun, predictable movie. All of the characters are likable and entertaining, particularly Kevin James as Albert Brennaman. (James does alot of cute physical comedy, and he's a very relatable character.) It would be a great date flick, and there are happy endings all around. Not much harsh language, and no sex scenes to speak of. (The movie lives up to its PG13 rating.)
B000093BDX|5.0|The Beach Boys were a very talented group. That is all there is to it. They understood the importance of harmonies and, in my opinion, perfected the harmony/melody combination.  <br />   There are only five songs out of twenty-five that I do not care for on the Sounds of Summer album, which is incredible, considering on most other albums there are five, maybe six out of twelve that I don't like.  <br />   1. California Girls 10/10 This song really created a platform for the Beach Boys to grow from. <br />   2. I Get Around 10+/10 I'm probably going to say this for all the songs, but, great harmonies. One of the many songs on this album that you can listen to over and over again and never get tired of it. <br />   3. Surfin' Safari 9/10 Not the best song on the album, it sounded kinda weird at first and it took a while to grow on me. <br />   4.Surfin' U.S.A. 10+/10 The most well known Beach Boys song, the melody is great, the harmonies are beautiful, and it makes you want to run out and surf <br />   5.Fun, Fun, Fun 10+/10 Ahhh.. Girls and cars. Need I say more? <br />   6.Surfer Girl 10+/10 All I can say is, wow. <br />   7.Don't Worry Baby 10/10 Took a while to grow on me, but it is still a great song. <br />   8.Little Deuce Coupe 10+/10 One of my personal favorites, and another well known song. <br />   9.Shut Down 10/10 Same genre as Little Deuce Coupe, just as good, not as well known. <br />   10. Help Me, Rhonda 10/10 Just good harmonies and beautiful melodies <br />   11. Be True To Your School 10/10 Very funny, don't know where this inspiration came from, but very good. <br />   12.When I Grow Up (To Be A Man) 5/10  A good song... but not my favorite, decent harmonies, but kinda boring. <br />   13.In My Room 10+/10 Another one of my favorites, talks to anyone who has ever retreated to their room just too be alone <br />   14.God Only Knows 10+/10 Once again.. a favorite. Absolutely beautiful melodies and harmonies. <br />   15. Sloop John B 10/10 Greatsong. Repeat on harmonies and melodies. <br />   16.Wouldn't It Be Nice 10/10 Fun song. I really like the timpani <br />   17. Getcha Back 9/10 Took a while to grow on me, but a decent song    <br />   18. Come Go With Me 10++/10 My favorite song on the album, <br />harmonies are absolutly perfect, just beautiful. <br />   19. Roch and Roll Music 9/10 Good song, but not their best <br />   20. Dance, Dance, Dance 10++/10 second favorite song on the album, even those who hate the Beach Boys like this song <br />   21.Barbara Ann 10+/10 Great song. Really fun to listen to. They all seemee to have fun with this song. <br />   22.Do You Wanna Dance? 10/10 Another song in which they utilize the timpani, which makes the whole song. <br />   23.Heroes and Villians 9/10 Took me a while to figure this song out, but once I did, it grew on me real fast. <br />   24.Good Timin' 10+/10 Another set of good harmonies and melodies. I like this song. Alot. <br />   25.Kokomo 10++/10 Third favorite song on the album. If this song is any indication, the Beach Boys were in the wrong genre of music. <br />   26. Do It Again 5/10 Decent, but not great. <br />   27. Wild Honey 5/10 Again, decent, but not great. <br />   28. Darlin' 5/10 I did not like this song. <br />   29. I Can Hear Music 5/10 Finally, decent, but not great. <br />   30. Good Vibrations 10+/10 A great closer to a great album
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Dirty Dancing was one of those movies that defined 80's cinema.  It was a 'sleeper' hit.  It didn't get much promotion from the studio.  It's promotion came from word of mouth.  People saw the movie, loved it, and told their friends to see it.  This movie made such an impact that it caused people to attend dancing lessons in droves, spawned to best-selling sound tracks, spawned a short-lived TV show, and spawned a Broadway musical.  Dirty Dancing still has an extremely loyal following which coused the studio to release a rehash of the plot a couple years ago called Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.  The original movie is much better both in storyline and acting.  Don't let the rehash of the plot dissuade you from seeing the original.  You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Dirty Dancing is a wonderful coming-of-age story.  Baby(Jennifer Grey) is vacationing in the Catskills with her family the summer before she starts college.  She soon meets Johnny Castle(Patrick Swayze) who is the dance instructor at the resort they are staying at.  After a somewhat rocky start, she and Johnny begin an illicit love affair.  They are both risking alot by being together.  Johnny is risking his job, and Baby is risking losing the respect of her father who has trouble seeing that being poorer doesn't necessarily mean being less worthy.  This movie has a wonderful climax that will make you smile every time.  It will make you feel as Johnny put it that 'there are people willing to stand up for you no matter what it costs them.'  Just a great movie with some wonderful messages throughout. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the extras that were available on this DVD.  Some of the extras included were an interesting interview with Jennifer Grey and a video of her try-out for the movie.  I enjoyed the extras, but they are probably only something mega-fans would ever watch. <br /> <br />And to the person below who gave Dirty Dancing one star because it was a 'rip-off' of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and even 'stole' the title.  Hun, Dirty Dancing came out almost 20 years ago.  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights came out like 2 years ago.  Dirty Dancing was the original...and better movie.  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was supposed to be a 'remake' of the original movie only set in Cuba instead of the Catskills.  So it would be the 'rip-off' not the original *rolls eyes*
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is possibly the best Dire Straits recording ever! I bought it used on cassette after hearing it from a friend in high school. Then, when the cassette gave, I bought it on CD. The CD was lost, so I bought it again. It's. Just. That. Good. <br /> <br />The combination of the lyrics and Knopfler's guitar are incredible.  Most probably know \\"Skateaway\\" or \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" however \\"Expresso Love\\" (not a song about coffee) and \\"Hand in Hand\\" are my favorits!
B00007ELF2|1.0|would love to review this movie. When delivered the movie dvd was missing. the box was not tampered with in any way. Sure would be nice when you spend $40.00 on a crtiterion collection dvd that the dvd is in the case.   zero stars <br />
0192833383|5.0|THE MOONSTONE is Collins's most compulsively readable and pleasurable novel. It was phenomenally popular, and it boosted the circulation of ALL THE YEAR ROUND. It is also his most conceptually complex work. As a prototypical detective novel, THE MOONSTONE has attracted a host of psychoanalitic readings, which have stressed the novel's cognitive ambiguity - the way that it continually asserts and undermines the sources of its own coherence, most notably by breaking down the boundary between \\"objective\\" and \\"subjective\\" reality, so that it becomes a palimpsest of overt and covert meanings. As a study in ambiguity itself, the novel becomes Collins's most ambitious exploration of social and psychic identity. <br /> <br />Mid-nineteenth-century debates about consciousness signalled the tenousness of a knowable subjectivity fixed through clear disruptive boundaries in the very drive to establish that subjectivity. THE MOONSTONE continually exploits the tenousness of these boundaries by juggling with these distinct hypotheses, and it is this that shapes its possible subversive ideological meanings. The undermining of the boundaries betwen homely and uncanny, inside and outside, normal and deviant, are homologous wiht the function of the boundaries between the \\"rational\\" and \\"occult\\" on the one hand, between \\"Englishness\\" and \\"foreigness\\" on the other, a process which culminates, through metaphoric transference and analogy, in a direct correspondence between the social construction of psychic marginality, adn the process whereby colonial \\"otherness! works as the projection of \\"English\\" fascination and fears.  <br /> <br />THE MOONSTONE is a novel about remembering, but it also is a novel about forgetting, about what is intractable, about silence, suppression and concealment. This is a basic precondition of the story: there would have been no mystery if Rachel had not suppressed her knowledge of the theft. The pleasure of the \\"discovery of the truth\\" thus depends on the interplay between conscious and unconscious forms of resistance involved in the \\"loss of the diamond\\".  <br /> <br />The Prologue tells the story of the Verinder's family guilty past of colonial expropriation. Yet the history of the diamond remains \\"unconscious\\". The novel is concerned with the journey from the darkness to the light. The reader, like the sceptical observers Bruff and Betteredge, is drawn into the \\"secret theatre\\" of the action. The mainstream physiologist William B. Carpenter had claimed in 1847, following Pritchard and anticipating Maudsley, that individuals could not be held responsible for actions that they had performed reflexively, or automatically: \\"Nor can we say a human action is wrong... when it directly results from a powerful impulse which he has no power to restrain.\\" (\\"Dr Mayo on the relations of crime, insanity and punishment.\\") Opium provides the explicit means of inducing a trance-like state in which \\"volitional activity\\" is suspended, and Ezra Jennings operates as Blake's \\"unconscious\\", the site of Blake's painful intractable memories.  <br /> <br />The function of the diamond in the novel resists any clear distinction between its metaphoric and metonymic meanings. It operates as the signifier of the meanings that are projected onto it. It is thus that the diamond itself represents the workings of the \\"hidden soul\\". As such, it is set against that other image of the magnetic yellow deeps - the Shivering Sand. <br /> <br />Blake remains healthy because he continually becomes dissociated from the past or any fixed identity. He is a palimpsest of national identities, yet this is not ultimately incompatible with his Englishness.
B00005JNQS|4.0|I don't generally enjoy cartoon movies but my entire family ages 27, 8, 6, 1 1/2 , all enjoyed this movie so much. We all laughed through the entire thing. It is rare for all of us to agree on a movie and this one did it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is the type of movie that we have been waiting for since Star Wars. Simply fun and adventurous. <br /> <br />I had never seen Firefly before this movie, but the movie makers had that in mind and clearly aimed to please both those who had seen the series and those who did not as well as fill in the series's backstory. I bought the series after I saw it in theaters. <br /> <br />The cast was great and the characters had great 'chemistry.' They just simply worked so well together. My personal favorite character is River. While she has telepathic capability, it is as much of a curse as it is a blessing. You really sympathize with her, especially when the crew gets suspicious of her (I will not spoil anything so I will not say more about her except that the plot of the movie is directly tied to her and her brother). The Alliance Operative (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) is one of the best villains cinema has seen in years. <br /> <br />The movies does seem rushed in some parts, events that would take hours or days are completed in minutes. That is forgivable though and here is to hoping for an extended version of the movie.  <br /> <br />The film's emotional impact is unusually strong, not only for a sci-fi movie but any movie in general. The fighting is tense, you actually fear for the characters, even when you know when they are going to make it. One character dies, but I will not spoil anything. Some parts are tragic while others are humorous. These emotional extremes add a lot of depth to the movie. <br /> <br />The special effects are top-notch. The space battle at the end is breif but very memorable. Being hard-sci-fi, there are rarely sounds in the space scenes since sound cannot travel through vacuum (espcially evident in the series). Although the space battle does have sound since it takes place inside an ion cloud. They even included the minute detail of space debris raining down from the battle above and burning in the atmosphere. While the anti-gravityvehicles actually radiate 'heat waves' instead of just appear to be floating while many ships rely on maneuvering thrusters (another minute detail normally left out of movies). <br /> <br />Five stars all the way. Here is to hoping there is a sequel! <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is a beautiful epic album!
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This album is one of the most creative albums Korn has put out. It pulls from all of their previous albums and at the same time, evolves and takes a step forward musically. Any true music fan will appreciate this album. For all the ones that said it sucks, they just want the same repetitive screaming and anger from KoRn's first album. What they don't understand is that bands that stick with the exact same sound doesn't evolve musically and become very dry and boring. This is where KoRn stands apart from every other band. Sayings this is a great album does KoRn no justice. All I have to say is you need to go out and buy it ASAP.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Is the release date above for real ? I've searched all over and found nothing to support or dispute it....
0060751967|5.0|WARNING TO ALL READERS! MIGHT HAVE SPOILERS<br /><br />\\"The Roman Empire has fallen!\\"<br /><br />That line was stucked in my head through the story!  I can't believe how unbelievably funny it was.  The heroine has a quirky sense of humor that definitely appeals to the readers.  It is seen why the hero loves her so much.  Without her he'd still be in the black hole he was wallowing in.  I still give it 5 stars even if the ending was a bit abrupt.<br /><br />I was hoping that the heroine would change her mind about being a mortal.  I don't know how their relationship could go if she ends up old and pruny.  I hope there would be more future books of hers are like this!
B00004W3L3|5.0|I recently gave Misplaced Childhood a re-listen after a couple of years.  In terms of Prog-rock albums it is on par with the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, The Wall and (gasp) even Dark Side of the Moon.  Whereas Dark Side deals with general themes of social isolation and de-humanization, Misplaced Childhood is a more personal, introspective evaluation of self evaluation and discovery.  In that way, it is a bit like The Wall, but more concise, and more personal.   From the opening synths of Pseudo Silk Kimono, Marillion guides the listener through one of the greatest rock love songs ever in Kayleigh, then into the melancholy Lavender.  What I call the &#34;Misplaced Childhood theme&#34;, Steven Rothery's soaring guitar signature appears for the first time in Bitter Suite and again in Hearts of Lothian.  Marillion's approach is prog-rock, pop and operatic all at the same time.  The themes of love, love lost, depression, substance abuse, suicide and re-birth weave through the course of the tracks.  Phenomenal music and terrific lyrics make this an album that holds up remarkably well.  I highly recommend it.
0689815816|5.0|This is a superb book for kids - we have both the board version for younger kids and the larger standard paper version and its one of the books which I think is ideal for friends who are about to have babies.  <br /> <br />This book has interested my children from a very early age (hence the board book which went with them in their cots) The illustrations are gorgeous lovely watercolours which Helen Oxenbury does so beautifully - but this is also a family and my children have related to that since a young age because there is a baby in it along with two young children. In fact it is a family who goes on a bear hunt. <br /> <br />the book is basically a series of chants which allow the children to take part - each of the first six pages is almost identical - they go on a bear hunt, reach an obstacle which they can't avoid (long wavy grass, Thick oozy mud, whirling swirling snow storm etc) and then the sound of the obstacle - (for instance the grass is swishy swashy, the snow storm hooo wooo and so on) <br /> <br />I really love the expressive language in here - learning different ways to emphasise and so on. When they find the bear there is a lovely piece of suspense and then the race back to the house back through everything with the bear chasing them. <br /> <br />The beauty of this book is also that the illsutrations can be shrunk down for the board book and still be of a good size to be easily seen. <br /> <br />There is a last poignant shot of teh bear going back to his cave and you get to talk with your (older) children about what the bear is doing and feeling. <br /> <br />This is really an extraodinary and enjoyable book for children - and a great aid to children's love of language and life.
B000001ESP|5.0|The high point of Rush's career up to 1980.  This should be considered one of the all-time great rock albums; up there with Back in Black, Led Zeppelin IV, and Sgt Pepper.  This album is musically complex, dark, mysterious (YYZ-the band just shreds on one of the all-time kick-ass rock insturmentals) and plain fun.  Listen to Red Barchetta, close your eyes and feel yourself in that car careening around corners.  Listen to Tom Sawyer and impulsively make a fist which you are dying to pump in the air.  Listen to Withch Hunt and try not picture in your mind the burning torches.  If you only own one Rush album- this is the one to own.
0920236162|4.0|This is a book which appeals to younger readers (2-4), but is better for the 4-8 age group as recommended. I say this because my younger children do follow elements of this story and enjoy it.  <br /> <br />This is the story of Elizabeth whose castle is destroyed along with all her belongings and her future husband Prince Reginald is carried off by the Dragon. All which is left for her to wear is a paperbag. So following the trail of destruction she goes to rescue Reginald. When she reaches the Dragons lair she has to trick the dragon to rescue reginald. Interestingly this is almost identical to the story of the Iron man when he challenges the dragon in Ted Hughes' story. <br /> <br />Having freed Reginald Elizabeth is disgusted to discover that he is not too happy with her. Her hair is a mess and she is dressed extremely badly. Luckily Elizabeth has a great deal of fortitude (having proved it already) and tells Reginald (very politely) what he can do with his fine hair and beautiful clothes. <br /> <br />Some nice messages here for discussion with older children (appearance vs substance - good manners and so on). The illustrations are simple but evocative. A nice classic story.
B000001ESN|5.0|With Permanent Waves, Rush inches closer to the culmination of the first phase of their development as one of the greatest progressive rock bands of all time.  They shred on Spirit of Radio and Freewill!  While not abandoning the anthems of their past albums like 2112 and Fly by Night (see Jacob's Ladder and Natural Science-one of my personal all-time favorite Rush tunes) they begin condensing it down to more accessible, shorter songs more amenable for FM play.
068981528X|4.0|Nice little book which tips the concept of the three little pigs on its head. My under 5 year old girls have started to understand that the story of the three little pigs has been told from a different perspective - now it is the three little wolves and the big bad pig <br /> <br />Illustrated beautifully by Helen Oxenbury it is a fun and funny story. a new morality tale.  <br /> <br />I think I enjoy it more than my two girls though, they can see that it is funny but I have a feeling that they are still really too young to appeciate it completely. It is more for the older child (4 and up definitely)as the humour is just a bit more sophisticated than they are ready for. <br /> <br />I will re-introduce this for them later as I do enjoy it and would like to share with them
B00000IBRI|4.0|If you can get past the initial weirdness of the concept - which includes a teenager who can communicate with insects, a chained-up murderer prone to driving a spike through its victims head's, a monkey wielding a razor blade and more red-herrings than you can shake an Agatha Christie box-set at - then you might just find Phenomena to be a greatly entertaining piece of Argento horror/schlock.  The plot, as per usual, is nonsense, and yet, Argento seems to instil it with an almost unbelievable sense of conviction, creating a strange hybrid of Tenebrea's amateur sleuthing style of narrative deconstruction and the warped fairytale fantasia of Suspiria, alongside the more familiar Giallo elements of black-gloved asailents, buckets of blood and, an almost pornographic obsession with gleaming, silver, implements of death.<br /><br />The initial set-up and the opening scenes are fantastic, demonstrating Argento's keen eye for location and composition, as his script finds a young Danish tourist (played by Argento's eldest daughter Fiore) stranded in the middle of the Swiss countryside after missing her last bus back into town.  Attempting to find solace, she knocks on the door of the only cottage in sight.  When there's no answer, the girl foolishly enters, with Argento brilliantly cross-cutting between the traumatised tourist desperately asking for help, and the thick chains of an unseen foe slowly breaking away from the wall on which they've been bolted.  The rhythm and the sense of unease (and later, tension) that Argento creates in this opening scene is phenomenal (sorry!), and is really all the more impressive given the fact that the whole sequence takes place during broad daylight *and* amongst some of the most beautiful and tranquil scenery you're every likely to see!!<br /><br />From here, the story begins to take shape.  There's a killer on the loose with a penchant for dismembering teenage girls.  When the head of the Danish tourist turns up after an eight month period of decomposition, the chief of police enlists the help of wheelchair bound entomologist professor John McGregor to study the various insects and secretions that may have collected within the head to help them define the exact time of death and the possible location of the murder.  Across town, Jennifer Corvino, the spoilt daughter of a famous Hollywood actor, is sent away to the Richard Wagner Boarding school (there's even a disarming Suspiria-style voice over to announce this ten-minutes in), where, on the first night, she enters into a somnambulistic state and inadvertently witnesses a murder.  When the school authorities and the other kids find out about Jennifer's sleepwalking episode - and, more alarmingly, her apparent connection with insects (developed during an earlier scene between Jennifer and the school's administrator Frau Br&uuml;ckner and a bee during the drive up to the school) - they chastise her, and subject her to a bizarre medical examination that brings about some alarming subconscious revelations about the night before.  Later that day, another girl is killed.<br /><br />Like Argento's early masterworks, Deep Red (Profondo Rosso), Tenebrae and The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Phenomena hinges around the notion of a potential victim having seen more of a murder/murderer than they can fully comprehend.  In this case, Jennifer's bout of sleepwalking brought her face to face with the killer and its victim.  And, although she remains oblivious to the actual identity of the murderer until much later in the film, she has, by this stage, already seen their face obscured behind a pane of broken glass.  Her relationship with insects and her hatred for the school eventually brings her to McGregor, who believes that Jennifer's special bond with the insects could hold the key to discovering the killer's identity, and together, the two hatch a plan to use the insects to retrace the Danish tourist's steps, to, eventually, lead them to the home of the killer.<br /><br />All of this sounds like complete and utter nonsense when looked at in print (which, to some extent, I suppose it is), but Argento clearly believes in his concept and somehow makes the whole thing plausible... by toning down his usually mind-bending visual style (the baroque colour schemes, cinema-scope compositions and atmospheric camera movements are put aside, with the director going for a much colder visual look, with soft blue hues and black and white production/costume designs captured by a camera that tends to observe from a distance, only rarely getting involved in the action) to give the fantasy a baring in reality, and to somehow, make the whole thing seem a little more believable.  Where the film does falter, slightly, is in areas of performance and dialog... the main cast are fine, with the young Jennifer Connelly creating that right balance of bratish adolescence and other-worldly awe as the young girl with the baffling gift, whilst Donald Pleasence brings the same gravitas and sense of overriding authority that he brought to films like Death Line and John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness, but the majority of the supporting players are virtually characterless, one dimensional ciphers, handicapped by atrocious dubbing and the director's heavy-handed exposition.<br /><br />That said, there is fine support from Argento's former partner/fixture/muse Daria Nicolodi in a pivotal role... and although she's subsequently stated that Phenomena is the performance of hers that she likes least of all, I think she creates a truly memorable and quite sympathetic character, who, it must be said, looks surprisingly attractive with glasses and a bad perm!!  Perhaps another shortcoming of the film is the dated visual effects, which, quite honestly, were probably dated even by 1985 standards (the swarm of insects' looks like it was crudely photo-shopped in, whilst the point of view shots from the insects are as cheesy as can be).  However, these criticisms are quite tenuous, with Argento (for the most part) managing to overcome these minor set-backs to deliver a uniquely bizarre, beautiful and unbelievably violent horror/fantasy/fairytale.killer. <br /> <br />All of this sounds like complete and utter nonsense when looked at in print (which, to some extent, I suppose it is), but Argento clearly believes in his concept and somehow makes the whole thing plausible... by toning down his usually mind-bending visual style (the baroque colour schemes, cinema-scope compositions and atmospheric camera movements are put aside, with the director going for a much colder visual look, with soft blue hues and black and white production/costume designs captured by a camera that tends to observe from a distance, only rarely getting involved in the action) to give the fantasy a baring in reality, and to somehow, make the whole thing seem a little more believable.

6305949980|5.0|I loved this movie, from the first time I saw it, and the DVD has a good amount of extras in it which fans will appreciate.  <br /> <br />This movie is one of the most amazing, wierd, inspired movies I have seen. It is animated, and is about what would happened if the people of Halloween land stole Christmas. Jack O Lantern is depressed, Halloween has just passed and it is the same old same old - he is looking for something but just doesn't know what. He strays into Christmasland and is suddenly reviatlised.  <br /> <br />Returning to Halloweenland he tries to explain just what Christmas is, the joy the presents - but the residents don't quite grasp the happiness and joy - they see the 'stalkings' instead of stockings and so on. So Jack gives up explaining it to them and instead allows them to do Christmas as they see fit . They make presents - snakes which swallow family pets - jack in the boxes which attack, and other horrible things. <br /> <br />The songs are amazing, I love the music - even my two small children do and I am always surprised when my 4 year old requests to watch this. I would actually have thought they should be quite frightened of it at that age, maybe the scary bits are too unreal. <br /> <br />Nice romance underlying it and the whole thing is filmed in the usual Burton-esque almost monochrome darkness world. <br /> <br />There are great extras available, including scenes which were cut or shortened from the original and interviews with Burton.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I WAS IN BED WATCHING FLIPPING CHANNELS AND CAUGHT THIS ON PBS. I COULD NOT CHANGE THE CHANNEL. I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND PUT IT ON THE BIG TV IN THE L.R. AND TAPED IT. WE WATCH IT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. THESE GIRLS HAVE BEAUTIFUL VOICES AND HIS BEST FRIEND FEELS JUST LIKE US. I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN MY HUSBAND SAID HE SAW AN AD ON TV WHERE WE COULD PURCHASE IT CHEAPER THAN ON PBS, I KNOW THEY NEED DONATIONS BUT IT WAS RIGHT AT CHRISTMAS AND I DID NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SPARE. I WILL BE SO GLAD TO GET THIS AND BE ABLE TO PLAY IT IN MY CAR. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE FROM THESE 5 GIRLS. IT IS LIKE LISTENING TO ANGELS SING, AND FOR (MY HUSBAND THE ROCK AND ROLLER TYPE) TO BE EXCITED LIKE I AM SAYS A LOT FOR THEM. HE LOVES LISTENING TO THEM AS MUCH AS I DO. ANYBODY THINKING ABOUT ORDERING THIS YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
B000005ALN|5.0|George Michael took 6 years before releasing this album, and understandably so. The wait was worth it. Each song in the album is brilliant. I've been listening to this CD since I bought it when it was released and every song never fails to inspire me (yes, including fast love =)). One of 1996's best albums!
B0000630BT|5.0|This is my favorite Priest album, bar none. It's their 12th studio album, their heaviest and also cheesiest. It is actually thrash metal! Unlike JP's standarts, it sounds more like bands like Slayer and Testament than Dio and Iron Maiden. I also must say that this is the album of the 90's, yes, even better than 'Images & Words' and 'Dirt'. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing have vastly improved their work from the 80's works (I can't say it for sure since I didn't bother with Turbo and Ram It Down), but this is the best work I've heard from them so far. Also Scott Travis is IMO much better than Dave Holland and he changes this band for good. However, unlike the earlier Priest stuff this took time to grow on me. The only song I could stand from this album was 'Night Crawler'. Rob's voice was too high-pitched and grating on the title track. But it has drastically changed. The title track is my favorite song on the album and my favorite Priest song ever, period. It has great double-bass drumming and two of the hardest guitar solos to play on the guitar. 'Night Crawler' is still one of the best songs on the album along with 'All Guns Blazing', 'Metal Meltdown', 'Leather Rebel', 'Hell Patrol' and the title track (duh). Consider that all that they could do in their 40's, who can do that?? Not Dream Theater nor Metallica, basically only JP (maybe Maiden did it also in 'Brave New World' and 'Dance of Death'). This is the 3rd best metal record next to Maiden's 'Powerslave' and Slayer's 'Reign in Blood'. Also their best album, 'Stained Class' IMO comes close second. I'm also surprised that there are only 90 reviews, I go to a Slipknot album and see at least 600 reviews, and only 90 reviews for this classic masterpiece?! At least I'd like to see a 5 star average with this low amount of reviews. But oh well... If you like metal this is a must have.    LONG LIVE PRIEST!!
B00007AJF8|4.0|I'm glad someone else has noticed the disturbing character of the film. You have carried Lovecraft a bit too far, fellow reviewer, the joke wore thin about half-way through your paragraphs. But then, so does the ingenuity of the movie, whose utter bleakness the fierce fancy of the director and the cast obstruct at first. Two things contribute to this eventual feeling the most: the sad, eerie score (\\"Craig's Overture\\" on the Soundtrack CD) and the fate of Malcovich himself. When he, having gone through and, literally, out of his own mind, cries out \\"I have seen things no man should ever see\\" this is, of course, a joke. Well noted, JSG. But, as you also know, he happens to be right, and the end of the movie is anything but funny, not even in the gallows humor sort of sense. The scene where Maxine thinks of making Malcovich, in whose body she is in, eat omelette off the table, is another little memory anchor. The film makes me think of rain; I do believe there are rainy scenes there, or this might be a false memory, but at any rate the grey palette and the music  remind me of a dounpour, cold, steely, never stopping, pouring down on some very miserable and confused human beings...  <br /> <br />To those who have not seen it: by no means think this is a negative review in the habitual sense. I gave the picture 4 stars not because of this hidden theme but only for petering out somewhat in the second portion. Do, in fact, buy or rent it. You'll be glad you did, even if, in the end, you find yourself uncertain about the genre. It is, perhaps, better to be much delighted and a bit heavy-hearted than just amused; the displeasure is often a sign you have learned something uncomfortable and new. T.
B000088E6D|5.0|A friend just gave me this for Christmas and I love it! The songs are favorites with a new twist so you can sing along in a new way. The delivery and sound of his voice is so smooth and cool...This is a VERY sexy CD! Feeling Good makes me dance around wishing I had some burlesque tassels to twirl!  <br /> <br />I have read other reviews who critique his voice. Maybe if your are a trained musician or vocalist you might find a flaw but if you are a regular person who is tired of the \\"same old song and dance\\" get this cd. I will be purchasing more from Michael Buble as I can't get enough.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I just want to say, that the release date is wrong. I happen to know that Advent Children will be released to the US on Jan. 10th, 2006. Let's hope that Amazon will catch up with the times. *fingers crossed* ;^_^
B000001ES9|4.0|Here we have Rush as they started... a very good Canadian \\"straight ahead\\" rock power trio.  This was before Neil Peart added his creative (and somewhat overblown) drumming and lyrics (also a bit creative and overblown) to the mix.  This is just good, simple rock 'n' roll... nice rocking guitar, macho lyrics, all the stuff that makes basic rock great!  I've always thought this album was a lot of fun.  Standout cuts are \\"Working Man\\" and \\"Here Again\\" (coincidentally, the two longest cuts on the album).  If you want to hear Rush before they got a bit pompous/semi-proggy (and after \\"Hemispheres\\", almost unlistenable) this is a fine place to start.
0307276902|2.0|I have used drugs (primerly marijauna) for quite a few years now, and have never been in a drugs rahabilitation facility or had my life adversly affected due to my drug usage. Having read the first few pages of this book, I would venture the authors problems stem more from his abrasive, self induldgent, self agrandizing personality than anything to do with his intake of illegal narcotics!
0441172717|3.0|This is not my favorite book, that would be Enders Game. But this is the best book ever. Sound like a contradiction? It's not. Enders Game is my favorite for some sentimental reasons best left to another forum. Dune is, quite simply, the most complete novel ever written. It has everything!<br /><br />The one downside to this tale are the names. Come on, we don't need some guy who's name has 27 consonants in it. Let's just call him Bob for expediency, shall we?<br /><br />Otherwise, this book has it all. Read it, and you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.
0062502182|4.0|This book is the worldwide famous book of Paulo Caelho. Its about a boy who has a dream about some hidden treausure and his journey from there on to reach to that treasure. Along his way, he learns inportant lessons about life. The philosophy put in by the author is nice, simple and strong. The book is small, not fat, so even non-readers will find it easy to read it. <br /> <br />So, instead of reading self-development or any philosophical book, read Alchemist, which has real and believable philosophies along with an interesting storyline.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I DID NOT WATCH THE SERIES, but gave the movie a chance based on the reviews and preview.  I am so happy I gave this movie a chance.  The writing is excellent.  This is a science fiction movie which does not get hung up on fancy pants terminology. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, in the future, you have the establishment (the alliance) and those that don't really fit in, the fugitives, outlaws, and former veterans of the losing side of the conflict.  Serenity tells a story about family (the crew); love (for people and for your ship); and for doing something right (which would spoil the movie).  In the end, you take an emotional ride with the crew of this ship. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good story, told well, by a talented group of lesser-known (by gifted) actors.
B00000JCOV|5.0|the person who says, \\"How is this music\\", how is rap music? They just talk and if i got paid for talking id be rich! anyway, slipknot is one of my favorite bands of all time, this is (to me) their best album. If u like slipknot, buy it now! It kicks major ass and proves why Hard Rock is better than rap and hip-hop.
B000000P17|1.0|GNR are one of my favs, but this albums was subpar for their standards.
B00005ABKC|5.0|This is, without a doubt, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' finest moment! I can still remember the battle he had with the record company over the pricing of this album!  Due to the rise in oil prices (a main ingredient used to press vinyl albums), the record companies raised the standard list-price of an album from $7.98 to $8.98.  TP fought his record company, going as far as threatening to name this album \\"$7.98\\"!  Finally, the record company relented and priced the album at $7.98, thus allowing \\"Hard Promises\\" to be released to the masses!  In addition to the classics \\"The Waiting\\", \\"Woman In Love (It's Not Me)\\" and \\"A Thing About You\\", also included is arguably the best TP & THB recorded song:  \\"Something Big\\".  BUY THIS DISC NOW!!!!!
6304806442|5.0|This isn't a groundbreaking movie.  It probably won't inspire future filmmakers, and it did nothing to change the motion picture.  Years from now, it won't be mentioned along side the great films of all time.  But none of that is important when it comes to judging the movie.<br /><br />This movie succeeds as a quirky, humorous look at disenchatment in modern society.  Some people might look at the characters as a bunch of junkies or screw ups, but they'd miss the point.  The main character, Mark Renton, choose heroin because he doesn't know what else to do.  Renton falls into the growing group of people who grow up and can't get excited about going to school and working for the next 40 years in a dead end job with nothing to show for it in the end except material goods and a 401K.<br /><br />The main character is played by Ewan McGregor, and he gives a fine performance.  The supporting actors are also good.  Perhaps my favorite part of the movie is the direction, as Danny Boyle does an excellent job of depicting several dream sequences, including one where Renton goes swimming in a toilet, and another when he's trying to get clean.
B000002WYT|5.0|I happen to be a huge DMB fan myself and this is one of, if not the best CD they have.  it has most of the DMB classics: <br /> <br />1. So Much To Say: 8/10 - Great melody, gotta love the sax <br /> <br />2. Two Step: 9/10 - A classic <br /> <br />3. Crash Into Me: 10/10 - One of the best DMB songs <br /> <br />4. Too Much: 7.5/10 - Just a great fast tempo song <br /> <br />5. #41: 10/10 - Without a doubt, one of the greatest songs out there <br /> <br />6. Say Goodbye: 7/10 - Defintally worth listening to <br /> <br />7. Drive In Drive Out: 7.5/10 - Pretty good <br /> <br />8. Let You Down: 8/10 - A little slow, but you gotta give it a chance <br /> <br />9. Lie In Our Graves: 8/10 - Just another great DMB song <br /> <br />10. Cry Freedom: 7/10 - Not bad <br /> <br />11. Tripping Billies: 7/10 - A very creative song <br /> <br />12. Proudest Monkey: 8/10 - Great ending touch for an amazing CD <br /> <br /> <br />CD: 9/10
B000002B1M|3.0|I didn't even get into Nas until his spring '99 \\"I Am\\" had me stuck like a crack pipe. <br /> <br />So after going back into his catalog for this LP and Illmatic and hearing everything AFTER I Am, I can honestly say this is the one Nas album I can't get into. <br /> <br />The singles he pushed to sell records are cool, \\"If I Ruled the World\\" with Lauryn Hill and \\"Street Dreams\\" (the remix is hotter!).   <br /> <br />\\"Affirmative Action\\" was aiight & I really liked \\"I Gave You  Power\\" which really displays Nasir Jones' creativity and talent as a sheer writer. <br /> <br />I consider myself a hardcore Nas fan, but most of these tracks just put me to sleep. <br /> <br />This is a must have for Nas fans, but I wouldn't push this LP on folks you tryin' 2 put up on Nas at his best.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I am a 13 year old boy who likes this album. Contrary to popular belief not every single teenager only cares about how popular a band is, and how cute they are, an BLAH BLAH BLAH! I like this album because I ACTUALLY LIKE THEIR SINGING, WOW!, a wierd concept I know, but it's true! And I'm not the only one, all my friends that actually like them, actually like them for their singing!, geez... Yes, even the girls. Yea, there are some that ONLY like them because they think Gerard Way is cute or something, and their not my friends, because I hate them. By the way this isnt much of a review as it is to yell at all of you @$$holes who think of teenagers and their tastes of music in such a terrible and disgusting manner, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.  <br />And here a quote from Eddie that made me laugh at what he thinks of teenagers, \\"Look at me kids. I am a 13 year old who listens to My Chemical Romance, dresses in black, dye my hair pink, get some eerings and think I am all goth and emo and punk and that. I am cool because I listen to this band. Look, explicit lyrics! O M G! I cant believe it. They must be really emo and punk because they curse.\\" Now lets see, NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! god... yes, as I said before there are SOME teens that think like that, but not all of them. No self respecting 13 year old that I know would dye their hair pink, green, blue, or any other wierdo color like that because of some band. I have many friends that listen to MCR and dont think what you are saying, and dont do what you are saying. And all those other bands you listed, I listen to them, I like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and System of a Down is my personal favorite. I also like some very popular/mainstream bands, but I dont only like them because their popular, or if their on MTV, i dont even watch MTV, they have too much rap for me, and dont even show music anymore, it's just a bunch of stupid shows, I like Green Day, because their a good band!, and MCR, and they arevery popular in New Jersey at least, and I didnt even realise they were on MTV, and I DONT CARE! And then you start talking trash about MTV, I thought you were talking about MCR, not MTV! If you dont like the music on MTV, DONT WATCH IT!, like me. Okay, I am now officially tired of typing, and I could go on about 500 lines more if I could be able to physically talk to you @$$holes, but for now your lucky.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas will forever been remembered, praised, honored and respected for Illmatic which was nothing less than hip hop history. <br /> <br />This album rightly deserves to be mentioned up there with TuPac's 2Pacalypse Now, Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet, Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt, OutKast's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Eric B & Rakim's Paid In Full and any other of the \\"best\\" rap/hip hop CDs of all-time. <br /> <br />If you don't own this CD, understand its artistry, respect the gangsta or relate to the poetic imagery of the content of THIS album, you don't know great music and you certainly don't respect the genius of hip hop at its best. <br /> <br />I can honestly say I love every track on this album, but if I've got to pick a personal favorite it's \\"Life's A Bitch.\\" <br /> <br />This is ironic to pick this track given Nas lets his boy AZ outshine him ... but rewind the lyrics over and over, feel the heat and sincerity as AZ spits & you can't help but fall in love with this track. <br /> <br />Classic! Masterpiece! Perfection! Hip Hop History! <br /> <br />A must have for all rap/hip hop fans.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|How wonderful it was to see the Firefly cast in action again.  The deeply felt characters, the humor, the action, the clear moral compass (sometimes spinning a bit out of control).  It was all so wonderful and so sad at the same time.  <br /> <br />Will we ever see them again? <br /> <br />Can the fan base bring them back for another shot at TV?  Another movie?  Is this all that there will be? <br /> <br />I hope not.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|Eric Clapton's new CD is not Eric Clapton. That's as plain as I can say it. The majority of the cuts are lilting Top-40ish sounding ditties about love and kids and general non-offensive subjects. The few blues sounding cuts have huge organ runs and what sounds like an entire choir backing his vocals. Orchestrated Blues? C'mon. There will probably huge numbers of fans who like this album, but they are NOT Eric Clapton fans. This is purely a generic \\"hit\\" album. <br /> <br />I am not saying EC should not do happy songs, but I did not buy the CD for this \\"kinder, gentler\\" music. I personally want raw guitar and damnable blues. He is too talented for this pop album. Pure middle of the road.
B000068IEU|1.0|I'm sorry this happened to those two girls but, please!  I was four years old when this movie first came out. Even at the age of 4 I was being tought to never trust anyone and stay away from strangers.<br /><br />I believe it's all the parents fault, letting their 'slut-wanna-be' daughter out of the house with a questionable \\"friend\\" to see some musical band called BLOOD LUST. I can't imagine there even was a group called that in the 1970's.<br /><br />Then the parents let a group of strangers in their house to spend the night? Their daughter had been missing for almost 24 hours and they are willing to let strangers stay in her room with a smile?  I don't think so...the group may have forced their way into the house, but no one is idiot enough to let shady charecters into their home, especially a DOCTOR and his wife.<br /><br />The acting was horrible and it was totally unbelievable. I can't believe the incident happened the way it was portrayed in this sucky movie.  I don't know anything about this terrible murder and yet I could write a better script now approximately 33 years later!<br /><br />What a waste of my time and you would be wasting your's if you watch this crap. You'd probably get a better informed idea of what happened if you read the archived articles that covered the murders.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|The best live albums are the ones that make you jealous that you weren't there, and this is one of them. Maybe this original \\"supergroup\\" is a little slower nowadays on the strings and the sticks, and maybe Jack Bruce's voice doesn't soar quite as high as it once did, but man, these old geezers can still rock.  This reunion concert really worked, and it's the benefit of years that made it click.  Instead of three young turks trying to upstage each other with their instrumental pyrotechnics, we get three old mates who now know how function as a unit, as a real band, and whose whole is greater than the sum of their parts.  Don't get me wrong - Cream in their 1960's prime was an amazing band.  Yet, even though the tempo and range of these numbers has slowed a bit with the years, they are still consummate musicians.
B000AXSN5G|1.0|It seems that the gospelchoir, lavish strings, and hornsection overproduction has crept into our music. Music by those same musicians who were once born free of false additives now seem to be shackled to saccrin sweet filler. Jeff Lynn practically killed George Harrison music with the Overproduction. Eric Clapton,Bruce Springsteen,Joni Mitchell, have all recently experimented with strings which made their music resemble a bad acid trip. Music once stood up out of the muck of \\"ENTERTAINMENT\\" by showing a very honest side.  A voice and an acoustic guitar rang out saying \\"this is real\\". Musicians could play their own instruments, write their own songs, and honestly have something to say. I thought the Perry Como, Andy Williams era had passed long ago. Why have these musicians circled back from where our parents came from? Frank Zappa said it best. \\"Strictly Commercial\\". But wait, this is happening to the musicians that have always advocated anti-commercial. Remember \\"This note's for you\\"? So what is happening. Is it true what they say? That you eventually become your parents. Well, I might have grey hair but please leave the strings with the philharmonic and the background choir in the church. Neil's latest effort does not compare to \\"Silver and Gold\\", \\"After the Goldrush\\", Harvest, etc, but maybe the next one will be better. I just thank God Neil has not jumped on the rapping bandwagon or is singing songs about \\"my grandbaby\\".
B00000AOUD|5.0|I've been a huge Jethro Tull fan for over 35 years now.  After listening to everything they have ever recorded, many, many times, I have to say that \\"Thick As A Brick\\" is the absolute pinnacle.  This is their best.  If you own only 1 Jethro Tull album, this needs to be the one.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|Okay, so I was hyped up about seeing it but I was somewhat let down in the long run.  It's by no means terrible, but it's not amazing either.  Theron does an okay job but having this follow so closly to her oscar winning performance in Monster was a shock.  North Country was a worthy follow up, but this was more suited to her Sweet November days, back when she was nothing but eye candy, you know, not taken seriously.  I want to say that a few reviewers said it was hard to follow if you hadn't seen the series...NOT TRUE!!!  I've never seen the cartoon nor had any idea what it was about and I followed the film fine.  There are things they don;t want you to know right off bat and thats the point of an unraveling plot.  That's a good thing.  Anyways...the action is decent but nothing to write home about and thats the reason for my complaint...with a film like this you don't look for a plot or brilliant oscar worthy performances...you look for amazing fight scenes and amazing special effects and this movie only delivered minimally...so, it's kindof a let down.  So does Flux Suck?  Watch it, I mean it's worth at least one watch, that way you can have your own opinion.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|How do you take an amazingly simple concept like HELLBLAZER and turn it into a ridiculously mundane and uninspired movie? Just cast Keanu Reeves. Evidently, Warner Brothers thought that the success of the MATRIX was due to Keanu's acting. They failed to realize that most of the credit should be going to the Wachowski brothers for having the keen insight to cast Keanu as an emotionally vacant Kung Fu master. Keanu is really good at looking emotionally vacant. But when it comes to a character like John Constantine, it would have been nice to cast someone who can actually act.<br /><br />For anyone that doesn't know it, this movie is based on a long-running comic book series by DC that revolves around John Constantine. Constantine is basically a modern-day incarnation of an old Raymond Chandler gumshoe that chases down demons instead of criminals. It's a great concept, which is why the comic book has a huge cult following. In the comic, John Constantine is a tortured, craggy, rugged man with white/blonde hair. The way that he's drawn usually makes me think of Rutger Hauer and Roy Batty.<br /><br />This thing was doomed the moment they cast Keanu Reeves. It's not just the fact that Keanu's hair is black. I'm not that much of a purist. I didn't have a hissy fit when they cast Tom Cruise as Lestat. A little peroxide will do wonders for the hair color, but what Tom had going for him was the fact that he can act. Keanu, unfortunately, cannot. He's like the male version of Tara Reid. Keanu should really just resign himself to being a bimbo. He should just stand around and look pretty, that's about all he's good for. His acting is always flat and boring. The only movie where I remember actually liking his performance was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. And that was probably because he was just playing himself... a stoner. And it was also probably because I was also like 6 years old when I saw it.<br /><br />The movie itself has some good moments, and the storyline is vaguely interesting, but I really just couldn't buy Keanu as a tough guy. It's impossible for me to say whether this movie could have been better if they'd cast someone else as Constantine, because Keanu is on screen for most of the movie. His stoner voice is so distinct, it's really difficult to ignore. The storyline had potential, and the guy that played Papa Midnight was perfect, but every time that Keanu was on screen the movie just lost all of its momentum. So, whoever decided to cast Keanu as Constantine should be fired. He or she is single-handedly responsible for destroying what could have been a huge franchise for Warner Brothers.oryline is vaguely interesting, but I really just couldn't buy Keanu as a tough guy.

0393312836|5.0|I wanted to write this review because I feel this book is reaching in so many ways and on so many levels.  Anthony Burgess paints a picture of life, of the way life is at any given moment and then strings you along this journey, expossing the atrositys of culture and the repricutions of our actions.  Alex, Your Humble Narator (YHN) is a droog (a gang member sort-of-speak) who fancies raping women and beating others near death.  He's the youngest member of his group yet is the bossy ringleader.  After having a fall out with his friends they decide to sell him out and he becomes a prisoner of the State.  While in prison he undergoes treatment to cure his violent urges and make him a safe human, stripped of free will and a complete robot for the sole purpose to make him safe for the comunity.  This novel makes you ask yourself so many questions.  Is it fair what they've done to Alex?  Did Alex suffer enough?  When you see is parents reaction to their sons return home you'll wonder if they're being fair, or if they are being unreasonable.  Don't let the language stop you from reading this powerful novel.  I almost stopped before the first chapter was threw and that would have been a shame.  The slang used in the novel actaully help you to see the attitude of YHN and how he is truly a distressed youth.  You can see how for the majority of the novel he is self pitying, feeling that he is a victim of those around him when in actuallity you can see he is a victim of his our selfish decisions.  Read and analyze and realize that this is a one-of-a-kind novel with guts that you don't see very often.  Great novel and an instant classic.  I understand all the praise.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|When I first heard about \\"Wicked\\", I had my doubts and didn't expect much. But after going to a friend's choir concert and hearing \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"Popular\\", I could hardly contain myself when I got a copy from my cousin. <br />   \\"Wicked\\", is story of the early life of Elphaba (the wicked witch of the west) and Glenda (the good witch of the north). An excellent story with very human themes incorporated into a beautiful fantasy world upheld for years known as Oz. Characters such as \\"the Wizard\\" and \\"munchkins\\" are mentioned and we finally get to hear where some of the most memorable characters of the silver screne really came from. <br />   Led by a phenominal cast of singers and performers, the original broadway recording is simply a joy to listen to (Even for a first timer like me). ALl the characters are sung to perfection and they sound just as they really should. <br />   Covering a wide range of styles, \\"Wicked\\" seems to have something for everyone. <br />   If you enjoy the heartwrenching ballads, \\"I'm Not that Girl\\" and \\"For Good\\" perfectly meet the expectations. <br />   Fun songs like \\"Popular\\" and \\"What is this Feeling\\" will be fun to quote and sing with theater geek friends (like mine). <br />   And then we have the great choral pieces that use the entire company, such as \\"No one mourns the WIcked\\" and \\"one SHort Day\\", that perfectly complete the broadway package. <br />   HOwever, I have to say \\"Defying Gravity\\" is the ultimate feel good song and very inpirational. <br />   An excellent recording, \\"Wicked\\" is perfect for a wide range of styles and interests. Two thumbs way, WAY up!!!!
B000006OAM|5.0|This album is hauntingly beautiful, with honest and universal lyrics and along with Natalie Merchant's strong and commanding voice makes this album a classic. While the albums hitting the high selling marks right now in the Mtv world are being claimed as unforgettable- they will be forgotten the very next year as they always are for most of the albums are nothing but mindless fluff that commands no serious attentin whatsoever, and that is what makes people forget. But albums such as Ophelia will always be remembered because of how captivating and powerful the songs are and especially, again, the lyrics on the songs are.   It may take a few listens to fully get into the album, as it took me, but believe me, it gets under your skin and it sticks eventually if you give it a chance.   This album is a classic in my book, with a deep, gorgeous sound to it that drew me to it at the first time I heard it. Matter of fact, Kind and Generous was the first song I recgonized by Natalie, so I knew eventually I had to get the rest of album as well. All the songs are memorable, as is Natalie Merchant, who I have grown to really enjoy listening to.    Ophelia- A- I love the way this song sounds, and the lyrics are ones you do not hear everyday. I like the pictures Natalie has in the album, which obviously relate to the song. I love the picture on the back the best...it's just cool to me, and she looks very lovely in the cover.    Life Is Sweet- B+- This song took awhile for me to get into, but the lyrics give it an extra boost to be a great song, for the lyrcis mean a lot. And the song got under my skin eventually.    Kind And Generous- A- I still love this song a whole lot, it is a great single and I enjoy hearing it.     Frozen Charlotte- A- One of my favorite on here as well. This song is so beautiful I just cannot get over the lovely vocals on this song and the lyrics as well.     My Skin- A- Another gorgeous song I love by Natalie, that does well perfectly after Frozen Charlotte.    Break Your Heart- A- This is another song that I can so relate to. I like the way she makes the song play as well, it fits well with her lyrics.     King of May- A- Lovely song, and her voice is just great in the song. It has to grow on you but when it does you'll just fall in love.    Thick As Thieves- A- Most will not truly appreciate this song till they hear the lyrics close enough. I love what Natalie is saying in this song- a true classic and played well.    Effigy- B+ - This song means a lot to me as well, and even though not much happens in this song (it's pretty short) the lyrics and the lovely vocals at the end of this song saves it.    The Living- A - Natalie's lyrics just continue to mean a whole lot to me, making this album the classic it is. I love the words to this song, and Natalie makes it lovely, as always.     When They Ring the Golden Bells- C+- Hmm this is the only song I do not understand. The lyrics are nice but the whole sound of this song is kind of out of place with the album to me. It takes the deep, shadowed beauty out of the whole album, so I usually skip this song. It's not a bad song, but just out of place to me sound- wise and just not a song that sounds that good altogether.    The Ophelia Reprise at the end though is very beautiful I like to fast forward to that, for that makes a great end to the album.    Overall, regardless of the last song Golden Bells, I find this a five- star album not just beause of the gorgeous, deep sound of this album, the lyrics will touch you and make the album even better. It is truly a classic that will outlive all the c.d.s I have to be tortured with daily on the radio. I know that since I'm a teen most assume everyone my age loves the radio fluff but I do not- and there are a lot more teens out there I'm sure who want more music like Ophelia and I hope there will be more like Ophelia and always will be.     PS- I also recommend her album Motherland. It is a little more lighter than Ophelia, but just as great.
B00000634J|5.0|This collection represents probably the best from John Lennon's solo career - if you define \\"best\\" as being those songs that became the most popular or are the most remembered.  For a proper appreciation, one should listen to John Lennon's albums. It also helps if you know something about the ups-and-downs of his life.  It really is wonderful to hear a new hopeful and happy sound from him in his last years, and you can actually hear that in the songs on this CD.  Also, these songs run the gamut from terribly pessimistic and critical to highly uplifting - a songwriting trick that few can pull off.  However, this is a really good CD that I like more each time I play it. If you are a Lennon or even a Beatles fan, I think this will spur you to go out and sample some of John Lennon's albums.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|this is utter drivel. the songs are forgettable, the playing is shoddy, the singing is repugnant, the recording quality is subpar.. below bootleg quality. Overally this is the worst album of the year , john mayer is the backstreet boys of the blues world.
068484267X|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into just by the title, but it turned out to be a memorable read.  I couldn't wait to sit down with it day after day, and was saddened upon reaching the end.  It really made me feel thankful for what I have.  Wow, what a story, what a writer!  I also plan to read 'TIS.
6304779607|3.0|In the mid-80's, Sylvester Stallone was one of Hollywood's biggest money making actors, and a gauranteed box office draw. He was given a green light by producers to go over the script and make changes the way he saw fit. One of these scripts that Stallone was interested in was called Beverly Hills Cop. The script mixed humor with action; Stallone, however, wasn't keen on comedy so he turned the script into a darker, more action-oriented script. The result was that the producers decided to stick with the original script and give the starring role in Cop to a rising young African American comedian/actor named Eddie Murphy; Stallone, on the other hand, was given the boot. He, however, had finished revising the script, changed the title to Cobra, brought his then wife Brigitte Nielsen to co-star, and filmed it on his own with George Cosmatos, who had directed him in Rambo: First Blood Part 2, as director.    Cobra doesn't come close to Beverly Hills Cop. It was a critical disaster despite doing good business at the box office.    The story is about a cool cop named Marion Cobretti, so much for Axel Foley, who is known as Cobra. He wears jeans and a pair of dark sunglasses, lives in a slum, drives an awesome car, carries a gun with a cobra drawn on it, tosses one-liners around like frisbies, hardly smiles, and chews on a matchstick (how cool is that?!). He is hired to protect a model, played by Nielsen, who witnessed a group of killers commit their grizzly crime.     The films follows Cobra and the model as they escape from the gang to nowhere in particular. And that's where the movie goes: nowhere. In other words, Cobra is plotless. Why are the killers doing what they're doing? To take over the world and start a new order, but why?!     On the other hand, the action sequences are unrealistic (Cobra's car flying out of the second floor of a parking structure and taking off like nothing happened), but they are cool just like the movie's main character.    Not really recommended, unless you love Stallone and 'cool' action movies (together, that is!).    C
0553573403|5.0|If there is only one sentence (well 2 including this one) that you read of this review, make it this one.<br /><br />Start this series immediately.<br /><br />Now, onto the detail.  I am a recovering non-fiction reader who would scoff at reading fiction in my teens and early twenties.  For some reason I could never get into it outside of hard sci-fi (which had at least some connection to base scientific principles).  I started reading Neal Stephenson and George RR Martin, and I have been blown away.  Game of Thrones, and its successors, are about the most intriguing stories I have ever experienced.  The characters are REAL, and the plots are intricate.  The minute you think you have found your hero of the story...poof...they are gone.  This may seem wrong in some way, but believe me, Martin will have you switching sides and supporting rival characters all the way through the epic.  From handsome knights to beautiful queens, and all the way to ugly dwarfs...and that is in the same family.  THe cunning wits of the characters are dynamic.  Don't underestimate ANYONE in this story.  If you read Game of Thrones, you WILL read the others.  Currently I am 1/4 way into the third book, A Storm of Swords, and I find myself reading internet forums looking for people's opinions of other authors I can read that even compare to Martin.  I am afraid when the series is over, the world will be void of a story of this caliber.  But I think I have found something in Bakker and Erikson...we will see.  Buy this now....you can go ahead and buy the rest as well.<br /><br />One more note, the switching around of story lines and characters will have things bouncing areound quite a bit, and it may be confusing for a while.  Believe me, by the middle of Clash of Kings, you will know where you are in Westeros, and you will be well grounded in the characters.  PRAISE TO MARTIN.
B0000CDL93|5.0|It was November 22, 1963, the day US president John F. Kennedy was assassinated marking one of the most overwhelmingly saddening and pivotal events in American history. A man by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was caught the very same day and charged with the murder of the president. The next day, Oswald was assassinated by former FBI agent Jack Ruby as he was leaving the facility he was being held in. The investigation has since frozen, and it was Oswald's name that has been linked to that of the president as the lone gunman who killed him. <br /> <br />Less than 30 years later, controversial American filmmaker Oliver Stone reopened the JFK assassination files with this excellent movie that studies the assassination, and comes up with theories revolving around Oswald, and a plot to kill Kennedy that involved the CIA, FBI, Cuban exiles, Lyndon B. Johnson and many others. Now remember, it's all a matter of theory. But the theories presented in JFK are eye opening. How could Oswald shoot no less than 5 bullets in a mtter of 8 seconds and get the president from at least 3 different angles? (The magic bullet theory). What about the people who said that they heard shots coming from the picket fence right in front of the motorcade as it was passing by?  <br /> <br />JFK is an interesting movie with a star studded cast including Kevin Costner as District Attorney Jim Garrison, who takes us along on an inspiring investigation spree of who did what, and for what reasons, Sissy Spacek as his impatient wife, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw Bertrand, the man Garrison is trying to pin, Gary Oldman who does a brilliant job as Oswald, and many others including Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donald Sutherland, and Michael Rooker. <br /> <br />One of the best movies ever made! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A+ <br />
B00004SZWD|5.0|Absolutely, unequivocally, without a doubt, the BEST r and b album ever released.  I have waited years for it to be remastered and then more years for it to hit the marketplace at a price I could afford ($27 is a little too steep for this music fan to pay for one cd). <br /> <br />This is the gold standard others aspire to.
B0002B15WE|4.0|Die Hard is an exciting action packed movie directed by John McTiernan (Last Action Hero). <br /> <br />The movie stars Bruce Willis as troublemaker New York cop John McClane who visits his wife in her Los Angeles workplace, a big firm called Nakatomi Corporations, at the same time a group of European terrorists take over the firm and hold everybody hostage. But they're in for a surprise, McClane is going to drive them up the walls in a cat and mouse game all around the building while the clueless LA police stands aside.  <br /> <br />The movie is similar to the Rambo films in that McClane alone battles the entire group of bad guys, but Die Hard maintains its own identity thanks to Willis' sense of humor and catchy one-liners.  <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B+ <br /> <br />
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Other than a loud and annoying soundtrack, I truely enjoy this film.  I thought the story managed a unique twist on an old theme.  Sure there are shots that look as though it belonged in the Matrix but all in all it works. I'm not saying that there aren't a few plot holes or that the movie isn't riddled with coincidences--it is.  I mean the finally fight between Victor and Michael was as anticlimatic as one could get.  We finally get this vampire/werewolf hybrid and Victor kicks his butt.  Selene turns out to be all anyone needs.  But hey, all the fighting poses were sleek and elegant.  More like dancing than fighting.  If you enjoy vampire stories--this film should still make your must see list.
B000000W5L|5.0|It is really hard to write a review for a record this good, so I'll just fake it. I listen to Exile constantly, as do most of my friends. Exile is a different kind of \\"great record\\". Records like Sgt.Pepper and Pet Sounds {which are better, but i'm not admitting it} lack what Exile has in spades. Exile is filthy and beautiful at the same time. I will probably sound like Liz Phair describing this record, but she is absolutely right. This is a guy's record. Listening to Exile is like drinking expensive champagne right out of the bottle. As far as me personally, Exile is a record that holds true salvation. \\"Shine a Light\\" is a religious experience for me in a world where I have given up religion. \\"Loving Cup\\" is my holy grail full of bourbon... you get the idea. When you own this record you'll know what I'm talking about, and if you don't, try not to spill any bongwater on your pink floyd c.d.'s or your grateful dead tapes when you fall asleep with your headphones on.
B000002NIW|5.0|When it comes to this band, Deftones have a diffrent sound in nu metal. Chino has a great voice, and he shows it in this album. Be quiet and drive is one of the best deftones songs ever. Another good song is Head Up with  Max Cavalera. Deftones is a band that dosn't care about the mainstream. All they care about is playing music. When you hear My own Summer man that makes you want to get up and just rock out. I don't care too much for nu metal but this band  stands out. They made me a fan and when you hear this it'll make a fan out of you. I hear other metal bands to see if they have a cool sound like Deftones. Tool is one of those bands that I like now. Anyway great band and I am proud to have this in my cd collection.
B0000508U6|4.0|Try as hard as i might i couldnt hate this almbum. Although i will never like the song yellow, the rest of the album is outstanding. <br />My brother bought the album as soon as it came out and i think i hated it cuz so many people praised it so much. As time passed i couldnt help but pick out songs that i liked and after a couple years just admited to myself and unfourtunately my friends (who dispise coldplay) that yes, i do like parachutes. Sometimes you just can't control the music you like.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|The Longest Yard brings to the screen the story of a former football player who ends up in jail serving a three-year sentence.  Things get a bit more complicated when the warden wants him to coach a team of inmates in an upcoming game against the prison guards... <br />Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, Courteney Cox, and the rest of the cast carry out their roles well, though by no means are these their best performances. <br />The plot is actually not unique (there have been enough football movies), nevertheless, it is quite pleasant. <br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.  3 Stars  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Simply this CD is one of her best. I've been waiting for this quality performance and sound recording by Madonna and it's here. Just click and buy this CD. All twelve tracks are great. <br />Thank you Ms. Ciccone.
0679601686|5.0|This book is timeless and never grows old.  The wit and humor never ceases to amaze me.  I have read it at least 15 times and find something new in it each time.  I also recommend the A&E series on CD.  You will love it.<br /><br />Terie Blankenbaker
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This is by far the scarriest and most intense horror film that I've ever seen in my whole life. It's creepy and will have your skin crawling all over. It's also very gory and not for the faint of heart. It's also better than the second one, which although still good was a big let down. Watch this if you love horror films and have a tolerance for gore and violence.
0062502182|5.0|\\"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting\\" (11) <br /> <br />This beautiful story, in all its simplicity, reawakens the reader, and offers him/her a renewed sense of wonder, inspiration, and hope. Coelho skilfully shows us the importance of the journey to realizing our \\"personal legends\\" and finding our \\"treasures\\" in life. In discovering and achieving our hearts's desires, we learn so many things about life, others, and ourselves. Things may not always go as planned, but with determination life's ambiguities start to make sense, and our hearts will lead us through the obstacles placed in our paths: \\"when you really want something, the universe conspires in your favor.\\"
B00005QVHO|5.0|The import version of this CD has an extra track - Gunbarrel Highway - that was left off the US release.  It's an okay song, but I can see why it was left as a b-side.  It doesn't really add anything to the album.  Sometimes is a great way to end this classic.<br /><br />Also - DO NOT purchase this version at an exorbitant price.  Gunbarrel Highway was included on the remastered version that was recently released.
0679422714|5.0|The writing was clear, but I had difficulty finishing it. Being reminded of this level of cruelty is not fun. The sheer weight of Mao's cruelty is awesome to face. <br /> <br />The book is obviously very one-sided. But because of the thousands of one-sided books praising him, this book actually helps to swing the general body of information back to a balance.
B000B8QF14|5.0|This is a high energy, sincere, ass-kicking performance by the world's greatest band.  Billie Joe is the voice of his generation, like Bruce and Elvis before him, he can sing anything.  The whole concert breezes by because it just takes over your mind for a while and let's you have a rest.  As far as the \\"explicit lyrics\\" warning, forget it, that's ridiculous.  These guys are as pure-hearted as you can get.  Great versions of all the songs, particularly \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\" at the end.
0670033375|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while.  The essays/profiles in Collapse are very detailed and gripping.  Diamond paints a vivid picture of each culture profiled as to why it failed -- or in the case of the modern cultures, why it may fail.<br /><br />Historically the chapter on the Greenland Norse was my favorite. In the modern profiles, it would be the Australian one.  The weakest was probably the Montana profile.<br /><br />Diamond does come with a very pro-environmentalist, pro-collective bias, so you have to keep that in mind in the book.  He does \\"stretch\\" some of the historial analysis to modern times.  He states a great case, and it is an excellent jumping off point for discussion or thought.  Highly recommended.
B000A7S4B0|1.0|Everyone please stand up for your rights - DO NOT BUY THIS COPY PROTECTED NONSENSE.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album is one of Nickelback's best.  All the songs are full of emotion and more direct than their previous albums.  This album is put together better than their previous albums as well, due to the higher amount of funding and the people they had producing and mixing.  All 10 songs on the album are worth listening to (almost everyone has heard \\"How you remind me\\").  The songs are versatile and complex and they touch on difficult subjects. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are biographical, some aren't.  (Rather interesting to think about that.) <br /> <br />\\"How you remind me\\" was written in rehearsals before they went to record the album.   <br /> <br />Ignore the first review and really listen to the songs.  Anyone that is a true fan of rock will enjoy this album.  They haven't gone soft either - their 2 new albums \\"The Long Road\\" and \\"All the Right Reasons\\" contain some really hard core rock in them.  I was surprised - most groups lose their edge over time - Pearl Jam, Metallica, etc.  Nickelback hasn't lost theirs yet. I hope they never do.  It's what makes them so appealing.
B000053V7Q|3.0|Which is a shame because the picture quality and sound quality are first rate.  <br /> Really the only unforgiveable sin of this version is the omission of 'Bridge Over Trouble Water'. Elvis' rendition in the theatrical version being my favorite song of the concert. Why its missing on this version is anyones guess, but it should be here. Also Neil Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline' is missing on this version. <br /> More songs that werent included in the original are on this version. So that is a plus. However I feel that the order in which the songs were played in the theatrical version flowed better.  <br /> The theatrical version gave you the feeling that you were ringside for one Elvis concert. In this version some songs have Elvis in a different costume on a different night so that ruins the feel of the film somewhat. <br /> For completeness this DVD should have included the original theatrical version for those who prefer the original. <br /> I can recommend this film only for the picture quality and audio quality. The original Thats the Way It Is despite its flaws is superior to this film. I urge Elvis fans to get the original first in lieu of this film. You can find it from overseas vendors where its still published in its original form.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Okay, first of all, yes, I only heard A7X through \\"Bat Country\\", although I have heard OF them through a couple friends. But when I first heard the damn song, I couldn't get it out of my head. It was, at the time, the greatest, fastest, hardest, baddest ass song I've ever heard in my entire life. I went and got the CD. From the first chord of \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" to the last chord of \\"MIA\\", I loved this CD like a long lost child and it never left my CD player (I still have it in my CD visor, which is reserved for only the best of CDs). I was totally and utterly killed by this album. The lyrics, the sound of the lyrics, the guitar work, the drum work, all of it was new to me and, to put it lightly, f*cking amazing. If you haven't picked this CD up yet because you don't like \\"Bat Country\\", get it. YOU WILL FIND A SONG YOU LIKE! I like them all, but my favorites are \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" and \\"Betrayed\\". And although it doesn't sound like \\"Waking the Fallen\\" or \\"St7T\\", it still is an awesome record, and I don't care if you're some hardcore A7X fan who says \\"It sucks because they don't sound the same as they did\\", you still have to admit, that somewhere deep inside your closed mind, that this album is one of the best metal albums of all time.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is definitely their best recording in years, and thank goodness for the new input from Dave. I think his 3 melancholy songs (with definite influences of Japan) Suffer Well, I Want It All, & Nothing Is Impossible are some of the best on the album, along with the pounding opening track A Pain That I'm Used To and the final track, The Darkest Star. I don't mind the two Martin Gore sung tunes Macro and Damaged People, but they may have been better if Dave had sung them with perhaps Martin backing up. His voice gets to be a bit much all on its own in these two particular songs - or maybe if he had just downplayed the trills. Lilian is probably the weakest of all the tracks - a little empty, somehow - but still not a bad song. In the end I'd give Playing The Angel 4 1/2 stars out of 5 if I could.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Well, not really.  But at least the main idea, the main plot, was more realistic than Dracula just trying to take over the world, or England, for no reason.  Here, Dracula, played by the wonderful Richard Roxburgh, just wants to give his children LIFE.  That gave him a emotional touch, a shadow, a relic, from his human side that many other vampire characters in other movies have lost.<br /><br />Also, I enjoyed many of the scenes, I liked how they really brought out the beauty of Kate Beckinsale as well as the Brides -what nice outfits!  Thou I feel sorry for them - they had to wear almost nothing in very cold enviroments.<br /><br />Why only three stars?  Well, first off it was hard for me to see the character of Abraham Van Helsing as a homdsome, butt kicking, action hero.  A, as somebody else pointed out, James Bond for the Church.<br /><br />I liked the Mummy movies but I did't know much about the legends or myths behind the Mummy movies.  I DO happen to know a lot about vampire myth and fiction.  In other words, the very people who might wish to watch this movie, vampire lovers, might be the very ones who will spend the whole time shaking their heads and wondering what the heck they're watching.<br /><br />IF you watch it with the understanding that you will see werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, Mr Hyde and lots of vampires than you might enjoy it.  Don't compare it to ANY other movie - it is within a class by itself.  It is, after all, a Stephen Sommers movie.
0452285186|5.0|This is the only book about suicidal bunnies i will EVER read EXCEPT for the sequel book, which i have read and enjoyed. This book gets two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|One, I enjoyed the movie.  Gun battles, great special effects, and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  I liked how the movie makers tried to keep humans in all the scenes and didn't use computer graphics for everything.  Being a fan of Whitewolf I enjoyed parts of the movie and can understand why they sued Sony.<br />But I think they failed in some parts - I would have liked to see vampires fighting fang and claw against the weres a couple of times.  Also, Kate's beauty was under used - she only wore two outfits during the whole movie.  While Sophia Myles, who was Erika, got to show off her beauty with multi-outfits and even got to show off her pretty fangs while on a ceiling.<br />We never learned much about the history of either sides, only in where it was needed to support the plot.  Frankly, while I like Goth, and found many of the backgrounds interesting, I think some vampires would be more colorful.  You're dead - you might as well enjoy it.  What about body art, nose rings and clown outfits?  And why are weres always in sewers or run-down ruins?  They seem to live just as long - don't they have bank accounts?<br />The commentary was perfect and the extras were great, but I fear the movie missed the true greatness it could have reached.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Only two other system CDs are better than this one, those being \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Steal this Album\\" (Ego Brain and Peephole are awesome) but this comes pretty close. The haunting sounds of this CD had me hooked from the start. 'Stealing Society', 'She's like Heroin', 'Kill Rock 'N Roll', 'Hypnotize', 'Tentative', 'U-Fig', 'Soldier Side', and 'Vicinity of Obscenity' are my favorites. So pretty much half the damn CD rocks. The other half is still awesome though, don't get me wrong. Two songs I have to mention though. First, 'Lonely Day'. Good music but what the hell was System thinking on the lyrics? \\"Such a lonely day should be banned\\"? What the hell is that? Second 'Vicinity of Obscenity'. Again awesome song but I have no idea what it means. I don't think I'm supposed to but if anyone could fill me in then that would be great.
B00008OLIO|4.0|Here is the debut album from Motley Crue, orginally released in 1981 on their own label Leathur Records.  Selling an amazing 20,000 copies before being picked up by Electra, this album shows the Crue in their raw, yet-to-be-perfected form.  Live Wire is awesome, as is Public Enemy #1 (co-written by Sixx's ex-London bandmate Lizzie Grey) Take Me To The Top and the title track.  Vince's vocals are still a little rough here, and the production, even after Electra's revamping, is still a little dated, but otherwise this is Motley Crue as they were on the Hollywood club circuit.  The Whiskey, The Starwood, The Troubador... that is the Motley Crue represented here, young and pissed and full of rocking energy.  Definitely a good sign for things to come.  Great effort.  Soon they will become legends.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I may not have been with System of a Down from the beginning but I'm still a huge fan. System of a Down does not dissapoint with their new album. Though not quite as good as part 2 of the album, \\"Hypnotize\\", it's a great CD with tracks like 'This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song' and 'Lost in Hollywood'. 'Revenga', 'Violent Pornography', and 'Question!' are good also but get old pretty quickly. On this CD my favorite song is 'Sad Statue' and least favorite is 'Cigaro'. Not System's best CD, but still a great buy.
B000002IGP|5.0|When I saw Ratt open for Ozzy in 1984, I was 14 year old and I wasn't that impressed.  They were loud and Stephen Pearcy was as foul-mouthed a frontman as any metal singer could be and that was about it.  Being that the show was in San Diego, most of Ratt's hometown, well...maybe they were just trying to show off.  Anyway...I ended up buying Out Of The Cellar on cassette tape right before I left on a three week cross-country family vacation.  Being ill prepared for the travel I had only packed three cassette tapes (Dio's The Last In Line, Out Of The Cellar & Ozzy's Bark At The Moon).  Well...three weeks is a long time on the road and in the back of the family van...to New York and back to SD.  Lots of time to just sit back and listen and that's what I did.  Out Of The Cellar became one of my favorite albums and is still on my all-time list.  Could it be that I know it like that back of my hand?  Maybe?  But familiarity usually breeds contempt and I have nothing but respect for Out Of The Cellar.  Wanted Man.  Round And Round.  Back For More.  The obvious MTV hits.  Killer.  Then you have You're In Trouble, Lack Of Communication, In Your Direction & She Wants Money.  Juvenile? Probably.  But what part of 80's Metal wasn't?  Please.  This album absolutely f*cking rox!  Warren Di Martini is a shredder that never really gets to show you how good he really is.  Pearcy's strange style is mezmerizing.  Solid. Hands down, one of the best metal albums of all time.  Brings back a lot of memories for me.  Classic.<br /><br />Dig it.
B000002U82|5.0|What else can you say? What hasn't already been said? Somewhere it'll still be playing when all the world is dead. The ultimate concept album, the ultimate mood album, and easily my favorite album of all-time. It hasn't aged, I never get tired of it, and nearly every time I listen I pick up something new. The moment I hear those tell-tale opening notes, it changes the way I feel. There are very few other albums about which I can say that. We've all heard the songs a hundred times, but if for some reason you're new to it, buy it now. Today. Don't wait.    There's a lot of it about. And I hope there always will be.
B000002J0B|5.0|Next to Pink Floyd and U2, Zeppelin is my favorite band.  I recently got into them (I'm 25 and they are before my time) but they are without a doubt musical geniuses, and this album is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"Song remains the Same\\" is a perfect opening track.  Although I like it better live, great tune.  \\"Rain Song\\" is a beautiful ballad, Pagey's guitar work is brilliant and everyone in the band brings their A game.  Great lyrics.  \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" is one of my favorite Led songs and contains some of the best acoustic work I've ever heard.  This song made me buy a guitar and start learing how to play. <br /> <br />\\"Jamaica\\" is another catchy, radio-friendly tune.  It isnt like other Zeppelin songs, and shows how the band loved to experiment.  Same with \\"Crunge\\", a kind of dedication to James Brown.  Both are not the strongest on the record, but both are great.  \\"The Ocean\\" is also cool, love how Bonham kicks off the song. <br /> <br />The highlight is \\"No Quarter.\\"  Absolute perfection from start to finish, especially from Page and Jones. <br /> <br />This is another great Zeppelin classic.  All the albums shine through and have stood the test of time.  People will be listening to them in 50 and 100 years, great music is timeless.  <br /> <br />I would recommend all their records, especially the first 4 and this one.  \\"Physical Graffiti\\" followed this release and was a great double album, but it had some filler on it.  \\"Presence\\" and \\"In through the out door\\" are both solid records, but don't stand up with the others.  Just my opinion.  <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Led Zep, go pick up \\"How the West was Won\\", the DVD and live album.  You'll be hooked.
B0009JAENU|5.0|I am new to these pieces, and wanted to get to know them.  Miss Hahn does a wonderful job with them. the phrasing is fresh and original, and the ensemble virtually perfect. <br />Every piece is played with verve and enthusiasm.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|ONE WORD \\"PERFECT\\" THIS CD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LISTENING PIECE OF ART. THIS REVIEW IS FROM A PERSON THAT LISTENS TO ALL TYPES OF MUSIC FROM RAP TO HARD ROCK AND EVEN ALITTLE OLD TECHNO. <br />THIS CD IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST MUSIC FOR LISTENING.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|So what he might have the most pretentious sounding (SUE-fee-yon) first name in the history of rock. So what he has a few song titles that are as long as short stories (i.e. \\"The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You're Gonna Have To Leave Now, Or, 'I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight...\\")? So what he's CHRISTIAN? <br /> <br />He's amazing and delightful and so is this album. <br /> <br />This album contains music with elements of folk, indie rock, orchestral, and classical using as instrumentation everything from banjo, guitar, and piano to flute, strings, and horns. And somemhow he manages to incorporate elements of experimental contemporary short fiction and Christianity into it all without seeming pretentious or self-righteous. <br /> <br />Sounds impossible, I know. But he does it, and I'm infinitely impressed. <br /> <br />Simply put, this is one of the most ambitious albums of the year, and Sufjan absolutely nails it.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This is a 'true' story of a college girl possessed, and inadvertenly killed while under the care of an exorcist.  The priest is thus charged with murder, and the story unfolds through testimony of the trial.  The director/writer explains in the extras, that merging a courtroom drama with a horror film is a brilliant idea.  Well, not really.  An unsuspensful and flat screenplay is saved by stellar performances all around however.   <br /> <br />This failing, the lack of suspense, is mainly due to no generation of empathy for Emily Rose.  We never really see her as a person, just a gyrating, aramaic spewing invalid.  Why did her boyfriend stick around, or fall for her in the first place?  We dont see it.  What was her relation with the caring priest before she became possessed? Who knows. <br /> <br />The Exorcist in contrast, is one of the simplest yet multilayered films of any genre, an essay on the nature of evil.  There is definite reference and homage here to that film.  Several scenes of the farm land of Rose's home, a swarm of bees etc, is meant to show that evil lurks everywhere.  <br /> <br />Wilkinson's Priest however, really SEES the devil in a black robe wherever he looks.  An early scene shows him reacting to something he sees through the farmhouse window...it is a flash of a black robe entering a barn, seen for 1/3 of a second.  His complex expression is truly wonderful acting, and the audience only later learns he has these visions, let alone makes out the robe.  His performance would garner oscar nods in a level playing field.  Laure Linney and Campbell Scott are excellent in understated performances as opposing lawyers.
B0006399FS|5.0|While many would suggest All That You Can't Leave Behind reinvigorated the record buying public's faith in U2 with its back to basics oeuvre after the techno glitch of Pop, at the end of the day many of the lesser album tracks such as Wild Honey, In A Little While and Peace On Earth felt somewhat ingratiating. After wrapping up the resulting Elevation Tour (having played over 100 nights to more than two million people), U2 returned to Dublin and polished up songs for a collection of their greatest moments from the 1990s. Although its tracklisting shirked some of U2's most well known singles in favour of album tracks, The Best Of 1990-2000 (confusingly including two tracks recorded in 2002) acted as a musical stopgap for U2 while they considered their next move. That next move has taken four years to make, but as Bono sings on opening single Vertigo, \\"Checkmate!\\".  <br />The most understated of U2's albums since their debut Boy in 1980, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb at first fails to reveal just how beautiful it is. The studied arrangements only divulge their excellence on repeat listens, with the clean and simple layers of bass, guitar, drums and vocals all being identifiable at any one instance across the 11 track album. While it is truly the worst album title they've ever offered up, Bono's familiar lyrical realms of religion, love, death and saving the world and The Edge's ongoing exploration of new guitar techniques reflect that this is a band that still has much to offer. Shadowed by his father's death on Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, Bono cleverly avoids cloying sentimentality and instead turns in a heart wrenching vocal that also includes his highest falsetto on record. In a similar vein to Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, City Of Blinding Lights could also have easily fallen into the pretentious basket due to its length, yet this Joshua Tree style ode to love and America (there's always one) maintains a refreshing jubilance. Thanks to its xylophone chimes and graceful elegance, Crumbs From Your Table is a decendent of the 2002 single Electrical Storm, although the lyric is a deceptively nasty denunciation of Western greed that peaks with Bono's line, `where you live should not decide whether you live or whether you die'. The stomping Love And Peace Or Else and All Because Of You kick like a six legged mule, One Step Closer is the greatest song ever inspired by Noel Gallagher's philosophising and album closer Yahweh is yet another moment of spine-tingling beauty from a band who could legitimately copyright the phrase. Mid-40s rock stars with some of the biggest bank accounts in the game aren't supposed to be this damn powerful. With How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, U2 shows once again why they are in a league of their own.
B0001FGBL6|3.0|I was disappointed with this album.The recording wasn't as good as Consign to Oblivion ,and neither was Simone's singing.
B00079018K|4.0|They have the press (\\"This is how the Stone Roses' Second Coming could have - should have - sounded\\" - The Guardian, \\"Kasabian is a microcosm of the whole Madchester scene in one album\\" - BBC). They have the image (Jill Furmanovsky press shots and an iconographic logo exhibiting a freedom fighter). Do they have the music? From the sounds of this eponymous debut, it appears that Kasabian do indeed. While the baggy references appear a little overstated, this excellent album throws up numerous other musical street signs for those interested in plotting Kasabian's flammable course. Early single Club Foot opens the album with fine ingredients including a fuzzy introduction, a weightier version of Perry Farrell's vocal style from Kasabian lead singer Tom Meighan and a piercing broadside of synths that come on like a enjoyable bout of tinnitus. Current UK top 20 hit Processed Beats is a little more jangly, with a Super Furry Animals bent and a breakdown that harks back to Australian classic The Real Thing. Maybe Kasabian are the real thing, since tracks like Reason Is Treason (included on one of the album versions in original format and as `secret' Jacknife Lee remix) offer a compulsive beat and a real sense of purpose. God knows what they're singing about most of the time, but Kasabian contains the same buzz (both in potential hype and guitar effects) of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's debut 45s. Sometimes sounding like Richard Ashcroft backed by Air (Butcher Blues) or an industrial Duran Duran (Test Transmission), this debut hosts such an engrossing number of great songs and divergent influences that it's hard not to be captured by Kasabian.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|When this film was released it was a huge success, in fact, it was, at the time, the highest grossing film ever released by Warner Bros.  Had it not been released the same year as a little film called \\"Ben-Hur\\" it would probably have been the big Oscar winner for that year.  It is a beautifully made film.  One that I can not imagine being made today.  It is not a a religious movie, although it is about religion.  It is the story of one strong, intelligent woman's struggle to to be true to herself, while conforming to her society's (in this case her religious order's) expectations.<br /><br />The performances are exceptional and what would you expect with people like Edith Evans, Peter Finch, Coleen Dewherst.  However, it is the glorious and powerful performance of Audrey Hepburn which makes this a truly great film.  This is her greatest dramatic performance.  Pay particular attention to the scene in which she is asked to fail an important exam.  You can see layers of thought and turmoil in her eyes and body language and they all belong to the character, not the actress.<br /><br />I first saw this movie during it's first release when I was quite young. I couldn't possibly have understood everything in it, but it fascinated me and has remained one of my favorite films ever since. This film deserves a restoration and blu-ray upgrade.<br /><br />I think there are a couple of reasons it has been neglected. First and foremost is the subject matter. Some people unfamiliar with it are going to see the title and subject matter and want nothing to do with it because they'll wrongly assume it's some treacly bit of sanctimonious religious propaganda. On the other side, there has also always been a small, but steadfast, minority of over sensitive Catholics who miss the whole point of the film and consider it anti-religious (just read some of the ignorant reviews these people have posted). In addition, our sensitivities regarding colonialism are somewhat more heightened today than they were in 1959 and the film's unquestioning treatment of the occupation of the Congo by Belgium, which was quite brutal, can make some a little squeamish.<br /><br />But more than that is the deliberate pacing of the film. I think it is one of the movie's strengths, but it is terribly out of line with the expectations of today's Attention Deficit Disordered audiences. This is a film that could never be made today. In retrospect, it's rather amazing that it was ever made or that it was as big a box office success as it was. Let's hope that one day it will once again get the attention and respect it deserves.<br /><br />It would also be nice if the best selling book it was based on was back in print. If you've never read it I recommend seeking it out.
B0002S94BG|4.0|Like similar one album legends such as The La's and the Sex Pistols (it's hard to argue anything other than Never Mind The Bollocks was a proper Sex Pistols release), the estate of Jeff Buckley has done very well off the back of such notably small output. It's the lavish packaging for this latest vault-digging adventure that initially grabs the eye, although it takes little time for the music to avert attention from the unreleased photographs, Bill Flanagan's interesting liner notes, the annotations from producer Steve Berkowitz and the overall polished sheen of this Legacy Edition. While cynics may scoff at this latest repackaging of Buckley music, fans are sure to lap up this special version of Grace. Any true Buckley aficionado's copy of Grace will no doubt be worn out due to years of loaning to unenlightened friends and soundtracking a decade of memories. This new version is a damn good excuse to update, although even an extra disc of rarities and a DVD inclusion cannot alter the fact the original Grace album remains a staggeringly beautiful enigma on its own. Ten years on, the record still holds an undeniable freshness and vitality. Corpus Christi Carol still divides listeners as to whether it is a beautiful piece or melancholy or simply a wishy washy medieval ballad, but there's no doubting the staggering worth of the Leonard Cohen cover, Hallelujah (also covered by Bono, kd lang and Rufus Wainwright, although never bettered) and Last Goodbye. Of the bonus disc tracks, the superfluous bluesy sketches of Alligator Wine and Parchman Farm Blues are quickly forgotten as the fantastic alternate version of Dream Brother and the haunting and desolate sounds of the Hank Williams track Lost Highway (made even more eerie by the similar age at which both artists died) drift by. The `short 14 minute' live version of Big Star's Kanga-Roo and the chilling bonus track Strawberry Street (when Buckley sings the line \\"born to die young\\" it's hard not to gasp) wrap up the bonusCD, while the Grace documentary and five music clips of the DVD add further weight to this hefty release. Unlike other estates that continuously dredge up unnecessary scraps from long deceased artists, Grace (Legacy Edition) has made a positive addition to Buckley's canon. With Grace a designated classic album, Jeff Buckley's spirit lives on through fitting tributes such as this.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|True, this movie could have been better than it was - it had great potential - but it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It is actually really good. The two stars are great as the main characters, Heath Ledger especially. They are funny and have great chemistry on screen. They have never played anyone like these characters and they do a great job bringing them to life. It is also very entertaining how many different fairy tales they squeeze in. Right when you see certain characters you'll be like \\"Hey! That's little red riding hood.\\" Or \\"Hantsel and Gretel, I remember that story.\\" It is really cool I think. The special effects are pretty good. They could be better but I think they made the most of the budget they had. Some of them are pretty astonishing, while some are obvious. But it doesn't ruin the movie. I think it actually adds to the whimsical aspect of it. It has the sort of dark and silly humor as movies like \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" and \\"Monty Python\\" so if you're not into that kind of humor or it puts you off, then you should probably look for something else. Personally, I love that kind of humor and I'm very glad that I bought this movie. But for those of you that don't want to fork up 20 bucks becasue your not sure if you'll like it or not, at least rent it. It is definitely worth seeing.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|Hope I'm still alive to upgrade my fuzzy VHS to DVD. <br />Looks like it won't be released until pigs have wings...

Missed, among other things, some of the superstitious ways of the family/relatives. <br /> <br />Man, has this book brought back those memories. Awesome book, nicely depicts the intricate web of superstitions, feelings, and the nature of people in India. <br /> <br />Read it...won't let you down.
1590710487|5.0|I was in the library a week before surgery looking for light fiction to tide me over a week of recuperation, when I saw \\"Belushi\\" sitting on a new non-fiction shelf and picked it up on a whim.  I never got to the fiction. <br /> <br />Well-collected and organized first-person interview quotes, personal photographs, behind-the-scenes stories...this is a wonderful, yet cautionary, tale of the 1970's in America.  I laughed out loud; tears came to my eyes.  Thank you, authors. <br /> <br />Disclaimer: John Belushi was born in the same hospital (a few years later) as I was; one of his father's restaurants was two blocks from where I did some of my growing up; I was in Second City audiences while John was there; I've watched SNL faithfully since its first year; I saw even John's bad movies.  Prejudiced I am-this is still an admirable, accurate, caring biography.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is it!!!  The release that shows the power of the E Street Band.  Seeing them live in 75 is like a dream come true.  Amazing from start to finish.  If you have recordings of E Street shows from 75, the loose feeling that's usually there is gone.  This is a band looking to prove something.  They are working to overpower this crowd and they kick it with all cylinders firing.  I am talking (of course) about the London Show.<br /><br />If I need to convince anyone that one of the greatest albums ever recorded needs to be heard, I'll give up without bothering.  The only question should be is the Box set worth it.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY!!!<br /><br />Give any old copies of Born to Run to anyone you know who doesn't get it yet, but buy this set.<br /><br />How else can we convince Bruuuuce to give us more of the same?
B000B2YQX4|1.0|I have the ability to detect how an album sounds by listening to the first few seconds of it - this works with most albums. This album starts of with an illbient noise blast, which I can't figure out why - these discordant sounds occur through the rest of the album too. The rest is not just \\"dark\\" - it is just plain bad compared to other Depeche albums. It seems like they were forced to make this album because of contractial obligations. The lyrics are awful, the music itself is poor considering earlier songs/albums, and the singing is also poor - the style, not being used before is more or less wailing than singing - it sounds like Dave and Martin are forcing themselves to sing during a mental depressive episode. I like them more when they wrote the earlier albums while partying. The creative flow is completely lacking in the album & I couldn't bear to listen to the whole thing. Unless you like being depressed, listen to this & you'll almost feel sorry for Martin & Dave.
B00025ETIW|5.0|choruses..great guitar and unexpected 3 dimensional turns.... they are so musical and yet have an \\"off tone' at times then with a sudden short lived harmony...check out \\"the jetset life is gonna kill you\\"; also i love what they do toguys like us in prison...if you are an angry person looking for some release, do listen to this...its grrreat
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day used to always be that \\"other band\\" that you kind of know for a few good songs to me.  I recently bought Nimrod, and Green Day has instantly become one of my favorite bands!  This album gave these guys a huge boost in their career, and it's easy to see why!  I won't even make a list of my favorite songs because each one is a hit.  If you're not really into Green Day, pick up this album and chances are you will become a huge fan.  I am going to buy this album as soon as I can, because, well I just told you.  This album is perfect!  Buy this album if you get a chance.  You won't be sorry!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|The super audio version of this album maintains the rather intimate studio sound of the original, while adding some judicious ambient sound and just a few separate instrumental parts for the rear channels.  Having listened to most of the Dylan SACD's, I would have to say that this is my favorite, and is well worth purchasing for anyone with an appropriate surround sound system.  The overall quality of the original project is well represented in this remastered and remixed edition.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|First of all, you may not want to take my advice, because I have never listened to these guys before.  I really like this album because it has a lot of good songs, but the main reason I love it is for \\"Dust in the Wind.\\"  It is an incredible song.  With a budget price, I say it is definetely worth it.
B000063JDE|5.0|After watching Mulholland Drive and reading the screenplay for Lost Highway, I was hooked on David Lynch. So why not watch his \\"masterpiece\\", this \\"classic\\"? I decided that I just had to pick it up and well..it was dark. That word perfectly describes the movie. First of all, most of the movie takes place in the dark and what you see on screen is shocking and hard to stomach. I have to aggree with what Siskel said in his review back in 1986..saying that this did to him what Psycho much earlier had done to him. And I aggree. It's like the newer version of Psycho. And well, it succeeds wonderfully.   For 1986, this movie shocked me as it had some very questionable and disturbing content. For 1986 on a 6 million dollar budget, this movie is nothing short of outstanding, And still today, 20 yrs later, it is extremely watchable and really creepy. It sent chills down my spine and the ear part made me gag.   David Lynch's movie is a masterpiece.   Jeffrey is a college student living in a small town with a small life. His father is in the hospital, he lives with his two aunts and so his life isn't too exciting. That's until he finds an ear in a field. This leads to his investigation with his friend, turning girlfriend, Sandy. It all centers around a mysterious lady named Dorothy, living all alone in her apartement. Jeffrey decides to sneak in and he finds DARK THINGS. Frank (Dennis Hopper) is a very bad man. A man who is somehow posessing Dorothy and having her do stuff for him. Weird stuff. He breathes air through a mask and it is that that makes the movie. This mask is chilling and so bizarre. It makes his character. Frank is one of the creepiest characters in cinema history. His line   \\"Mommy!\\" and \\"Don't you fu****' look at me!\\" are genious.   David Lynch has created one of the most memorable vilains I have ever seen..if not the most memorable.   The movie keeps on going at this dark pace and mysterious and shocking events occur. Some scenes will makes your jaw drop forsure!  Dennis Hopper gives a bewildering performance. Best Supporting Actor!! He gives one of the best performances for a vilain of all time! Not since Gary Oldman in the professional have I been so impressed. But here I am a lot more impressed.   The conclusion is well thought out. In conclusion, David Lynch's movie is mesmerizing, absolutely brilliant. It is as good as Mulholland Drive if not better. It's very hard to watch but is such an interesting study of good and evil and human actions and emotions. It is a critical study that is summed up in this line: \\"it's a strange world.\\" As well as gross and sick may I add! Great job mr. Lynch, this is the modern Psycho and may even be better than Psycho. It's only Psycho's score that puts it on top!
B000BP86OG|5.0|This album is not as \\"heavy\\" as PtL... Or is it? On initial listen it may seem not. It is it's own thing, but not really so different past the superficial roadblocks that some people have put up (\\"They use strings!\\" to paraphrase). Quite frankly it's an expansion in some areas, a tightening in others. But NOTHING here is out of place from the spirit of the first album, and to think so shows a lack of comprehension and makes me believe that One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back is just over some people's heads (Listen to them back to back to see what I mean). The humor is here (Hazel Eyes). The rocking, rollicking fun is here (Girlfriend, Knockers). And, yes, the heaviness is here in spades (Bald, One Way Ticket to Hell)! And the only excess they're guilty of is going for a bigger sound. But the roots are pure. For those who enjoy their rock with grandiose, voluminous pomp and strut: this is a must have.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Best Foreign movie EVER!  <br />Oldboy is a Korean film, obviously made on a very short budget that is nothing short of brilliant. It has been compared to Tarantino movies and may I ask: what's up with that? Sure I enjoy some Tarantino flicks but this has nothing to do with them. The pervasive language label on the back is in all fairness a bunch of b.s. Mr. F is barely used.  <br />There isn't that much violence in the movie but when there is, it's intense. The violence is there for a purpose: for example, one scene is a sacrifice and another is vengeance. The one brawl the movie has is great! The protagonist (don't know his name) and his hammer makes these 15 men's lives a living hell.  <br />Yet there were very few fights which surprised me. But the ones there are..are great!  <br />On the other hand this movie lives off of the ingeniously woven plot. The violence is only a product of that, only used with a purpose. A man, preparing for his daughter's birthday is abducted and thrown in a room. He is framed for the murder of his wife and spends 15 years of his life there. Who did it? Why? This will all be found out in due time. When he is released, he's given a suit and a cell phone where his abductor calls him. He meets a young woman and falls for her. She helps him, shows him love, and helps him get revenge. But things are more complicated than that. And if you want to see a twist, the huge one at the end will knock you flat. It will haunt you and maybe bring tears to your eyes. The \\"sacrifice\\" is the true meaning of love, and it shows the good nature of our hero. This hero isn't only a but kicking bad a#$ like Tarantino would have made him out as, no...He is someone who really knows about love and is such a courageous person that he will do anything for that person. And this is what American films lack, a moral. And this twist isn't like the dark crazy ones in Amercan cinema, it is an unusual one, an unexpected one. It's a touching tale, a haunting tale, a sadtale. It will make you think a lot and behind all of this violence and revenge is love and that love is the true meaning behind this ingenious tale.  <br />It is hands down the best of 2005 and more than that even! <br /> <br />
0060594888|4.0|I think this is an excellent book, but a few things cast a dark shadow: Why did he have to spoil a five-star book with a quote from that monster CARLETON SHEETS @#!? or a \\"success\\" story on convicted felon ROBERT G. ALLEN !!?? Doesn't he realize?? that Allen served time in prison? I had bought Allen's real estate book. I wish I had stumbled onto John T. Reed's website before I knew about those guys. Another highly questionable character in my mind is Robert \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" Kyosaki. Why is he in there??!!  Now I know that SUCCESS MUST BE PRECEDED BY SOME LESSONS IN BEING STREET SMART (AND RESPONSIBLE). And hopefully, it doesn't have to happen the way it did for me.<br /><br />I was basically unemployed, making about $3,000 that year when, as a naive beginner, I bought the Sheets real estate course, which I didn't like and I returned, but the salesman somehow talked me into trying personal coaching, by painting a dreamlike picture (for me and my family's \\"future.\\") I wasn't so smart after all, because I not only forked out the money, but I very quickly realized I didn't have the money to drive around trying to find properties. It's like a full-time business, and it obviously requires time and money, which I didn't properly consider. And they didn't screen my circumstances either; it was just sign an agreement and \\"hand over the moolah.\\" Sheets refused to refund about $1,600, no matter what I said or did. Even the attorney general's office was ineffective in getting the money issue resolved, even a pro-rata agreement. Sheets simply maintained that I continue the course, but I wasn't about to get anywhere near them after that. That money loss and situation was a huge financial and emotional setback for me at the time, and very humiliating. I had never been held hostage like that over my money to anybody in my life.<br /><br />This Success book was given as a gift, and it does emphasize some principles in breaking with the past and moving on, but that doesn't negatea highly important point of my own: be very, very careful WHO you associate with in the process of setting goals and achieving success. As Reed points out, as one of several points, in his Guru BS detection: don't ever sign a contract or agreement.<br /><br />I plan to get Reed's \\"Succeeding\\" book, because he has some important considerations, and guaranteed, there won't be any Carelton Sheets or Robert Allens mentioned there (except possibly what not to do and WHO to stay away from). Best of wishes to all. Pursue your dreams, but also be careful. Do your homework. Be like a detective or investigator and learn to detect the bad guys, and trust me, there are lots of them around every corner.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Gabriel Byrne stars as Tom Regan a Prohibition era counselor type gangster who has the ear of Irish racketeering kingpin Leo played by Albert Finney.  The insightful Byrne is attempting to broker an uneasy peace between his boss Leo and powerful up and coming Italian mobster Johnny Caspar played flawlessly by bald character actor Jon Polito.<br /><br />Polito it seems has been having his gambling profits minimized by the efforts of erratic grifter Bernie Bernbaum played by John Turturro.  He comes to Finney for his blessing on the execution of the pain in the neck Turturro.  Turturro is however under Finney's protection and Finney's refusal to sanction the hit sets off a violent turf war with the scheming Byrne in the middle.<br /><br />Byrne must negotiate his way through this minefield while having an affair with Leo's mistress Verna played by Marcia Gay Harden, who also happens to be Turturro's sister.  Byrne manages to play both sides against each other while frequently getting pummeled throughout the film.  It seems as if he's an inveterate gambler and in addition to taking his lumps from each warring faction, he also gets beaten for welching on gambling debts.<br /><br />The Coen's with brilliant set design and wardrobing create a very authentic looking film populated with accomplished actors doing very effective jobs with their roles.  The character development, difficult to attain in a two hour film is nicely accomplished. Their creation \\"Miller's Crossing\\" rivals any of the vintage gangster classics considered to be the top films of that genre.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|As others have said, this isn't a typical horror movie, and though it is a film in part about demonic possession and in another about the trial that follows the terrible result, it's also about belief, helplessness, sacrifice, fear, and the recognition that we are small and myopic in a universe we barely understand.  In this it reaches further than most horror movies since, perhaps, the original Exorcist.  And this may be why so many react so differently to its story. <br /> <br />It's not a slasher pic; it's not filled with gore or scantily-clad teenagers who suffer horribly ridiculous deaths because their hormone-ridden bodies crave sex.  Nor is it obvious: it rarely answers the questions it raises.  Instead, it's an intelligently acted, well-considered, subtle and frightening movie about the collision of what we don't understand with what we think we do. <br /> <br />Though I do see how some might want to claim it as propaganda (that science doesn't explain everything, for instance, or that God and the devil might exist despite our best efforts to rationalize them away), and though its courtroom scenes hardly are primers for criminal procedure, still, it seems to me that those who criticize this movie on those grounds are missing the point: not everything we believe about the world particularly makes it so. <br /> <br />It is scary, smart, and tense, with terrifically-realized performances by some fine actors, including Tom Wilkinson, who seems to bring heart and depth to every role in which he appears, Laura Linney, who can express even with a slump of her shoulders complexity and depth, and Jennifer Carpenter, the daughter of John Carpenter, who brings vulnerability and terror to what is, in retrospect, a relatively smallish role. <br /> <br />I like this picture; it's subtle and scary in the way of some of the best horror movies I've seen, including The Haunting (the original) and The Mothman Prophecies (in which, of course, Linney also was luminous).  Sometimes (often) a character's haunted stare can elicit more fear than the thickest pea soup.  And in this picture there are a lot of those frightened looks. <br />
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I enjoyed Sin City in the movie theater.  It has excellent performances by a multitude of stars and accurately captures the style and substance of Frank Miller's \\"graphic novels.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, it is a \\"film noir\\" in the extreme and full of gore and violence.  But if you watch it as it is intended -- a larger than life cartoon portrayal -- I think you will enjoy it. <br /> <br />I watched the movie again in DVD when it was first released and enjoyed it even more on the second watching as I \\"got\\" more of the story line the second time around.  Still the original release DVD disappointed due to its lack of special features. <br /> <br />The Recut, Extended, Unrated edition more than makes up for the disappointing originial DVD release.  Perhaps most impressive is the presentation of the separate tales in separate segments as they were told in the original Miller works.  This allows each to stand on its own and the addition of more and clarifying footage.  One sees how each story relates to the others in a different way than in the theater version in which the separate stories are intertwined througout the feature. <br /> <br />The commentary by directors Rodriguez and Miller is excellent are all the other special features.   <br /> <br />If you haven't already bought the original DVD, skip it and buy this version.  You won't regret it, especially if you are a fan of the genre.
6305657947|5.0|This could be one of the eccentric secrets you hold among your friends who are poets, academics, and other nogheads who, like you, like WB Yeats over Tom Clancy.  This movie is an indulgence in luxury:  the fantasy protagonist who has every single item of fancy and lustily shares them with the audience.  From Jaguars, skyscrapers, excellent wardrobe, private planes, a killer dress, Magritte, and a snappy score, this movie fulfills hits luxury on every level.  If it were a sweater it would be of the finest cashmere, and the sex is the kind everyone aspires to, whether or not they'd admit it in say, a bohemian gathering of the literary bent.<br />So enjoy.  Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo deliver on all the levels you want them to.  Curl up with chocolates and watch this movie, and revel in the sheer luxury of it all.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This is a very good soundtrack! It has some of the most famous songs by various artists and new ones for the film! Plus great score by Alan Silvestri! If you like the film get the CD!
0790749858|5.0|This film follows \\"His Heirness\\" through a crazy adventure sure to delight the young and old. The movie follows Jordan's rise to fame in the game of baseball as well as the end of the careers of 3 NBA superstars; Mugsy Bouges, Shawn Bradley, and Charles Barkley.  <br />The film was enjoyable and realistic. Jordan is a natural star with an award winning smile. MVP! MVP!
B000059ZLH|4.0|This dvd is really good, aside from some of the annoying videos they show throughout it.  The sound quality is not the best, because it's kind of quiet (I have to turn my tv all the way up for a decent volume level), but it still sounds good.   <br /> <br />The metropolis part 2 cd is by far thier best work, and to see the whole entire thing performed live is awesome.  If your a fan of that album, than this dvd is for you. <br />Another thing i really liked about this dvd is the live version of \\"A Change Of Seasons\\".  To me, that track alone is worth the price of the dvd.  What a great song that is.   <br /> <br />The bonus \\"behind the scenes\\" crap is pretty dumb...  I think they could have put a little more work into that.   <br /> <br />With all the annoying things about this dvd, they don't really matter in the end, because it's dream theater, and they are awesome... so go buy it!
B000BJS4BM|3.0|I give the album five stars. <br />I like the bonus track, Fighting Spirit. <br />The Disc will not play on my computer. I've even returned it. <br />The new copy doesn't either.

B000002UAU|5.0|I know it seems arrogant to say this, but there's really no other way to go about it. It 's bold and daring even by today's standards, and is a complete change from their music before. There are some bands out there that have created works comparable with the Beatles, but are still a notch below them. Take Pink Floyd. They created breathtaking music, but even they wouldn't have dared to record a song like \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" And even if they had, they wouldn't have put it on an album with a mind blowing depression pill like \\"A Day in the Life.\\" The Beatles had enough daring to do things like that, things that people had never thought about. This is how they broke away from the standards of American music that they sunk so deeply in with \\"With the Beatles.\\" They changed the way people wrote music. The only band that's come close to doing what the Beatles did in terms of mastery of different styles is the Rolling Stones, and even their best albums weren't master compilations like Sgt. Peppers. Safe to say, music changed the day this album came out, and you owe it to yourself to hear the album that became the inspiration for most of your favorite groups.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|I expected a lot out of this movie and I was not disappointed.   <br /> <br />Plot: 5 Stars.  While there are no great surprises in the plot, the beauty of this movie is how the plot unfolds and develops, how the story continues to build and how in the very end, the emotion, special effects and acting combine for a seamless climax. You are not left wondering how you got to certain points in the movie.  <br /> <br />Audience Reaction:  5 Stars.  The movie is a fine tuned roller coaster ride.  The audience was truely dazzled.  I never heard so many \\"Geeeez\\" in all my life.  There is humor but it's not over done.  The cooks theory about the abominable snow man is a hoot.  There is stress and tension but not anything that will short circuit your pace maker.  Best of all I felt the movie connected with the audience.  While I did not cry I found my 14 year old daughter bawling her eyes out.  She has never cried at a movie before.  The poor lady behind me was sobbing like her pet cat Squeeker just fell out of a tree and got run over by a super hero.  I noticed a lot of hankeys on the way out of the theater.  <br /> <br />Special Effects:  5 Stars.  Anymore, I expect special effects to be seamless and not a distraction due to their poor quality.  King Kong's special effects are, as of today, the best I have ever seen.  There is only one part in the movie where I was a little uncomfortable with an effect.  Kong tosses around Ann Darrow to the point where her neck should have been snapped.  I can live with that.  The T-Rex's, Kongs fight scenes, the bugs, the swamp slugs (awesome) and the Empire State building were so very real.  I did think the swamp slugs should have eaten an attorney rather than the cook. <br /> <br />Scale:  5 Stars.  Too often special effects characters change their size during a movie.  One minute they are 100 feet tall in one scene and then 10 feet tall in another scene.  Kong and the other creatures in the movie stay the same size.  Kong is not sitting comfortably in the back of a pickup truck in one scene and then holding that very same pickup truck in his hand in the next scene.  This makes the movie so much more believable and realistic.  <br /> <br />Family Entertainment Value:  5 Stars.  This is a movie you can take the entire family to.  There are no unnecessary sex, nude or vulgar language scences.  The closest the movie gets to anything uncomfortable is when Ann Darrow stands in front of a burlesque theater and there are some visible mildly suggestive posters of women.   <br /> <br />Kong:  5 Stars.  The star of the movie.  A masterpiece of special effects and character research.  Kong actually acts like a gorilla in love with a beautiful blonde.  (Not that I have actully seen that happen before)  Kong's facial, hand and body expressions and movements are realistic and right out of the jungle.  Kong's character changes throughout the movie.  I don't think he is just dazzled by the beauty of Ann Darrow (so wonderfully played by Naomi Watts) but he is also captivated and confused by her courage in front of him.  Kong respects her because she begins to show no fear and you sense that change in him.   <br /> <br />In Summary:  5 Stars.  You can safely take your entire family to this movie and enjoy the ride.  The acting is impecible, the plot entertaining and the special effects are special.  Peter Jackson has truely gone beyond Lord of the Rings.  Thank you Peter and the rest of the gang. <br /> <br />
0800116917|5.0|If you like grand epics and sweeping vistas?  This is a classic that should not be missed.
B00000255F|5.0|Musically speaking Bruce Springsteen is very clever.'Born To Run' is a flat out terrific album.Bruce (in his pre Boss days)threw together a musical stew that blends Phil Spectors Wall Of Sound,Southern soul music and good ol' fashioned rock n' roll into his own vibrant,unique sound.The majority of this recording are made up of classic upbeat stuff such as the classic title song and \\"Thunder Road\\",not to mention the naggingly catchy Memphis grits n' gravy soul style of \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\".Bruce even throws in a Bo Diddly type beat on \\"She's The One\\".During this period Spirngsteen was hyped as a modern day Bob Dylan.Not a fair comparasin since it's obvious Bruce is a total flat out rocker and R&B belter without alot of the folky connectiond of Dylan and Springteen ups the ante by unashamadly siting (musically) the influences of the first couple generations of rock n' roll rather then psychedelic or prog rock.This opinion was so previlant in the mid 70's that alot of the music buying public neglected more epics such as \\"Jungleland\\" and the slower \\"Meeting Across The River\\".Lyrically Springsteen,as before continues to explore character sketches and further developments come on these songs,illustrating the free wheeling lives of a group of young adults living the 'life' on the there end of the street and if Bruce has anything to say about it it's again the E Street shuffle.'Born To Run' is alot of fun to listen to and deserves a place in any rock n' roll collection.It's sure in mine but check out the whole,not just the hits.'Born To Run' was born to be digested whole.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This movie is awesome.  I love this DVD.  Granted the extras should have been more but I've watched the \\"original\\" and the director's cut and the extended scenes are pretty sweet.  Regardless if they were there or not this is still a great movie.  Why do I love this movie so much you ask?  It has nothing to do with the actors (even though I love Drew Berrymore),nothing to do with the score, or even the plot (I admit I've watched this many times and I still don't know whats going on).  What makes this movie worth it then?  It's the freakin rabbit!  Its crazy!  I know thats not really a good reason to encourage others to buy this but man that rabbits crazying looking.

This album will make you weep at the brilliance of this man.
0441003257|5.0|Honestly, there aren't many books out there that can add this kind of levity and hilarity to the apocalypse.  I read the Hitch hikers guide to the galaxy and loved it, but this book is better.  I've loaned it to many of my friends and the response is always the same.  They are surprised at how funny it is and many of them laugh out loud. <br /> <br />After reading it for the second time recently (and I rarely re-read a book), I couldn't help grinning through most of it because it brings back all of the nostalgia from laughing out loud the first time. <br /> <br />A great effort from both Pratchett and Gaiman.  I have gone on to read many of their books (especially Gaiman) and none quite work as well as this one. <br /> <br />5 Stars!

1419359827|1.0|The book isn't that bad, but it isnt worth buying with so many other masters out there writing about how to get it done.  Here's what's wrong.... <br /> <br />First, it's billed as \\"revolutionary\\" concepts which I found to hardly be true.  Almost evey idea was something that I've read in a Covey, Mackay, Peters, etc book. Recycled.   <br /> <br />Further, he's so proud of his accomplishments it becomes exhausting to keep up with all the great things KF did in his life.   <br /> <br />Finally, he writes often about how he was from poor, underprivileged family and he had nothing but his \\"revolutionary\\" concepts to break him into The Club.  I believe it at first, until he started (and then repeated) to tell the reader about how he went to a private elementary and HS, then to Yale and Harvard BS.  He was IN the club from first grade - hardly a life course that demonstrated how unique and terrific his practices were.   <br />
0066620996|1.0|This book does its readers a tremendous disservice.  I expect that statistics courses at Stanford Business School (where the author used to teach), like everywhere else, teach that correlation is not causality.  This book, however, is a collection of correlations presented as having causal relationships.  But wait - it gets worse.  The gross selection bias throughout the book guarantees that the companies identified as \\"great\\" appear to be, while the so-called comparision companies give the illusion of a control group.  Don't be fooled.  This is pseudo-science couched in management-speak.  Once you've seen through this silliness, you're left with little more than conventional wisdom about good management (do what you're passionate about, get the right people on board) that, while possibly true, is unsubstantiated by any of the \\"data\\" presented in the text.

6304698690|5.0|<br /> <br />The 1993 movie version of The Secret Garden captures the magic of this inspiring story for both children and adults, while the BBC television version does not.  It's plodding style, avalanche of dialogue, and low production standards let the inherent magic escape. No matter how hard they try, repeating the word \\"magic\\" over and over again does not make the TV show magical.  <br /> <br />Some portions of the TV dialogue are lost in thick Yorkshire accents and unintelligible dialect, interesting only to language scholars. At the other extreme are too many wordy explanations of what we clearly saw happen and plainly heard spoken.  Just because a television script corresponds closely to a beloved book does not necessarily mean that it makes good television, or that it captures the spirit of the book.  <br /> <br />Children are capable of understanding that something special or wonderful is happening simply by watching the event take place. The 1993 movie knows this and wisely lets a picture speak a thousand words. <br /> <br />The movie version communicates a vibrant love of life. You get to know the unique, even eccentric, characters as though they were real people struggling with hardships and fears. You are drawn into the depths and heights of their emotions through the use of stunning visuals, dramatic portrayals, pithy dialogue, moments of quiet contemplation, and a serene musical soundtrack that is worth owning on its own merits.  <br /> <br />In the TV episodes, on the other hand, a lot of effort is expended but no real drama is achieved. For example, during what could be quiet, thoughtful moments of solitude, the mood is often spoiled with a voice-over or with the use of grainy film for outdoor scenes - a distracting contrast to the clear videotape used in indoor sets. I've never been made so aware of production methods and camera work. I'd rather just sit back and enjoy.  <br /> <br />The BBC actors are good and appear capable of much better performances, but the director was content with their shallow characterizations and a few instances of mumbling, garbling, and stumbling over their lines. At several points I expected to hear the director yell, \\"Cut. Try it again.\\" Unfortunately, it's not up to normally high BBC standards. <br /> <br />It's nice to have a better choice.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Clint Eastwood does a great job of getting the best out of some very fine actors in this urban working class instant classic.  Sean Penn, reminding me of some of the best work by such stars as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, is absolutely authentic as Jimmy Markum from the mean streets of Boston, a guy who brushed with the law, went straight, and then, when his beloved daughter comes up murdered, is tested and found...<br /><br />All too human.<br /><br />He is supported by Tim Robbins as his boyhood chum Dave Boyle, a man tottering on the edge of sanity, a man haunted by a childhood abduction by pedophiles, one of whom flashes a priest's ring.  Penn won an academy award in 2004 as Best Actor, and Robbins won as Best Supporting Actor.  Best film that year went to Lord of the Rings, but Mystic River couldn't have been far behind in the voting.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon, the third of the boyhood pals who have gone their separate ways in adulthood, plays Sean Devine, a homicide detective with the Boston police.  He also does a great job.  His sidekick is played by Laurence Fishburne who brings the very familiar black police detective role to a new level of excellence with his balanced and realistic portrayal.  Also excellent is Marcia Gay Harden as Celeste Boyle, Dave's wife, who through stupidity, fear, and a misreading of human grief, makes a fatal mistake in judgment, a mistake that leads to a needless murder.<br /><br />The story itself is riveting.  Eastwood's direction is tight, focused, always believable, and atmospheric.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, is nothing short of mesmerizing.  This movie is that good.  It reminds me a little of some great mafia classics like The Godfather in the way it depicts east coast urban America: the family ties and betrayals, fateful acts born of anger and frustration, stupidity and human frailty, and most notably in the high quality of all aspects of the production, especially the most important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere.<br /><br />A couple of other things set this film apart.  One is the interesting and deep psychological situations that some of the characters find themselves in.  Detective Sean Devine has an estranged wife who calls him but doesn't speak; Jimmy has dark secrets in his past known only to himself; Dave Boyle does something that nobody knows about until the end, something totally in keeping with his character; and finally, the boyfriend of Jimmy's daughter, Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) knows something that solves the murder in his mind, but he doesn't want to tell it just yet.<br /><br />The second is, even as Brendan runs home to confirm what he knows, you'll never guess who murdered Jimmy's daughter.  Only in the next scene as the film nears its climax, is it clear what happened and why.  And the difficulty isn't anything artificial as is so often the case in movie thrillers.  The difficulty results from a beautifully constructed story based on a realistic and believable plot that makes us feel when the truth finally comes out, that it is right and understandable although almost impossible to guess beforehand.<br /><br />See this for Clint Eastwood who, with this film, can take his place alongside Hollywood's great directors, and for Sean Penn who gives the performance of his life.t important ones, story, character and veracious setting and atmosphere. <br /> <br />A couple of other things set this film apart.

0783225857|5.0|To those who judge a book by its cover, Gregory Peck in spectacles looks like too serious a film to dig up - but this film is not about serious old Gregory Peck.  It is quite a simple story from the vantage of two motherless children who play around and are intrigued by an unknown fearful character in their neighbourhood reputed to be mad, and the events surrounding Gregory Peck, their father defending a black worker unjustly accused of raping a woman - during the 1930s when segregation was the norm in the south. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character - who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.  The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.  Peck's character is a admirable lawyer defending a case which in all probability he will lose.  But the unfairness meted to the black defendant though forming a core aspect to this film is not centre stage.  What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice. <br /> <br />The music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm - along with the grosser aspects of intolerance at the time.  The music if very special. <br /> <br />This film got several oscars including best actor for Gregory Peck. <br /> <br />This DVD comes with one version of the film with a producer/director commentary and a 90 minute documentary about the whole project with critical exploration of what the film and book convey. <br /> <br />Truly an American classic and the best aspects of humanity from a south US heartland.
B000BISBDY|5.0|For those who are still unaware, Johnny Cash is a true American legend. His music has defied category, which makes it as easily accessible to fans of Kenney Chesney and Coldplay as it is to fans of Metallica and Eminem. For those interested in hearing his music, then \\"The Legend of Johnny Cash\\" is a fine place to start.<br /><br />Spanning his entire recording carrer, which lasted from 1955 to 2003, the listener gets to hear Cash grow both musically and lyrically. On these 21 tracks, we get a glimpse of his life and legend. There are no standout songs on here. For me, it is really hard to pick a favorite song from Johnny Cash, as they are all classics.<br /><br />If you're a new fan of Johnny Cash, then this is definitely a must-have CD. As for longtime fans, you, too will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is simply one of the most brilliantly composed rock records I can remember.   <br /> <br />Try to forget for a moment what the political message is of this record.  What Green Day has done is created a recording that basically reads like a book or plays like a symphony.  What I mean by this is that the songs lose much of their meaning if you just listen to one of them.   <br /> <br />For example, if you heard \\"Boulivard of Broken Dreams\\" on the radio, you might take a message of sadness or a feeling of not belonging.  When you hear it on the CD, in the context of \\"American Idiot,\\" \\"Jesus Of Suburbia,\\" and \\"Holiday,\\" the four songs play to me like one long track with progressions of mood, and \\"Broken Dreams\\" feels much angrier all of a sudden.   <br /> <br />Green Day is, without a doubt, very angry about what is happening in this country right now, and as a result, this record winds up dividing a lot of people along ideological lines.  So be it.  Sometimes, I think music needs to do that to be truely meaningful.  That being said, this is by far Green Day's finest work.   <br /> <br />While it can be said that in their past few efforts, they sold out, they have not done that here.  Green Day is naturally progressing in age and intellect with their target audience.  While the sound certainly isn't necessarily very \\"punk,\\" the attitude certainly is.   <br /> <br />If you are the one person in America not to have bought this, buy it now!
B000028U0Y|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said about \\"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison,\\" which is one of the most impressive albums ever recorded. Johnny Cash was an American legend, and this album proved that he could indeed put on a heck of a live show, especially in front of a crowd of 2000 inmates. Not much else needs to be said, except that this is a fantastic album that belongs in anyone's collection of great music.<br /><br />Grade: A+

B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickelback is my favorite Rock band. The long road is one of my best rock albums, it was the first Nickelback album I get, all the songs here are good but the highlights are Someday, Figured You Out and Feelin' way too damn good. Figured You Out was No.1 on US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart for 13 weeks that made it the No.1 song in this chart at the year-end chart.<br /><br />The closing song \\"See you at the show\\", is the best choice to be the last song on the LP,...The meaning, the lyrics are all so cool.<br /><br />01. Flat on the floor 9,5/10 (Amazing but too short)<br /><br />02. Do this anymore 9,5/10 (THAT could be a single)<br /><br />03. Someday 10/10 (Maybe this song has the best Video I have ever seen)<br /><br />04. Believe it or not 9,5/10 (For another time, Chad and his lyrics are amazing on this track)<br /><br />05. Feelin' way too damn good 9/10 (Nice title, and an impressive chorus)<br /><br />06. Because of you 10/10 (I really love this song)<br /><br />07. Figured you out 10/10 (For a long time this song was my favorite, don't forget that was on No.1 of Billboard's Mainstream Rock for 13 weeks)<br /><br />08. Should 've listened 8,5/10 (The last chorus is really cool)<br /><br />09. Throw yourself away 9/10 (Oh my God, the most heavier sound on this LP)<br /><br />10. Another hole in the head 9/10 (Fast song, a track that reminds me late 80's)<br /><br />11. See you at the show 10/10 (Perfect meaning of what a closing song is)
B000BUYP4Q|3.0|The movie was awesome. I definately recommend the movie, but be wary of the 2 disc set. I had the same problem another reviewer had; the special features disc does nothing. It comes up with the WB logo, and some other legal jargon and then nothing. i have tried it on my DVD player, and two computers. even upon returning it for another copy, the second disc refuses to play.  <br />the movie really is great though, and this review is only a concern about the features disc technical errors. =^.^=

B000AP04FG|4.0|Well, this mix of action-romantic-comedy movie, is a good movie but not the greatest of these two actors.  My perception is that Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) was the powerful of the two, John Smith (Brad Pitt) was kind of soft and sensitive man, she was really a beaatch, she had feelings for him but she is more willing to forget what she feel for him, he was all love and kindness, she is smarter, more decided and powerful, anyway I love Angelina Jolie, and as a great fan, I liked the movie just for the sake of seeing her.  The movie is all fun, and if you think about it, marriage today is kind of Mr and Mrs Smith, isn't it?
B00006JJ51|5.0|I love this CD. The whole CD has a great beat, and a great contrast in all the MC's. <br />Whoever said that G-unit is  better then NWA is probably 12 years old. G-unit wouldn't be here without NWA, Snoop Dogg, and Dre. They started what hip-hop is.  <br />Nowadays hip-hop all has the same generic beat, with lame ass lyrics about nothing.
B00005JOGU|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Truman Capote in this film is amazing, but the film itself is just as interesting. Its story focuses on Capote from when he first learns of the Clutter murders to the publication of his book about them and their killers , IN COLD BLOOD. It shows him constantly at odds with himself, negotiating morally over how to deal with the real people involved in the crime. For the book to be good, Capote knows that he has to get close to everyone involved. Thus, he tries to balance a personal relationship with the killers, particularly Perry Smith, while also hoping the state will execute them so that his book has a true ending. Capote essentially drives himself mad trying to compromise being an impartial journalist and a sympathetic human being, but watching his descent is fascinating. As he continues writing IN COLD BLOOD, the movie shows us a contrast to his struggle, the rise in fame of Capote's childhood friend Harper Lee, played sharply by Catherine Keener. At times, the film is funny, uncompromisingly dark and always fascinating.
0380973839|5.0|I acquired my first copy of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" when I was in elementary school back in 1966.  My school library had a book fair and my parents had given me some money to spend, when I saw the \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", a paperback version with a cover showing a bright orange Mars against a black, star filled sky, a spaceship in orbit and the ominous face of a Martian superimposed on the planet's surface . . . I knew I had to have it.  As soon as I opened the book and began to read, I was hooked . . . forty years later and I'm still wandering through the deserted marble, crystal and glass cities that are scattered across the deserts of Ray Bradbury's Mars. <br /> <br />The 1960's were a wonderful time for anyone who was interested in space and science fiction, as I was.  The race for the Moon was in full swing,  Mercury, Geminii and then the Apollo missions were blasting off from Cape Canaveral every few months . . . it wasn't hard to imagine, as Ray Bradbury wrote in \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", humans traveling to and colonizing the Red Planet.  Also,  television was in it's golden era with shows like \\"Star Trek\\", \\"The Outer Limits\\",  and \\"The Twilight Zone\\", the future looked very bright and promising.  Sadly, the future hasn't quite turned out as I expected back then . . .but that's a story for another time and place. <br /> <br />\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is a wonderful book, but you will have to put some amount of effort (and imagination) into your reading to get the full benefit from it.  If you're interested in scientific and technical accuracy, and prefer the spectacular battles and special effects of \\"Star Wars\\", this may not be the book for you, this is more of a study of humanity set against the backdrop of a beautiful and mysterious alien world.  \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is really a collection of short stories that Ray Bradbury wrote, all of which revolve around the theme of humans leaving their own troubled planet (Earth) and attemptingto colonize Mars.   They find an advanced and mysterious civilization that is in it's twilight years, and the stories explore the encounters between . . . and ultimately,  the sad destinies of . . . the two alien races and their way of life.  <br /> <br />I consider Ray Bradbury to be one of the finest American writers, his ability to bring a story to life is unparalled.  When I read \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", it's as if  I'm actually walking through the courtyards of those ancient cities, I can feel the Martian sun on my face, hear the water bubbling in the fountains, and feel the loneliness and sadness of the lost Martians who still wander the marble pathways of those cities.  Whether it's an iridescent metallic Martian machine gliding through the orange and white sand dunes at night with the light of Mars' twin moons sparkling off of it, or a beautiful abandoned Martian city, the wind blowing leaves through the deserted streets with the sound of \\"dead beetles rattling in a skull\\", it's as if I were actually there. <br /> <br />The last chapter, \\"The Million Year Picnic\\",  is also one of the most haunting and beautiful, if not the best, chapters in the book.  Colonel John Wilder, in an effort to escape a violent and ultimately doomed Earth, brings his wife and three young sons to Mars to build a new life . . . and in the process come \\"face to face\\" with the \\"real\\" Martians.  A superb and moving ending to \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", it has some interesting and disturbing similarities to the state of humanity as it exists in 2005. <br /> <br />_______________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />     \\"The cities were deep-laid with granaries of silence, time  stored and kept, pools and fountains of quietude and memory. A crystal tower dropped into soft dusting rain. In shattering flights, stone animals with vast granite wings dived to strike the courtyards and fountains. Mars was dead.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Blue Bottle\\", Ray Bradbury 1950 <br /> <br />________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />No, Mr. Bradbury, not as long as I have \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" in my memory . . . Mars will never be dead.
B000BOH8XW|1.0|Honestamente ya no se que decir de una \\"artista\\" como Shakira. Es p&eacute;sima  cantante y su voz ahora ya no es igual a la del gallo Claudio, ahora intenta ser sexy, pero se queda en la voz de una persona que le estan apretando el cuello. Horrible CD, peor que el otro. Lo unico rescatable es la portada, Shakira es muy bella pero que no cante!
0425098478|1.0|I read all the business and management books that I can find and this is by far the worst I have ever seen.  The main character spends the entire book devoting his life to improving at his job after he makes a mediocre presentation to a client.  In the end he finally presents the results of all his hard work to his supervisor. When she reacts positively, he stammers \\"you mean you are not going to fire me?\\"  Are you kidding me?  He showed he is as dedicated an employee as there ever was and worked like crazy to get better at his job.  After all his dedication he ends up with very little self confidence.  And even worse, his boss replies, \\"I can't afford to fire you.\\" She jokes about how much they have invested in his training.  Unbelievably bad book, the writing is very sophmoric, and the overall message is one of self doubt, groveling, and low self confidence. Save your money and avoid this book!

B00003E480|1.0|Ok, I can't figure out every secret of how they did every illusion.<br /><br />Sure, I don't know how they create the illusion of levitation but having the lady start out in a glass cage with a lot of corn snakes bred to be different colors, milksnakes, ball pythons and other non-venomous snakes hardly creates an illusion of danger.<br /><br />Another one, a guy suspended in the air escapes from being tied up while 3 ropes suspending him \\"burn through\\".  Are we to believe that they would snap clean one at a time.  No sign of increasing tension until these ropes \\"burn through\\" and snap.<br /><br />I have to assume these are cables inside that release electronically.  Like we are to believe...<br /><br />a) a rope burns through in less than a minute<br />b) the ropes have any possibily of snapping clean one at a time<br />c) they will snap at just the correct moment right after he frees himself.<br /><br />The sword through the basket with the lady inside is obvious just poking through the edges not going near the middle!<br /><br />A few of the illusions wouldn't be illusions at all if the \\"audience\\" members were shills.  For example, \\"audience\\" members blindfold a magician and another \\"audience\\" member mixes knives (3 upside down and one point up) covered with a paper cover.  The magician then slams his hand on the 3 with the handle up.<br /><br />There is some that are not easily figured out but there is much too much obvious happenings in this.
B000002G89|4.0|Even though this was originally released in 1974 as his comeback album.  Several of the songs on this CD still sound fresh.  The best songs are Motherless Children, Let It Grow, and Mainline Florida.  These songs aren't as well known as some of the others, but overall make this CD one of my favorites from Eric Clapton!!!
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash's Prison Albums (Folsom & San Quentin) have long been the stuff of legend, but with the relatively recent release of Live At Madison Square Garden they form a remarkable trilogy: terrific live performances from '68,'69, and late '69, each with a different feel, and an evolution in each of the famous Johnny Cash-June Carter romance. At Folsom, they've yet to wed, at San Quentin, they have, and at Madison Square Garden, Cash proudly announces that June is home because she's pregnant with their son John Carter.      San Quentin stands as perhaps the best summation of these performances and this era, and what is all the more remarkable is how different it is from its Folsom Prison predecessor. There are but two songs overlapping the two (\\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" and \\"I Still Miss Someone\\") and the musical approach is significantly altered from the bare-bones, ragged-but-right stint at Folsom.  For starters, the band is much larger, with Bob Wootton standing in at lead guitar for the tragically deceased Luther Perkins, in addition to the great rockabilly embellishments of Carl Perkins. The Statler Brothers join in on backing vocals, as do the Carter Sisters (providing an unbelievable trumpet imitation on \\"Ring of Fire\\").  This results in more fluid performances (no laughs in the middle of a line here), though the atmosphere is still about as volatile as Folsom Prison.  This leads to some priceless between-song comedy (\\"If any of the guards are still speakin' to me...\\" and in response to the inmates jeering said guard, \\"Oh, you don't really mean that.\\"), and with the dual performances of \\"San Quentin\\", the feeling that there could really be a riot.      Virtually everything there is to love about Cash can be found on this album.  The songs display his reverence for contemporary songwriters (the Dylan-penned \\"Wanted Man\\" and John Sebastian's \\"Darlin' Companion\\"), his deeply authentic faith (\\"He Turned The Water Into Wine\\"), and his remarkable ability to sing for,rather than to, his audience (the aforementioned \\"San Quentin\\" and \\"Starkville City Jail\\").  More casual fans will be glad to see the presence of several Cash classics, including \\"Big River\\", \\"I Walk The Line\\", \\"Ring Of Fire\\", and the then-new \\"Daddy Sang Bass\\" and \\"A Boy Named Sue\\".  For \\"Sue\\" fans, be sure to check out Live At Madison Square Garden for Cash doing a hilarious play on the bleeped/unbleeped versions of the song.       Johnny Cash At San Quentin has proved to be one of the most replayable discs in my collection.  It's an essential purchase for the Cash fan and an ideal indoctrination for the Cash newcomer.
B00005ASIL|3.0|I have been a fan of JT for many years.  This very best collection was missing some of the songs that I expected to be on here.  Songs such as Cross-Eyed Mary, and Skating Away should have been included.  Some of these \\"very best\\" songs I have never even heard.  Oh, well at least Aqualung and Bungle In The Jungle are here.  This could have been better...the editing and the quality of the CD isn't the best...But, it's still Jethro Tull.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Eeeeeewwww Maroah is so fat madonna looks still great and isnt fat go madonna!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I admit, I always viewed Madonna as a Has Been. Everyone knows her biggest hits. The infamous \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Vogue\\" ecco whenever the 80s are mentioned. It wasn't until I discovered her newer stuff like Ray of Light and Music that I really viewed Madonna as an artist, a woman with a brain.    I also admit that I've succumbed to dance fever over the past year. I mean, with people like Goldfrapp and Ryksopp forging a new name for European dance and techno, dance music is the best its been since a long time. Confessions on a Dance Floor completely hits the mark for a good dance album. Sure, it's pure pulp. The album exists as its own entity. It doesn't bill itself as revelatory. Nostalgia is the theme here. And how fantastic it is!    1.) \\"Hung Up\\"    An amazingly catchy tune. Madonna utilizes the ABBA sample perfectly. It's able to dominate the song, making it a perfect homage to one of dance history's most prolific artists, and yet it so screams of 2005, with its pulsing base and driving beat. Catchy.    2.) \\"Get Together\\"    Though produced well, I don't find this song very aesthetically pleasing. It's not what I personally look for in a song. Effects are used perfectly, but it's not the most immediate song, and compared to the immediacy of the other album tracks, it feels out of place. It's a great transition, however, between the pulsing first track to the the third, \\"Sorry.\\"    3.) \\"Sorry\\"    Hypnotic! The spoken intro adds a great facet to this song. Upon its completion, a driving edited voice chanting \\"I've heard it all before\\" introduces the feel of the song. It drives the song along its tracks. As the song draws to an end, more spoken lines are followed by the same chanting chorus, which closes out the track. Fantastic. It will make a great single.    4.) \\"Future Lover\\"    This song shows how vocal editing can improve a song. A chuggling, mellow bass is punctuated by a highly melodic anthem - \\"In the evidence of its brilliance.\\" Themelody shows emotion, and reflects the theme of the song. There's something mystical about it.    5.) \\"I Love New York\\"    Ok, I'm sorry.... people REALLY need to stop knocking this track. There is so much more to it than its given credit. I must start with the lyrics. This song could simply not exist without the lyrics being as they are. They're simple, possessing few syllables, allowing them to flow effortlessly with the music. Sure, who cares if she rhymes \\"New York\\" with \\"dork\\" and \\"sleep\\" with \\"keep.\\" (Ooh, I can rhyme \\"critic\\" with \\"parasitic!\\")    And now the music. This song progresses well. Early on, it's driven by an acoustic guitar, quit similar to the way Stevie Nicks on \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" and Destiny's Child on \\"Bootylicious\\" used that addictive, repetitious guitar riff. It surges on, and recalls the fast cars, neon lights, and endless eye candy that is New York City at night. The melody of the chorus is sickeningly addicting, especially the way it lowers in tone. And I must say, the transition between \\"Future Lover\\" and \\"I Love New York\\" is the best transition on the album!    6.) \\"Let It Will Be\\"    Decent song. Always moves forward. Not really my favorite. I find it a tad boring. Same thing as with \\"Get Together.\\" It's a good song, just not what I personally like.    7.) \\"Forbidden Love\\"    Again, computer editing makes the vocals interesting, and the melody is mystical. The percolating synths highlight the bass. Good track.    8.) \\"Jump\\"    A dance-pop tour de force here!!! Arguably my favorite track on the album. The same percolating synth mentioned in \\"Forbidden Love\\" transitions this song. The formula for this song is reminiscent of \\"Crazy for You.\\" Madonna's vocals start out low and mellow, but after a quick bridge, the tone completely changes. She calls out for anyone who has the courage to take the plunge with her. She offers her hand as support. The melody has great optimistic emotion. For anyone who likes to take risks and go for it, hereis your anthem.    9.) \\"How High\\"    This may be the most blatant confession that Madonna has to share. The song is basically Madonna having a conversation with herself, posing questions like \\"How did I earn it?\\" and \\"Does this get any better?\\" and \\"Should I carry on? Will this matter when I'm gone?\\" She's completely aware of her fame, but her deeper, more thoughtful side asks about the future.... the beyond... when she's gone. What will her success be? Just a name? Is she the queen over some pop dynasty? Or will she fade into obscurity? Who knows! I don't think even Madonna knows. It seems Madonna knows the answers to her own questions.    Ok, apart from that, this is addicting music! The edited voice in the beginning sets the tone of the song. It surges along, and lets the music creep up from behind. Listen to this song in your car, at night, lots of city lights around you - it's where I first heard it. You can almost see the lights around you shine \\"Madonna\\" as you go by.    10.) \\"Isaac\\"    This is Music meets Ray of Light. Combining the ethereal and spiritual with the secular and the worldly. Israeli singer Sinwani highlights Madonna's chanting, and the music reflects Semitic themes. I really like  it. It's not really an track I would choose to dance to. However, it's excellent on its own merits, especially the spiritual interlude by Sinwani at the end of the track. One of the best musical accomplishments of the album, especially with the strings in the background.    11.) \\"Push\\"    See \\"Get Together.\\" Commendable, but not for me. I tend to skip this song to the very end, only because I like the transition between here and the final track.    12.) \\"Like It Or Not\\"    This is a pulsing finale, and Madonna's testament to her detractors that she could serious care less about what they think of her. With all the surging and hardcore rhythms of this album, \\"Like It Or Not\\" is the antidote. It's certainly the most mellow. I really like how Madonna's singing interplayswith the odd beat and rhythm. Notice the nuance between the downbeat. Sometimes it sounds like a clap, sometimes like a sharp stomp. Nice touch. This is among my favorite songs on the album. The lyrics are mildly scandalous, with the Garden of Eden references. I like it! And as someone pointed out before me, notice how the track and the album closes out with acoustic guitar. Great touch, and its a testament to its modernity.    --------------    There you have it. My breakdown of the album. And you know, you can like it, or you can dislike it. I'll quote Madonna in this case: \\"If you don't like my attitude, then you can f off.... just go to Texas - isn't that where they golf?\\"  *licks finger and touches your shoulder* ***TSSSSSSSSS!***  Oh, you got BURNED!
0385507755|5.0|Nearly everyone in my family (and I have a very large family) is addicted to a substance, whether it be heroin, alcohol, or model airplane glue. Never have I been able to deal with this fact--even when using substances myself--until I read this book.  <br /> <br />\\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" whether it is completely true or entirely fictional, is an exact experience. The novelization of addiction is pure, simple, and overwhelmingly powerful. This book can and will change lives.
B00004R7TP|3.0|Dipper wishes he was Tori Amos' lovenubbin. Dipper thinks about Tori playing her piano alot. A REAL lot. Imagine my surprise when, at a recent party with some of the hippie weirdos (isn't that repetitive?) in semi-frozen Medusa (we have our share of nuts), this CD was spun and I began gyrating and shakin' my rumpus maximus to the sounds of Tori playing \\"Cloudbusting\\" (Dipper would really, really, really, really like to bust Tori's cloud)! It was quite a sight! I did the Rumba Rumba Tribal Dance similar to Bluto in Animal House and received a standing ovation from the hippies before trying to find out the name of this new masterpiece by my porcine loving princess Tori. Much to my amazement, it was not Tori that I heard, but this old chick named Kate Bush! I wondered if she is related to Laura Bush (speaking of Napalm Hot Rumba Rumba!!!!)? Marilyn the She-Jay (looks more like Manson than Monroe and smells worse than a Mississippi mud bog in August) pulled out the CD again and played the title cut to prove my error while I googled at the cover! Rumba Rumba, sort of. Kate is not nearly as purty as Tori, but would not get kicked out of the Dipper Love Shack for eating potato chips. I then started to think of Tori again and wondered how it was possible that Kate Bush copied Tori Amos in 1985. This sounds like an episode of Quantum Leap. Mmmmmmmm, ziggies.......<br /><br />I found this CD shortly after in the Bargain Bin at the local record shop and picked it up. I will keep it because Kate still reminds me no end of Tori. Now if only Kate could dye her hair red and slink all over a piano after losing about 25 years. THAT would be heaven for The Dipper.
B000053V7O|5.0|Round Midnight is the most delicate, sensitive and deep movie I've ever watched.  <br />It's a movie that goes much beyond jazz and musicians.  <br />It's a movie about love, about the possibilities, about us, human beigns.  <br />And amazingly played by two INCREDIBLE actors: Dexter Gordon and Franois Cluzet. Dexter Gordon was a special human being, he was an angel. I really belive this. It was up to Bertrand Tavernier to see it and he did. That's why the movie is a masterpiece, it's a combination of untouchble and unique souls.

B00004BZ0V|5.0|When I think about life-changing events in my life, I would honestly put down throwing this particular disc in my cd player and listening to it for the first time as one of them. The Clash quickly became my favorite band and from them I got into all kinds of punk, reggae, ska, \\"alternative rock\\", soul, rap and rockabilly. My interest in politics and how it be conveyed through music also came from The Clash.     This \\"Singles\\" album is great. It covers material from their entire career and is perfect for a casual fan of rock and roll who's interested in hearing some of what this band has to offer. By buying this album, you're in no way going to spoil the rest of their catalogue. Each and every album has some phenomenal tunes not found on here (\\"Death Or Glory\\", \\"Safe European Home\\", \\"Police On My Back\\" to name a few).     If you were looking to get further into the band and you had already gotten this album, just make sure to get the UK version of the self-titled first album as the US version contains songs already on this 'Singles' album.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Easily one of Burton's very best movies and frequently overlooked because of its small scale. Depp has never been better, (which is saying something), as the relentlessly optimistic and talentless aspiring director who wants nothing more from life than the joy of making movies. His innocence and ineptitude are both touching and persuasive, gradually he builds his team of like-minded losers, dope-fiends, homosexuals, hucksters, and has-beens. Together they embark upon one crack-pot adventure after another, putting together staggeringly awful films with scotch tape, glue, rubber bands, and moxie.<br /><br />The whole thing is just so much fun, and so endearing. Much has been said about Martin Landau's portrayal of Bella Lugosi and he deserves it, it's dazzling. He and Depp, (and the illusory nature of their friendship), epitomize the very essence of Hollywood, a place where demented dreams are coin of the realm and sanity is defined as the moment when two or more people share the same twisted delusion.<br /><br />Many great supporting performances, especially Patricia Arquette who is infinitely more appealing than her sister. In lesser hands this would have been a mean-spirited movie. But Burton so clearly loves his characters, and sympathizes with them, that the audience does as well. A treat.
B000002BSG|5.0|the first time I heard jamiroquai was in my brothers room, he was jammin out to Synkronized. i was impressed but the initial effect hadn't taken yet.  A couple years ago I had the opportunity to go on an exchange trip to DEUTSCHLAND!!!!! while I was staying at tom's house i heard traveling without moving for the first time!  amazing, the reggae inspired funk vibes blew me away.  this was and still is by far my fave!  not to take anything away from their other albums including the new one dynomite, but I guess that being in europe hangin and partying with all the cool guys and gals while listinging to T.W.M. was enough to leave a lasting impression.  If ever you get the chance to go to europe do it, and may jamiroquai be right there with you...
B0007ZIYWY|5.0|Long time SY fan here. I own and love all of their output from the past 24+ years they've been around (Including all SYR releases, side-projects, solo projects, soundtracks, etc.) All great great stuff, I love them to death. The DIRTY deluxe edition was excellent, and the same goes for the legendary GOO. And much like the DIRTY reissue, the remastered classic is almost just a bonus along side the wonderful b-sides/outtakes/demos from this era. I would usually be put off by re-issued and remastered albums being released, but SY does them really well and make it worth your money. I hear that a re-release of their hard to find very first 1982 self-titled album is on it's way for re-issuing, as well as their 1989 side-project \\"The Whitey Album\\" done under the alias of Ciccone Youth is also rumored to be re-issued. And thankfully a brand new LP due out sometime in 2006! I can't wait!
B00005JO04|1.0|OK if you like to watch CNN and could make a boring (I mean I think more than half the audience I was with fell asleep, they were sleeping through the credits at the end and people had to wake them up) movie about oil and corruption. OK good thought went into the story but time drug like a doctor office waiting room. I give it 1 star because I see to many of you gave it 4-5 stars. I don't think i could get through this again,,  <br /> <br />Lord of War was much better and more entertaining, this is  Docutainment I would have rather watched the history channel!!
B000AWYOG4|2.0|Once upon a time, one Japanese horror film translated successfully into a Hollywood production (The Ring, i.e. Ringu).  This film's popularity made many American producers rich, and they were convinced they had founded the new age of Horror in the United States with this formula.  Since then, Hollywood has made three more attempts at reproducing this early success; first by importing and subtitling Ju-on, then remaking The Grudge and now Dark Water.  Dark water is by far the most boring of these three ghost story failures. <br /> <br />Oooh, that's harsh you say?  Let's see, in order for a Horror film to be any good it has to be, at the very least, interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention.  The director seems to hope that heavily filtered, moody cinematography will do that job instead of good old-fashioned storytelling.  With a very slow pace and a forgettable story (which I won't bother with), Dark Water loses the audience quickly.  The \\"gotcha\\" moments, when they do arrive, lack that visceral impact which Horror fans live for.  About halfway through I just stopped caring for the characters' fates and wished the ghost would push them all into the river or something so that it would be over. <br /> <br />Sadly, the crown jewel of Dark Water is the critically acclaimed actress Jennifer Connelly.  She is largely wasted here, although she does a fair job with the material she's been given to work with.  If you're madly in love with Jennifer, I should inform you now that she is shot though so much atmospheric filterage that her gorgeousness is dulled with a dark greenish cast.  And as for you lustful ones, she isn't revealing much skin in this flick, either.  <br /> <br /> Please, can this one be the last of this tired Horror subgenre? <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />
B00005R2M3|5.0|That's all I have to say: great songs! Just bought this CD? I suggest listening to track 8 first.  Then go on to tracks 6, 3/12, and 1/13. At least those are my favourites. But all of them are great (I know I'm saying that a lot!)
B000002UR7|4.0|Radiohead's first three albums trump the rest of the catalog by a long shot, Pablohoney included. They showcase radiohead as the band it should always be, a guitar band. Creep might be one of their worst songs ever. But the rest of this album is really solid. The guitar work is magnificent, and the whole album is full of good songwriting and tight hooks. As far as debuts go, most people would give their right arms for an album like this. As it stands, it lands somewhere in the middle of radiohead's best. And it should land somewhere in the middle of yours as well.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is an excellent film that I think everyone should go and see whether you're straight or not. This compelling story succeeds in every possible way. Both lead actors give fantastic and mesmerizing performances that really grabs your heart and soul. A great script and a great director is also on the mantle and the supporting cast is just as good and shine on their own. This movie is not for everybody. People with short attention spand will not benefit from the rewards that this film brings which among other things it is a great piece of filmmaking. Men who consider themselves the \\"macho\\" type will find this movie offensive and disgraceful and will never realize that they are missing the whole point to the movie. Love can grow out of nowhere and with anyone. I highly recommend this film it is one that teaches us a lesson and makes you think long after the end credits are rolling on the screen. A beautiful film all around which boosts a beautiful and natural scenery that you will find to your enjoyment. If you care about films that are compelling and controversial because of its subject matter and excellence in acting you cannot miss this movie. It is nominated for seven Golden Globes including Best Picture and I am almost positive that it will receive a handful of Oscar nods as well. Brokeback Mountain is a gem of a movie one that really makes you think and analyze things and you will find this film is a story that is very much a part of the society that we live in because this sort of thing happens more often that we tend to think. Go see this film and you will not be disappointed trust me.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This movie is a touch of action and love.  It is much better than the origanal.  If you haven't seen it than spoil yourself and see it right now.  It may seem lengthy being 3 hours but the timeing is perfect.  This is a 5 star movie, maybe the best of the year!
B000002TQV|5.0|I'll be honest, I was never really into Radiohead. It was only until recently, when my Radiohead-head suitemate Sim introduced me to \\"The Bends\\" that I finally caught on to their greatness. EVERY track (except for probably \\"Bones\\") is either great or very good (with \\"Planet Telex\\" being a monster of a song). You might not like it on the first listen, but after listening to it several times you'll begin to see the greatness underneath (except for \\"Planet Telex\\", which is extremely catchy, the songs don't hit you at first, but it turns out that this isn't a bad thing at all). It's a very emotional album, and every time I listen to \\"Planet Telex\\" I get the greatest goosebumps. Thom Yorke does an outstanding job with his much-imitated vocal style as he greatly enhances every song in which he sings. It's most certainly a plus that every song here also happens to be very well-written and produced. As an historically important and influential album and one that true lovers of music will love (and I'm sure others will like it, too) this is just a fantastic album to own! Absolutely recommended!     Highlights include:   everything except probably \\"Bones\\"
B000AP04FG|3.0|Two super-assassins who work for rival agencies just happen to fall for each other, get married, and carve out their own little veiled niche in conservative suburbia.  Six years pass by and they never discover their respective identities.  Please, stop me when this sounds ridiculous.  Early on in this film I was rolling my eyes and searching for anything credible in this outlandish yarn to hang my proverbial hat on.  Alas, this is a Hollywood film through and through.  Big stars, big explosions, exciting \\"Alias\\"-style getaways and fight scenes.  After about twenty minutes into this forced epilepsy it occurred to me to shut off my brain and just try to enjoy the film.  After that breakthrough decision, the film flowed by virtually unnoticed.  Well, I didn't hate the movie, but I have seen all of this generic filmmaking before.  However, the two lead actors (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) show tremendous chemistry and they somehow manage to keep this listing vessel afloat regardless of my many protestations.  Brad Pitt, in particular, shows as much charm and power and gravitas as any actor could with this type of overblown character.  Angelina Jolie has her moments, as well, but mostly she plays off of Brad Pitt and his scene-stealing gesticulations and playful looks.  When all is said and written, this movie retains the dubious moniker of a \\"decent rental\\" and nothing more.  Not bad...but not great either.
0385507755|1.0|I just don't buy his story, and wish I hadn't bought his book.  <br /> <br />Frey tosses in details for \\"authenticity,\\" but often they don't click. Half an hour after finding myself on the Crayola web site looking for proof that Razzle Dazzle Rose wasn't in the 64 pack in the early 90s (really, I don't care about crayons, but somehow this detail was my breaking point), I bailed on the book entirely. I can handle a little fiction in my creative nonfiction, but with the narrator going on about integrity and honor so much, I can't swallow half-truths.  <br />
0307276902|5.0|\\"A million little pieces\\" is the story of James Frey, and his 6 weeks in rehab. We enter the story when James wakes up, finds himself on a plane with no idea of its destination, his clothes soaked in a mix of snot, urine, blood, and vomit, his four front teeth are missing and he has a hole in his cheek... He has, at the age of 23, almost destroyed his body due drugs and alcohol abuse.<br /><br />\\"A million little pieces\\" is James' memoir, but it reads like a novel. His writing is simple and direct, yet beautiful and elegant. His economic writing style, the staccato way of expressing himself, adds an interesting angle to it.<br /><br />The book had my attention from the preface to the very last page. The author has this amazing ability to grab the reader's attention and hold on to it. When reading this book, I was a part of it. I was there; I could feel the emotions of each of the characters. And when they suffered, I suffered. Reading the part when James went to the dentist was almost unbearable - and the only place in the book I was even remotely tempted to skip a few lines...<br /><br />This is, bar none, one of the best books I've ever read, and I will never forget it! I read it in 50 page gulps - a compelling read.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000089CJI|3.0|Existing somewhere between the musical and lyrical quirkiness of Komeda or Chumbawamba and the trip-hop funkadelic stylings of Massive Attack, you'll find The Postal Service. Perhaps this cross-breeding equals an original beast; though it is, in the very least, a melodical and rhythmic experience that you will enjoy. It  might not fatten up your top ten list, but I think you'll find that The Postal Service delivers!
B000002J1S|5.0|This double album must of been a chore to make, since it sent Peter Gabriel out of the band.  Everything before works up to it as classics, and the two after were good too.  But once Steve Hacket left the band it became to comercial for myself and really was not the begining, thus Genesis is the begining and which will never be again.  Many classics and great experimentation with sound.  Simply amazing as the turing point in this band became the Lamb Lies down on Broadway.  Genesis from the day on, lied down.
B000003TSP|5.0|Let it be known that this album is extremely dark and haunting (don't listen if you're depressed!). The album starts off with a 1-2-3 punch that pretty much trumps the rest of the album - the rest isn't terrible, but they aren't as easily accessible as the first three (they'll grow on you). It does make pretty good background music (on low volume), though. The singer definitely matches the style of music here, as I would claim that most people will like her (she's very haunting). Thankfully the lyrics are also pretty good and dark here - basically everything about the album contributes to its dark undertone. All in all it's a very creative and inspired trip-hop album that I think the first three songs make into a classic! Fans of this album should definitely check out their first album \\"Dummy\\" as well as Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\" and especially \\"Mezzanine\\". Absolutely recommended!  <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />\\"Cowboys\\"  <br />\\"All Mine\\"  <br />\\"Undenied\\"  <br />\\"Over\\"  <br />\\"Humming\\" (parts of)  <br />the rest are good, too
B00008G8M4|4.0|To someone that gave it one star and would wonder how \\"the masses\\" think this movie is good: Since SO MANY people like this movie and YOU don't, did you ever stop to think that it may be YOU who is wrong on this one? <br /> <br />Look, I'll give you the fact that it's not a deep, meaningfull, piece of art. But if you go into watching it that way, then you've got the problem. <br /> <br />If you saw a preview, the ads make it perfectly clear: this is a movie where aliens come down and blow suff up. PERIOD. duh. <br /> <br />Yes, we don't really care about the characters (espescially the kid in the baseball cap - I think that character is a movie pre-requisite, even though it's so annoying). Yes, the story is simple and in many cases predictable. But you don't go on a roller coaster ride because the seats are comfortable. <br /> <br />Stuff blows up. Stuff blows up a lot. And it is good. It's pure mindless fun. If that's not \\"mature\\" enough for you, then you would bewrong to think that it would be. You don't turn on a rock and roll radio station hoping to hear Beethoven. <br /> <br />By the way, to all of those who are reading this: All the other reviews on this movie are POSITIVE. Except for that one guy. Just for the fun of it, go see all his other reviews. Guess what?!? He hates EVERYTHING! 7 out of 7 movies! He even goes so far as to give ID4 a bad review two different times! Plus, notice how all of the movies he reviews and doesn't like fall into the mindless fun thrillride catagory. Who would listen to a guy who hates these kinds of movies but takes the time to watch them and review them?!? <br /> <br />If MILLIONS of people around the world like this movie but one does not (and they don't like any movies of these kind), then they're the ones who don't get it. <br /> <br />Buy it. It's innexpensive here on Amazon. You'll enjoy it.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|Through all the hype for this movie, you constantly hear about Peter Jackson's encyclopedic knowledge and love of the original 1933 classic film. That's why it's amazing to see how much he didn't learn from the original Kong. In 1933, the producers and screenwriters worked very hard to eliminate anything from the script that proved superfluous or impeded the flow of the action.  (That's the primary reason why the legendary \\"spider sequence\\" was removed from the original King Kong.) The tight pace of the action is what makes the original Kong so great. This new film is loaded with unnecessary bloat -- and lots of overdone effects just to please the people who like that sort of thing.  In short, this film is a big disappointment and I was expecting much better.
B00005JNTX|2.0|I got the dvd as a gift and with all of these teen movie actors in the film (Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, etc.), I was expecting something completely different. I was expecting something light-hearted and silly, but Sin City is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. There are some amazing visuals, but they're so shocking and brutal. Lots of nudity, blood, gore, violence. It was too much for me. <br /> <br />I guess the storylines are interesting and there's lots of interlacing and they tie together near the end. Some of the storylines are somewhat trite and not that intriguing <br /> <br />If you're really into visual violence and fantasy, this is a good movie. But definitely don't watch it if you're under 17 or if you can't stand the sight of blood.
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought this album about a year ago after hearing the song \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio. I would have never imagined that this would become one my favourite albums! It contains some really cathy  tracks, good for the car or just to break the ice at a party. Overall a great album! Would not hesitate to buy this again.
B00005V1B2|5.0|This band made some great music for the progressive rock listeners.  The guitar is similar to Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, but slightly different.  The keyborads of Peter Bardens compliments the writing.  All the albums are very good, but this one is in the era of the best ones.
B00008BRBG|5.0|I'll admit that I didn't really like this album when I first got it. I already owned and loved \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" along with \\"Synchronicity\\", so it was a little hard to make the jump to \\"Outlandos\\". The reason for this was because the songs are generally harder to get into as most of them aren't as instantly catchy as \\"Every Breath You Take\\" or \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" (though \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" obviously are). Sting's voice is the weakest on this particular album, but it's still great and very likable. The lyrics are, as usual, well-written, catchy and very memorable. The production is decent here, but the CD could use a good remastering. As for the songs, they're mostly growers - I hated the first 4 songs on here, but after a while I finally got into them (they're more interesting than fun, arguably). Overall, if you're looking for a great Police album or one that will stand the test of time then \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" will greatly satisfy you. Absolutely recommended! <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />\\"Roxanne\\"  <br />\\"Hole In My Life\\"  <br />\\"Peanuts\\"  <br />\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\"  <br />\\"Be My Girl -- Sally\\" <br />the rest is great, too
B000683VI4|2.0|In my review of the novel, I described the story as:<br /><br />\\"Noah Calhoun is a thirty-something, World War II Veteran who has reached a level of financial security by doing all of the right things.  Working hard.  Being honest.  Loving his parents.  Fighting for his country in a time of war.  Allie Nelson is a beautiful southern belle who has a tender, loving heart and who comes from a family that is as much concerned with social status as anything else.  Noah and Allie have little in common except for a few weeks they spent together during one magic summer a decade and a half earlier.<br /><br />Now, after the end of fighting the European and Pacific theatres, Allie is engaged to a socialite lawyer and Noah has purchased and restored an old house that holds his memories of the one woman he has ever truly loved.  By chance only a few weeks before she is to be married, Allie sees a newspaper story about Noah who has returned to New Bern, North Carolina.  At the moment she sees the feature, she knows that she must see Noah just one more time either to exorcise the ghosts from her past or to restore the love that she and Noah once briefly shared.<br /><br />Framed around the memories of a mysterious retirement home resident who tells a story to another resident of the home of love found, lost, and found from a notebook, `The Notebook' is not short on salubrious emotion.  Occasionally a little campy, `The Notebook' is a cross between well-conceived, well-written contemporary fiction and a sentimental romance novel.  The results are enchanting.\\"<br /><br />As enjoyable as the book is, and even taking into account that the film adaptation of a book is rarely as good as the book, the movie version of `The Notebook' is not good.<br /><br />While Rachel McAdams' portrayal of Allie Hamilton was fair and McAdams is very nice to watch, the other performances ranged from very ordinary to poor.  Ryan Gosling is oafish as Noah Calhoun, and the performances from Gina Rowlands as Allie Calhoun, James Garner as an aged Noah, and Joan Allen as Allie's mother, Anne, appeared to be \\"phoned in.\\"  It's as if Nick Cassevetes and the entire production team for the film hurriedly had a script written, hired a few name actors, filmed a take or two for each scene, and rushed the raw footage through editing in a vain attempt to take advantage of the popularity of Nicholas Sparks' novel.  In fact, it's difficult to determine whether Rowlands, Garner, and Joan Allen were poorly directed, whether the screen play was just that bad, or whether Cassavetes just did not care.<br /><br />It's sort of a shame because the novel was fun, but this one's a stinker.ed Noah, and Joan Allen as Allie's mother, Anne, appeared to be \\"phoned in.\\"  It's as if Nick Cassevetes and the entire production team for the film hurriedly had a script written, hired a few name actors, filmed a take or two for each scene, and rushed the raw footage through editing in a vain attempt to take advantage of the popularity of Nicholas Sparks' novel.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|It seems a given that most fans of the original King Kong movie with Fay Wray were asking, Why?  Why remake a classic movie that, in spite of the limited technology, was an absolutely marvelous monster picture.  Of course, many of us were children when we saw the original, and we were more easily awed in those days, and it is a sentimental favorite.  Although nothing will quite equal that black & white thriller, Jackson has convinced some of us that it could be re-done almost as well. <br /> <br />The action is non-stop, beginning with the escape from New York to the foundering on Skull Island, to fighting dinosaurs and other creatures.  A few things could have been trimmed or cut altogether and the movie would not have suffered -- maybe even been better.  Such scenes as the original encounter with the natives, where brutality was a bit overdone.  Or Kong's fights with so many different monsters.  And his final island fight with the bats with which he must have been living harmoniously before the arrival of humans.  Bets are that many people closed their eyes on the scene at the bottom of the cliff. <br /> <br />The casting was marvelous, even Jack Black as Denham.  The romance between Jack Driscoll and Ann Darrow was -- well -- romantic.  The CGI was well done, although as some have already stated, not entirely seamless.  Still, the monsters were believable and Kong himself a totally sympathetic character. <br /> <br />This is a movie well worth seeing, lots of fun, with all of the things we go to movies to experience.  Enjoy it, then rent the original, just to see where it all came from.
B000060OFT|5.0|I loved this movie.  <br /> <br />It's definitely not a classic portrayal of Shakespeare, but the way the Romeo and Juliet story is shown is so much more intriguing. It's a modern setting with the same Shakespearan language. I've seen this film many times and there's so much going on that I never get sick of it. Other reviews say that this portrayal is ludricous and just absurd, but I think it's clever and interesting. Think Westside Story with more energy and darkness. It's a different retelling and maybe it's not as \\"classical\\" as many purists would want, but it certainly is interesting. <br /> <br />I think Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are great in this movie. They're great as these two star-crossed lovers who are conflicted between family obligation and love. They're young and youthful and do a great job. The only thing that bothered me was that Juliet's mother seems to change completely overnight. First, she's crazy and frantic and the next, she's subdued and proper. It's a minor detail and you probably won't even notice it. <br /> <br />It's a fresh, more youthful interpretation and teenage viewers will probably like it more, but everyone should see it at least once. Just to see a different interpretation of a classic story. <br />Great movie.
1401308201|3.0|I got this book for a good friend of mine, who, like me, is a big fan of Wicked. I'm not the candle carrying-Idina worshipping type, but I like it alot. <br />Anyways, <br />I was somewhat impressed and somewhat disappointed by the book. <br />Good things: <br />There are some great interviews, and being a fan of stage make-up techniques, the \\"greening of elphaba\\" was pretty interesting to me.  Also, the book is very nicely put together, but I would say wait until it goes down to $20 or $15 before you buy it. <br />The Bad things: <br />There was a deffinate lack of new material: any big fan of Wicked has seen most of these photos before, and the information has been either read or seen on television specials. I hate to say it, but I think this was put together 'just in time for christmas' to cash in on the Wicked fans.  <br />Summary: <br />I am still up in the air: I own the Lord of the Rings behind-the-scenes-book, and not only is it an interesting read, it's also a reference for costuming, make-up, special effects, ect. I find that this book is nice...but that's about it. If you want to give a nice gift to a Wicked fan, this might be what you're looking for, but if they are a HUGE fan, I think that in the long run, you'll be somewhat disappointed. <br /> By the Way: <br />I've noticed a dissatisfaction with the lack of the libretto: It can be found (for free) at this website: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />and can be printed, with a laser printer, in about 7 1/2 minutes and bound in about 3 at your local Kinko's for about $5.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|This movie, directed by Michael Mann, is all surfaces. I looked forward to learning something about Mohammed Ali, about whom I knew nothing, so it was disappointing to find this film to be more like a music video (or string of them) than a biopic.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the performances. Will Smith is fine; sometimes his resemblance to Ali is almost creepy. But, beyond depth, the movie lacks connective tissue. It's one damn thing after another. You don't feel a why behind anything. Ali becomes a fighter. Why? He converts to Islam. Why? Etc.<br /><br />So I don't especially recommend it. But if you have the remotest interest in Ali, do see When We Were Kings; this is a terrific documentary about the Ali/Foreman fight in Zaire.
B000001F3C|5.0|I'll admit that the first couple times I heard \\"War\\" the only songs I liked were the first four. After youve listened to it for a while, though, the songs definitely grow on you. I think part of this was because Bono's voice, even though it's pretty incredible most of the time, becomes a little questionable in certain songs (see \\"Drowning Man\\" for an example). However, if you listen to the songs enough then you begin to understand that it actually tends to work with the lyrics. The lyrics are about the troubles of war, and Bono sings, especially in the song I mentioned, like someone who's wailing or crying - it definitely works with the material given. Most people only know the two hits off this album (\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\"), and while those are classic songs the rest are just as good. The lyrics are especially interesting, memorable and deep - \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" being the best example, I'd argue. Musically no other band sounds like U2, and considering this came out in the 80's one can see how influential this album was. Bono's voice might not be for everyone on some of the songs, but those with an open mind will be able to look past that. All in all I'd say that this is another U2 classic and one that most people should really enjoy! Absolutely recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />\\"the first four tracks, but the rest are good, too
B000BIOGV0|5.0|This album has most of Blondie's best hits, all of Blondie's songs are great but i dont think that many could be on one \\"Greatest Hits\\" contemplation....The songs on this album are shortend which is a downside, Blondie's hits need to be in the normal state that they were sang (instead of  shortend \\"Atomic\\" needs to be like it is on \\"Eat To The Beat\\")Blondie is at thier best when the songs are in long versions or original verions. The Remixes are Great! exept that the originals of the remixes need to be on this album!! <br /> <br />The music videos are awsome!!i haven't saw the \\"Eat To The Beat\\" videos so i can't compare the two. But overall this is a must for Blondie fans!
B000000H3Z|5.0|Being a metal fan from way back in the day (I had Show No Mercy & Kill 'Em All on vinyl back when they 1st came out in 1983), I will admit that I wasn't impressed at all by Sepultura's 1st 2 releases (well, they were both E.P.'s) \\"Morbid Visions\\" & \\"Bestial Devastation\\".  In fact, I thought that they were pretty awful to be honest.<br /><br />But that all changed when their 1987 release \\"Schizophrenia\\" was released, quickly making me a fan.  They had gotten a new lead guitarist & had really made some improvements on the musicianship front since I had last heard any of their stuff. This still ranks as one of my favorite thrash (well, actually more early death thrash) albums of all time.<br /><br />Then in 1989, they would release the album that would set the entire metal world on its collective ear: \\"Beneath the Remains\\". This album blew me away even more than Schizophrenia did and found the band fine tuning their own distinct sound while also adding a damn find sounding production/mix that really made the music jump out at the listener.<br /><br />It's almost like they had asorbed everything that had gone on in the world of metal up to this point and put it all through a filter that made all metal fans sit up and take proper notice.<br /><br />While some might argue that the album might lack some variety compared to their next 2 releases \\"Arise\\" and \\"Choas A.D.\\", those people are completely missing the point of \\"Beneath the Remains\\".  Those are 2 equally great albums, but Beneath the Remains will always be my favorite Sepultura release.<br /><br />Sure, Max's voice might not yet be quite what it became on  subsequent releases, but it still has a punch and attitude that is just great, plus you can understand what he's saying this time around unlike Schizophrenia.  (that was more a fault of the production and Max's then still limited handle on the English language.)<br /><br />The energy felt throughout this entire album just gets my blood flowing everytime I listen to it.<br /><br />It's just a true thrash metal classic that every true metal fan should know front to back without hesitation.<br /><br />There's really not that much more superlatives that I can bestow on this monumental, classic release that other reviewers haven't already.<br /><br />If you only know of Sepultura through their Roots album or their post-Max stuff, this album will seem so fast at first that it might be disorienting.<br /><br />While the speed is there, they keep things in check as to where it still remains musical (which is what I don't like about a lot of grindcore).<br /><br />This album deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Rust in Peace, Reign in Blood & Master of Puppets IMO.<br /><br />It's really that good!c that every true metal fan should know front to back without hesitation.    There's really not that much more superlatives that I can bestow on this monumental, classic release that other reviewers haven't already.

This album deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Rust in Peace, Reign in Blood & Master of Puppets IMO.    It's really that good!
B000AP04L0|5.0|Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis & Butthead, turns his brilliantly satirical eye towards Corporate America in \\"Office Space\\". <br /> <br />If, like me, you've spent most of your adult life as a \\"white collar professional\\", you'll identify with the countless stings and barbs Judge slings at middle management types, the absurdities we encounter daily in preparing our \\"TPS Reports\\", and corporate culture in general. <br /> <br />This is satire for sure, but beneath the satire lies so much truth, you have to believe that Judge secretly infiltrated some faceless Office building somewhere in LA County for a week, and like Cameron Crowe----posing undercover as a high school student to give us \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\"----Judge surfaces with an over the top slice of bitterly funny truth. <br /> <br />This is a very funny movie----many reviews here have mentioned some of the best bits so I'll refrain from repeating them----but suffice it to say, after watching \\"Office Space\\" for the 5th or 6th time, you too will be repeating a few of the more memorable catch phrases the next time your sitting at your PC typing up \\"one of the new cover sheets for the TPS Reports\\"!!

B000006OBQ|4.0|Although I am a ute (youth) compared to the Sinatra fans out there, I can say that this is a great album for a great sense of what made The Chairman so enjoyable.<br /><br />This concert recorded at the Sands Hotel in the 1960's was recorded with the Count Basie providing backing.  This alone is pretty special.<br /><br />Sinatra comes in making jokes, singing, and interacting with an appreciative audience.<br /><br />Here my favorite is \\"Get me to the church on time.\\"  Compared to the Sinatra in Paris album, this is far better for an overall experience.  Along with the compilation albums from Capitol and the Reprise records, this is a nice addition to your OVERALL music collection, and I believe a must for Sinatra fans of all ages.
B000001FS3|5.0|Only about 6 out of these 11 songs are worth repeated listens, but the fact is that they're SO good that it absolutely makes this purchase worth it (especially for the price). \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With Or Without\\" you, for example, are such great tunes you would think they've been written for ages. U2's history somewhat helps in explaining the unique style of music they create. In their 20s the four band members were all good friends who simply wanted to make music but had absolutely no experience with instruments or songwriting. They practiced and practiced, sending endlessly rejected demo tapes to record labels hoping to get signed. Low and behold, when the contract finally came, Bono proved to be an excellent singer while The Edge developed a unique guitar sound that an expert musician wouldn't have thought of (if you listen to it carefully it's pretty basic stuff). Their extreme dedication brought such heart and soul to the band that it was obvious that they could grow to be huge if they tried hard enough. The lyrics here are absolutely wonderful and indeed very memorable, and the musicianship is extremely unique and fasincating. No other band sounded like or will ever sound like U2. But enough of my digression - this is a highly recommended album although it would probably be wiser to get the greatest hits CD if you're just a casual fan of U2 as it's a very good compilation (missing only 3 of the highlights here).<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />\\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\"<br />\\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\"<br />\\"With Or Without You\\"<br />\\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\"<br />\\"Running To Stand Still\\"<br />\\"In Gods Country\\"<br />\\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" (parts of)
B000059XUI|5.0|Fantastic movie, but wait for the two-disc special edition being released in June to coincide with the theatrical debut of the new Superman Returns movie. The theatrical version of Superman II on one disc, along with option to play deleted footage shot by Richard Lester, and two different commentary tracks, Lester on one, various actors including Margot Kidder, Sarah Douglas, and Gene Hackman on the other. The second disc has the long-awaited restored Richard Donner version, along with commentary by Donner. Plus, loads of other extras. Hold out for that one; it'll be worth the wait.
B000002MT0|5.0|Heres my story, i was sitting around one night with my good friend rob and he had just bought the Prince 'Come' album. Now I had never heard a song off it, all I knew is it was the album he made with the deliberate intention of pissing off his record company, and in turn what proceeded to come from the speakers was the most original and diverse sounding album i had ever heard. To say that these songs are unmemorable is baffling, this album jumps from industrial techno 'Loose' to 'Papa' with the deep bass keeping the tempo Prince proceedes to scream \\"SMACK SMACK! ew papa papa\\" making it the darkest Prince song ive heard with the exception of the secret track on New Power Soul, and then into 'Solo' which is just him singing while slowly strumming a harp. And why not end an album with 'Orgasm' which is pretty much exactly what the song is, a female orgasming for around a minute. I remember hearing this album and hearing something i had never expected to hear in music in general, let alone a Prince album. Hearing this album made me wish he would get angry with record companies more, it forced him to step outside the normal Prince. Buy this album, it is like no other Prince album you have in your collection and its one of the bests.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very original!  Great script and great cast!
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins followed up their second album \\"Siamese Dream\\" with this 28-track double album which features some of the bands greatest songs. The single for \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" (their best song in my opinion) won them their first grammy and this album showcased the Pumpkins as an incredible musical talent. Billy Corgan is frequently called a songwriting genius and is critisized for his voice. I love Billy Corgan's voice and I think that he even though he's a di*k he is a musical genius. But it isn't merely Corgan who makes this album work. James Iha is one of the most underrated guitarists of the nineties, Iha can play. D'arcy Wretsky is one of the hottest bass players ever and she's not that bad. Jimmy Chamberlin can play hard and fast. While Corgan wrote all the songs; It's the Pumpkins that made them what they are. Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />Dawn to Dusk (Disc 1) <br />1. Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness-5/5-Just a 2 minute piano instrumental. I don't know who plays it, but they do it quite well. <br />2. Tonight, Tonight-4/5-I never REALLY liked this song. It's got an awesome video, but the song is just so-so. <br />3. Jellybelly-5/5-The beat is rocking. James Iha's guitar is mad. <br />4. Zero-5/5-This is one of my favorite Smashing Pumpkins songs. It's great. From the awesome guitar, to Corgan's singing. The chorus rocks!!! <br />5. Here is No Why-5/5-This song has some really good metaphorical lyrics. It's got a great beat too. <br />6. Bullet With Butterfly Wings-5/5-My favorite Smashing Pumpkins song. This song has got one of the coolest choruses in rock music and is just a purely great song. <br />7. To Forgive-5/5-This song is a ballad and is pretty damn good. <br />8. An Ode to No One-5/5-The beat (especially bass & guitar) is fu**ing great. <br />9. Love-3/5-This song has Billy Corgan singing meaningless lyrics in a distorted voice. I didn't like this song that much, it pretty much sucked. <br />10. Cupid De Locke-4/5-Weird.It's got a strange beat; Billy Corgan speaks at the end of the song and sounds pretty cool though. <br />11. Galapogos-5/5-I don't know why Billy Corgan chose to call the song \\"galapogos\\" but anyway...It's really slow dream-like song, but I loved it. <br />12. Muzzle-5/5-Very good, one of the best on this disc. <br />13. Porcelina of the Vast Oceans-5/5-A little overbloated (9 minutes) but other than it's a great song.  <br />14. Take Me Down-5/5-I don't know who sings this song but I know it's not Billy Corgan. It's really good, but the singer for some reason remains anonymous. If anyone knows who this is feel free to e-mail me at moviefreak144@hotmail.com <br /> <br />Twilight to Starlight (Disc 2) <br />1. Where Boys Fear to Tread-5/5-Weird, but really good. Lyrics kinda tell a fairy tale. <br />2. Bodies-5/5-\\"Love is suicide\\" is a pretty cool line. The song should've been given a different title, but ignoring that this is a great song. <br />3. Thirty Three-5/5-Really good...One of the five singles from this album. <br />4. In the Arms of Sleep-4/5-Good lyrics, not a big fan of the song though. <br />5. 1979-5/5-This is a great song and has an equally good video. This song is pretty much about teenage angst; the lyrics fit perfectly with the music. <br />6. Tales of a Scorched Earth-5/5-Really angry lyrics. Including the statement <br />\\"You're all whores and I'm a fag\\". Interesting statement for Billy Corgan to make. Also, Corgan screams Marilyn Manson-style on this song. <br />7. Thru the Eyes of Ruby-5/5-In a sense it's pretty much told through the eyes of a ruby, so it's interesting, if not overbloated (7: 30) <br />8. Stumbleine-4/5-I have no idea what this song was meant to be about, but we have Corgan making a weird statement again; \\"I'll be your stumbleine, I'll be your super queen.\\" <br />9. XYU-5/5-One of the best on this disc. Blends hard rock (simalar to \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings) and soft rock (1979). <br />10. We Only Come Out At Night-5/5-Apparently about vampires or something. It's not the best nor the worst song. <br />11. Beautiful-5/5-I really like the lyrics in this song, really good. <br />12. Lily (My One and Only)-5/5-The lyrics are fu**ing hilarious; Not what you'd expect from the title. <br />13. By Starlight-4/5-(No Comment) <br />14. Farewell & Goodnight-5/5-OK. There's at least 3 people singing on this song. One's Billy Corgan. But who are the other two? James Iha & D'Arcy Wretsky. If you know e-mail me at moviefreak144@hotmail.com <br /> <br />A-
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|In the CD liner notes, the music director for the film Love Actually suggests that different music would have made this a completely different movie, and I have to agree.  When listening to the soundtrack, I could easily recollect exactly where in the movie each song was used; the music served to recapture all of the complex emotions so wonderfully portrayed in the film.<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack has a rather jazzy/R&B feel, from Kelly Clarkson's \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" to Lynden David Hall's upbeat version of \\"All You Need is Love.\\"  Those who have seen this CD in stores may have been dismayed to find that the song list doesn't include Billy Mack's hilarious \\"Christmas is All Around,\\" but don't worry--this is included as a bonus track along with \\"All I Want for Christmas is You,\\" another of the film's more fun tunes.<br /><br />This soundtrack makes perfect background or mood music for virtually any occasion, especially a romantic one.  Highly recommended!
B000957O82|4.0|Plot is predictable -- in the \\"goofy guy gets the hot girl\\" genre <br /> <br />However the particular steps along the way are a lot of fun.  Lots of clever lines and very funny scenes. <br /> <br />Will Smith is outstanding.  If you like him you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|this was a powerful magnetic story. i was absolutely drawn unto these characters. excellent read. along with kerry e wagner's she did that. this book is a real trip.
B0001US8EO|5.0|A great western, though largely fictional. Wyatt Earp, Cosner's character, is well developed and Doc Holliday makes the movie. All of these characters are highly fictionalised, like any movie (that's Hollywood's formula). But I particularly like Costner's Earp as he genuinely caught the type of demeanor necessary for dealing with the situations portrayed in the movie. Largely though, it's a matter of taste as to whether one thinks the movie great. The cinematography is excellent, the main characters are interesting--in all, an epic adventure.
B0001GNDR0|1.0|A dear \\"friend\\" recommended this to watch. Needless to say we now don't speak anymore. Utter trash. Wash hair, clean out sock drawer, clip toe nails, rent Dusk til Dawn 3...! DO ANYTHING just don't waste your time watching this trash.
B000069CWE|5.0|I'm not a hardcore Linkin Park fan. But I do like their songs which are on the radio and a few others. <br /> <br />Their combination of rap and rock are amazing. And their mix of electronica makes it even better. <br /> <br />I have briefly compared the reamination songs to their alblums and I honestly like reamination better. It shows their growth, because their songs sound more thought through and less abprupt. Their transitions are really good as well. <br /> <br />If your a hardcore fan, you wont like this or their collaboration with Jay-z, which is a shame.  <br /> <br />The only reason I like Linkin Park is because of their diversity and ability to cross genres. If they were a straight up metal band, I wouldn't even listen to them. <br /> <br />So hats off to Linkin, for showing they have musical talent in multiple genres.
0689859368|5.0|This is a great series! It tells about the fantasy world around you, filled with brownies, boggarts, trolls and goblins. I liked Simon with all his weird pets, and Jared was pretty smart. Their big sister Mallory was mean and crazy just like mine. It's the kind of book that once you start it, you just can't put it down.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just learned about Firefly recently and purchased the DVD.  How did I miss this when it first aired and why would a TV network cancel such an original series?  Didn't the network know what they had?  Firefly should have received the opportunity to build an audience based on the quality of the material.  Firefly is the best written hour of TV I've seen in some time.  It ranks with Deadwood and I'm amazed at how Josh Whedon has brought a western to space, with all the fun, snappy dialouge, and wit that is missing in the recent plodding Star Wars efforts.  I'm in my forties and my girlfriend, who is no fan of science fiction, loves this show.  I see that the series and the recent film, Serenity, are #2 an #3 on Amazon's DVD Best Sellers list.  Hopefully, this will spur some network to resurect the series so more episodes can be made.  This really is a gem of a series and deserves a better fate.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't already been said? First off, yes, this is one of the best albums of not only the 1990s, but of all time. Radiohead never ceases to amaze me, and this is the best they've got to offer.     Every song on this album is amazing, with tracks ranging from the epical Paranoid Android to the sweet lullaby of No Suprises. Thom's lyrics are incredible, and even Jonny writes amazing lyrics as shown in the song, The Tourist, which is about appreciating the beauty in even the little things. This album adresses technological progress and it's effects on humans as it's central theme, and there is truth in the lyrics.     What makes this album incredible in my opinion is not only the lyrics, but how the music is layered. Radiohead isn't your typical guitar, bass, and drums band. They use a wide variety of wonderful instruments and sounds to enhance each track, transcending the album into it's realm of brilliance.    I don't know what else to say except that this album is a must in your collection. Personally, it is my favorite album ever and it's worth every penny of purchase, or every second of downloading time...
B00005JO1P|5.0|What an overwhelming, sentimental journey back in time.  Never really grasping or digging the man and woman my mother from Italy so adored in her broken english and part terrantella jig whenever Johnny and June came over the TV.  I cried and felt the love now my mother felt then in the 60s for the music and heart and soul these two wonderful characters portrayed in what I will say to be one of the best must see movies ever.  Reese is flawless and Joaquin is the soul embodiment of Johnny.  Sorry you \\"Ray\\" movie supporters...That was no stretch.  The Oscar should be returned from Jamie and go to...Reese and Joaquin...Now THAT is real acting.
0312995423|3.0|Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown, is an exciting and thrilling read for the average reader.  The techniques Dan Brown employs to captivate the reader and draw someone into the book are awe-inspiring.  The author must have taken an adequate amount of time to plan out the plot of the story and piece together the conflict.  The myriad amount of enigmatic puzzles and perplexities the protagonists face is infinite; one could think piecing it all together would be impossible.  However, Dan Brown made it possible for it to happen.  I enjoyed this fact, as well as the subtle use of romance squeezed within the plot.  Although the mainstay of the book is adventure, the small portion of romance is surprisingly effective in the midst of this thrilling plot.  Overall, I enjoyed this book because of its vast content of creativity and its mysterious nature. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to those who enjoy books which contain creative aspects as well as traces of boundless imagination.  People who like adventure and suspenseful thrills should also give this book a chance.  I also recommend this book for those who enjoy perplexing puzzles and thought-invoking mysteries.  This book is highly recommended to those who wish for an interesting mix of mystery, adventure, fiction, and slight romance.

0316172324|5.0|\\"Blink\\" is the first two seconds of your thoughts.  It's when cognition takes place.<br /><br />And in the blink of an eye, we all make decisions based upon our past experiences.<br /><br />Yet, if you were to ask someone what their basis for their decision on something that was important to them, you'd probably get an answer like, \\"I don't know why.  It just is.\\"<br /><br />This is much like Michael Angelo's response to \\"How did you know that you created David?\\"<br /><br />And the essense of his answer was, \\"I knew it when I saw it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is about trusting your instincts.  It's also about conditioning yourself to make educated, controlled snap judgments, also known as \\"thin-slicing.\\"<br /><br />Of the many case studies presented in this book, here are the results of three of them:<br /><br />1.  Doctors who take the time to use \\"orienting\\" comments with<br /><br />  their patients, such as \\"First, I'll examine you.  Then we<br /><br />  will talk a the problem over,\\" are less likely to be sued,<br /><br />  even if they made life-threatening mistakes.<br /><br />2.  The Warren Harding Error:<br /><br />  In 1920, after years of everyone seeing this tall man<br /><br />  with \\"Roman\\" features as presidential material, he became<br /><br />  president.  And after serving two years, which ended in<br /><br />  death from a stroke, historians described him as one of the<br /><br />  worst presidents in American history.<br /><br />  Snap judgments had been made, not by is leadership<br /><br />  abilities, but by his external image.<br /><br />3.  And then, there's a shooting where one police officer<br /><br />  mistakens a wallet for a gun.  His snap decision was based<br /><br />  upon his presuppositions and distance.<br /><br />\\"Blink:  The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,\\" is a great social science book, loaded with case histories, and questions that lead readers to rethink how they make decisions.<br /><br />It's just as good as \\"Tipping Point.\\"
6304806434|5.0|\\"Con Air\\" is about prisoners who take over a plane and plan to fly it out of the USA. Although there is a lack of character development in this movie, the director, Simon West is more focused on bringing out the action element for this movie. Moreover, this is actually an action-comedy movie and it is one of John Malkovich's funniest movie.    The main reason why I liked this movie is because it keeps the viewer in suspense. The jokes are also funny and not too cheesy. Although this movie will never win an Oscar for best director, the mindless action will keep the audience spellbound throughout the movie.
0962477060|5.0|I've been playing for a little over a year now and I find the Fretboard Logic series to be fantastic. I started using it in combination with another book and supplemental information from the web, but now I pretty much use Fretboard Logic exclusively. I don't understand the negative reviews of this book that seem to center on the incompatibility of Fretboard Logic with music theory. I don't think the two have to be mutually exclusive. To the best of my knowledge, the author points out where there are differences between \\"guitar-oriented\\" terminology and \\"music-theory-oriented\\" terminology within the book. If you want to learn music theory, then by all means learn music theory. Fretboard Logic doesn't prevent you from doing that. Also, although I am a beginner, it looks to me like Fretboard Logic III is packed full of standard music theory oriented topics.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|A Lot of complaints about not being able to copy the CD, add to iPod, etc. <br /> <br />There's an easy way to get around it, follow ea-pty's advice above, or Google it.  I did it, it's easy. <br /> <br />Definately a good buy, I loved the contrast between the two discs.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|I don't know why some people are so critical about this movie. In my opinion, this one was just as good as the first- but not better, because Vin Diesel doesn't play in this one :( I still think it was pretty good though.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I too am one who was introduced to Death Cab For Cutie by Comedys Centrals Last Laugh 05.  I could not remember their name that night but went crazy trying to find it.  I tape the show when it aired again then went out that next day to buy the CD.  Hearing Soul Meets Body prepared me for what a great album I was about to discover.
B000002MJR|4.0|During the 1985 Live Aid concert, it gave an opportunity for many bands that had established a cult following to come out and play on the world stage. Perhaps one band that benefited from this more than any other band was Dire Straits. Dire Straits' live performance of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" clearly elevated the band to superstar status. It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled \\"Money For Nothing\\" to #1 song status and the album \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to #1 album status. If you look beyond \\"Money For Nothing\\" and \\"Brothers in Arms\\", you will discover what a terrific band Dire Straits is. Much of Dire Straits is the result of the awesome guitar work of Mark Knopfler, but there is also some great instrumentation from other band members such as bassist John Illsley.. In many circles, Knopfler is considered as good as they come. For Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place. In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way: a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country. Knopfler has also proven himself to be a top notch lyricist - writing both humorous and serious songs. The combination of outstanding instrumentation, great lyrics and a mix of old-fashioned Rock genres is really what made Dire Straits such a great band.  As evidenced by that Live Aid performance, Dire Straits has proven to be an awesome live act.   This is reflected in their second live album, \\"On the Night\\" <br /> <br />During their career Dire Straits would release three live albums.   The first was the legendary 1984 double album entitled \\"Alchemy\\".  \\"Alchemy\\" was considered to be a great live album because of some of the great improvisations taken by Knopfler and the band. \\"Alchemy\\" consists of material prior to \\"Brothers in Arms\\".   The second album is \\"On the Night\\", which focuses on the materialfrom Dire Straits' last two studio albums - \\"Brothers in Arms\\" and \\"On Every Street\\".    Dire Straits would also go on to release a third live album called \\"Live at the BBC\\" that would consist of much of their early material that they performed at the BBC. <br /> <br />As mentioned the tracks from \\"Brothers in Arms\\" and \\"On Every Street\\" are going to account for the majority of the tracks (8).   The contributions from \\"Brothers in Arms\\" are: \\"Walk of Life\\", \\"Your Latest Trick\\", \\"Money For Nothing\\", and \\"Brothers in Arms\\".  The contributions from \\"On Every Street\\" are: \\"Calling Elvis\\", \\"Heavy Fuel\\", \\"On Every Street\\", and \\"You and Your Friends\\".   The pre-\\"Brothers in Arms\\" tracks included are \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and  \\"Private Investigations\\".   There are several missing tracks - most notably, \\"Sultans of Swing\\", \\"So Far Away\\", \\"The Bug\\", and \\"Telegraph Road\\".    However despite \\"On the Night\\" only having 10 tracks, it is jam-packed with 75 minutes of music, so this might have been done to keep the price down to an economical single CD. <br /> <br />Like \\"Alchemy\\", Dire Straits aren't going to be afraid to improvise.   \\"Alchemy\\" also had plenty of longer tracks that gave the band the opportunity to showcase their outstanding instrumentation.   \\"On the Night' isn't going to be afraid of long tracks either.   There are 11 tracks on this collection - all of them over 5 minutes with 8 of the tracks over 6 minutes and two tracks over 10 minutes.  \\"On the Night\\" is going to provide much of the mix of Rock genres that have been heard throughout their careers - namely the mix of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.   I think it's fair to say that the harder rock sound is probably going to be the one that stands out. <br /> <br />One thing that disappointed me was the version of \\"Money For Nothing\\".   If you have heard Dire Straits' versions at Live Aid or Knebworth, these versions are going to blow you away.  This version is going to definitely have a heavier guitar sound - with some incredible drum work.  However, I feel Knopfler's vocals are not up to par with the other versions I have heard him do of this song.   At times, Knopfler is too drowned out by the guitar - especially during \\"he's banging on his bongos like a chimpanzee\\". <br /> <br />There are some great live versions of tracks.  \\"Calling Elvis\\", \\"Heavy Fuel\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Your Latest Trick\\", and \\"On Every Street\\" are going to be the standout tracks.  \\"Calling Elvis\\" will completely blow you away - showing the mix of the genres.   I like how the band does a 10 minute jam of this song. The song really pays homage to Presley's music <br /> <br />When I review a live album, I usually prefer the album to basically be a full recording of a concert. In other words, I prefer the tracks come a single night's performance and be arranged in the order that they were played in concert. I normally am not one for edited concerts or live compilations.  \\"On the Night\\" is a mix of the performances from 1992 performances in the Netherlands and France.  It also doesn't include all of the tracks from those performances (The DVD has 2 additional tracks, but again this might have been done to keep things to a single CD).  Despite these shortcomings, producers Knopfler, Guy Fletcher, and Neil Dorfsman do a great job at assembling the tracks to give the impression of a single concert. <br /> <br />The liner notes don't contain much information other than the musician credits and a lot of photos.   Overall, this is still going to be a pleasing album - especially for the Dire Straits fan who will want to have a live album of their later material.   This album will probably also be pleasing to the more casual Dire Straits fan as it will contain a nice spin on some of the more familiar material.  Highly recommended.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|To keep it short-and-simple ---  This DVD is Fantastic.    <br /> <br />I kept trying to see if there were 5 or 6 other musicians hiding on stage somewhere but nope -- just the 3 of them.     <br /> <br />It was an absolute pleasure to hear Clapton play. He has not played like this in quite some time.     <br /> <br />The drum solo by Ginger Baker was worth the verbal abuse I got from my wife when I cranked up the sound system at 2:00 in the morning.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0792841344|4.0|Director:  Don Coscarelli <br />Cast:  A. Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, Reggie Bannister, Kathy Lester, Terri Kalbus, Kenneth V. Jones, Susan Harper, Lynn Eastman, Angus Scrimm. <br />Running Time:  88 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, language, and gore. <br /> <br />\\"Phantasm\\" begins with a funeral of one of Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie's (Reggie Bannister) best friends. Jody's little brother, Mikey ( A Michael Baldwin) is a precocious kid who can't seem to stay in one place and follows his big brother everywhere he goes. Hence he is at the funeral but is surreptitiously hiding out in the bushes. As the funeral ends, he sees the caretaker lift a casket all by himself and put it into his truck. This is the nascency of the bizaare rituals that encompass the film.  Michael decides to investigate the strange looking mansion where the cemetery rests. Once he breaks into the house, he is chased by some strange Jawa looking creatures and by a sphere that seems to come out of nowhere and drains your head of blood. He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery. Now, up until this point, the film is quite linear. You have your classic set-up, a spooky looking mansion where the dead are taken and your typical stupid characters that do the traditional scary movie things, like going to investigate a haunted house all by yourself, gratuitous breast shots, some eerie music and dark nights. But that is where the title \\"typical horror film\\" ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory. From here on out, it just goes weird, but in a goosebump inducing way that keeps you frozen in your seat. <br /> <br />Don Coscarelli can take all of the praise and/or blame for this eccentric film. He wrote, produced, directed, is credicted as the design producer, the editor, and probably swept the floors at night and fetched coffee for those on the set.  Infinitely unique and complex, \\"Phantasm\\" succeeds due to its innovate script and one of the most haunting, yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" theme. Both are intricate pieces to the presence of the film.  It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" and \\"Phantasm\\". Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say, but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.  This movie is intended for everyone who feels an uncomfortable, ominous atmosphere in funeral homes and cemeteries, and serves as a terrifying (and hopefully fictional) expose of just what goes on back there after dark. Yes, the film is full of incoherent nonsense involving flying metal spheres and little demonic creatures, and some of it is unintentionally hilarious, but it is a \\"Phantasm\\", after all: it's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to confuse you, shock you, and unnerve you, and it sure delivers.  Along with Clark's \\"Black Christmas\\", one of the most underappreciated and overlooked members of the genre.
B000060K4O|5.0|This comedy is so well crafted, one has to wonder why others haven't capitalized on the motiff since the Abbot and Costello days!<br /><br />Here we are, twenty one years later, and it's humor still endures. The Busters are misfits... talking their own brand of techno-babble, dedicated to snaring the very \\"ghosts\\" that most don't believe in.<br /><br />The supporting characters, such as Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson are just as funny as the SNL and CS veterans. Signorney Weaver (sp?) plays an effective \\"straight\\" character in distress.<br /><br />The busters are both brilliant and bumbling.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|If you were a fan of the Eagles back in the 70's and 80's you probably know the meaning behind the title.  For those of you that don't, when The Eagles took \\"a break\\" from playing together in the early 80's they did so because of a lot of fighting.  When asked when they would play together again the response was \\"When hell freezes over!\\".<br /><br />The full concert that's on this DVD is their first performance (talk about guts!) back together again.  The song selection, performances and audio are amazing.  I loved all the old classics but also loved the new song \\"Get Over It\\" which came from \\"Watching too much daytime tv where there are way too many stupid people with way too many stupid problems\\".<br /><br />Easily 5 out of 5 stars.

B00006AVRK|3.0|The first year was the best...great characters and plots. <br /> <br />Then, things changed.  The trip to America was excreble, the \\"lost at sea for months\\" was out of the beginning to a Monty Python episode.  For the last year and a half of the series, it was a parady of itself.  I kept waiting for Berty or Jeeves to look into the camera and give a wink.
078322608X|4.0|Director:  Terry Gilliam <br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Madeleine Stowe, Frank Gorshin, Carol Florence, David Morse, Harry O'Toole. <br />Running Time:  129 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />Stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages, since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se. The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.  \\"12 Monkeys\\", director Terry Gilliam's take on the excellent \\"La Jetee\\" is a hokey, yet extremely dark, sinister, and overwhelmingly entertaining venture into the depths of a future that is severely in doubt.  Somewhere in the distant future, all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only one percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them; a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a \\"volunteer\\" to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called \\"The 12 Monkeys\\" and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.  With Railly at his side, Cole is thrown into a race against time to discover the leader of the Twelve Monkeys and end the epidemic in order to save mankind. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination, while Bruce Willis gives the one of the best performances of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero; instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist, holding her own by injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false \\"religion\\".  Paul Buckmaster creates an original, timeless score that punctuates the wild mood swings Willis' character endures. As Willis acts out the questioning of his own sanity, a desire to be what he calls \\"well\\", and eventually his acceptance of a patently impossible situation, Buckmaster's score delivers a suitably downbeat punctuation. The music is part of what makes the misery of the situation so tangible. Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes \\"12 Monkeys\\" a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with solid performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a gripping treat of madness.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to see Pink Floyd live.  I bought \\"Delicate Sounds of Thunder\\" on cd and later VHS and thought it was a decent show.  About that same time I started to get into Pink Floyd and grew to have a huge appreciate for their music.  When Pulse came out on cd I knew I had to pick up the live VHS and I wasn't disappointed.  The show is unbelievable with a great songs selection including the entire \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album.  Hopefully this will come out on DVD soon (it keeps getting pushed back) as my VHS copy is getting old and fuzzy from use.  If you like Pink Floyd even a little I guarantee you'll love watching this concert.  Pink Floyd sets the bar for light shows!
B000AP04FG|1.0|This movie moved so slowly at the beginning, I kept looking at my watch.  Then it tries to make up for that in the second half by adding action, sexual tension, and explosions.<br /><br />If you can get over the fact that two gorgeous people who are married and live together just can't seem to find anything interesting to do with each other, and that they can hide being assassins, then you may enjoy this.  Of course, you would have to excuse the completely lame and implausible ending.<br /><br />I can think of better action movies to spend my time on than this.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Director:  Sam Mendes <br />Cast:  Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney. <br />Running Time: 122 minutes <br />Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence, and drug content. <br /> <br />\\"American Beauty\\" portrays the ideal picture of suburbia in the most extraordinary of fashions, utilized by up-and-coming direcor Sam Mendes with glorious execution.  Winner of the 1999 Oscar for Best Picture, \\"Beauty\\" sends viewers on an emotional rollercoaster that doesn't waver until the final second of the film.  The Burnham family is the ordinary suburban family but in a way the not so ordinary. As the film first starts out, the family lives in suburbia where they are pretending to happy living in a small town and feel right at home (or at least try to).  Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey in an Oscar-winning performance), our main character who is a 42-year-old man whose middle class, suburban doldrums far exceed the standard middle-age crisis. His fourteen-year career at a magazine publishers is going nowhere, his perfectionist realtor wife, Carolyn (a stupendous outing from Annette Bening), drives him crazy and his angst ridden teenager daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) barely communicates with him, simply writing him off as \\"weird.\\" Things soon begin to change around the Burnham household; however, upon the arrival of several new people who shake things up. While their neighbors on one side are a gay couple, Jim (Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards), the once vacant house on the other has now been occupied by the Fitts family. Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper, who was snubbed of an Oscar win for Supporting Actor) is a stern, military man whose wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), seems to be in state of domestic shell shock.  <br /> <br />Little do they know that their eighteen-year-old son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), a boy so obsessed with life and beauty that they once institutionalized him for two years, is actually a successful drug dealer with a penchant for videotaping everything, including Jane next door.  While that initially creeps her out, Jane soon starts to find Ricky interesting once she gets to know him. That only disgusts Jane's gorgeous cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who thinks Ricky's a pervert although she herself claims she's slept with men just in an attempt to further her aspiring modeling career. When Lester meets both Angela and Ricky, he finds a stirring within himself that he long thought dormant and perhaps dead. With Angela, who openly flirts with him, Lester goes into hormonal overdrive and constantly fantasizes about her, when not pumping iron to get into shape and make himself more attractive to her. With Ricky, Lester finds a kindred spirit whose carefree attitude about life and work -- as well as the expensive pot he sells him -- causes Lester to change his outlook on life. Having successfully blackmailed his former company, Lester sets out to have a good time, not caring that his wife might be seeing local real estate king, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). <br /> <br />As everyone reacts to Lester's newfound attitude with shock, he must deal with the fact that Carolyn doesn't like his new self, that Jane half-jokingly asked Ricky to kill him, and that Colonel Fitts becomes suspicious of Lester's involvement with his son.  The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the piece draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.  This film will leave audience's gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realization, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Thomas Newman's riveting, beautiful musical score accompanies the eloquent and demanding characters as they flow through their lives with whistful nature and mystique.  Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of \\"American Beauty\\" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.  Simply one of the grandest American films of all time.

B00005JO1Y|3.0|Jack Black (School of Rock, High Fidelity) stars as Carl Denham, a director who has found a map to a place called Skull Island. He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island. They arrive there not knowing what's going to happen but then they meet the natives....scary looking natives who kill some of them but they flee. The natives eventually come back and kidnap Naomi Watts, bring her back to their place and strap her down so that she can be sacrificed to KONG, who is a massive Ape. Black, his crew and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Jacket), who plays Jack Driscoll, go off with the captain and his men to go rescue Watts from her awaited doom but she is taking into the jungle by the Ape and suddenly Kong becomes lost in her beauty. The hunt continues as the rest of the gang faces great perils, dinosaurs, lizards, nasty looking bugs to try to resue Watts. Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it. They bring Kong back to Manhattan where Kong becomes King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World but Kong then escapes causing more havoc, breaking out in the streets, climbing building...he even throws blonde woman away as he tries to find his. Then we all know what happens, King Kong climbs the empire state building with the blonde girl, airplanes come and so forth. Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects...an example being the longneck dinosaurs pursuing the resue party. This blows away the Jeff Bridges one too (which was god awful and even more god awful when they put a crown on King Kong's head in that one). It's long...yes, but that creates story and we get to know the characters more better....enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple. Also starring Colin Hanks (Orange County), Kyle Chandler (Tv's Early Edition), Jamie Bell (Undertow, Billy Elliott) Thomas Kretschmann (Blade 2, The Pianist), Evan Parke (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, All My Children) and Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 24 Hour Party People) who plays both King Kong and Lumpy.
B000AA4JMK|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites even though I'm embarrassed to say so. Primarily because I'm Jewish and Dickens' original tale of Oliver Twist is one of few in classic literature that firstly portrays Jews at all, and worse, with such anti-semitism. Written in 1837, anti-semitism was ingrained into English society and manifests itself in Dickens' depiction of \\"Fagin the Jew\\" which is littered within the original works. There is some debate, however, if Dickens himself was actually a racist. Although it would appear so obvious, the \\"conventional wisdom\\" of the time, the money-grubbing Jew, was permeated within the culture. It's not an excuse, but not surprising for people who succumb to such racism, not meeting or interacting with Jews socially. To his credit, he went on to write \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" and created the positive Jewish character of Riah. And in 1867, he re-edited Oliver Twist in an attempt to remove the racist references of  \\"Fagin the Jew\\".  I've read portions of the novel and just found it too disturbing to read it all. <br /> <br />Having said all that, this is still one of my favorite movies. Mostly because Fagin's character is barely associated with anything that would be considered stereotypical. Ron Moody sings and dances with a certain Jewish ethinicity, but for all his wickedness, he comes across just as equally lovable. The real story is poor Oliver, destined to live as a poor child on the streets who ends up miraculously finding his rather wealthy family and home. Besides, the real villian is focused on Bill Sikes, brilliantly portrayed by Oliver Reed, who is as menacing as he is heartless. You laugh, you cry, you cheer. It's a good time. <br /> <br />The music became classics of their own accord. We were taught these songs in choir as a child, as well as hearing them on the radio. \\"Where is Love\\", \\"OomPahPah\\" to which we played a hand clapping game, \\"Food Glorious Food\\" and \\"Consider Yourself\\" are just a few of the more popular. Forthe price of this DVD along with the soundtrack, even if you never listen to it (it's fabulous btw), this movie is a must for your collection.
0740748475|4.0|Finally! A sturdy collection of all the Calvin and Hobbes strips. I can finally get rid of all of those paperback collection series copies that are dog-earred and ready to fall apart. <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars and not 5 for 2 reason: <br /> <br />1) they are so heavy I can't put them on my bookshelf <br />2) the price is a little steep  <br /> <br />The good news is that the book is printed on high-quality sturdy paper and the hardcover is the best I've seen yet. Also the Color prints are extremely bright and smooth. The white space outside the strips is offwhite, I guess to lower the harshness on the eyes. <br /> <br />Overall A very good collection for die-hard Calvin and Hobbes Fans
B00000163G|5.0|ok lemme say this, everyone knows this album was golden, but c'mon if u haven't evn heard the album dun say its the greatest album ever.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Wow, what a debate in the review section.  Let's put it this way:  you'll think this is a five star movie if you loved Firefly (the now-canceled TV show that its creator called \\"Stagecoach, set in space\\"), scifi in the campy style of the original Battlestar Galactica TV show and the Star Wars (Episode IV) and Blade Runner movies, or the concept of small-set ensemble acting.  You'll think this is a zero star movie if the only kind of acting/movies you like are bravura performances (Pacino in Scent of a Woman), unironic action (Rambo), true military (Saving Private Ryan), love stories, or Masterpiece Theatre, i.e., serious stuff.  Love it or hate it.  There's not a lot of room for a three star review here. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" was a 12-show canceled TV project of Josh Whedon, the creator of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise.  Its central conceit is that humans are slowly colonizing the far reaches of the galaxy, but in a gritty and unromantic fashion -- there are no aliens or even extraterrestrial life of any kind, just barren planets that must be \\"terraformed\\" until they can support life, after which the refugees and poorest souls from existing planets colonize them.  Space travel is routine but still fairly dangerous, deep space scares the heck out of everyone, and the newly-habitable planets tend to be rough in a wild west sort of way.  Nobody but the central government has laser pistols or ship-to-ship weapons, so disputes are avoided or settled with guns.  Serenity is an older cargo ship (a Firefly-class ship, hence the name of the TV show) fitted for hauling and a little smuggling.  Adventures ensue when the crew stumbles into that old scifi chestnut:  a sinister plot by a well-funded cell in the central government, which wants to reduce everybody's freedom. <br /> <br />What this movie really offers is a fresh take on the space movie -- no aliens!  no asteroids!  no giant plasma storm menacing the galaxy! -- and a cast of nine (ten, if you count the ship) who have been acting together for two years and show incredible timing and really, truly, act like they are the crew of a ship.  It's not too serious.  Funny and fast, but the tragic points are truly tragic.  Does it require a suspension of disbelief?  Of course.  Dummy, it's set in space.  But it fires on all its cylinders for what it's trying to do. <br /> <br />I've read the reviews that compare this unfavorably to Blade Runner, etc.  Really?  When's the last time you saw those movies?  Blade Runner is slow, slow, slow, but it's still fun.  Don't get me started on Star Wars Episode IV -- I loved it, but that was a near comedy, packed with stuff that is just goofy:  the supposedly fearsome storm troopers can't hit anything (ever see them actually use those scopes on their laser rifles?) and never take cover in a firefight?  And why engage in an infantry battle when you own a star detroyer?  C'mon.  This Serenity movie fits perfectly in the genre of offbeat, smaller-budget scifi flicks.  But here's one last piece of advice:  get the full Firefly TV season on DVD.  You'll love it, and it will make this movie even better for you.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna, whether you love her or loathe her, is undoubtedly a jaw-dropping cabaret.  She can rock a crowd, old and young and churns out nuggets of musical gold.  Possibly spurred on by Elton John's slants about her inability to sing, she faded her own voice up whilst singing at the MTV European Music Awards. I have to say it didn't sound the best.  Anyone would struggle dancing about like that without getting horribly out of breath and sounding like a wavering 13yr old choir boy with a voice about to break.  She should have mimed because genuinely I don't think most people would have cared.  She's a total show woman: hard-working and impossibly innovative when re-vamping her image... <br /> <br />As a package, Madonna is abbbbbsolutely brilliant.  'Hung Up' is generating some extraordinary bootlegs and I can only imagine how 'Get Together' will sweep the Club National in 2006. <br /> <br />Go Madge!  Hands in the air people!!
B000B63EZG|2.0|After hearing 'Hand of Blood' and an immaculate, super-heavy version of 'Her Voice Resides', I was expecting great things from this album. Unfortunately, now, after numerous listens, I cannot see why such a fuss is being made over the release of 'The Poison'.<br /><br />True, there are many good aspects to the album, a few good riffs, a quite frankly, beautiful, introduction on track one, and lyrics that many angst-ridden teenagers (like myself, I'll admit) will be able to relate to.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, the bad outweighs the good for me on this album, as a whole. The first thing that I noticed was the flawless, polished production. (and for a metal band, that is NOT a compliment!) I'm not great on the technical side of describing this, but if you listen to the album for a few minutes, you'll know what I mean. It's not raw and heavy, like proper metal should be. After hearing what Bullet sound like live, I was seriously let down by this.<br /><br />The main thing, however, which annoyed me about this album, was Matt Tuck's whiny-cum-roaring vocals. It's laughable at times. One second he sounds like Gerard Way mixed with Westlife, the next, it's a pathetic impersonation of Corey Taylor and the heavier side of James Hetfield. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for variatons and extremities regarding vocals in metal, but Tuck  takes these extremities one step too far. The roaring isn't too pathetic, but the girly whining is abominable...<br /><br />...Which leads on to the lyrics. Yes, I know I stated earlier that many could relate to the lyrics, but they are just so (yes I really am going to use this word again) whiny. They are also quite unimaginative at times. Many songs (such as 'Ten Years Today' which deals with a friend of the bands' killing himself) have the lyrical potential to be touching and emotional, but it just comes out as WHINE!<br /><br />And, musically, they're not even that heavy, due to the pop-like production.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|<br /> <br />Batman Begins is an excellent retelling of Batman's origins (something's that never been properly done in the movies, except maybe in the cartoon movie \\"Mask of Phantasm\\") and brings the Dark Knight back to the mantel he stood upon before the late 1990s. That aside, I really have to commend the director -- Christopher Nolan -- on bringing Batman into the silverscreen limelight, the plot was written quite well. It certainly was on par to the Batman Comics themselves and the dark themes of the series. The city used for Gotham City was such an amazing choice of the corrupt city -- much better than cartoonish Gotham City via \\"Forever,\\" \\"Batman & Robin,\\" and the early Tim Burton Batman movies. All which reminded me a deranged architect's warped mind.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />A short overview of the movie is this: A young Bruce Wayne (Gus Lewis) while playing with young Rachel Dawes (Emma Lockhart), falls down a well and is attacked by a flurry of bats. After his father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), pulls him from the well, Bruce begins having nightmares about bats. One night the Waynes go to the opera where Bruce becomes scared at some of the dancers' portrayals of bat-like demons. Bruce experiences a panic attack and begs his father to leave the theater early. The family exits into an alley where they are confronted by a mugger, Joe Chill. Despite the calm submission of Thomas, Chill shoots both him and his wife. Fatally wounded with a bullet in his chest, Thomas Wayne tells his son not to be afriad. Bruce is left physically unharmed, but in a state of total mental shock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />From there the movie picks up when Bruce Wayne is in the a Chinese prison for attempting to steal products that, ironically, belong to Wayne Interprises. He approached by Ducard to meet his master Ra's al Ghul and an opportunity to join \\"The League of Shadows.\\" From the movie becomes very interesting. That aside, the actors chosen for the roles (comicbook and original character alike) were also an excellent choice. Aside from Christian Bale and Michael Caine, other well known actors play their roles superbly.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Even Liam Neeson, whom I usually haven't liked since \\"Phantom Menace\\" was interesting as the character Henri Ducard. Though many people complained about Katie Holmes' performance in the movie as Rachel Dawes, I thought she did a swell performance in this movie than she ever did in the entire series of \\"Dawson's Creek\\" and other films she's been in.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Cillian Murphy, an actor quite knew to me played his role as twisted Arkam doctor, Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, like a well oiled machine. The mask he used when his victims were given his hypnotic gas gave me quite a scare. The graphics for the film were top notch. It was hard to tell what was CGI, though there were obvious CGI moments in most of the high shots of the city. The narrows, the rundown and cut off area of Gotham City where the poor reside was nicely created, very reminiscent of Gotham City after the massive earthquake in the \\"No Man's Land\\" arc.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The action was sparely placed throughout the movie to develop the storyline and character, but when the action was thrown into motion it really captured your in the moment, especially the Tumbler/Batmobile scenes. Batman's fighting style was very Batman-like, though most of the time it was hard to tell what was going in the darkness, even then Batman was grabbing up his enemies on his grappler. All in all, Batman Begins managed to reel you in with its dark comic book style story telling set in a more realistic world that better reflected Bob Kane's universe, while maintaining the mystery of the plot until the very end. This is a film I would defiantly want to own. ----- [a 5 out of 5]
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Me and my family were very impressed by this movie.  Not only was it entertaining and perellis, but it looked so real!  I'm very pleased with how this movie was put together.  Deffidently a new tradition to watch this movie on Christmas Eve. <br /> <br />It will lift your Christmas Spirit a whole lot =D
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I am a huge fan of Daredevil Comics and was so disappointed when I saw the theatrical release of Daredevil the movie. I understand that the producers were trying to market it for a broader audience but I disagree with their \\"fast pace/all action\\" product. The movie was LAME! It wasn't even entertaining for its badness, like \\"Batman Forever\\" or \\"Batman and Robin\\" were. The movie was so abysmal that I felt like stabbing myself in the eyes. The producers forgot that appealing to a broader audience should not mean loosing the story and strong character development.     However, despite this fact, when I saw that there was a re-release of the film in a director's cut I thought I would give it a try. To my great shock, the movie is 110% better! A much stronger story (if you could even say the original release had a story), and a lot more nods to the Frank Miller comics that made me a Daredevil fan in the first place. I like Daredevil the film now. I do hope that someday Chris Nolan and the folks responsible for \\"Batman Begins\\" will look to do a Daredevil movie the way it ought to be, until then this director's cut is pretty decent. Yes, you must still get over the bad casting (and acting might I add) of Ben Affleck, Colin Farrell, Coolio (why does Coolio need to be in this film--who the hell thought that was a good idea? Fire him immediately!) and Michael Clarke Duncan (and why was he cast as the Kingpin??? And why doesn't Ben Urich work for the Daily Bugle in the film for that matter?) but despite these issues the movie is far better in this director's cut than the theatrical release.     Caesar says thumbs up!
B00005JNX0|5.0|Very uplifting and funny.  Great for the whole family. <br />
B000002B1M|5.0|Stop talking people. It Was Written is a classic on its own. Even though he copied 2pac's \\"All Eyez on Me\\" beat (what's with that), there are still classics like \\"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)\\", and \\"I Gave You Power\\", where Nas tells a story from the view of a gun. The most catchy song on the album.  <br /> <br />It Was Written is a classic. If you are looking for something as good as Illmatic, get \\"Ready to Die\\", or \\"Doggystyle\\". If you are just looking for a good rap album, than pick up It Was Written today
B00080EU58|5.0|Okay first things first.  To all the people who say that this is Slipknot's worst album, and to the people who called other people liars because they said that this was a good album, just be quiet now and save yourself the rest of the embarrassment.  Just because Corey doesn't scream the \\"F\\" word every 17 and a half seconds doesn't make this a bad album.  Just because Corey doesn't cuss at all, with the exception of 'b!tch3d' in \\"Duality\\"--which is hardly even discernable--doesn't make this a bad album.  Personally, it shows me a more mature Slipknot than we got on Iowa and the self-titled album.  Cussing does not make an album good or bad.  Let me repeat myself.  CUSSING DOES NOT MAKE AN ALBUM GOOD OR BAD!  Some people have a problem figuring out what that means.  I, personally, like this album, as I do the other 2 'Knot albums.  I cannot wait for the next Slipknot album.  (There is one coming out in 2006, just to let people know.)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched Firefly when it was on TV. I was too disappointed that Fox had canceled Dark Angel (if I wasn't already married, Jessica Alba would be mine!) and vowed never to watch them again. After all the hype of Serenity, I put the boxed set on my Christmas wish list. I'm glad I did! Firefly is one of the few Sci-Fi series that stressed character over special effects. Joss Whedon is a master of plot, character and story. The actors relate to each other like a family, warts and all, which makes the viewer feel comfortable. All I can say is that Fox shot themselves in the foot, again. If they got rid of the Fox News channel, they could support quality television with a return of Firefly.
B000066NW0|3.0|First off, what I'd like to say: Enough with the Avril bashing. I'm not a fan of hers, but honestly. Children, grow up. You're not even criticizing her album, you're criticizing the singer (share your little angsty prepubescent rants somewhere else). I believe this space is for a product, yes? <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br />Anyways, Let Go is a solid debut album. Nothing too special, nothing too deep. However, the CD was extremely catchy. I think some of the tracks capture teenage insecurities quite well; the \\"lighter\\" themed ones are just fun to listen to, such as 'Mobile'. <br /> <br />The biggest dealbreaker, however, is that her real voice sounds nothing like the CD's. Her real voice is low and deep, whilst her voice in CD is high and feminine. =/ <br /> <br />However, this is a solid CD. I'd say that it's definitely not punk rock, but a \\"pop rock\\" CD. It's actually better than most current pop songs that I've heard so far, such as Britney-the lyrics actually revolve around something besides sex. <br /> <br />As far as buying goes, I don't recommend it. I don't think it's anything too special/amazing. However, it's definitely a \\"guilty pleasure\\" with its catchiness. =]
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The movie picks up only months after the last chapter of the series, which helps to maintain the continuity of the story arc. Some of the crew have left; Shepherd Book is now running a commune, Inara is teaching at the \\"Companion\\" training school. But the major plot is that the Alliance wants River Tam in the worse way, and has sent an assassin to find her. He will stop at nothing to obtain his prize. I won't give away too much, but I will put it this way, River does possess some serious skills when threatened.<br /><br />To fully appreciate the last 1/3 of the movie, you should watch ALL of the series. You will understand.<br /><br />Contrary to what other reviewers have stated, this isn't the end. Joss Whedon wants to make more big-screen chapters of Firefly. He is busy right now working on Wonder Woman, but plans on returning to the good ship Serenity.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought this CD when it was first released, around 2 years ago. I still listen to it, which is quite remarkable. =] I usually tire of a CD rather quickly, but this one has withstood my picky taste. <br /> <br />I must admit to thinking that Christina was a talentless slut/ho/one hit wonder (like Britney) before I actually listened to this CD. It has totally changed my opinion of her, considering that she co-wrote many of the tracks on this CD. This is a truly stunning follow-up album to her original debut (which, by the way, I dislike). <br /> <br />Some of the gems on the CD include Can't Hold Us Down, Walk Away, Fighter, Beautiful, The Voice Within, I'm OK, and Keep Singin' My Song. These songs go beyond just the current popular themes of music- sex, drugs, money, etc., providing a deeper insight on life.  <br /> <br />However, I do also like Make Over (my all-time favorite song) and Dirrty, some of the \\"lighter\\" tracks on the CD. <br /> <br />Overall, the CD is worth definitely worth buying. It proves that Christina isn't your generic pop princess anymore. =]
B00008G7UJ|2.0|The story of the Capulets and the Montagues has never looked like this before.  Baz Luhrmann has created an updated version of this timeless classic.  Often considered the perfect tragic love story, Romeo and Juliet proves that Shakespeare was an outstanding playwright and a master wordsmith.  Unfortunately, even the best writing cannot carry a movie when the actors have no passion nor innate skill. <br /> <br />   Leonardo DiCaprio has just the right look to play young Romeo, but he lacks any true acting ability.  He takes some of the most passionate lines ever written and plows through them like a bull in a china shop, determined to just get through and get out as quickly as possible.  Take for example the scene when Romeo first speaks to Juliet.  \\"If I offend with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this...\\"  DiCaprio delivers these lines with no emotion, no passion, and no apparant thought for what he is actually saying.  This soulless acting continues throughout the film. <br /> <br />   Claire Danes is better, but not much.  She is far more convincing than her counterpart, but the lines still come across flat.   <br /> <br />   Not all this is the fault of the actors.  The director is ultimately responsible and that brings us to Baz Luhrmann.  Cinematically, this film is impressive.  He's done a wonderful job of updating the play to modern times without tying it directly to any particular period or location.  The creative way that he introduced the \\"Dagger\\" (now a semi-automatic pistol) and the \\"long sword\\" (a rifle) are proof that Luhrmann does care about the details.  If only he cared a little more about the acting, and worked a little harder to draw forth a more passionate performance from his stars. <br /> <br />   Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version is a vastly superior performance from an artistic point of view; however, Luhrmann's updated version provides a version that the youth of today will probably connect with.  If the goal is to get kids to watch and appreciate Shakespeare, then show this version first.  Once they're hooked, have them watch the 1968 version and show them what Shakespeare was really meant to be.
B0000041DF|5.0|This is truly the most transcendental performance of the rach 3 ever. Right from the morose opening lines, to the hair raising electricity of the finale, Argerich simply explodes in a manner unmatched by any other pianist (Horowitz being a close second). Though the entire concerto is brilliantly played, the highlight is undoubtedly the finale.. One would run out of superlatives trying to describe this performance. As described in the CD insert, this recording is truly 'One of Nature's happenings' ! <br />     The presence of rach 3 totally overshadows an almost equally good performance of the Tchaikovsky B flat minor. However, there are several better recordings of this concerto, so I would go no further than saying that it is a good performance. I would advise Gilels for both the Tchaikovsky concertos, though. <br />     In summary, i would give 7 stars to the Rachmaninoff and 3 to the Tchaikovsky...making it 5 stars in all. However my advice to everybody is : Forget about the Tchaikovsky, buy this disc for the Rachmaninoff itself..you won't find a better one!
B00005JO04|5.0|Unlike most of the bad reviewer's opinions, I thought it was a joy to watch. It's not the run-of-the-mill, explosion-filled slug-fest the trailers make it out to be, but a deep, conscientious movie that draws you in and keeps your mind working to put the pieces together. No doubt that the events in the movie mimic real-life - makes you wonder who really has their \\"hands in the cookie jar.\\" The many scene cuts are a bit overbearing at times, but fit perfectly with the style of the movie with all of the sub-plots going on.   <br />A great movie a definetly one to grab when it's released on DVD.
1401201911|4.0|The premise of this story is that Superman lands in Russia during the height of the Cold War.  Most writers would've gone for an easy \\"Superman as a bad guy\\" story.  Instead, we get a mature and refreshing take on the Man of Steel that surprisingly changes very little about his personality. <br /> <br />This is still the Superman we know, more or less.  A good man with amazing powers trying to make the world a better place, struggling to make sense of his role in the larger scheme.  It's very good.  Very, very good. <br /> <br />I do have one minor complaints though.  It is very strongly bound to Superman continuity (even if an alternatre version) and a lot of non-fans might have trouble following the story because many characters basically have cameos.  This is due to the fact that the story takes place over several decades, highlighting each era of the Cold War.  While very well written, it can seem a little rushed.  But I'd rather the story move quickly than drag itself down with endless exposition. <br /> <br />Fun read.  Intelligent read.  Satisfying read.  In other words, a very worthwhile take on the Superman character that might make you think, but, more importantly, will keep you entertained.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Thank you SONY and your SPYWARE placed on CD's, I will not purchase any PRODUCT with SONY as a Owner,Name or ETC and including the the new SANTANA CD ALL THAT I AM. You have lost a customer for now. <br /> <br />HAPPY NEW YEAR 2005 <br /> <br />
0060764899|4.0|I'm 28 and, sadly, this is the first time I have read this book. I am ashamed myself. But with the movie coming out,I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It was an extremely quick read...a couple hours is all it took and well worth the time. I am not a fan of fantasy but this book was a cute book...CS Lewis has yet to let me down.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Be very cautious about purchasing this CD.  It may contain copy protection that will not allow you to play this CD on a computer, portable player, some car stereos and more.
B000023VR6|5.0|that wack punk who said Dre didn't write the songs on 2001 needs to check himself and the 2001 booklet.  I checked this masterpiece's book and Dre wrote every song on the record.  I mean its a totally sick album.  Not as great as The Chronic but it is still one of the best.  Anything Dre touches turns to gold.  Look at Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and The Game. What more can I say.  Can't wait for Detox gonna be another classic.
0385338686|5.0|I have read every book written by Sophie Kinsella.  I loved her Shopaholic series, but I loved this one just as much!  Very light, fun reading!
1882723007|5.0|I had always been interested in religion and the after life, this book is very comforting to me, it explains experiences I've had and rises new curiousities and questions for me.  Before I wrote this review I was skimming through the costomer reviews.  I found that many believe and others do not.  But it's all about what you believe and your perception of the contents of the book.  I believe in it because through out the course of history of man experiences like these have happened and many of them connect in some way, although some do not.  Just how can you explain things like Joan D'Arc, Nostradamus & countless other prophets, NDE's, and even Muhammid's vision's of which the Islamic faith is based off of.  Of course people will explain that it was ergot poisening,they were skitsophranic, or it was a hoax.  Well prehaps there is a reason for all these faiths and visions prehaps God gave Muhammid his visions.  Maybe it's all for a reason to learn to accept people no matter of thier race, religion, age, and sexuality.  To accept that all religions have good views and bad views it's our job to pick the good from the bad.<br /><br /> Some of the reviews question the council of 12 men, well weren't all Jesus's deciples men? Well that explains the council of 12 doesn't it, clearly they are the deciples.  There's just so many questions out there about these type of experiences and all it comes down to is what you believe and how you percieve life and what there is to experience after life.  I'm not saying you must believe in christianity its our deversity that makes this world great and unique.  This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it no matter what you believe it will be benificial to you.
B00000ILDF|2.0|The director said he made this film for his friends.  There are plenty struggling directors out there with greater abilities that could have been used. This is a commercial project and not a vehicle for showing-off to friends.   <br />    When the warden says there are no aliens on his prison and gets immediately snatched up from above, it's so artificial that the whole scene becomes a waste of opportunities.  An amatuer filmmaker knows you have to give the actors reaction time!  Maybie Fincher is an amatuer in a job he can't handle. <br />     I didn't think his other movie Seven was very good.  Fight club was good but I didn't like seeing buildings blown up then or even now.
B000006IUQ|5.0|Anthony Hopkins stars as Charles in 1997's \\"The Edge\\", a sad, lifeless billionaire who has accumulated a vast store of mostly useless facts. Because of his great wealth he's unsure if people are honestly interested in him as a friend or just want his money. His much younger, model wife (Elle Macpherson) treats him more as a teddy bear than a romantic lover. He wonders if she's having an affair with her photographer Bob (Alec Baldwin).<br /><br />Charles gets stranded in the Northewest wilderness and is forced to confront three types of nature: First, he must contend with wilderness nature itself (the movie was filmed in breath-taking Alberta and British Columbia). Secondly, he comes face to face (literally) with a fierce Kodiak bear. Thirdly, he must confront human nature in the ugly form of arrongance, envy, malice, greed, lust and murder.<br /><br />Unexpectedly, as Charles confronts these three challenges he starts to blossom and fully come ALIVE, perhaps for the first time in decades. His colossal store of mostly worthless knowledge actually becomes useful.<br /><br />There are a couple \\"Yeah, right\\" Hollywood implausibilities -- for instance, the bear shaking the tree as the guys cross the river (an homage to King Kong) -- but, for the most part, the story plays out realistically.<br /><br />\\"The Edge\\" addresses many powerful and worthy themes including Rebirth & renewal, confronting & overcoming incredible challenges, and, perhaps most potent of all, the power of repentance and triumphing over evil through goodwill & forgiveness.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT *** Don't read the next paragraph if you haven't seen the movie<br /><br />Some may scoff at that last one but, after Charles gains the upperhand over Bob at the end, Bob sincerely repents of his wicked deeds before he ultimately dies (the 'wicked deeds' being his intention to kill Charles for his wife & wealth). At the end Charles refuses to say anything bad about Bob, even though he clearly has the right to; all he states is that Bob died saving his life. Why did he say this? Why didn't he lambaste him for being a murderous, greedy, adulterous scumbag? Perhaps not only because Charles accepted his repentance and FORGAVE him, but also because he realized that ALL OF US are screw-ups to some degree. We all have a dark, carnal side to our psyche, Bob simply made the mistake of going over THE EDGE; yet, in the end, he realized this and was truly sorry for it. What an amazing story about the power of repentance and forgiveness!<br /><br />*** END SPOILER ***<br /><br />These descriptions of the film's profundities are feeble at best; there's so much more I'd like to comment on but mere words won't do it justice. Discover for yourself. This is definitely a movie worthy of repeat viewings.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If all you want out of \\"The Edge\\" is a great adventure/survival story with spectacular scenery, you'll definitely get it, yet it profoundly (and unexpectedly) offers so much more. I'm a pretty masculine dude but the last time I saw this film I was so affected that I broke down at the end.<br /><br />The next day I saw the Peter Jackson \\"King Kong\\" flick, which is essentially another adventure/survival yarn albeit with a giant gorilla and dinosaurs instead of a bear.

B00005JOFO|4.0|I did not see this movie because of its \\"gay\\" theme.  I saw this movie because I love movies in general and will see anything that seems interesting to me.<br /><br />This is a beautifully shot movie with breath-taking scenery that perfectly depicts the lonely and sometimes harsh beauty of Wyoming.  The acting is good by everyone, but I agree with a previous reviewer that what was missing between the two main characters, Ennis and Jack, was the true intimacy of two people falling in love.  The desperation and sexual wanting between the two was obvious, but not the deeper love for one another.  Anyway, it was aching to see that for the next 20 years in the movie, Ennis and Jack must sneak away to Brokeback Mountain in order to be themselves, and spend the majority of their lives living a forced lie out of fear, obligation, responsibility, etc.  It made me wonder how many of us live that way - not being able to be ourselves.<br /><br />This is definitely not a \\"feel-good\\" movie, so if that's what you're in the mood for, you should see something else.  But if you want to see something that will make you pause and think, this may be it.  It does have some graphic scenes, but nothing that I would say is over the top.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day need to stick to what they write about best: Getting high and reminiscing about love and life gone bad. At least they're experts at those things. Heck, their band name is an East Bay slang term that refers to sitting around all day doing nothing but weed. These guys are never clear-headed or sober enough to express their political views articulately, and it shows. For an even funnier look at the band, I suggest watching (but not buying) Bullitin: Green Day Loves Reading the Bible, so you get to see \\"the boys\\" in \\"serious mode\\". American Idiot, which is a botched attempt at a \\"political\\" record is definitely not their gig. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Billie Joe is a Democrat, but you never know exactly what he's trying to communicate from his mindless lyrics on American Idiot, which make so sense. He ranks right up there with Michael Moore in terms of giving us Democrats a bad name. In his misguided and ignorant mind, Billie Joe views any and all Republicans as his mortal enemy, and encourages his fans to think the same. The fact is, anybody with who can see through a phony facade (whether the person be Republican, Democrat, or whatever) can see that George W. Bush is dishonest and a mockery of a leader. Too bad Billie Joe can't see through his own phony facade he created for himself, because he's a total mockery of a Punk Rocker. He's not humble (he parades around literally with a king's crown and cape onstage), and milks the anti-establishment fad when he is the establishment. Charging fans $30.00 for T-shirts and a $50 for a yearly Idiot Fan Club subscription is anything but Punk. <br />  <br />Either you think like Billie Joe, or he spits at you and threatens to kick your arse. It's a total shame this band is alienating and attacking their fans who don't think the same as them, because I know that not all Green Day fans think alike (although you wouldn't guess that from how Billie Joe gets thousands of his fans to blindly follow his every scream at concerts). He puts up a front with his powerful exclamations and dramatic facade, but it's all a paper-thin charade that's made for fans to eat up. Billie Joe has told his fans to riot (not on this tour, but on the Nimrod and Warning tours), and they've done so because he knows he has total control over them. It's a bit scary seeing thousands of screaming kids blindly saluting him and dressing in the all-black Punk Rock uniform you see all \\"Punks\\" wearing nowadays. Seeing that reminds me of those Reich scenes from World War II. And obviously, that kind of blind following is a very dangerous thing. If Punk is all about being anti-conformist, then those of us who enjoy classic Rock and Country music must be the real Punks.
B0000013G9|2.0|I had \\"CrazySexyCool\\" when I was in high school and after listening to it a few times, I sold it to one of my classmates. The only songs I liked on the album were the ones released as singles. Everything else was just whatever. After \\"Waterfalls,\\" TLC turned pop so quick that it made my head spin. And for as long as TLC has been out, I never cared much about T-Boz's singing. But after hearing a TLC song on the radio the other day, I realized that T-Boz sings like a croaking frog. RIBBIT!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Dear listeners, <br />All though the majority of this country will contradict me, <br />(believe it or not, I USED to be a greenday fanatic!) I think that this is almost as far from true music as possible.  <br />       The musicality-- chords,overall sound is very sophomoric and rudimentry; in every song you can hear the SAME chord progression. <br />     The lyrics are about drugs and stupid things. <br />Why don't you go listen to some Beatles, or Sigur Ros, or even classical, which, by the way, is TRUE music. <br />I don't know why I'm making this argument; no one will listen. I hope someone out there will. <br />
B000002UAO|4.0|It is hard to listen to this classic album starting with \\"Drive My Car\\" rather than \\"I've just seen a face\\".  Its like Clapton's Derek and the Dominoes album starting with \\"I shot the Sherriff\\" rather than \\"I looked away\\".  And having to listen to Ringo singing \\"What Goes On\\" instead of starting side 2 with \\"It's Only Love\\" is almost too much to bear.  Until Capitol releases a US version, the best that can be done is to buy \\"Help\\" along with this and cut and paste the album back together on your ipod or mp3 player so new generations of Beatles fans can experience the greatness of the US version.  To experience the US version, replace \\"Drive my Car\\" with \\"I've just seen a face\\" from \\"Help\\", replace \\"What Goes On\\" with \\"It's Only Love\\" from \\"Help\\", and also remove \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\".  \\"Nowhere Man\\" is a great song but doesnt belong on this album. Try this out and let me know what you think.
0446577383|2.0|Written in multi-threaded, Tom Clancy style, Camel Club is an entertaining mystery if you can suspend disbelief at the ridiculous plot.  The characters are shallow and pontificate in silly, left-wing drivel from time to time.  Suspense keeps one turning the pages, but there is no lasting substance to the book.  Good to read on an airplane, it will soon be forgotten.
0804106304|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I read it the first time for an English class in high school, and I always return to it when I need some good chick lit.  This book intertwines the stories of four Chinese-American women and their mothers.  It shows how these women, who are all from Chinatown, have struggled to adapt to being Chinese-American, but their challenges are also very similar to those that young white women experience.  Every character is realistic, and I could identify with each of them to some extent.  A must read!!!
0767834739|3.0|Being a Resident Evil fan since the 2nd game came out for PlayStation. I noticed the simularities that they tried to do in the game and movie. The Dislikes which made me give it a 3/5 is becuase of the music and action scenes. The action scenes seemed terrible, the combat moves to be exact. if they tried harder on the combat moves it would have made it seem more interesting. The music! They could have done better! It was the worst ever, they played music at the wrong times, music that didnt even belong with the scenes! Also what dissapointed me was that one character, that \\"funny\\" one, they should have left him out, i never found any lines of his funny and its suppose to be a thriller/ Sci Fi film, not a comedy film. But unfortionetly hes going to be in the 3rd movie also, i forgot what it was called. THe nemisis should have been kept till the 3rd movie, but remember readers! Always in the 3rd films, they go back to the 1st movie and talk about stuff we didnt know! The first one was the best! THE HIVE!
B000660UN0|2.0|I already wrote a review for this release, but thought I would return a few months down the track and reconsider some of the content.<br /><br />Upon revisiting the DVD, it becomes clear that the production values are very high, and that real time and effort was spent constructing the 'movie'. As a 'bonus' item, the DVD is exceptional in both audio and visual terms. Clapton fans are certainly being well catered for, and seeing the material 'performed' adds immeasurably to the value of the package. Clapton and co. certainly deserve applause for this attention to the 'fans'.<br /><br />With releases like this, it is clear that Clapton is 'throwing in his lot' with Robert Johnson and has become (if he wasn't, indeed, before) the central organising presence in the popular musical world justifying Johnson's critical worth and encouraging his contemporary popularity. However, what becomes apparent in the 'interview' sections of the DVD is that Clapton has a somewhat wrong-headed understanding of Johnson's place in blues history (if contemporary scholarship is to be believed). At one point he places Johnson with Charley Patton, Son House and Blind Lemon Jefferson - all of whom were a generation removed from Johnson, whose first recording session was late in 1936 (ten years AFTER Jefferson began recording).<br /><br />Indeed, like many, Clapton arrived at Johnson by going backwards - through Chuck Berry, Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, etc. Therefore, he considers Johnson to be one of 'the first' - i.e. 'the thin end of the wedge' (as he puts it), rather than as one of the LAST great Delta performers. This is significant, in that it invests Johnson with a degree of 'originality' (for want of a better term) without justification. These problems are compounded by Clapton's statements regarding Johnson's repertoire. At one point in the interview segment he admits 'blues' is not the only genre of music Johnson would have played for audiences, but then later states that 'this' (i.e. 'blues') is ALL Johnson played - or COULD play, given the restrictions on what the labels would have wanted from such a performer given the time. This reduces Johnson (whose 'They're Red Hot', 'Steady Rolling Man' and 'Drunken Hearted Man' indicate an artist very much skilled in a range of styles, and willingly appropriating others), allowing him to fit snugly into the 'blues' label with little deliberation.<br /><br />Indeed, Clapton appears content with the 'Robert Johnson' as presented on the liner notes for the first 1960s release of 'King of the Delta Blues Singers', a portrait that may have accorded with a romanticised 'folk' depicition of 'the blues' but which has come under scrutiny in the last decade or so - and for good reason. (See Elijah Wald's 'Escaping the Delta' for perhaps the most important understanding of Robert Johnson in blues scholarship.)<br /><br />Ultimately, this package will confirm Clapton's status yet again with his (blues) audience - but that audience is entirely comfortable with Clapton and his understanding of that genre. The problem is that Clapton is as much contributing to the popular understanding of Robert Johnson with releases like this as much as he is building his OWN reputation. Not only is this a weighty endeavour, but he is willingly promoting a particular portrait of Johnson that is (somewhat) problematic. Some might suggest that, at this late stage, it hardly matters, but Robert Johnson is very much an industry - the rise and fall of which bears greatly upon the popular appreciation (and understanding of) 'the blues'. The danger is not that Clapton clearly loves this music and happily promotes it, but that it is a specific interpretation of the music that is being presented (and unconsciously so).(i.e. 'blues') is ALL Johnson played - or COULD play, given the restrictions on what the labels would have wanted from such a performer given the time.

B00005JL3A|5.0|Best movie ever! resident evil is great, this movie really brang it all alive. From the Setting to the DEAD! it was awsome, you must see this!
B000002U8G|4.0|I bought this album after buying Dark Side of The Moon through The Wall. Those albums got me very into the band, but I wanted something more after listening to those albums for a while. Meddle definitely satisfied my craving for more Floyd, because the post-Wall albums just don't do anything for me. Meddle is Pink Floyd just before the peak of the mountain that is Dark Side Of the Moon. Here's my song list and thoughts: <br /> <br />1.) One Of These Days: Good opener to the album. Creepy winds, pounding bass riff, Gilmour's slide guitar, and Nick Mason's horror flick-esque line, \\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces!\\" ,just make this song give me goosebumps. 5/5 <br /> <br />2.) A Pillow Of Winds: A nice acoustic chill out song in supreme Floyd style, with great lyrics. The song's progression from almost happy sounding to dark and melodic is great, giving it a great don't-get-too-comfortable feeling. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Fearless: Following in similar style as \\"A Pillow Of Winds\\", this acoustic/clean electric/slide song sounds very much unlike some of Pink Floyd's other works. It almost sounds bright, but the lyrics are thoroughly dark. 5/5 <br /> <br />4.) San Tropez: Now this was something completely unexpected. When \\"Fearless\\" ended and I heard that first jazzy chord of San Tropez, I wasn't sure this was the same album. However, it seemed to fit. Roger Waters' echoing vocals and overall feel, just seemed to fit with them. I grew to love this song in a matter of seconds. It'll have you from the opening vocal line \\"As I reach for a peach...\\" 5/5 <br /> <br />5.) Seamus: Now comes the aforementioned \\"weak song\\". I really just don't like this song. I have nothing against acoustic blues, but it felt out of place. It seemed like filler to me. I just think that if they had gone right from San Tropez into Echoes, it would have been better. 2/5 <br /> <br />6.) Echoes: Clocking in at 23:18, this song is possibly the longest song I have ever heard. It also happens to be one of the best. It's intro is very ethereal, flowing into an early shadow of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt.1\\" Its hard to put into words the rest of this song, just bear in mind it is quirkily beautiful, and thoroughly Pink Floyd. 10/5!    <br /> <br />Buy this album if you already know and love Pink Floyd. I don't reccomend this album to new Pink Floyd fans, just for the simple fact that it still isn't quite as polished as even Dark Side Of The Moon.
B00005JOM9|5.0|Felicity Huffman plays desperate housewife Lynette Scavo on the popular TV miniseries DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, which, though occasionally immensely entertaining, is also Desperately Silly. In TRANSAMERICA, Huffman has a Big Screen gig that should indisputably prove that she's an actress of considerable ability. The other desperate housewives, actresses Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Nicolette Sheridan, can only stand back and envy.<br /><br />Here, Huffman is Bree Osbourne, born Stanley, a California man on the verge of the very last stage of his transgender transference, i.e. genital surgery that will, as he puts it, convert his \\"outey\\" to an \\"inney\\". In every other way, Stanley/Bree already presents to society as a female. What has otherwise been a relatively smooth transition hits a bump when Bree discovers, and must bail out of a New York City jail, his 17-year old transient son, Toby (Kevin Zegers), conceived in a long-ago liaison with a since-deceased girlfriend. Bree's problem is how to get Toby back to the Golden State without revealing to the teenager their biological relationship and the former's genetic gender. What's a poor girl to do?<br /><br />When the creators were sitting around the table discussing casting for this clever film, there had to have been some argument. Do they find a man to play a man morphing to a woman, or a woman to play a man morphing to a woman? Their choice of Huffman was inspired, and it pays off brilliantly. This is perhaps not surprising as the excellent actor William H. Macy is the movie's producer (and, also, Huffman's real-life hubby). Indeed, Felicity's performance is eminently Oscar-worthy, and will be a definite eye-opener to audiences that are only familiar with her DH persona. Also notable in brief supporting roles are Graham Greene as the Navaho rancher, Calvin Manygoats, who gives Bree and Toby a ride after their car is stolen in New Mexico, and Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's distraught and resentful Jewish mother.<br /><br />On the surface, TRANSAMERICA is a four-star, insightful, poignant, and amusing look at the practical problems associated with transgender transition. Huffman's performance, the best I can recall by an actress since Charlize Theron's triumph in MONSTER, elevates it to five-star, must-see status.e surface, TRANSAMERICA is a four-star, insightful, poignant, and amusing look at the practical problems associated with transgender transition.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is an excellent space adventure that hopefully will go down as a classic. Not only does it have an amazing action packed world that blends its own personality with bits of Star Trek and Star Wars, but the characters are rich and it's social commentary gives the film multiple layers.  <br />    <br />   When I saw Serenity I had never seen an episode of Firefly, the TV show that the movie is based on. However, the film is made so that newbies like me can sit down and jump right into the story without leaving the viewer confused.  <br />   <br />   The part of film that makes it truly interesting is that it's storyline is a reflection of events going on in the world today. With the \\"civilized\\" Alliance planets trying to impose their version of society on the Independents. Unfortunately Alliance meddling backfires on them (you'll have to watch the movie to find out how.) The film is clearly underlining western imperialism, and probably the unfolding events in the Middle East. However, if what you're really looking for is a cool space blow 'em up, chop 'em up, ask questions later, Serenity has plenty of that too.

B00003BDXG|1.0|Im reviewing the \\"widescreen\\" release of this movie and not the movie itself (which I give 5 stars). <br /> <br />Basically, this is a 4:3 version, shown in 4:3 with the top and bottom cut off. This is absolutely the dirtiest filthiest trick the studio could pull, and it really ticks me off to have paid money for this. <br /> <br />These studio's wonder why people pirate movies? Well this DVD release is one LOUD and CLEAR reason. I feel they just robbed me with their false advertising of this title - and I'll have to really think about whether I buy a movie from them again. <br /> <br />Sleazy studios. Someone should file a class action suit against them.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|5 stars just cause, I wanna...<br /><br />This movie was recommended to me by my son. So, I finally got it and watched it. WOW. wicked cool. Funny, interesting, insightful.<br /><br />My son, the Marine, over in Iraq, he loves this movie, and I must agree. This is something! Don't you just get tired of the run of the mill, cranked out Hollywood spatter, that we are suppose to rave over, even if we know in our hearts that it's not that great?<br /><br />Well, then, this is a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />The kid, Napoleon, played by Jon Heder, is about as ugly a kid as you'll ever meet. Not terribley bright either. But, there is something loveable about him. Maybe it's the \\"Me\\" in him. He is me, he is you, he represents all of our insecurities, faults, dreams that go unfulfilled. We all blunder, we all blow it, we all have dreams that get poo pooed by a family member or friend. We pretend that it doesn't bother us. but, I think it does.<br /><br />Napoleon embodies all our fears and hopes. that is what makes him so special. His idiot-ness is out, in plane sight,  for all to see. we laugh, but we FEEL him, and FEEL his pain. His family, brother, and uncle, are an extension of his painful dumb-assedness. they are a hoot! but, in a way that is embarrassing. like an uncle that is so absurd, you hope your friends don't come over when he's there, because you will be embarrassed by him.<br /><br />Life isn't all pretty, and we don't all look like Paris or Brittany or Tom or Leonardo.. life is cruel. life is hard. And most all of us can relate to Napoleon. Great acting, great humor. Great humor with a straight face. And great dancing at the end. Which reminds me, I enjoyed his friend, the Mexican kid, can't remember his name. Good on him too!<br /><br />My dear man, Norman, laughed his bum off (can i say ass?) He liked it too.<br /><br />It's a slice of real life, that's what makes it great.<br /><br />thank you, son, be safe.<br />
0062502182|2.0|I found the book very bland and unoriginal.  The plot is similar to old fairy tales, and the ideas are very shallow philosophy.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|5 stars for interesting.<br /><br />Donnie Darko is my son's favorite film. so, I bought it and watched it, last night, with my sweet hubby Norman. He hates \\"horror\\" movies, this is not a horror movie.<br /><br />My son is dark, mysterious, obsessed with death and things that go bump in the night.. As I watched this DVD, I could see why my son loves it. He is a Marine, off in Iraq right now. Bless his heart. So, to feel close to him, I watched this and his other fav - \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\" That one is another story.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect for this roll. Couldn't have been done by anyone else. He had the looks down pat. the head down and look up, look. The innocent smile. The evil smile. The fear. The horny kid at the therapist.. He was made for this roll! He was excellent.<br /><br />The girlfriend, also very good. As were the mom, dad, sisters. all good, but, could have been done by most anyone. I was pleasantly surprised to see Drew Barrymore, and Noah Willey as teachers. Oh, and the shrill-voiced prude teacher - perfect.<br /><br />oh, geepers - the small, but important roll played by Patrick Swayze - that was something!<br /><br />Our dear Donnie... every mother's fear, to have a troubled son like this. As a mommy, I could relate. You want so bad for your kids to be happy, well adjusted, and SANE. But, Donnie is not any of those. He is troubled. He has visions and sees his friend Frank. Frank is a wee bit creepy, but, not scary really. and, in the end, we know where Frank came from.<br /><br />The most interesting and different ending ever. Not a cranked out \\"Hollywood\\" happy ending with all loose ends tied up. Nope. Sorry. You walk away with more questions. I like that.<br /><br />My Norman was confused. Not me. I \\"got it\\" and got it all. Which is funny, because he's the PHD scientist. Some men, well, they think too hard. You know what I mean? When you watch this, just let it flow, like a river, you can't control it, just experience it.<br /><br />So, allow me a toast to my son, in Iraq. \\"I watched your favorite movie, dear, and loved it! stay safe. come home soon. love mom.\\"xperience it.  <br /> <br />So, allow me a toast to my son, in Iraq. \\"I watched your favorite movie, dear, and loved it! stay safe. come home soon. love mom.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000OAC|5.0|This classic opens with the familiar thunder of \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\". Then they rip into \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" a hyperactive classic. Next is May's sentimental \\"All Dead All Dead\\" which I have heard is  written about the loss of his pet cat. Other outstanding songs are \\"Fight From The Inside\\" one of Taylor's rowdiest and best efforts. \\"Get Down Make Love\\" is one of Mercury's most amazing and sexy songs. May's \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\" is a catchy song about a musical icon who goes back to his roots. \\"Who Needs You\\" is a latin style tune with clever lyrics by John Deacon, and equally clever guitar courtesy of May. \\"It's Late\\" is one of my favorite Queen songs and it rocks! This incredible album closes with Mercury's genius and gorgeous piano on \\"My Melancholy Blues\\". This is the album that got me hooked many years ago (when it was new) and made me the Queen addict I will always be. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love it. Joss Whedon rocks my socks.
B000000OAA|4.0|I love what I hear and I wasn't a great fan of Queen at the time, but loved a handful of their songs. You definitely do them justice. I played guitar, frettless bass, piano, trumpet/flugelhorn for over (20) twenty years with the same band. We did 98% all original compositions. I have been around for awhile and have played horns in Jazz bands.  <br />SUGGESTION: If you can get your habds on a nice harmonizer to really fill those super high Mercurian vocals no one can ever say you are anything but the best. <br />Thanks for listening and best of luck. I would do anything to be back in your shoes again.
B000001EMW|5.0|In my opinion, a great album should do one of two things: 1) it should introduce you to something new, and 2) it should stand up to repeated listening. A phenomenal album does both. That's exactly the label I'd give to \\"Plays Metallica by Four Cellos.\\"     I was not much of a Metallica fan when I was introduced to Apocalyptica. I thought it would be interesting for the novelty, so I took it home and gave it a few spins. By the fifth listen, I started to catch all the nuances and craftsmanship in the music, and by the tenth I realized that this was a truly groundbreaking sound.     String Quartet Tributes are starting to pop up all over the place; Apocalyptica distinguishes itself from those out-for-a-quick-buck releases by demonstrating, through each of the 8 tracks, a genuine love for Metallica. The music is faithfully reproduced, right down to the vocals, in cello form. In the process, the songs are lovingly elevated from 'just' metal into incredibly artistic compositions.     This album made me a diehard fan, not of just Apocalyptica, but of Metallica as well. After hearing these versions, I was able to go back to the originals and experience much more of the depth and layering. From there, I began to enjoy songs that Apocalyptica didn't cover, and a fan was born.     This album has stood the test of time for over 5 years now. I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of Metallica or people looking to try something new. It may surprise you.     Incidentally, Apocalyptica puts on an amazing live show. See them if you can!
B00005K3LW|5.0|WONDERFUL! YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE LAST DIE HARD MOVIE, AND AS THE FIRST WAS A 10/10 AND THE NEXT WAS AN 11/10, THIS ONE WAS A 12/10!!!!!!!!!! OH JOHN MCTEIRNAN! I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DOWN! SO FAR, DIE HARD IS THE ONLY SERIES WITH EVERYTHING BEING 5 F**KING STARS! Ok, I really need to breathe (woooooooooo-hhhoooooooo)Much better. Okay, on to what this movie is about. John McClane is being stalked by someone who has blown up part of a city block. At first, all we know is that this someone has an axe to grind with him, and that unless John does exactly as he says, he will destroy more property and kill more people without any hesitation or mercy. First, he tells John to stand in the road with a sign that says: \\"I HATE N***ERS\\" WHAT A VILLAIN! HE'S MAKING JOHN BE RACIST AND IF JOHN DOESN'T DO IT, HE'LL KILL MORE INNOCENTS! THAT'S EVIL PERFECTION LADIES & GENTS!  Soon, John gets the attention of a store runner, who seems not to be too pleased with white people, or at least the majority of them. John is attacked by black teens who have no clue that he's doing this for lives, but the store runner, an African American by the name of Zeus(yeah, like the Greek God, as he said \\"You climb up on my Olympus, I shove a lightning bolt up yo ass Zeus! You got a problem with that?!?)saves his life because John has explained what is going on. Soon, the two team up, with John's    police friends trying to find out who the hell this maniac is &  why he's so focused on getting to John he'll do anything. John and Zeus look around for clues, calling the villain on the phone for what they need to do next if they want New York to live. Soon both of them are stealing taxis, jumping on trains, running all over the place, solving puzzles to disarm bombs, getting into arguments with each other, and facing all sorts of deception and treachery. Finally they find out that the man who is behind all this is none other than Simon Gruber, the older brother ofHans Gruber, who John killed in the first Die Hard movie. Seems he found out what John did, and he's looking for more than a simple apology. John and Zeus soon get into all sorts of vehicles, and  are in fights on foot, in bulldozers, in the pouring rain and/or flooding pipe water and of course on Simon Gruber's boat. In all of this, they gun down a lot of Simon's terrorists, and the rest they kill by turning the car over, beating them with anything around that could be used as a weapon, including their fists, or  <br />ripping them in half with ropes. Soon enough, Simon has done his share of damage, and the two heroes are tied to a pole in a room where a bomb is about to explode and blow them to kingdom come. But they find a way out, and they manage to get off the boat, find that Simon still has more men, off those men with firearms & explosives,& then John finally manages to destroy Simon himself.  Simon tries, along with the last man he has, to get away in a helicopter. But even after all his tricks, all his assaults on schools and the people of New York and all the gold & other sort of money he stole, that is not enough to save him or the man he's with from a large explosive fired upon the helicopter by John. The copter explodes, goes down in fire, and takes Simon and his buddy with it. If the explosion didn't kill them(which it most likely did anyway)the fire surely will. John then remembers the argument he had with his wife. Zeus sees a phone, and suggests he use that to talk to her. John says: \\"You know my wife. She's a stubborn woman!\\" But he laughs & calls her anyway. End of series.  <br /> <br />Now for the good things and bad things in this perfect conclusion <br /> <br />The Good Things <br /> <br />There's much more action & lots more blood/gore than the first 2 <br /> <br />There's lots of funny/cool/interesting quotes, many with cursing <br /> <br />John is much cooler than he was in the first two in this one <br /> <br />Zeus is a unique hero. He pretends not to care but really does <br /> <br />Simon was a terrific villain. As a matter of fact, he is my 2nd favorite Die Hard villain next to Stuart. Hans is 3rd, of course <br /> <br />There was even this one scene where the nastiest & coolest b*tch you'll ever have the misfortune to meet slashed a guy to death with a knife and kept slashing after that until Simon stopped her <br /> <br />Not only were the fight scenes well organized and guns along with knives were used, but the director even went so far as to use all the explosives he could recall off the top of his head. Chilling <br /> <br />The famous movie ending line \\"Yippie Kay Yay, motherf**ker!\\" is used by John McClane to wrap up the finale of the series. I loved it when he used that line in the first 2, I love it now. Period.  <br /> <br />We get to see a flashback of Hans Gruber's death in the 1st movie  <br /> <br />The Bad Things <br /> <br />What bad things?  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like terrorist fighting/action and adventure films this is for you. It is also for you if you like movies, period. I am Alex AKA Catman(due to my love of big cats)Happy New Year!!!!
B000002KHH|5.0|Everybody says that Paranoid is Sabbath's best but I personally enjoy Master of Reality more.  Paranoid is also cited as one of the best metal albums of all time which I agree with but I also believe the self titled, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath are also amazing.  Though I hate it when you go up to people and ask them if they like Black Sabbath and they only know the songs \\"Paranoid\\", \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man\\".  Which aren't bad songs but are over played on the radio and can get annoying.  On the positive note I love \\"Electric Funeral\\", \\"Planet Caravan\\", \\"Hand of Doom\\" and all the other songs.  No metalhead can deem themselves worthy of being fully metal at all unless they own a copy of this.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|wow, koRn has finally done it!  This is probably their best work since their self titled debut album, life is peachy and follow the leader!  this really puts them in a different state of mind musically and emotionally. no more talking about bad childhoods, something different!  KoRn, keep on rocking your doing it! my fav. tracks are TearJerker, and Hypocrite, and Love Song
B000002IFP|4.0|Yes, I loved this one. The CD has two real killers - \\"Love Lays It's tune (which may be Mick's best song ever - absolute genius), and \\"You Got It\\". I rank it in a 4th place tie with \\"Russian Winter\\" as an overall ranking compared with the other Simply Red stuff. Mick has never had a bad offering and anyone should love this one. I am partial to his \\"newer\\" stuff so this is going back a ways for me.
B000BHN7DE|5.0|Anastacia is perhaps one of the strongest and most soulful voices in pop music today. She is also a huge superstar in most of the world (except for urban music dominated US), and \\"Pieces of a Dream\\" only does her justice by offering up an excellent collection of her hit tracks from the last decade, as well as a bonus remix CD with mixes by some of the hottest DJs of our time including Hex Hector, Jason Nevins, Barry Harris/Chris Cox and Norty Cotto. Putting Anastacia's lack of US success aside (purely an outcome of poor marketing), her music is a brilliant combination of dance-pop, hook-laden lyrics, strong beats, R&B, soul and rock music.  <br />Starting with her first big single \\"I'm Outta Love\\", Disc 1 takes you on a journey through hot Anastacia trademark track-after-track including \\"Paid My Dues\\", \\"One Day in Your Life\\", \\"Left Outside Alone\\" (brilliant) and \\"Sick and Tired\\" (wow). Some of the newer tracks include \\"Heavy on my Heart\\" and \\"Everything Burns\\" - all of these offer a rock-heavy sound, with Anastacia's deep voice working brilliantly against introspective lyrics and heavy guitar riffs. The Club Megamix that closes this set is a drawn out but deserving tribute to Anastacia's music that has burned through the dance charts year after year.  <br />Disc 2 offers a solid goldmine of dance classics (prepare for spine-shivering dance music) with the Hex mix of \\"I'm Outta Love\\" and \\"One Day in Your Life\\", the Thunderpuss mix of Chicago's \\"Love is a Crime\\", and brilliant mixes of club classics like \\"Left Outside Alone\\", \\"Boom\\" and \\"Paid My Dues.\\" But it is the Jason Nevins remixes of \\"Sick and Tired\\" that catapult this remix CD into a league of its own, with thumping beats, a haunting chant and fierce vocals, Anastacia really outdoes herself with this single.  <br />The hard cover booklet that this best-of set come in is of value as well, with great images, lyrics and detail on this talented artist.  <br />
B0000AM6LY|3.0|Ok, I gave it a 3 and it hurt to do it. I love Mick Hucknall, and I was so excited  when this CD was released because like all Red fans, I had been hoping for something new. I love the title track and Sunrise is special, but much of the rest is just not up to the incredible standards set in the past. I want more original tunes from this guy. The clever insite shown in his lyrics from past outings just wasn't there. I could never give a Red album less than a 3, but I was let down.
B0001B3YTM|5.0|I got both \\"Firefly: The Series\\" and the movie \\"Serenity\\" for Christmas.  The former is the late lamented television show that was the brainchild of Joss Whedon, creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" (which explains why the title \\"Joss Whedon's 'Firefly'\\" appears a lot).  The four-DVD set \\"Firefly: The Complete Series,\\" includes all 15 episodes of the series, which is set 500 years in the future and reminds those of a sense of television history that \\"Star Trek\\" was originally sold as \\"Wagon Train\\" to the stars, because the western elements of this series are as strong as the science fiction elements.<br /><br />Since this is a Joss Whedon creation the obvious question is what sort of twists did he put into this one? The most obvious is that this is a science fiction series without aliens. Apparently there was nobody out there after all (or else they are hiding really well). The other major twist is that in the future there were just two superpowers, the United States and China, which explains why the characters tend to curse in Chinese now and then. I think if more people had known that there was a television show that was more explicit that \\"South Park\\" that would have meant high enough ratings for \\"Firefly\\" to survive. Finally, you have to appreciate that if this is Western set in outer space it is one that existed after the Civil War. Clearly Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has the die-hard spirit of a bitter Confederate veteran.<br /><br />From my perspective the only real problem with \\"Firefly\\" is that it lacks a strong story arc for this abbreviated first season. I might be making too much of this, but one of the strengths of Whedon's other shows was that he always makes excellent use of story arcs, using by wedding a first half story arc to another one in the second half of season. The closest things we have to driving story arcs are (1) the mysterious Alliance forces trying to capture River (Summer Glau) and her brother Simon (Sean Maher) and (2) Mal and Irana (Morena Baccarin) wasting time insulting each other instead of getting on to business (so to speak). Both of those are clearly there, but things were progressing too slowly for my taste. I know Whedon had some big payoff for the first one, but he was keeping it awfully close to the vest and if this revelation is not a major part of the planned movie, I will be totally surprised.<br /><br />The strength of the series is in the characters of the crew, all of who are realized with some degree of depth. My favorite was Kaylee (Jewel Staite), who was smart as she was cute, a killer combination in my book. Captain Mal Reynolds was the most fully realized of the crew, mainly because he had a pivotal role in most of the episodes, but with the rest of the crew of \\"Serenity\\" you know there was more to come. We got a little of the back story on what Mal and Zoë (Gina Torres) did during the big war, and there was a flashback that told how Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and the rest of the crew were hired on by Mal. But it is the secret behind River Tam's strange condition that is is going to be the key in everything that happens next, which you will now when you watch \\"Serenity.\\" It was also great to see Ron Glass as another familiar face in the regular cast.<br /><br />Of the 15 episodes collected here eight of them have commentary by various cast members (Fillion, Baccarin, Tudyk, and Staite) and writers (Whedon, Tim Minear, and Jane Espenson) and others.  The additoinal special features include three behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, Alan Tudyk's audition, Joss Whedon singing the \\"Firefly\\" Theme, and a gag reel (the last three are actually three separate things).  Each DVD comes with its own thin plastic CD box with shots of Mal Reynold, Shepard Book, Jayne Cobb, and Zoe Washburne posing in front of assorted nebulas on the respective covers (Notice that the alien landscape continues inside the slipcase).<br /><br />The more I watch \\"Firefly\\" the more it grows on me (Kaylee is currently my favorite character with her combination of cuteness and competence, although after watching \\"Serenity\\" it is hard not to be totally captivated by Summer Glau's River).  I just wish \\"Firefly\\" had not come at the expense of \\"Dark Angel\\" in terms of FOX's willingness to spend money on a show with a big special effects budget.  The irony that both shows were gone before the 2002-03 season was half over is not lost on me either. In a much better world than this one both shows would have survived, but having neither is really the short end of the stick for fans of science fiction on television.\\"Firefly\\" the more it grows on me (Kaylee is currently my favorite character with her combination of cuteness and competence, although after watching \\"Serenity\\" it is hard not to be totally captivated by Summer Glau's River).

B00080Z53O|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie - loved it, loved it, loved it!! It's beautiful, moving, lyrical and poetic. The commentry by Alejandro Amenbar included in the special features is equally fascinating and a virtual film class. This truly is a must see and worthy of sharing with others!
0440241588|5.0|an outgoing president pardons a few people as his last official act. one of them once was a successful broker who was accused of treason and took a guilty plea to spare his law firm and son prosecuton. now after 6 years in solitary confinement, he finds himself a free man living in italy, but also hiding from the people who would love to see him dead.  <br /> <br />this story revolves around the enemies who would like to keep him alive for their own purposes, and the ones who will stop at nothing to get the secrets he know and then dispose of him. <br /> <br />this book was good until you got to the end. the ending left you saying where is the rest of the story. a disappointment after such a good read.
B00000272N|5.0|This is definatly my favorite Alice in Chains Album. Over the past few years I strayed away from rock into hiphop because I started to find it boring. This album however is still one of my favorites. <br />Its full of heavy riffs but isn't repetitive, and Layne (r.i.p) has a great voice. I like this more than dirt, which seems to be their most popular album, because it all the tracks are great, no fillers.
0440234743|5.0|this is the story of an old rich man's revenge. he is worth billions and leaves his 6 children with the impression that they are about to inherit everything. a last minute change of the will leaves the entire fortune to a daughter no one has ever heard of. so the whole estate gets tied up in probate court whereas a brave lawyer goes and tries to find a woman who does not want to be found or bothered.  <br /> <br />now the book is excellent in it's presentation. my only problem is that i figured out the ending long before it transpired. i like to be surprised. if you think about it you probaly will too.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this CD, Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and I see them in concert every time they come to Seattle.  HOWEVER, some of you may know about the Sony rootkit fiasco, where Sony installed what was essentially spyware on the computers of people that bought the CD, it appears that Virgin is doing the same thing.  If you buy this CD and you are on a Windows PC, make sure, before you put the CD into your drive that you turn off AutoRun.
B00004VXF2|5.0|First of all, I love this album. It's the kind of music I like; music that becomes more of a \\"thing\\" than just music.<br /><br />Secondly, why are so many people shocked by this album? Why is this so difficult? In the realm of left-field avant-experimentation this should have been a no-brainer, especially for those of the Velvet-loving persuasion. Nico's Marble Index had no rhythm or progression: Why be shocked by an album with no polarity or tone?<br /><br />I myself hate the noise-rock scene/movement and I hate the hype around it. It's not experimental because it's got a pretty significant and accepting fanebase, unlike when Lou definately took a plunge by dropping MMM. It's actually kind of sad how truly misunderstood this great album is: It was mostly rejected at its birth and is now being blindly accepted in its rebirth by indie kids as an indie Holy Grail of cred. If you listen to mostly noise-rock I don't see how purchasing this record would make a difference in your collection since noise-rock all sounds exactly the same anyway. Though if you truly love the art of experimenting, I recommend this highly along side Erik Satie, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and ritual Tibetan music.<br /><br />And \\"Part IV\\" is probably the best track on Metal Machine Music.
B00029LNHS|5.0|I love the guys, the music and the lyrics. I can not not enjoy any of their music when I listen to it wherever I might be.<br />I think this CD Broke the record in the number of weeks in my car magazine. I don't get bored.<br /><br />\\"Let's get it started\\" & \\"Hey Mama\\" are out of this world
B000B5IPLK|1.0|I'm sorry I know some of you will click the button dissing me without reading what I have to say because I gave the cd only one star. The reason I did that is because of the single \\"Unbreakable\\". I know that this single is popular now but it's wrong. \\"We can fight like Ike and Tina.\\" Ike and Tina didn't fight she got the sh** beat out of her for several years until she decided to fight back and leave Ike. Any person or any woman for that matter who can right a song and use another's woman's abuse in her lyrics and then go so far as to have the song produced and released needs to find herself some direction.
0385507755|4.0|At least Chuck Baris' book was half true.  I just finished this book and enjoyed it.  It was 90% fiction. I can live with that if he can just admit it on Oprah.<br /><br />Most people you meet in rehab survived believing their own lies long after everyone else caught on.  Don't be fooled by this guy.  Like Chuck Baris, his lies are woven into story lines that are held confidential by the unnamed rehab center or by fabricated dead people.<br /><br />I dreaded that eventually he would become a flaming 12 stepper...thank Hercules that never happened.  Though if he would have followed AA he would have written a more honest memoir.<br /><br />There is a lot of good truths in this book spiced up by self-aggrandizing fictional plot twists.  Beating up the molester priest on the way to jumping off a bridge in Paris (ya right) and the love story sub plots (convieniently kills herself just when he gets out of jail) were obvious fabrications intending to prove to the reader that Jimbo IS NOT GAY. Even though he got himself a SUGAR DADDY Leonard. Now he's got Oprah for a SD. Oy!<br /><br />I will enjoy reading this fiction again and just hope this will never be made into a movie starring Danny Boniduce.
B00000DQWT|5.0|This soundtrack lifts the spirit or relaxes the weary and tired soul from a day's worth of hard labor. It actually does both. I distinctly remember hearing a couple of tunes off this sound track in the 80's on light pop and jazz contemporary stations. In one case, those tracks recevied popular airplay on what was then called a \\"rock album pre-alternative\\" station. Many pop radio stations of the time as well as Top 40 outlets could not easily categorize the music;Therefore, it received little or no air play at all from them... <br /> <br />Pat Metheny as an artist has always had a cult following with his music.Some thought his own blend of contemporary, instrumental jazz musings were what the 70's folk and flower children listened to in the 80's. It was a musical venue for those wanting something different and not the norm that had already gone through the hippy movement and post-Viet Nam era...Metheny's music is not only mesmerizing and artistically all encompassing , but there is something very intellectual about it. Hard to put the finger on it, though...In no way is his music elevator muzak. He's not Kenny G. folks.  David Bowie also outdoes himself offering possibly his best vocal artistry for the 80's,post Let's Dance album days.A pinnacle? maybe. If the Let's Dance c.d. were to be re-issued again, This Is Not America would be a track worthy to fit in with the rest of that particular album's songs and not seem like an afterthought;It would blend in seamlessly like it was meant for the Let's Dance project ! <br /> <br />Pat Metheny and Bowie could have easily taken the easy way out and immersed the entire soundtrack in the styles of 80's pop rock or New Wave;styles which were prevalent with other films of that decade. Instead, an awesome tapestry of various genres that have stood the test of time were utilized: spiritual choir music,hints of classical intermixed with light jazz influences,and adult contemporary music stylings, some faint light guitar rock work (Extent Of The Lie),orchestration.Tracks 6,7, and 8 are mood pieces that,even without seeing the film,you can tell are for key action sequences with their haunting synthesized effects and ambiance. In sum, the collage or variety makes the soundtrack very rich and fulfilling and also works coherently.It all stands the test of time pretty well for a 20 year old soundtrack. Nothing sticks out like a sore thumb. Not a single toss out track on this disc...Some who hear the haunting lyrics of This Is Not America (Snowman melting from the inside,falcon spirals to the ground) and have not seen the film will wonder about the meaning. I have not seen the film myself. Despite this, the music is pure mental nourishment that I can conjure up my own visuals or \\"music videos\\"...The film, from what I do know, is about a couple of young American men in the 1970's who become disillusioned with America and the government that they become Soviet spies and traitors to the U.S. Their lives are never the same. This is all based on a true story. I'm sure in seeing the film on dvd it would probably enhance my overall listening experience of the soundtrack.Snowman and the Falcon receives plenty of rotation play in a couple of my stereo systems at home and makes a fantastic cd to lull me to sleep(not in the bad sense as in boredom). I cannot find an ounce of boredom in this soundtrack !I highly regard The Falcon And The Snowman as one of my all-time favorite movie soundtracks !
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I was nervous, I must admit.  After I heard the news that Robbie and Guy Chambers were going their separate ways, I did not think that Robbie's next album would live up to its predecessors.  I am happy to admit that I was wrong. <br /> <br />The opening song, \\"Ghosts\\", is truly haunting (no pun intended....well, maybe a bit).  It is my favourite song on the album.  It is about love lost, which seems to be a topic that Robbie speaks of quite often. <br /> <br />\\"Tripping\\" is a brilliant single.  It took me a few listens before I warmed up to it, but I now enjoy its reggae and pop infusion quite thoroughly. <br /> <br />Other faves on the album include \\"Advertising Space\\" (his next single), \\"Please Don't Die\\", \\"Sin Sin Sin\\", and \\"A Place To Crash\\". <br /> <br />All in all, Robbie is evolving as an artist, this time without the security of Guy to back him up.  Robbie is moving on, and it shows.  I have to say that this CD is definitely on my list of favourite albums of all time. <br /> <br />I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|This is a movie I enjoyed a lot more than I expected I would.  Joss Whedon has a thing for telling stories about very small women, girls really, doing really big things.  It is not unlike Buffy in its broad gesture, but very different in its specifics.  Like most space stories it is really a story that would have been a sea story a hundred years ago.  The characters even refer to their spaceship as a boat.  Being a space story of some indefinite time period allows for everything to be more extreme and even disorienting.<br /><br />The broad range of characters from the half-crazed waif, River, and her doctor brother, to the boat's motley crew, through the seemingly invincible \\"operative\\", to the Reavers themselves there is a lot to notice and enjoy.  Nathan Fillion as the boat's captain does the hero's job quite well while Summer Glau fill's the River role with all the insanity and power the role demands.  Whedon shoots her face at all kinds of very odd angles to play up strangeness and mystery.<br /><br />There are several love interests in the story all of a different kind of love.  We have the husband and wife love between Zoe (weapons officer) and Wash (the great pilot), then the brother and sister devotional love of Simon (the doctor) and River (Glau), and the new romance love developing between Simon and Kayee (Jewell Staite).  And what about the weird relationship between \\"Mr. Universe\\" (David Krumholtz) and his lovebot?  Of course, there is some kind of relationship between Captain Mal and Inara as well.<br /><br />The payoff of the movie is pretty good, if not particularly subtle.  But I don't expect intellectual stuff from Buffy either.  It is what it is, and that is pretty fun.  Isn't that enough?
0446577383|1.0|This book is a bucket excrement. David Baldacci you are one stupid man. Notice I say stupid because this terrible book comes from someone whow is proud of not knowing history and even current events. Stupid is intentional, while ignorance is accidental. <br />I don't normally read popular fiction because popular almost always means inferior. I can't believe that anyone is publishing such garbage. <br />Warner Books you have brought publishing to a new low. <br /> <br />1. Lame, silly characters. Don't relate to how people act or react to others anywhere on this planet. <br />2. Baldacci must live in a neo-hippie world of his own making. I can't think of any of the trash that was written in the 1960's by real hippies that makes less sense as to how the real world operates. Baldacci you live in a fantasy world, of your own making, that is so far removed from reality. Pull your head out of your ass. <br />3. Baldacci tries to make it look like he knows something about the Koran but puts off anything negative as being only cultural and mostly not written in the Koran. There is no excuse for this. Anyone can go out and purchase an English interpretation of the Koran and have a copy of it. You can even find free English interpretations of it on the internet. Instead of having people tell you what is in the Koran, read it for yourself, it is a small book. Muslims aren't ashamed of passages that tell you to beat your wife if she is disobedient. And what \\"beat\\" means you can find out by Saudi Arabian telecasts where the iman has an eight foot long wooden rod. Baldacci's ignorant premise is that Islam is basically tolerant and reasonable with rest of the world and just wants peace. See my list of countries in the next section. <br />4. Baldacci's premise is that the US and the US alone is the cause for the world being so screwed up. The US spy agencies and US corporations have brought down democratic movements all over the world. Let's see, the US is the prime cause of the Soviet Union, China, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia(Soviets poured millions of weapons into the county in the 1960's), Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Nigeria(muslem minority runs the corrupt government), Congo, Liberia (Taylor was a friend of the US, yeah right!), Rowanda. The rest of Africa. Africa has been left alone by the US (even Somalia was nothing, they went back to killing each other in lovely Muslim Somalia). How about Asia: We definitely interfered in Vietnam, Loas and Cambodia. Maybe this makes the US responsible for the Muslim insurgency in Thailand, 300 million Muslims in India that want a Muslim state and Sharia rule over the 800 million Hindus, Pakistan (US is the cause for this failed society, yeah right!), Bangladesh, Bali, East Timor. Can you see a patern here, Communism or even more of a problem, Muslim intolerance. US support for Israel and Egypt has nothing to do with any of the countries I listed. I didn't write about East and West Europe, Latin and South America, Pacific Islanders, etc.... We can go on and on. US interfernce isn't the cause of the economic collapse of countries like Argentina and Venezuela, 40 or more years of socialism is. How about lovely, corrupt Mexico? Did the US create the Mexican Oligarchy, are we sustaining it or rigging their \\"Democratic\\" elections? Mexico is right on our border. <br />4.Here is something so idiotic that he writes: US consumption is destroying the world. How can anyone be so stupid. If you took out all US consumption of resources tomorrow then billions of people would have no jobs and would face starvation and death. Consumption equals jobs. How can a person not know even the basics of economics and be so stupid (this is not ignorance). Consumption is good and crying about the fact that wealth isn't distibuted fairly is not caused by the US but all these corrupt people and their failed societies. Thank goodness the US is here in this world or else they would have nothing. But Neo-Hippies like Baldacci don't actually care about anyone. He evens states that other countries can't get energy because the US is using it all. What a goofball, you live in La-La Land. <br />5. Go on and hate your country Baldacci. You are most sick.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|This movie was excellent.  It borrows a lot from the original with incredible special effects and amazing recreations of 1931 New York!  King Kong finally moves like a real gorilla and the destruction that gets wrecked throughout the movie is very convincing!  The natives of this movie look like something out of the Exorcist although there was a tribute to the original natives during the scene where Kong is displayed to the New York public at the theater. <br /> <br />There are a lot more dinousaurs in this one including a lot of prehistoric insect creatures that look convincingly real.  I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:  <br />- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long <br />- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham <br />- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen.  I am sure people being introduced to Kong for the first time will love it!
0553801503|3.0|I am a huge GRRM fan and savored every detail.  I remember him telling readers that the devil is in the details...well, I spent the Brienne chapters in a hellish place.  The Lannister chapters, however, balanced the boredom of Brienne.  The point of greatest intensity was definitely the capture of Cersei.  I still look forward to Book 5.
0740748475|5.0|If you love Calvin and Hobbes, as I do, this is a must have collection.  These three nicely bound and well presented volumes provide every Calvin and Hobbes comic strip ever published, 1985-1995. <br /> <br />There is also an introduction by Bill Watterson covering his background and way of thinking that sheds a lot of light on some of the humor and skits that appear in the comic strip. <br /> <br />The collection comes in three over size volumes with a sturdy slip case.  The comics are well presented in both black and white and color, just as they appeared in newspapers.  The books are large and a bit heavy so you won't be lugging this onto the subway with you.  But they are great to enjoy at home and will provide nostalgia and lots of laughs for people who followed and enjoyed the comic strip for years. <br /> <br />This collection is well worth the price.
B0002X314C|4.0|No those 4 stars are not for his great singing voice but it's for his pure talent. He's not the second coming of Luther Vandross or Teddy Pendergrass but if he keep it up he may be the next Stevie Wonder (Doubt it but you never know) <br />If he stay true to music like he has done on this CD this guy will be a great music maker. The lyrics are strong enough to leave you wanting more and you just might have to dig you out some Stevie. He's the male version of Alicia Keys and you just gotta love that!
B000BTJDGC|1.0|Watching the trailers I was totally pumped to go see this movie.  \\"Emily Rose\\" looked to be the next \\"Exorist\\".  I thought this movie was gonna be really creepy like the trailer made it out to be.  WRONG!!!!  This movie is nothing like it is advertised as being.  This movie is a courtroom drama, the stuff in the previews only last for about 1/2 an hour, and is only used to debunk anything supernatural going on in the movie.  The movie itself is not half bad, it's not great either, definatly not one of the best pictures of the year by any means though.  I might have given this a better rating had I known what I was going to see, I like courtroom movies, but I don't like paying $20 to go see something that turns out to be something completely different.  So in closing(and this is a stretch, I know), I ask that no one go out and buy or rent this film, let's tell the studio's that this, what they did is not okay.  What they've done is gone out and stolen from anyone who wnet to see this film through false advertisement, and that to me is a pretty low blow.  \\"F\\" Sony, they should know better.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Yes I am a Whitney fan but I got to give it up to Mariah she's back in rare form. This is inspiration that Whitney can make this sort of comeback! <br /> <br />Mariah was in excellent recording voice! This is one of her best CD's. She show's that she can still fly into that upper register. In \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" She sings in that Whistle Register with as much ease as Minnie Ripperton. This is suppose to be like a Gospel type song because I know they released it to those stations as a single. <br /> <br />\\"We Belong Together\\" is another great song but I am in love with the song \\"Mine Again\\" once again she is hitting those notes like Minnie Ripperton. \\"Mine Again\\" sounds like some old school R&B like something Angela Winbush would have recorded. One of the best CD's you are going to find today.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I remember when I first saw the preview for this movie in theatres. I was going to go see \\"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,\\" which is another movie and book series that I strongly recommend. Anyway, I was very doubtful. Tim Burton is, and always was, my favorite movie director. I still remember the first of his films I ever saw: \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\" Burton has an imagination all his own that I love so much, and can see in every one of his movies. However, I have seen \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" (made by the same film studio: Warner Brothers) starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, and I have loved it for years. It was a \\"golden\\" movie to me. When I saw the first moments of the preview for this movie for the first time, I thought that Warner Brothers had finally decided to put Roald Dahl's book \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\\" on the big screen. I was wrong of course. Having seen \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" as many times as I have and loving it so much, I almost did not go to see this, until I learned who was directing it.<br /><br />I saw it, keeping an open-mind. I kept saying to myself: \\"Tim Burton directed this\\" as the movie began. Let me just say what happened to me. I was Wonka-fied all over again. I saw it (this movie) a total 5 times in theatres (which is a lot considering I cannot drive) and special ordered it, deluxe 2-disc edition, from Amazon.com. By special order, I mean that I payed the $3.99 extra to have it as one-day shipping (I am an Amazon.com prime member as I write this review).<br /><br />It is Wonka. Johnny Depp was great. My favorite Wonka movie? For me, it's a tie. Really it is. Tim Burton had some obstacles to overcome to do this movie, and I think he passed them with flying colors. Have a Wonka-tafic day!

B000BJS4TO|4.0|I was quite surprised with the music soundtrack, and loved the flow of music.  I was quite surprised that after viewing the movie and listening to the music, to find out it was composed by John Williams.  Just the soft and calm feeling of the music assumed it was Hans Zimmer's work.  But BRAVO to Williams.   <br /> <br />Personally my favorites in the soundtrack are Chairman's Waltz, Sayuri's Theme and Sayuri's Theme and End Credits.  The excellent combination of Yo Yo Ma and Perlman increases the calm and swaying mood of this sensational soundtrack.  I'll be sure to buy it for myself. <br /> <br />To answer Lucky Strike \\"Joan\\"'s question, many movie trailers take music from other soundtracks to make people interested in the upcoming movie.  For example, the trailer for K-19:The Widowmaker, included music from Gladiator's soundtrack (The Gladiator Waltz, Year 2000), however its movie soundtrack sounds nothing like Gladiator's. <br />The trailer to Memoirs of a Geisha includes the song \\"Red Warrior\\" from the Last Samurai Soundtrack.  However this does not always mean that the soundtrack is the same as the trailer's music.  I hope this helps you.   <br />I give the soundtrack 4 stars for chilling and beautiful music by John Williams.
0553801503|3.0|It troubles me to make the comparison, yet it's what I've come away with after reading the book. I truly love the series and A Feast for Crows had its moments, but was dissapointing compared to the other books in the series. Hopefully a special edition will be published to include books 4 and 5. So much potential wasted here.  <br /> <br />Edit: I've read all the series books in the last month since hearing about this author. I had no idea it was 5 years between books 3 and 4. If I were a longtime reader, I'd have to pull a Stannis and take a knuckle from the author! For shame!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I have nothing to add to my review of the DVD of the Albert Hall performances.<br /><br />I would only say that having been wowed so much by the DVD I had to buy the CD if only to listen to in the car.<br /><br />If you have the CD and you have not checked out the DVD yet, I would strongly advise you to do so.<br /><br />This must be one of the performances of the year and I want to put in a plug to anyone reading this from the record compnay... CAN WE PLEASE HAVE ALL OF THE PERFORMANCES RELEASED IN ORDER.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00005JOHI|5.0|I have been a longtime Jane Austen convert, for as long as I can remember.  \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" one of her most well-known and well-loved stories, has been brought to the screen a total of three times (prior to this new 2005 version).  The previous versions were made in 1940 (with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier), 1985 (with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul), and in 1996 (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle).<br /><br />This new version, with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden, is intelligent, witty and very sensuous in its adaptation.  Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is one of five daughters of the \\"have not\\" Bennett family, and her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is anxious to marry them off.  Once Elizabeth encounters Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who comes from great material wealth, but who lacks a lust for life, it is clear that the unlikely pair has been brought together for a reason, bigger than the both of them.<br /><br />This is an excellent character study and social commentary, on the state of the British class system and the pursuit of true love.  What's more, the actors in this film shine brightly and have great onscreen chemistry.  The photography is luscious, the story is engaging, and this is definitely NOT a chick flick.  I saw several men in the audience, and heard them chuckling warmly in the darkness of the movie theater.  Check it out!!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I checked out this show on the strength of Joss Whedon's recommendation.  I'm a HUGE Buffy fan!  It took a couple episodes for me to come to terms with Veronica Mars because it's NOT Buffy!  Yes, a cool chick...Yes, a California High School.  But Veronica Mars is more like Lost than Buffy.  Like Lost, there's a continuing mystery interspersed with the subplots of each episode.  And like Lost, flashbacks are used to brilliant effect to give us information on a need-to-know basis.  And, like Lost, the twists and surprises are plentiful! <br /> <br />Yeah, Veronica Mars may not be Buffy, but she's definitely worth checking out!
1932100385|4.0|I was originally researching dog nutrition when I accidentally came across this book title on a forum.  I looked at the Amazon reviews to see what others had to say.  Based on the reviews here, I went to my library and borrowed this book. <br /> <br />Here's what I liked about the book:  T. Colin Campbell earned a lot of credibility with me by documenting, in GREAT detail, what his studies were about and the conclusions that came from them.  I also like the fact that he had many affiliations with the big-industry groups and has been on the \\"inside\\".  His account of how information is given to the average American offers a lot of insight and he backs his claims up with many examples.  At the end of the day, I agree with him that both American agriculture and the drug industries have a lot to lose if we start eating healthier and don't need to take as many drugs to treat symptoms that are brought on by our diet. <br /> <br />Here's what I didn't like so much about the book:   <br /> <br />While I appreciate the detail offered about the studies, nutrition, etc. I found the ending of each chapter to drag out just a little.  I'm sure some readers will appreciate this amount of detail, but for me, I could have done without the last 3 pages or so of each chapter. <br /> <br />T. Colin Campbell made lots of comparisons between traditional Chinese and Japanese diets and the traditional American diet.  The only part I had a hard time reconsiling was the elimination of fish from the diet.  Being married to an American-Chinese person and being around his VERY traditional Chinese family for about 8 years now, I know that fish is a very important part of their diet.  And it is obviously a large part of the traditional Japanese diet as well.  There may be some good reasons to not eat fish or fish-based foods, but I got the impression that T. Colin Campbell is lumping fish-based foods in as an animal-based food which should also be avoided.  This didn't make much sense to me.  Butperhaps I missed something here... <br /> <br /> <br />Reading this book HAS changed my views on food and diet.  Changing the way I eat will take some time and practice, but I'm ready for the challenge.
0740748475|4.0|Let me first say that Calvin and Hobbes is by far my favorite cartoon strip of all time.  Even better than Far Side.  When I first heard that this complete set was coming out I was thrilled!  Finally all of Bill Watterson's work would be available in one deluxe book set!  This is why I was kind of upset after really going through the set to find out that it's really not complete.  It's very close...but definitely not complete.    Sure this set contains all the comics that ran in the newspapers, plus the cover art for the books, and various other special pictures/poems Bill drew for the series... but if you check out some of the older Calvin & Hobbes collections that were released, you'll find a whole bunch of really funny one-picture strips mixed in with the comic strips that are not included in this set.  These were never put in the newspapers, they were probably made specifically for the older collections just to fill up space.  For example, one of these one-picture strips featured in the very first Calvin and Hobbes collection shows a terrified Calvin in the back of car his Mom is driving holding up a big sign to the other drivers that says he's been kidnapped.  Hilarious stuff...which makes me wonder why it wasn't included in this \\"COMPLETE\\" Calvin and Hobbes set.    Then there's also a bunch of pictures at the beginning and end of certain Calvin and Hobbes colections that didn't make it to these sets.  For instance, at the very end of the collection \\"Scientific Progess Goes Boink\\", there is a large picture showing Susie looking down on the sidewalk shocked to see a crude drawing of herself, while Calvin and Hobbes are laughing behind a tree.  Why wasn't this included?!    All in all, I do realize that I'm nitpicking with these left out pictures and one-picture strips.  I just wish everything from all the previous collections was included, then I'd consider it truly complete.  I really don't think it would have killed them to put in another dozen or so pages into this set so that everything from the older books was included.  However, with that exception this collection is a must-have to any Calvin and Hobbes fan.  It's well-made, looks terrific, and is worth every penny.  I'd like to give it five stars, but I simply have to take off one star for the missing artwork.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This album was given to me by a friend 20+ years ago.  I was very interested in Phillip Glass and Steve Reich at the time- minimalist, repetitive.  Years later, I rediscovered it while looking for background music for T'ai Chi.  It was perfect!  I have since come to appreciate it for its simplicity.  It is beautiful in its lack of complexity. It is exactly what Eno described in his original concept- a piece to underscore life, without calling attention to itself. I have heard the other stuff in Eno's \\"Ambient\\" music period, and while all of it is evocative and passive, none of the other pieces approach the tranquility and eloquent drone of Music for Airports. I just recommended it to a friend who is looking for music to underscore a yoga class. It is truly beautiful without the artifice and sugar of much of the \\"New Age\\"-y muzak!
B00005NFDQ|4.0|This appears to be the old B&W movie with Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch. A very good but dated movie based on the wonderful Neville Shute book. <br /> <br />The Australian TV mini-series is light years better - in fact is one of the greatest movies ever made. <br /> <br />I hope some day it's released on DVD. Until then I still have my old VHS copy.
B00009ATIX|1.0|This is the formula that was used to create this movie.<br /><br />Start with Tarkovsky's 1972 version of Lem's novel and do the following<br /><br />1) Strip it of all its mystery, creepiness, and hazy imagery, replacing that with Hollywood-style psychobabble and expensive sets.<br /><br />2) Cast George Clooney in a role far beyond the scope of his acting abilities (thanks for the shot of his muscular ass, by the way).<br /><br />3) Remove the seldom-seen and seldom-heard basketcase crew members that haunted and confused Kelvin in the book and original movie, and replace a) the pilot with a slacker moron who behaves like a David Spade character and replace b) the mad physics genius with (of course) a black woman actress.  A little bit for the PC crowd and a little bit for the teenagers to laugh at.<br /><br />4) Lots of flashbacks of George Clooney dressed smartly in his pseudo-James Bond milieu.<br /><br />What a piece of trash this film is.  It is about half as long as the original by Tarkovsky, but it seems to be twice as long.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Serenity,\\" then you must see the prematurely-cancelled series.  The characters are more fleshed out (the advantage of TV over film), and the events in \\"Serenity\\" have more power and make more sense.  The writing is just as strong in the series as in the film, too.  I can't recommend this series enough.
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Ironically, after seeing the new remake of King Kong, I instead reviewed the 1976 remake, a film I loved when I was eleven, but I have changed my mind about since seeing it on TV the other day. <br /> <br />As for the new 2005 version, much of this film was so spectacular, that I find myself overlooking much of what I disliked about the film. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, if Peter Jackson had employed a better team of writers (and left himself out of the writing process altogether) and hadn't decided to cater to the masses who spend all of their down time playing with video games, the movie would have been consistently excellent and not so difficult to review. <br /> <br />From an emotional aspect, I was back to being eleven years old, and walked out of the theater feeling extremely satisfied and saddened by the big gorilla's demise, even though I saw it coming thirty-five years ago. <br /> <br />As a 40-year old native New Yorker with an affinity towards the 1920s and 1930s, I was blown away by the recreation of New York City during the height of the depression, and was fully convinced that this was New York as it was. I was equally impressed with the costumes worn by the cast members, particularly those worn by Naomi Watts who looked positively sensual in her blue bobbed hat, accentuating her beautiful blue eyes. <br /> <br />The ship voyage to Skull Island was harrowing and left me at the edge of my seat. And as opposed to the typical African-like natives that greet the ship's crew on the island, they are instead attacked by a zombie-like tribe that are merely primitive and devoid of any national origin which works quite well and were far more terrifying than anything I've seen in any horror movie, and far scarier than Kong himself. <br /> <br />The dinosaur sequences were exciting, if not more than a little on the Jurassic Park side, but were also over the top and cartoon-like as most of the cast members survived running for their lives from a herd of brontosauruses. <br /> <br />And the scenes of Kong's return to New York where he ultimately suffers his fate on top of the Empire State Building were simply spectacular and emotionally charged. <br /> <br />So, what didn't I like about the new King Kong? Like I said in the beginning: some awful writing. Many of the characters are uninteresting and the relationships between some of the minor ones came across as false. Also, Jackson and his crew of writer's attempts at humor were off-putting and dumb, and not cute and witty as they were obviously shooting for. In fact, the movie then takes a quick turn when the crew reaches Skull Island where things grow dark and helpless, and you feel as if you're in another movie altogether. <br /> <br />I really had to suspend my disbelief at how Naomi Watts survived the jungle as Kong juggled her from hand to hairy hand while wrestling a number of dinosaurs.  <br /> <br />Lastly, the filmmaker completely skips over how a twenty-five foot gorilla was transferred from his homeland on a skimpy sea ship that barely got the crew to the island alive, and back to New York City. <br /> <br />Perhaps, if Peter Jackson hadn't realized King Kong through the beguiling eyes of a child, King Kong would have been perfect, and after a 72-year try at the big ape by numerous filmmakers, based on the amount of money that was spent and the talent that was employed, this film should have been great. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, one must give credit where credit is due. Everyone at hand, from the director to the actors to the special effects artists on poured their hearts and souls into this childhood fantasy, and I must admit when the film is transferred to DVD, regardless of my criticisms, I will be one of the first to own it.
B000002LQD|5.0|This is one of Lou Reed's best cd's.   If you are going through a loved one having cancer, this cd is for you.   It will raise up some emotions that you thought you didn't have.  Great relief.
B000001ESP|4.0|I'd been a fan since 2112 and saw them on this tour and the Permanent Waves tour among many others. For Moving Pictures Rush went for a more stripped down and muscular hard rock sound. Gone were the lyrical scope and musical intricacies/subtilties that made Permanent Waves or Farewell To Kings such amazing albums. Instead they kept the overdubs to a minimum and created songs that were tauter, more focused and in general shorter for Rush. This isn't a bad thing necessarily, but to my ears at the time, after the complexity of Permanent Waves, it appeared that Rush simplified their instrumentation and their lyrics and increased the keyboards prominence in order to go for mass commercial appeal. Now however I think that assessment isn't completely correct. I believe that Rush wanted to make an album that would be easier and more fun for the band to reproduce live in the large venues they played, so they backed off from the multilayered overdubs that they used on previous albums. So it's no suprise that Moving Picture's muscular hard/progressive rock songs happen to translate very well to a live setting. The songs sound big. No ballads, no fluff, just tough guitar, bass, synthesizer and drums made to be played in front of large audiences. Radio play was obviously a concern, but ultimately I think they just wanted to rock out. Rush was aware of the change in music during the early '80s and so there is a discernable \\"new wave\\" influence or feel in the streamlined muscularity of many of the songs. Alex Lifeson seems to have been especially enamoured of Police guitarist Andy Summers work as he changed his guitar tone beginning on Permanent Waves and started to introduce a more textural and reggae-like feel to the songs as well. Lyrically there are a few weak songs such as Red Barchetta (I still like it though), but musically Moving Pictures is full of odd time signatures, and large riffs that work as a successful marriage of commerciality, melodicism and progressive hard rock. It's strong and focused, streamlined but engaging. Compared to the more sophisticated Permanent Waves and the later album Signals, Moving Pictures is an entertaining bruiser of an album. At the time of it's intial release critics said that it was a Geddy Lee dominated album due to the huge bass sound and the use of keyboards. Maybe, but I do know that Moving Pictures is a very good rock album. Perhaps it's a little lightweight lyrically compared to some other Rush albums (A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres come to mind), but it's among their most enjoyable and is well worth getting.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer is a great song with an unforgettable riff obviously designed to be impressive in front of 30,000 fans. It's arena rock at its best. The lyrics are about a modern man whose \\"mind is not for rent by any god or government\\" and is Neil's homage to the modern day free thinker. One of my favorite Rush songs.<br /><br />Red Barchetta - I don't think that driving a sports car constitutes revolutionary behavior or thought whether legal or not, ridiculous lyrics. Excellent music though that captures the excitement of speed.<br /><br />YYZ - a strutting instrumental, great fun. It's not as sophisticated as La Villa Strangiato and not meant to be either. This is the band having fun flexing their instrumental muscle. Geddy Lee's bass is featured to great effect.<br /><br />Limelight - a more personal song from Neil Peart than is usual from him about retaining one's humanity while coping with the trappings/illusions of being a famous performer. In the hands of a lesser lyricist this could be an embarrassing cheesy disaster, but Neil pulls it off. The music is outstanding: great melody and playing.<br /><br />The Camera Eye - very good rocking song contrasting the energy of New York's inhabitants with the physical structure and history of old London. Rush's last long composition.<br /><br />Witch Hunt - ponderous and pompous, another one that's geared for the arena, but stillvery entertaining. Lyrically it's a harsh criticism of mob mentality, prejudice and especially fascism. \\"Quick to judge, quick to anger, and slow to understand.\\"<br /><br />Vital Signs - sorry but the lyrics are a little weak, didn't' like the cheesy, dated sounding electronic snare drum either. But the reggae influence is cool. Obviously Alex Lifeson was enamored with Andy Summers guitar sound as on subsequent albums he introduced a good deal of Summers-like textural and reggae influenced playing into Rush's music.cism of mob mentality, prejudice and especially fascism. \\"Quick to judge, quick to anger, and slow to understand.\\"    Vital Signs - sorry but the lyrics are a little weak, didn't' like the cheesy, dated sounding electronic snare drum either.

B000BNNLN4|5.0|I am not really interested in tractors, but this book took my breath away! It covered the subjects of 'old country' thinking, immigration, family dynamics, many aspects of aging. It covered the multi-faceted subjects of love in every which way! <br />This book could have been the observation of a co-workers life drama unfolding over time - complete with the small town view -it was absolutely FASCINATING!! I read it in one night. <br />I immediately loaned out my copy and can't wait to loan it some more! <br />Oh! And I learned about tractors too, and felt a real sense of pride in the telling of that part of the story.  <br />Marina Lewycka is a lovely storyteller!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is a truly remarkable ALBUM, and I capatalize that word because that's what makes this release so important.  These days, a lot of people just collect singles by downloading.  The album seems to be dying, replaced by releases with a few standout tracks and enough filler to get to LP length.<br /><br />But the Arcade Fire chose to go a different route.  It's not the most original release, but they did an excellent job of taking inspiration from older artists and following in their footsteps.  The tracks on this album fit together like puzzle pieces, and when you get to the end you feel like you've completed a jouney.  Sure, the singles are great, but each one has even more power when played within the context of the album.<br /><br />So the question you might ask is \\"Will I like this album?\\"  If you're a fan of indie pop, I think you'll love this album.  If you're a fan of artists like David Bowie and Brian Eno who combined art rock with dance beats, then you'll love this album.  If you can appreciate a group of talented, theatrical artists who seem to be having a great time, and you like a dark side to your music, you'll absolutely love this album.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of impact the Arcade Fire will have on rock.  Maybe they're not original enough and will be forgotten in five year, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great album now.
1582432678|4.0|This is the best contemporary novel I have read for quite a while. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the characters, motivations and situations were convincing. For the readers of true crime books you know as well as myself that the real stories are even stranger than this work of fiction. <br /> <br />Lionel Shriver has made her thoughts on motherhood clear but I don't see a problem with using that or integrating it into a work of fiction. The book is also beautifully written and some paragraphs just have to be re-read. For me, this is the nearest anyone has come, recently, to providing any insight into  why  families implode and why children can become murderers. I for one will be reading more Lionel Shriver books.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young waltzes on the brink of sentimental but never falls over the edge. He does the same with politics. Only when you listen carefully do you hear he's said something radical. Never does the music stop being good.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill's album greatly contributed to the ever-expanding world of hip hop artistry.<br /><br />With Mary J. Blige bridging the hip hop sound with soulful R&B, you gotta credit Lauryn Hill with blending reggae with hip hop and R&B.<br /><br />I just got through listening to this album last night for the first time in a while and it still brings back fond memories of my junior year in college when it first came out. Any album that can pull you back into time so vividly is nothing short of classic!<br /><br />But I call this a 5-star masterpiece because we haven't seen anyone daring to imitate Lauryn's vibe on this album ... which should show how unique and creative it is.<br /><br />Personal favorite tracks are \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" which shows that venomous mouth on L-Boogie when she really feels compelled to grab your attention.<br /><br />\\"Lost Ones,\\" \\"Ex-Factor\\" \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" with D'Angelo and \\"I Used to Love Him\\" with Mary J. Blige are other standout tracks, but this is an album of a dying breed in that you really can listen to it all the way through.<br /><br />Don't sleep on the hidden bonus cut \\"Be Alright,\\" I actually awoke one morning about a year ago with this song in my head and couldn't even remember when I'd last heard it.<br /><br />That's magical music right there!<br /><br />Highly recommended for picky R&B listeners who favor a Mary J. Blige-Faith Evans-Lauryn Hill-Aaliyah kind of hip hop vibe (notice I didn't put Alicia Keys-Beyonce-Ashanti or Keyshia Cole in this category yet).
0553382179|2.0|I have really mixed views about Sink Reflections.  I received this book for Christmas two years ago (after requesting it).  A self-described slob for 39 years, I really want to make a change in my life, and this was, I thought, the end of my struggle with clutter.  As the book suggested, I started with cleaning out my sink until it shined.  I started with baby steps.  I made a control journal (all of these things you can get off of her website, but I prefer a book, maybe you do, too).<br /><br />All I can tell you is that after so many days, I got obsessed with the control journal.  I made list after list (a classic symptom of ADD and chronic disorganization).  The lists took up more time than the cleaning did and overwhelmed me.  According to the FLYlady's website, I'm doing something wrong.  According to everything else I've read about chronic disorganization and ADD, it's not \\"My\\" fault.  My brain is wired differently and doesn't fit well into \\"normal\\" or \\"systematic\\" methods of organization.  That's why the FLYlady's control journal didn't work for me.<br /><br />Yes, I loved the concept of the control journal - of having every day of the week planned out from morning till night.  I loved the concept of calling housekeeping, \\"house blessing\\".  But even with all of this, I still failed in my attempts to keep my house clean.<br /><br />From all the positive testimonials, I KNOW Sink Reflections is a life-saver for many, or most.  But for those, like me, who have ADD, or are chronically disorganized, Sink Reflections is just another disappointing bookend.  For those of you out there for whom this book has Not worked, I suggest something by Judith Kolberg like \\"Conquering Chronic Disorganization\\", or \\"ADD-Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life\\".
B00004XQP4|5.0|So you bought \\"American Idiot\\" and were completely blown away. All I can say is that you should enjoy \\"Warning\\" nearly if not just as much. It's a more heavily acoustic (note: don't confuse this to mean it doesn't rock, it does) cd that has tons of likeable riffs, infectious melodies, and excellent thoughtful lyrics. How this cd has stayed below most people's radar I'll never know! Perhaps since it was so unlike their previous material and fans couldn't conveniently put \\"Warning\\" into the box they'd created for all things they thought were supposed to be Green Day. I can't really add much to what the Spotlight Reviews have already stated about the individual songs except that \\"Misery\\" is great and should probably be included in the soundtrack of Martin Scorsese's next mob film. If \\"American Idiot\\" is to be considered Green Day's \\"Revolver\\" for its' excellent song quality, then this cd is their \\"Rubber Soul\\" for running a close second.
B00079018K|5.0|This is such an excellent cd. I downloaded it from itunes and can now listen to it on my ipod all the time and burn it onto a disc if I wish .  It's just too good to pass up.  Definitely a 5 star debut.  I have heard that there is some sort of a patch that can be downloaded to fix the copy right protection issue on discs like these.  There's always a way to listen to good music, so think twice before writing those 1 star reviews.  It's not the band's fault!  Anyway, this disc is a fantastic piece of work.  I'm looking forward to more releases from Kasabian.
B00005JM0B|3.0|This movie is not in the same class as T1 or T2. But that does not mean its a bad movie. It's just not as good as the rest in the series.     I enjoyed the movie and had no real issues with where they have taken the story. I think it makes a good companion to the first two. If they make a 4th I just hope they find a different way to bring the terminators in rather that just a few more sent thru time.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|King Kong was three hours of unbelievable, boring, plotless, nonstop, predictable cliche action.  After the first hour I was squirming in my seat, wishing I was at home doing something interesting.  The only good points of this movie are the special effects.  I didn't like this film because it lacked creative content, there was hardly a plot, no worthwhile moral, all tied together with meaningless action.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Their have been several Batman movies and series over the years. Some were very good (Tim burton's Batman, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman: The animated series), Some were just silly(Adam West TV Series) and some were just awefull (Batman and Robin).    This movie is the best movie to date. This movie felt right from the first sequence to the ending. The fight seens were close and fast the way I'd always imagined. The feel and look of the characters perfect. While not a dead match for the comics they captured the \\"soul\\" of the characters and transferred them to the screen.    Any batman fan will love this movie. For anyone that is not a fan(ie my wife) its still and engaging thriller and touching drama.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I loved GIST. This movie I have not watched. I will not get to watch this movie unless they fix one small issue.  This movie needs an English soundtrack.       I do not speak Japanese and I am not willing to read a movie. Books are for reading movies are for watching. Some of my friends are anime \\"purists\\" (AKA snobs) that only use the subtitles because they say the dub's are normally bad. I don't care its a movie I do not want to read it.     I hope someday I'll be able to watch this movie. What little I saw before I turned it off looked fantastic.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Shakira, but I do enjoy her music. This album in my opinion is way better than \\"Laundry Service\\". It sucks that the album is not selling very well, and I think I know the reason why: \\"Don't Bother\\"! It's not a bad song, it was just a HORRIBLE choice for first single! It didn't work.  <br /> <br />Hands down the best songs on this album are track #1-\\"How Do You Do?\\" which starts off sounds very gothic and spooky, and the other being track #3-\\"Illegal\\". Such a soulful and gorgeous song! Amazing!
B000BRBA8S|5.0|This movie is beautiful in every sense of the word. Kar Wai Wong created a world of mystery and wonder. <br /> <br />Seldomly do I ever watch a movie and get goosebumps; however, 2046's incredible display of emotion, character, and vision put chills down my spine. <br /> <br />Sensual. Erotic.  <br /> <br />Truly remarkable...
B000002GQG|5.0|The first song of this CD, \\"Departure,\\" let's you know to please take your seat, buckle up, and enjoy the ride, not at 30,000 feet above the mind, but shooting up through the void of outer space. As it delivers us into the Sun \\"without burning a wing ...\\" we are delivered to the next serving in this multi-course dinner of music, revelations, songs, and insights. The CD cover is the first clue as to what this CD is about - birth, death, and rising to enlightenment. \\"Departure\\" also is the signal to us that the Moody's are beyond their previous album, \\"Days Of future passed,\\" and are creating music mainly for themselves.  The success of \\"Days\\" allows them their indulgence, sans the London orchestra. <br /> <br />In Search Of The Lost Chord, the title reveals that not only are they looking for the ultimate note, but that chord is there, if you just get beyond the expectations and dictates of society, the government and the industries, including the music industry. Pink Floyd had a similar revelation when they rebelled in \\"The Wall.\\"   <br /> <br />1968 - The year of Nixon, rebellion, a nation gone mad, a senseless war thousands of miles away, that prompted an entire generation a cry for peace, and music; music like no other period in the history of mankind. It is an age of experimentation, of angry youths singing outrage at the military-industrial complex.  And then, after all was said and done, a British rock group created an album which in many respects outdid their previous albums. <br /> <br />The Moody Blues decided that the technology of the day allowed them to emulate an entire orchestra, so they experimented with a combination of regular instruments, such as the oboe and french horn, but also with synthesizers, successfully mixing them into a CD that was influenced by not only the Beatles, but also eastern meditation, and mind-altering drugs via \\"Legend Of A Mind.\\"  Right after their tribute to Timothy Leary, they begin the second part of \\"House Of Four Doors,\\"as if to say that the answer to their search may be in what the hippy guru, Dr. Leary proclaimed - \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out.\\"  Each door the singers encounters is a new universe to explore. <br /> <br />\\"Voices In The Sky\\" implores nature to give up it's secrets, as if the singer awoke one day and realized that the world of his reality is no reality at all, just an illusion, which it is, according to eastern philosophy.  The world of time, cars, 6 o'clock news and TV dinners eaten while watching the latest sitcom fades into the background as the singer cries out to the voices in the sky, the song of the Universe. If the Moody Blues were to play in the woods and no one were there to hear them, would they truly make us hear their sound?  Just wondering. <br /> <br />Thus, we come to \\"The Best Way To Travel\\" ... Which is to say, we must use our minds, our imagination, our thirst for knowledge.  The secret to the soul of any society is it's imagination, and the Moody Blues tell us so in this song, which then fades into \\"Visions Of Paradise\\" which tells us there is a better calling for us than we presume in our daily lives.  It is calling to us to go to the garden paradise ... \\"come see.\\" <br /> <br />By this time, the CD no longer is a CD, but an experience, an event that takes us from our Westernized fastfood burgers and diet sodas and secretary-spread bottoms, and begin to see that this is not the \\"real\\" world, but a play in which we are the actor, who stands behind the curtain, and as the curtain rises, we realize that it is we who are in life's play, but we are not independant, nor are we free, but a part of the play, part of a script to which there may be no escape, or is there ...  <br /> <br />And then, \\"The Word\\" booms out in the spoken word, telling us this garden universe vibrates complete, and we search for that chord, which is nameless, and as we search we name the chord which becomes \\"Om.\\" The butterfly gracefully flies along the flowers as the earth turns slowly round. <br /> <br />I cannot express all the feelings I experience while listening to this one, amazing CD, although I tried to extend my impressions as I sit, listening to it, while typing these notes. I was only 14 when I first heard this CD, and had a bigger impact on my becoming a fan of the Moody Blues than Nights In White Satin did. I would hope that if you have never heard this music, that you listen to it while relaxing, preferably taking a warm soothing bath and just close your eyes and try to think of nothing but that one sound, the sound of Om, which is the first note of the song of the Universe.  <br /> <br />Namaste. <br />
B000062YAZ|5.0|First of all, \\"Horrible noise\\" says Good Charlette is better than Slayer! Good Charlette sucks! People who say that slayer sucks are probably retarted who live with their moms! Slayer is one of the best! This is the best album from Slayer! All you Slayer fans must buy this now!

0783114893|5.0|This movie from beginning to end is great. The story, the characters everything about this movie puts in the category of being a classic. Buy it, great performances by Rutger Hauer and C. Thomas Howell. Stay away from the sequel though, it really sucks.
B00005J6UP|2.0|This is a parent review of \\"The Goonies.\\" It is not a good movie for kids, as it contains <br />quite a few instances of the s-word. It is rated PG, but that rating from the mid-1980s <br />doesn't compare to PG movies these days. In 2005, this movie would be rated PG-13, <br />with clarifications about the language, among other elements where parental guidance would be suggested. I remember the movie fondly when I saw it myself in the theater <br />when I was 27 years old. But I would not want to hear kids (meaning those in the basic <br />grade-school age) talking with this kind of language.

B0006399FS|5.0|Somewhere on the road after \\"Pop,\\" U2 reached a turning point during their 20'th year as a band. They always seemed to be on an endless quest to not box themselves in, and to try their hardest not to retread the same ground over and over. It lead us to many a brilliant album (think \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Acthung Baby\\"), but it also left us scratching out heads when \\"Zooropa\\" appeared. Somewhere in their collective mind, they realized that experimenting was not a bad thing, but being one of the best rock bands in history wasn't such a bad thing, either. And so they entered the new century with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" a CD that found the group playing to their strongest traits.<br /><br />As a return to form, \\"ATYCLB\\" was a satisfying event. But as dedicated U2 fans (of which I count myself as one) know, a satisfying album from U2 frequently gets followed up by a swing and a miss. Not this time. \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" strides with confidence and swagger, and the band's mojo pitting their maturity with intelligence and self-assuredness. This is everything you'd expect from U2, and is probably more than an early listener to \\"Boy\\" likely expected a quarter-century later. All the familiar themes are here. A bow to loving American Pop Culture (\\"City Of Blinding Light\\"), a nod towards a love of the blues (\\"Love and Peace or Else\\"), a mature look at love and loss (\\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\") and finally a shout out to the man upstairs (\\"Yahweh\\").<br /><br />Bono's social conscious pops up here often. (Time's 2005 Man of the Year?!? Wow...) \\"Where you live should not decide/whether you live or whether you die\\" springs from the song \\"Crumbs From Your Table,\\" and he is still putting his money and his muscle where his mouth is. (Judging from the Time Magazine article, he does this without dragging the band into his politics, and they are content with that.) So while Bono is out trying to save the world from \\"stupid poverty,\\" his mates work up the muscle of \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"City Of Blinding Lights.\\" It is to the band's credit that there isn't a single song here that sounds wasted. After all this time, U2 remain a 4 piece (quick, name one other band to last 25 years without ever changing a member....couldn't do it? Didn't think so...) to which each member maintains his individuality and still can pound outstanding records out when the call comes. \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is a great album from a band that delivers the goods like the true vets they are.the muscle of \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"City Of Blinding Lights.\\" It is to the band's credit that there isn't a single song here that sounds wasted.

B0002OERI0|3.0|American jazz great Duke Ellington once stated that there were only two kinds of music-good and bad. Music is pleasing to its loyal audiences who have learned to distinguish nuances of style and may be able to identify their favorite performers by sound. It may be less than pleasing to others, who may comprehend so little of the music that they think it all sounds alike. Music can also be performed well or poorly. These judgments are made within a musical culture, according to what that culture believes about music. It is obvious how important the composer and the performer are in musical communication, but the importance of the audience's knowledge and active participation in music is often underestimated or ignored. <br />This is my first Green Day album so I am neutral in how I rate it, compared to Green Day fans who love the album and Green Day haters who gave the album a poor review. I recommend you listen to John Coltrane's Album \\"A Love Supreme\\" and see what your feelings are when you first listen to it compared to repeated listenings.  <br /> <br />

B000AP04EW|2.0|Director:  Doug Liman <br />Cast:  Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Vince Vaughn, Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, Keith David, Chris Weitz, Rachel Huntley, Michelle Monaghan. <br />Running Time:  120 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence, intense action, sexual content and brief strong language. <br /> <br />By day, the marriage fires for John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith are slowly flickering out. At night, the two are opposing international spies, jetting across the globe killing bad guys, trying to make it home before dinner. When a routine hit goes wrong, and John and Jane's double lives are revealed, the two go on the defensive, looking to kill each other out of fear of betrayal. However, when a death warrant is put on the couple, they must set aside their differences to stay alive, reengaging their passion for each other in the process.  It is an insipid idea for a film, yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals and as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal, the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a \\"wouldn't it be cool if ...\\" moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a \\"James Bond\\" movie, the result is like \\"The War of the Roses\\" on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent. <br /> <br />As the Smiths, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry, most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. Butas they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions, gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then, even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths, the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to, but totally failing at, explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.  Ultimately, the film has no real point, as it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss (marriage, suburban home, mini-van, etc. ) one suspects that the original screenplay for \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" hoped to join the ranks of \\"The War of the Roses\\"; \\"Divorce\\",  and even \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions, with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics. A film focusing on adult themes sells out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem.
B00003CXAE|5.0|i'm going to get straight to the point here:buy it!it was totally awesome!i usually don't like old movies,but decided to watch it anyways,and i just fell in love with the movie the soryline is great and so are the actors.you will not be disapointed if you purchase this!!
0783224338|1.0|Director:  Roger Donaldson <br />Cast:  Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, Charles Hallahan, Jamie Renee Smith, Jeremy Foley, Elizabeth Hoffman, Grant Heslov, Kirk Trutner, Arabella Field, Brian Reddy, Paul Dreyfuss. <br />Running Time:  104 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for disaster related peril, language and some gore. <br /> <br />In 1997 two disaster films, \\"Volcano\\" and \\"Dante's Peak\\" galloped toward the Hollywood finish line in the hopes of becoming the first Volcanus Eruptus to explode into movie theaters. \\"Dante's Peak\\" won that race by a nose with it's release date coming in February, and Volcano's coming in April. In the end it doesn't matter which film won the race as both are nothing more than a couple of tired old nags that belong in the glue factory.  In the 1970's, Hollywood gave us a satchel full of disaster films such as this, as most of those were usually filled with an underwhelming all star cast placed smack dab in the middle of some impending doom whether it was jetliners with holes poked in them, skyscrapers lit up like a blow torch, overturned ocean liners, or earthquakes rocking the California coast. In the 1990's, we were still getting the disaster films, but the all-star has been casts seem to have been done away with. Instead we get a few well known cast members sleep walking through an exercise in how to survive nature's peril. In \\"Dante's Peak\\" they throw Pierce Brosnan who is moonlighting from his \\"007\\" job along with \\"Terminator\\" cast off Linda Hamilton at us to gawk at. Brosnan should have just taken the time off and Hamilton should have looked for another gig. <br /> <br />Resident volcano expert Harry Dalton (Brosnan) comes to the town of Dante's Peak to find out whether or not the local volcano is still dormant or is ready to pop it's cork. Harry, you see, was in love with another volcano expert he worked with who just loved to get up close and personal with them. Unfortunately for Harry, she gets bopped in the head during one such explosion and that's the end of her.  Linda Hamilton is the mayor of Dante's Peak. Unlike her character of Sarah Connor in the \\"Terminator\\" films, who took action when things weren't looking too good, as mayor and widow Rachel Wando she does nothing much more than run around the mountainside looking worried and fretting about her kids and her mother-in-law who lives on the mountain. The mother-in-law, Ruth, is played by Elizabeth Hoffman, and is supposed to be just like that guy who stuck around Mount St. Helens till the bitter end refusing to move from his home. Here it just enables the writers to throw in the idiotic plot development where the kids and Rachel have to go and rescue her just as Dante's Peak is spewing ash and lava all over the countryside. It's supposed to add suspense and excitement, but only serves to up the stupid level. For one thing, Ruth is annoying enough that we don't care whether she is rescued or not, and second, the two kids (Jamie Rene Smith and Jeremy Foley) have a high annoyance level of their own and we end up rooting for Dante's Peak instead of them. <br /> <br />There are truly some ridiculous scenes in this film. These are the moments we would usually just overlook and go on if we were at least being entertained somewhat by the proceedings but since we are not, they stand out like the Rock of Gibraltar. We get people in a jeep riding a lava flow, Pierce Brosnan paddling a boat with his hand in an acid filled lake and not being any worse the wear for it, we get a couple of cute dog moments, we get a ridiculous scene of our cast trying to outrun a cloud of ash in a jeep and so forth and so on.  Also on hand is Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's doubting Thomas boss Paul Dreyfuss who is made to believe in the eruption only when it's too late to do anything about it. There's always one such character in these types of films, but at least Hallahan's doubts come from logical assumptions instead of the blatant idiocy usually given these characters. At least that was refreshing if nothing else is. There is nothing about \\"Dante's Peak\\" that you'll believe for one second. Everything about it is below par, and not worth one second of your time.
B0000399WI|4.0|This movie always keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart beating. In the beginning, one could describe Tim Robins character as a confused puppy dog in a big doghouse filled with pit bulls. Andy{tim robbins} in the begining has a quiet and paranoide sort of character. Almost everyone could be considered a antagonist to him. As time goes by, he begins to get some friends like Red{morgan freeman}, Tommy{Gil Bellows},Heywood{William Sadler}, and a few other guys. Yet through the entire movie, he keeps a few antagonists, like Warden Norton{Bob Gunton},Captain Byron T. Hadley{Clancy Brown}, and a gang of guys that are always beating up on Andy. The moment Andy got into Shawshank, he wanted to get out. He created a strong enough relationship with Red, that he could get stuff \\"smuggled\\" to him from other guys in the prison. Things like a small hammer, posters for enjoyment and to cover up the giant hole he made in the wall. Near the end of the movie Andy tells something to Red that changes the movie a little bit that makes the audience get on the edge of there seat. Andy wanted to have Red stay with him in Mexico when he broke out, but first he would have to find an igneous rock in a field under a tree. Under the rock would be the way that Red could get to where Andy was. In this movie, the guards mostly have a power theory affect on the prisoners. They have created a certain pathos in the prisoners. This pathos would be harsh beatings, death, or very harsh work. The warden also has created a pathos in the prisoners as well. He has a nice side, but if you mess with him, its not good for you {the prisoners}. i would be this movie 4-4.5 stars out of 5. Its a cool movie that should only be seen by people High School and up.
6304936303|3.0|Director:  Tony Scott <br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Damon Wayans, Chelsea Field, Noble Willingham, Taylor Negron, Danielle Harris, Halle Berry, Bruce McGill, Badja Djola, Kim Coates, Chelcie Ross, Joe Santos. <br />Running Time:  105 minutes <br />Rated R for extreme violence, extreme language, and some innuendo. <br /> <br />The central figure of \\"The Last Boy Scout\\" is Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis) a cynical, down-on-his-luck private detective who once had a career as a Secret Service agent until he butted heads with Calvin Baynard (Chelcie Ross), a corrupt Senator in his charge. He has since become a full-blown alcoholic and an object of derision to everyone around him, especially his wife and daughter (played by Chelsea Field and Danielle Harris, respectively). His latest client is a mysterious exotic-dancer named Cory (an early-career performance by Oscar winner Halle Berry) who is seemingly being harassed by some creeps, but isn't quite telling the whole truth. Unfortunately, she ends up being ruthless gunned-down before anything can be done, forcing Hallenbeck to forge an uneasy alliance with Cory's boyfriend, Jimmy Dix, an equally-disgraced ex-NFL quarterback who was kicked out the league on drug and gambling allegations. Together, these two misfits uncover an intricate sports-gambling plot involving Shelly Marcone (Noble Willingham), the owner of the L.A. Stallions for which Jimmy used to play ball and, of course, Senator Baynard (Taylor Negron_, the man responsible for Hallenbeck's current woes. <br /> <br />\\"The Last Boy Scout\\" is laced with a strong amount of graphic violence, and the bad guys, who are not there to make the good guys look good, meet a lot of gruesome and bloody ends. The film has some exciting and thrilling action sequences and the surprises are startling. Perhaps the most disturbing elemends is with Hallenbeck's foul-mouth 13-year old daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris), when she and her dad curse at each other, and later on when she gets agun to her head. She is also an enthusiastic witness to the many gruesome and violent events that culminate in the film's brutal finale.  Bruce Willis gives a solid performance, while showing remnants of John McClane from \\"Die Hard\\" and Damon Wayans gives a comic persona as Jimmy Dix.  Taylor Negron, who is an extremely despicable villain and gives a chilling performance as one of the villains who has the annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names.  Director Tony Scott keeps the plot boiling before delivering an explosive climax. Shootouts, car chases, and fistfights all take up the last half-hour or so in a concluding setpiece that most would probably deem ridiculous (a football is used to save someone's life), but in the midst of all this chaos, it actually works.  Made in the early 1990's, before Scott became obsessed with quick cuts and fast camera movements (which heavily marred his \\"Spy Game\\"), though some of the same kinetic cinematography can be seen here, but in a good, exciting way.  The film was written by none other than \\"Lethal Weapon\\" scribe Shane Black, who opts for a lot of the same material here, though not as tightly written. Willis' Hallenback is every bit as fun as Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs, but this has more to do with his performance than any of Black's written dialogue. The same goes for Wayans, whose comedic potential is only unleashed on an inconsistent basis. The film's entertainment value is also somewhat inconsistent, but with its star duo and blowout finale, is a movie ultimately worth watching.
B000000W5L|5.0|Many critics and fans have baptized this May 1972 release as the Rolling Stones' greatest record and one of the handful of greatest in the history of rock and who am I to argue? Why would I anyway because I happen to agree though how could it be better than the three holy grails of rock that preceeded it? What a way to cap off an brilliant streak when the Stones were unparalleled as a recording and touring band, the years 1968-1972 of course. Recorded in an extemely decadent and filthy environment, the South of France in the summer of 1971, 'Exile' is the ultimate rock album. Standouts include \\"Tumbling Dice\\" (dynamite sleezy groove), \\"Happy\\" (sung by Keith of course, the album's mad scientist (chemist?)), \\"All Down the Line\\" (archetypical Stones, awesome leads by Mick Taylor, song gives me goosebumps), \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Loving Cup\\" (amazing!! yet no airplay??), \\"Rocks Off\\" (I'll never think of piroettes the same way again!), \\"Rip This Joint\\" (barnstormer, Dick Nixon's favorite rock song), \\"Torn and Frayed\\" (does any song describe Keith any better?), \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" (electric blues at its finest!). I mean it goes on and on! Filler?? Maybe a track or two, but one man's filler is another fan's favorite obscure track. It is funny how an album as universally acclaimed as 'Exile' has maybe two or three tracks played on classic rock radio. Whatever. Don't get it and never will. 'Exile' is a very personal record for obvious reasons, everyone has their own favorites. What seems like a loosey - goosey, free range, sloppy recording to some is inspired genius to others. And that genius is Keith Richards who not only owned the asylum...er...house where this monument was recorded but also was the key maestro that kept the recording sessions together and fruitful in between drug deals and boat chases with the local gendarms. The legends around the recording of 'Exile on Main St.' just add to the aura of this greatest of rock records. It's gonna be the death of me...........
079072961X|4.0|Director:  Andrew Davis <br />Cast:  Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, Sela Ward, Julianne Moore, Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Jeroen Krabbe, Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, Ron Dean. <br />Running Time:  130 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for intense situations, some violence, and language. <br /> <br />Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by a fast talking agent (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious \\"one-armed man.\\"  <br /> <br />Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role, Ford's intent wasn't to play \\"Indiana Jones\\", but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon and his wife. Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting) and his search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool.  Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character.  Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark.  He creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent, as his only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin. <br /> <br />Director Andrew Davis has not been known for exemplary work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked interest within the film industry.  With such films as \\"Under Siege,\\" \\"Code of Silence,\\" and \\"Above the Law,\\" he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris), while here he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot).  The film is brilliantly scripted by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, who manage to remain faithful to the plot of the original show, while updating it for contemporary audiences and condensing it into a two hour narrative. James Newton Howard also does a fabulous job with his score, which is emotional and exciting at all the right moments. The story is paced very thoughtfully, so that the characters are introduced and developed meaningfully, without tedium setting in while the viewers await the action. \\"The Fugitive\\" is a terrific film, totally absorbing and exciting from beginning to end, and easily one of the best action films of its year.  <br />

B00007ELF2|5.0|Director:  Steven Soderbergh <br />Cast:  Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Thomas Milian, Topher Grace, Erika Christensen, James Brolin. <br />Running Time:  147 minutes <br />Rated R for pervasive drug content, strong language, violence and some sexuality. <br /> <br />Like an abstract expressionist master, Steven Soderbergh stands in the center of a canvas that stretches from Cincinnati to Tijuana. He mixes materials and splashes colors with the dash and power of a Jackson Pollock. His materials are skillful acting, lively editing, a dynamic music score, and an unflinching camera. (He did his own lensing, under a pseudonym). The artist's aim? To paint a picture of our country's drug problem.  Scripted by Stephen Gaghan, \\"Traffic\\" has its roots in a 1989 British television mini-series, \\"Traffik,\\" which followed the drug trade from Pakistan to Britain. There are three loosely related stories, each with its own color coding--and as with Pollock, there is nothing random about where the paint splashes upon the canvas. <br /> <br />Blue hues bathe blue bloods in Cincinnati where an Ohio Supreme Court Justice (Michael Douglas) is flattered into taking a job as national drug czar, just as his bright young daughter (Erika Christensen) is seduced into addiction by her prep-school friends.  A rich golden-yellow surrounds San Diego where a comely couple (Catherine Zeta-Jones and Steven Bauer) occupy the upper links of the drug chain and spend ill-gotten cash on clothes, cars and country clubs. They are pursued by two undercover cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) who spend most of their screen time cooped up in a surveillance van.  In Mexico, a washed-out, burnished brown bespatters a desert of desperation as two Baja policemen (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) pull off a major drug bust only to be themselves busted, by a sinister general (Tomas Milian) who notifies them that 'I will take over from here.' Each color signifiesits own impenetrable culture, and when Douglas crosses into Mexico to meet his counterpart, we know (but he doesn't) that his fellow drug czar is really a drug lord. <br /> <br />The performances were exceptional, especially considering that no one was given star treatment. Much of the film was shot with existing light and Soderbergh kept the composition wide, letting the actors create their own space. Douglas was surprisingly believable as the would-be czar and bookends an Oscar-worthy year with his scruffy professor in the earlier \\"Wonder Boys.\\" His real-life wife, Zeta-Jones (carrying their child), gave a quite credible performance as a society snob who turns ruthless when her status is threatened.  Other stand-outs include Christensen's drugged-out daughter, Del Toro's street smart Mexican cop and Cheadle's dedicated drug buster. In fact, there was not a weak performance in the bunch, including crucial cameos by veterans Peter Riegert and Albert Finney. Real people even play roles: Douglas's fictional drug czar confers with real-life senator Orrin Hatch, while actual customs officials relate their day-to-day drug enforcement dilemmas.  Each of the three stories ends with a glimmer of hope. But despite small battles being won, the film's verdict is that the larger war is plainly being lost.  <br /> <br />Like Pollock, Soderbergh continues to stretch the boundaries of his art, as he did a dozen years ago with \\"sex, lies, and videotape,\\" and more recently with the undervalued \\"The Limey.\\"  The film is virtually filmed entirely with hand-held camera, giving each and every scene an up-close-and-personal feel. There's also a distinct lack of background music, which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on real-life scenes, and not just watching a film, making for a very personal, intense experience similar in some of his other films (\\"Out of Sight\\", \\"Erin Brockovich\\").  Certain scenes in \\"Traffic\\" are filtered a specific color, to heighten a mood or a senseof awareness of what's about to happen. The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier, for example, are all filmed in a very bright, almost disorienting yellow. It's a technique that can be irritating at times, but for the most part, it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.  \\"Traffic\\" is certainly a film that will not be embraced by all, but is a stunning addition to the industry and is highly considered as one of the most spellbinding, yet honest painting of the evils of the drug world.  Film making at its best.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|As a drummer, you've got to give it up for the man.  As much as this is a Coltrane record, it is Elvin's too. <br /> <br />I bought this record after seeing Ethan Iverson's (he's the pianist in \\"The Bad Plus\\") review in Downbeat where he gave it five stars.  As an aside, wouldn't it be cool for musicians to review records more often?  Iverson says there is more Half Note out there (the other Amazon reviews seem to confirm this?)  I hope to hear the rest some time. <br /> <br />One detail that is really interesting to me is where Elvin's bass drum pedal seems to fall off for a while in the title tune.   <br /> <br />Go Elvin!  He leads directly into Jack and the rest of the great modern drummers.
B00005NRO3|3.0|Director:  Wes Craven <br />Cast:  David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, Liev Schreiber, Timothy Olyphant. <br />Running Time:  120 minutes <br />Rated R for language and strong bloody violence. <br /> <br />\\"Scream\\" was a wittily postmodern recasting of slasher films of the early 1980's like \\"Halloween\\"  and \\"Friday the 13th\\" and their endless horde of imitators. On one level, \\"Scream\\" was filled with all the shocks and thrills expected of it, yet there was another whole level to it which at the same time was consciously crafting a film that was slyly mocking and parodying its own genre and cliches. Characters stopped in the middle of the flight from the slasher to hold discussions about what characters in slasher films did in the situation and which type of character was supposed to survive according to the slasher movie formula. And following \\"Scream\\"'s success, what more natural to follow it up with than a \\"Scream 2\\", which gleefully launches into satirizing the pandemic of sequels that followed most slasher films in the mid-1980's.  The plot follows on from the first; Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and fellow survivor Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy once again as the hilarious film geek) are attending a film and theatre school, while Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) is releasing a film based on the events of the first film (which hilariously parodies the first films opening) called \\"Stab\\". Unfortunately, at \\"Stab\\"'s opening, two people are found dead after being killed by a man in a mask.  The paranoid Sydney tries to tell herself that it is just a coincidence, but she knows the truth of the matter all too well. <br /> <br />The film has a fabulous opening that perfectly encapsulates the joyful sense of meta-fictional play that screenwriter Kevin Williamson delights in, while watching a film based on the events of the first film (wherein the opening of the first film is replayed but amusingly satirized; one scene rather funnily digs at directors that like to pay homage to the \\"Psycho\\" shower sequence) a copycat killing takes place in the theatre where the victim's death throes are just taken to be part of the promotional gimmick for the film. Here the constant blurring of the lines between what is happening and `the artificial' is dazzling.  Unfortunately for \\"Scream 2\\" the film that ends up on screen sadly fails to meet the criteria it itself establishes for worthwhile sequels. Williamson's script is far too burdened down and overweighed by the necessity of trying to turn the survivors from the first film and most of the cast members into potential suspects and as a result the jokey genre interplay that essentially made the first film gets lost.  Wes Craven, director of the first film, once again shines with his celebrated use of the camera, piecing together an exciting, dramatic thriller that will keep you guessing until the final reel.  Indeed, the film contains genuine tension; the vague reconstruction of Casey Becker's (Drew Barrymore from the initial scene in \\"Scream\\") demise is very scary, and a scene where Sidney and her friend are trapped in a police car with an unconscious killer is exceptional; however, \\"Scream 2\\" tries too hard to be clever and witty, instead of just getting on with it.
B000001E7L|5.0|A bit creepy in my opinion! Sounds like they just threw in a bunch of words just to make it all rhyme and fit together. Take 21 for example: \\"You took my thoughts from me. Now I want nothing more. And did you think you. Could just take it all away. I don't think it's happening. This is what I say. Leave me alone.\\" And then later: \\"Twenty One. Today. Twenty One.\\" What's the number 21 got to do with leaving someone alone? But that's only a minor problem. Other than that, my favourite Cranberries songs are all on this CD: tracks 4, 1, 2, 3 (in that order). <br />
6305903182|3.0|Director:  Wes Craven <br />Cast:  David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Patrick Dempsey, Parker Posey, Scott Foley, Deon Richmond, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen, Jenny McCarthy, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Kennedy. <br />Running Time:  116 minutes <br />Rated R for strong horror violence and language. <br /> <br />\\"Scream 3\\" is not as satisfying as the original horror masterpiece \\"Scream,\\" but what can we expect from the final chapter in a slasher trilogy? The first film was a superior horror thriller, one of the most loved slasher movies of the past decade. That was a picture with some hard standards to live up to; however, Wes Craven, director of the trio, accomplished another success with the sequel of \\"Scream.\\" Usually this kind of movie would fade into the Hollywood recycle bin by now, but \\"Scream 3\\" still produces chills, thrills, and lots of surprises even though we have been receiving the same kind of story for the past four years. This film is marginally passable, although the most flawed film of its series, that fairs as recommendable, but not substantial in quality.  <br /> <br />The film's opening once again provides the audience with a pre-credit murder sequence that is almost the highlight of the entire production. The \\"Scream 3\\" writers take advantage of one of the movie's old and important characters to arrange this very effective, and scary, sequence.  The setting is several years after the second film. The small college town of Woodsboro is where we are placed. Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney Prescott, a tormented young woman who was the target of the killing sprees in the past. She has attempted to move on with her life with her father, and has an anonymous hotline operation that offers assistance to those in need. Also, television reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) has experienced a big career jump, now working for a network called Total Entertainment. While the wrongly accused murder suspect of Sidney's mother, Cotton Weary(Liev Schreiber), has his own trashy TV talk show.  The central presence that connects the events here is the production of \\"Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro,\\" a movie the characters are creating that follows a horror trilogy based on the terrors experienced by Sydney. The masked murderer may or may not be found on the set. Besides police Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and the arrogant bodyguard Stone (Patrick Warburton), concluding the list of suspects, there is Dewey Riley (David Arquette), a former cop who is now an advisor for \\"Stab 3,\\" Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the film's director, John Milton (Lance Henriksen) the film's producer, as well as acting counterparts Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), Tom Prinze (Matthew Keeslar), Angelina (Emily Mortimer), Gabe Tucker (Deon Richmond), and Gales's reciprocal (Parker Posey). <br /> <br />Certain plot points lead our suspicion to believe one of several characters is the killer. We are fooled again; however, but does the killer's identity really matter here? As long as we receive a speech on why he or she is responsible, we would be satisfied and any of the character's could have been the killer. None of the characters have any shape or construction. We care only about the order that the victims will be picked off at, not about who hides behind the ghost mask. The identity is actually pointless when the slasher is finally revealed.  Once again, a key success in \\"Scream 3\\" is the scary sequences that build up momentum and thus work well, usually where the slasher kills his victims. What makes these scenes so effective is how we know that characters are three dimensional; they put up a firm fight for their lives, unlike victims in most slasher films. However, the plot seems to revolve around the murders, instead of the murders branching off from the story. \\"Stab 3\\" seems to be a central presence to connect the film's somewhat desperate through line.  Some of the plot points are fun and revealing. We see a videotape of apast character describing the possibilities of the movie's final outcome. This event programs our imaginations to suspect the unexpected. The plot does desperately attempt to fill in missing pieces of the previous screams, however, showing some signs of contrived foreshadowing. Each scene moves the story forward, though, replenishing the plot with freshness and ability around every abrupt corner.  \\"Scream 3\\" is a close call, and is given somewhat of a mixed review, but I still am giving the movie a marginal recommendation. It contains more startles, more surprises, and more effective scary material than most slasher movies.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|L. Clem you obviously cant see art when its smashed into your face. Their is about a minute of nudity throughout the entire movie and if you have even looked at the graphic novels u will see that this is much much more clean then they are. Most of the violence is in black and white and the way its worked in is just art. This movie is by far one of the greatest ever made and i think you are absolutely disgusting for hating it. From what it sounds like the kind of movies you consider art are those like finding nemo. I belive that this is one of those must see movies even though its R rated. Im not saying show it to your 7 yearold but anyone over the age of 15 needs to see this movie.
B00000J2KX|4.0|Director:  Stanley Kubrick <br />Cast: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scotman Crothers, Barry Nelson, Philip Stone, Joe Turkel, Anne Jackson, Tony Burton. <br />Running Time:  146 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />Stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived. No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\" Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed \\"The Shining,\\" one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.  Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies. He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation. One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.  Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company. But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the \\"shining\\"), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac. <br /> <br />Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, \\"The Shining\\" has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie. The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible. Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror. While grand in scale is its beauty and terror, it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well. <br /> <br />Although \\"The Shining\\" is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; \\"The Shining\\" does not execute the climax in which it builds.  All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  Certainly one of the most engrossing and interesting films of the genre, \\"The Shining\\" will always be adored by some and scrutinized by others; it is this kind of enigmatic triumph that makes cinema so grand and so disappointing in the same breath.

B00005N5RM|3.0|Director:  Chuck Russell <br />Cast:  Kevin Dillon, Shawnee Smith, Donovan Leitch, Jeffrey DeMunn, Candy Clark, Joe Seneca, Del Close, Paul McCrane, Jack Rader, Billy Beck. <br />Running Time:  95 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language. <br /> <br />\\"The Blob\\", a glorified, special-effects injected remake of the 1950's classic, opens to the eerie and totally deserted streets of a small American town called Arborville with everyone attending the big game. One of the football players Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) asks an attractive cheerleader out named Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith). That night an old man (Billy Beck) who lives out in some woods near Arborville sees a flaming meteorite land nearby. He investigates, he sees a purple jelly substance moving around inside. He unwisely decides to poke it with a stick. The purple jelly slides along the stick and attachs itself to his hand. The towns local petty criminal Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) is repairing his bike when the old man jumps out from behind some tress at him and tries to cut his own hand off with an axe. The man disappears into the woods, Flagg runs after him. Paul and Meg are on their date when the old man runs out in front of their car and is hit. Paul and Meg take the old man and Flagg to the local hospital. Before long the old man has been more or less completely eaten by the blob and decides Paul looks tasty as well. The blob is loose, it's growing at an extraordinary rate and will eat anything or anyone that moves! The local police, Sheriff Herb Gellar (Jeffrey DeMunn) and his deputy Bill Briggs (Paul McCrane) don't believe a word of their story to begin with, but as the population of Arborvile rapidly decreases they have a race against time to stop the blob before it eats the entire town and possibly the whole of nation. Soon after, Government agents turn up, lead by the sinister Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca) and Colonel Hargis (Jack Rader), and it soon becomes clear that they aren't the townssaviours as they at first appeared to be. <br /> <br />The special effects are often silly, but nevertheless very effective, with sequences that are very imaginative and take advantage of the 80's style humur that make that decade's horror films what they are.  The acting, as you would expect, is nothing to write home about; but the cast approach their roles with gusto, and the fun performances help to make the film what it is. Kevin Dillon as the reluctant hero and Shawnee Smith as the only living witness to what's behind all of this are likable in their roles, and pleasingly, the story gives the latter's character a lot more fire and guts than you'd imagine a the role of a cheerleader to have. Dillon's character is your regular badboy turned good, but he plays it well, despite his shocking mullet! A diverting subplot involving the origins of the blob adds a good twist near the end, and there's a creepy ending that hints at the possibility of a sequel. Chuck Russell does a great job of creating the right sort of atmosphere for the film and the screenplay is better than you would expect for a trashy eighties horror flick.  Overall, an entertaining remake that will undoubtedly satisfy those who love cheesy horror flicks or who just enjoy watching good, hokey fun, no matter the genre.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not that I put a lot of stake in other people's opinions of music, but please... go on iTunes and see what the number one songs are, garbage. The fact that this album does not have a 5 star rating doesn't suprise me at all. This is not only the best album of the 90's, but one of the greatest of all time. Radiohead is the one of only bands that successfully integrates electronic elements into classic guitar and drum driven music. Thom Yorke's vocals, while not classically brilliant, are perfect for the message that he relates to the listener. <br /> <br />Their evolution from Creep to The Bends and then to OK Computer was and remains an amazing achievement. Please, keep listening, Kid A and Amnesiac are both stunning albums, and under-rated.
6305252572|4.0|Director:  Walter Hill <br />Cast:  Nick Nolte, Eddie Murphy, Annette O'Toole, Frank McRae, James Remar, David Patrick Kelly, Sonny Landham, Brion James, Kerry Sherman. <br />Running Time:  96 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />Walter Hill is one of those directors who seems never to make an average film, mainly because his movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. \\"48 Hours\\" is one of his \\"very good\\" offerings, giving Eddie Murphy one of cinema's most unforgettable movie debuts and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come.  The film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn't like blacks, and Hammond doesn't like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other. <br /> <br />Fast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad villain. If the plot to \\"48 Hours\\" sounds like a collection of all the clichs and predictabilities that ruin most films, it's important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered \\"cliches\\" nowadays because \\"48 Hours\\" was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner's music score is perfectly judged too. There are numerous exciting and hilarious moments, but none rival the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn't so. It really is an electrifying screen moment in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience.  Paved the way for Murphy's great film career and buddy cop successes such as \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Rush Hour\\".
B000A6CLL0|4.0|Some critics complained that the season long Xindi story arc was too long, I thought it often had some good bits to it. <br />I thought the production values were good and many of the story line bits were good as well. T'Pol sports a new hairstyle and costumes, Reed actually had a force field,(in one episode), several of the stories were good. <br />#8 Twilight was interesting, set 12 years in the future Enterprise had failed in it's mission when Archer was disabled and T'Pol took over but due to a just in time cure developed by Phlox Archer is cured (both in the future and in the \\"present\\") and save the day. <br />#9 North Star was about a colony of 19th century humans captured and taken to the quadrant as slaves. When Enterprise arrived they'd long since revolted and in turn enslaved their captors. The story was fun, one of the better ones of the season, but it had some plot holes big enough to fly Enterprse through. The original human population couldn't have been very large but somehow they've expanded to 5,000 or so in 300 years and maintained a civilization like their ancestors had (realistically they couldn't have enough genetic variety to remain healthy and wouldn't have had all the skills needed to keep up their society. The Skagaarans would've been even worse off). <br />#11 Carpenter Street Daniels sends Archer and T'Pol back to Detroit in 2004 to stop some Reptilian Xindi from producing a doomsday bioweapon. I liked this episode as well as any. <br />#14 Stratagem involved Enterprise somehow capturing Xindi Leader Degra and while he's unconscious constructing a ship set on board Enterprise. He woke up in the set and was supposed to be fooled into thinking that he and Archer were escaped prisoners, the idea being that he'd be tricked into revealing the location of the weapon. Not a very likely plot. <br />#16 Doctor's orders was interesting, the crew couldn't safely cross some region of space so Phlox had to put them all to sleep and fly the ship himself,several surprises in that episode. <br />The last few episodes all work pretty well with most of the Xindi races becoming allies with Enterprise, lots of action towards the last and a surprising twist finale leading up to the fourth and final season. <br />I don't remember the extras all that well now but the Day in the life of a director with Roxann Dawson was actually better than the second season one with Levar Burton. She directed at least one episode, #6 Exile, and took the camera all around the set on a tour, seemed very friendly and told a lot of details.
B0007RT9LW|3.0|Director:  Dominic Sena <br />Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, T.J. Cross, William Lee Scott, Scott Caan, James Duval, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant. <br />Running Time:  117 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for violence, mild sexuality and language. <br /> <br />\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. If you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Con Air,\\" \\"The Rock\\"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.  The film stars Giovanni Ribisi (\\"The Mod Squad\\") as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, Randall \\"Memphis\\" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.  Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara \\"Sway\\" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business, a fellow named Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde).  <br /> <br />Contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.  There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone.  In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing, Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here, and Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. <br /> <br />The film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.  The soundtrack to \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement, but not much more.
B00005J9U1|5.0|For many years, \\"Legend\\" was the only truly great compilation of this man's life's work but if you don't already have that album or if you are new to Bob Marley and want to find out what all the fuss is about, this hard-to-find version is really the best that there is.  20 great track selections and one track, the last one, that's not even on any other Marley album and most importantly of all, the sound quality is brilliant!  Too many albums use the \\"remastered\\" claim too easily and sometimes even falsely to get you to \\"upgrade\\" from the album you already have but this is not one of them as this disc has  been remastered to perfection.  If you are not too wild about \\"live\\" performances just like me, then don't worry too much about the more expensive 2-disc version as this great one-disc version will more than suffice.  Great track selections, great sound quality, great value for money, this is THE Bob Marley one-disc compilation album to get.  Highly recommended!
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|Director:  Peter Weir <br />Cast:  Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Brian Delate, Blair Slater, Peter Krause. <br />Running Time:  103 minutes <br />Rated PG for thematic elements and mild language. <br /> <br />Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the most famous man in the world, and he doesn't even know it. Raised entirely within a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, \\"Seahaven\\", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (\\"Its a Wonderful Life\\"). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, Christof (Ed Harris) the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly.  Truman becomes rebellious, trying desperately to escape his existence. More importantly, he is in love with a girl named Lauren (Natascha McElhone), who he met in school, but was taken away (She tried to tell Truman the truth).  In search for his one true love and the truth behind his life, Truman is taken on a whirlwind of experiences that are capitvating beautifully on screen. <br /> <br />Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection, yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire(ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub).  We can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning scores in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film.  Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in \\"Dead Poet's Society\\". Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him.  <br /> <br />The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show. <br /> <br />In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current \\"reality TV\\" obsessed culture. Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do). The universe does not revolve around us. In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic \\"childhood\\" existence.  A giant leap for Carrey, and despite some of its enigmatic flaws, \\"The Truman Show\\" is an enduring, emotional, and humorus film with just the right touch of charm.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I do not understand why people think that just because the word \\"Exorcism\\" or \\"Exorcist\\" in the title of the movie makes people think that particular movie is going to be anything like or near \\"The Exorcist.\\"  There will NEVER be another movie like \\"The Exorcist\\" so get over it. <br /> <br />I found this movie quite compelling. I felt for Emily, although I would of liked more background on her, her family and her relationship with Father Moore.  Yes, most of the movie is in a courtroom, which I thought was an interesting way to tell the story.  The movie didn't use the old 'pea soup' and 'head spinning' routine.  There were several times where the hair on my arms stood up.  I did have a problem with the previews which did make it out to be a 'horror' movie, but I did my homework before watching it and searched the web to find out what the movie was about, so I knew what to expect.  Overall, I enjoyed it and it did it's job: It made me think.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|Director:  Betty Thomas <br />Cast:  Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth Perkins, Azura Skye, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tudyk, Mike O'Malley, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Reni Santoni, Diane Ladd. <br />Running Time:  103 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving substance abuse, language and some sensuality. <br /> <br />\\"28 Days\\" is one of the most accurate, yet touching movies about alcoholism and drug addiction.  The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead. Why would anyone want to see a movie about someone spending time in rehab, regardless of how well crafted it is? Because \\"28 Days\\" is an interesting, sometimes funny, and involving tale with empathetic, down to earth characters, it is a production that should not pass by you without a watch.  The film's main character is named Gwen Cummings and is played by the talented Sandra Bullock. She lives a wild, crazy life with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West). Gwen is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and does not get much support from her similar love interest. As the movie opens, the two get drunk at a club, come home, have sex, and put out a fire with wine. The next day, Gwen arrives late to her sister's wedding, only to destroy an expensive dessert and crash a limousine into a house.  <br /> <br />The Gwen Cummings character is developed clearly and effectively. We learn about her lifestyle, recognize faults, and are shown a dark history through painfully real flashbacks. This is one of the things that make \\"28 Days\\" so involving. We discover elements about the character and notice inner changes as she learns of them herself. I really cared about this character.  Gwen is given a choice, she can serve jail time for her wrongdoing or can waive that and spend 28 days in a rehab clinic. She chooses rehab. The head counselor is Cornell (Steve Buscemi), who shows empathy but alsocoyness. Also present at his heath clinic is an assortment of characters who sing sappy melodies and share group love, including Daniel (Reni Santoni), with thick glasses and medical capabilities, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's young roommate, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), a famous baseball pitcher with a drinking problem.  <br /> <br />Gwen's experiences in rehab seem truthful and accurate. Her withdrawals and agonies are realistic and knowledgeable. It is obvious the filmmakers and Sandra Bullock thoroughly researched the stresses and details of rehab.  Sandra Bullock performs with the right amount of immaturity and charisma. This wonderful actress is set free in this kind of heart filled role; she is best when the main character. Here, Gwen is free to tread the surface of the movie and still allows other characters to contribute to her defining.  About half way through, the movie losses its much needed focus on Gwen and drifts into detailing relationships, friendships, and other characters. While most of the events that take place surround Gwen, the movie was on the right track with its first half. \\"28 Days\\" is smart enough to recognize its blunder; however, and by the final scenes it regains the emotionally correct material and concludes with high standards. The filmmakers are advertising it as a comedy, but only an isolation of sequences offer hilarity or slapstick. This movie teaches us lessons through its characters and the lessons are well taught.
0385495323|4.0|as (they say) Albert Einstein said (referring to some conceptual framework in quantum mechanic (which BTW he didn't initially get right)). Anyone reading the \\"popular\\" (quite a bit biased/peppered) account of the WWII and the parallel \\"word/messaging\\"/intelligence war, might come to the conclusion that the amusing British secrecy games and the D-day invasion, delayed by the US. Gov. to the point you couldn't tell if it was tactic or strategic, won it. When the NAZI army were being defeated and bent to the ground by the \\"Red\\" army on the Eastern front, which was actually the turning point of the war. <br />. <br /> In fact you may find books out there which would have a narrative more into trying to show you how the NAZIs would have won WWII. Ach! Yeah, Sure! <br />. <br /> Most wrong things (or at the point they get to be wrong) naturally come to terms by themselves to a large extent and within. Even if you may hear some people say stuff like Pr. Ronald Reagan defeated communism with his silly star war arm race or Pr. Bush \\"liberated/democratized\\" Iraq (I bet there are books about that too), I think the two main factors that brought to an end NAZI Germany were: <br />. <br /> 1._ their most basic premises were wrong, both in \\"their mind\\" (culturally speaking) and \\"on the ground\\" (as it so similarly happened with Pr. Bush's Iraq's engagement) <br />. <br /> 2._ the Red army beat the hell out of pesky NAZI offensive <br />. <br /> Also Mr Singh, do you really believe the British \\"intelligence\\" didn't know Alan Turing was gay? Really? Give me a break! They just used him as they would have anyone else. I found quite excessive, abusive and sad that his life was tormented to the point of committing suicide (or probably killed?) by the same people he so dutifully and wholeheartedly served. On the other hand I am glad that the Polish Mathematician Marian Rejewski took credit for having actually been the one who deciphered the so called freaking NAZIs \\"Enigma\\" machines. <br/>. <br /> In general this is a -good- book directed at the masses not the specialist, but taking historical circumstances into consideration, the soap-opera-like writing style is more than half way off. The WWI primarily and most fundamentally was a very bloody historical reality not just a mathematical/secrecy play. <br />. <br /> I think it is worthy to recall that millions of people died/were killed in this large-scale nonsense, which as historically documented, was being performed already in full swing by the British empire in their colonial overseas territories, the only difference being that NAZIs were less imaginative and decided to throw the party home, right in Europe. <br />. <br /> It is also baffling to see the nonsensical stupidity by so-called \\"intelligence\\" services and \\"Deutschland ueber alles\\" mentality still happening in our times. <br />. <br /> otf
B00015YVDG|3.0|Director:  Ron Howard <br />Cast:  Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Brawley Nolte, Gary Sinise, Delroy Lindo, Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Donnie Wahlberg. <br />Running Time:  139 minutes <br />Rated R for graphic, bloody violence and strong language. <br /> <br />\\"Ransom\\" is yet another Hollywood extravaganza movie about the terrors of the crime of kidnapping - with a twist. Ron Howard (\\"Apollo 13\\", \\"A Beautiful Mind\\") directs this, for the most part, gripping story with propulsion and the ability to gain nuanced performances from a disparate cast. The result is a tightly wound spring that coils tensely until the last fifteen minutes when the film explodes.  Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy man with a strong willed wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son Sean (Brawley Nolte, son of actor Nick Nolte). When Sean is kidnapped by an estranged detective named Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) and ransom is demanded, Tom goes before national TV audiences and doubles the ransom demand for a bounty on Shaker's life. How this turn of events of a kidnapper becoming the victim and the resolution of the kidnapping that results is the gist of the story: it is the struggle of good versus evil, citizen versus police, and calling the bluff of a dangerous man for the sake of a father saving his child. <br /> <br />Gibson does well as the torn father, though director Howard allows him to go a bit over the edge, acting wise. The real shiner of this film is Gary Sinise who continues to impress with the facility with which he moves through varied character parts. Russo is moderately enjoyable as the supportive wife at the side of her husband, yet Delroy Lindo is the most explosive of the excellent supporting cast (featuring Liev Schriber, Donnie Walhberg, and Lili Taylor) as the detective hot on the case.  Ron Howard is clearly a director with talent and this is a cracking story, deserving of a modern update (it was originally made in the Fifties). He draws a fine performance from his cast and keeps thefilm exciting and taunt. Ransom, despite its flaws, is well worth checking out even if it is only to remember Gibson's good old days before he became an over-ambitious director with delusions of religious grandeur. A good cat and mouse tale that has at its core the heinous crime of kidnapping, police corruption, and family devotion.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Now, I know I'm gonna get over 100 \\"Not Helpful\\" clicks , but who gives a flip? I didn't realize it back then, but Madonna's music in the 80's & 90's (back when she was slutty) was sooooooo much better. Back then, she had an image agenda, and she could've care less about the music, and so she put no effort into her songs. It was all record sales & image for her, but her music was good, then (or as good as someone who can't sing, dance, act, or write songs could get). Now, that she's old (not OLDER, just OLD;) ), the sluttiness is gone, but so are the songs that were at least half-decent. I didn't care for her then, when the song were alright, and I certainly don't care for her now that her songs blow. She's just like Michael Jackson & Prince. How old do they have to get before someone informs them that this ain't the '80's anymore, the spark that they had (they lost) they're old now, and they should just go away never to be heard from again. Now, her pushing 50, and still trying to go at it would be ok if the songs were good, but they aren't. The music industry is much too crowded (w/ bad music as it is) for old folks (who have been releasing albums since the birth of Christ) to still be around trying to blend in and be hip w/ the younger generation who's music also sucks ass. Madonna & this album is just taking up space in an already OVERLY CROWDED industry filled w/ garbage. I don't wanna still be talking about this when Madonna turns 80! :( Madonna is just too damn old to still be around, and sucking more & more w/ every album she churns out and you people know it.
0790731924|4.0|Director:  Richard Donner <br />Cast:  Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Joss Ackland, Derrick O'Connor, Patsy Kensit, Darlen Love, Traci Wolfe, Steve Kahan, Mark Rolston, Jenette Goldstein, Dean Norris. <br />Running Time:  114 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, language, and sexual situations. <br /> <br />\\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" is a rarity: a sequel with most of the same qualities as the original.  It has the same off-center invention and wild energy as the original. The movie continues the friendship between Riggs and Murtaugh who are in the great tradition of buddy cops, while capturing the magic of the original.  The film opens with a high-speed car chase on a freeway in Downtown LA. Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are in hot pursuit, tearing up Murtaugh's wife's brand-new car as they chase the speeder through an underground tunnel, up a bridge, and so on and so forth. When they finally catch the speeder they find African gold hidden in the back of his truck and soon they are being threatened to stay off of the case by African diplomats, one of whom Riggs really enjoys annoying. They can't arrest them because of diplomatic immunity, so Riggs goes in and shoots up the place where they're staying.  Riggs finds himself a new girl (Patsy Kensit), while Murtaugh protects a federal witness named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a lovable little blabbermouth who likes being one of the cops. He waddles around throughout the film like a little eager puppy, ready to do anything he's told. Of course Riggs and Murtaugh pick on him throughout the movie, but their friendship is a sort of love-to-hate.  Together they must take on the group of South African thugs involved in a smuggling scheme while hiding behind their precious immunity before it is too late. <br /> <br />As he did with the first \\"Lethal Weapon\\", director Richard Donner keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace, though he allows the intensity level to drop somewhat this time while infusing more humor. There's some `Stooges' on hand, and a bit that finds Murtaugh the target of some office gags after the debut of a television commercial, starring his daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), for a product that takes him by surprise, but the real laughs come courtesy of Pesci, who's upbeat, manic characterization of Getz becomes a real scene stealer. Though serious at the core, this movie is more of a joy ride than the first, though there are moments of true menace and apprehension, as well as a sobering resolution involving one of the featured characters. Performance wise, Gibson is as charismatic as ever, by now settling comfortably into Riggs' skin while further exploring the more intricate details of the character's personality. Glover, too, manages to take Murtaugh to the next level, leaving no doubt as to who this guy is and what he's about, from his dedication to the job, to his even more stringent dedication to his family. And, most importantly, these two really click as a team, and Donner knows just how to bring out the best in them.  The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Derrick O'Connor (Adolph), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Mark Rolston (Hans) and Jenette Goldstein (Officer Meagan Shapiro). With snappy dialogue, plenty of action and some good guys to root for, \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" is a thoroughly entertaining sequel that more than does justice to the original. Donner knows his territory, and his stars know their stuff and how to deliver it, and that's a `lethal' combination any way you look at it.  \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" should be the benchmark for action movie sequel making. In a way, this is Donner's no-sequels-rule movie. It's fresher, it doesen't have that rushed-into-production feel, and it doesn't have that bitter taste of repetition or greed for more money. This bang-up sequel serves as a fond portrait of superheroes with their pants down (literally) and a hopeful model of brotherly love.
B000002UAR|5.0|I said it before and I'll say it again: The Beatles were, and still are, the best band that ever walked the earth. Since their big break around 1963, the fab four never hit and missed. Each album they made was hailed as their best work. And after 8 years and somewhere around 13 albums, give or take, it's really hard to point out their best album. Actually, it's impossible.  <br /> <br />However, one thing is for sure and that is that their 1966 album Revolver symbolized a clear transitional point for the boys from balladeering teenyboppers to mature and serious musical artists. <br /> <br />Revolver, which follows in the footsteps of previous album Rubber Soul, comes fully loaded with songs that speak little or nothing about love and dabbles into topics never before discussed by any other band, The Beatles included; take Harrison's funny Taxman, McCartney's social commentary take on Eleanor Rigby (a subliminal response to Lennon's excellent Nowhere Man from Rubber Soul), Lennon's ode to the man who introduced LSD to him and the boys Doctor Robert, the highly experimental Tomorrow Never Knows and She Said She Said (in which heavy drug use triggered the writing of both), and I'm Only Sleeping, a song about laziness. On the other hand, The Beatles return to old form on songs like Lennon's witty And Your Bird Can Sing, McCartney's beautiful Here There And Everywhere and For No One, and rock poppin' Got To Get You Into My Life and Good Day Sunshine, while Ringo gives his voice on the classic children song Yellow Submarine (which would go on to inspire an animated film with the same title starring the boys). <br /> <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A <br />
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Director:  Frank Darabont <br />Cast:  Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolster, James Whitmire, Larry Brandenburg. <br />Running Time:  142 minutes <br />Rated R for language, prison violence, and sexual innuendo. <br /> <br />Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.  Based on a short story written by Stephen King, the film begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis (Morgan Freeman), commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. <br /> <br />By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of King's equally noteworthy novella, \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\". In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.  While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does employing the cunning Thomas Newman (who would later dazzle us with his score for \\"American Beauty\\") showing recognition for the film's needs of an emotional score; the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong seed to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. <br /> <br />With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.  This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film, proving that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour was a significant moment in the Beatles' history simply because it marked the biggest flop for the fab four. Don't get me wrong there, it was the movie inspired by the album that flopped, not the album itself. <br /> <br />The songs on Magical Mystery Tour are typical Beatle greatness. The first Beatles single of 1967, which has been revered as their best single ever, released before the epical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is featured here: Lennon's raw and elusive Strawberry Fields Forever and McCartney's sweet Penny Lane. The title track, penned by McCartney, is similar to its predecessor's title track Sgt Pepper in that it is a carnival of sound with the band welcoming you, only this time on a wonderful trip. The high point on the album has to be Lennon's landmark tune I Am The Walrus (he would later reveal that the walrus was Paul in The White Album's track Glass Onion), his other contributions are nothing less than spectacular: the quirky Baby You're A Rich Man, and the anthemic All You Need Is Love, a song that defined a generation of peace-seeking hippies. McCartney, on the other hand, takes over most of the production like he did on Sgt Pepper: the reflective The Fool On The Hill, the song that was probably a hit before your mother was born Your Mother Should Know (I love the sound of that song!), and the extravagant Hello Goodbye. Harrison offers Blue Jay Way, another one of his experimental songs, that by then had become his signature sound. <br /> <br />Despite the failure of the movie inspired by the album, Magical Mystery Tour is yet another classic album from the best band that had ever walked the earth. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A-
B000059Z8J|4.0|Director:  Richard Donner <br />Cast:  Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margott Kidder, Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure <br />Running Time:  143 minutes <br />Rated PG for peril, some mild sensuality, and language. <br /> <br />Richard Donner's spectacle of an adapation of the popular comic book is one of the most charming, sensitive, yet action-packed superhero films to hit the big screen.  \\"Superman\\" opens with the beautiful and far more advanced planet of Krypton. On this planet, in an arena of some sort, we witness the respected elder, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) passing judgment on three malevolent characters named General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran). After the elders of Krypton find these three villains guilty, Zod promises vengeance on his jailer (Jor-El), and is sent into the vacuum of space encased in the Phantom Zone, only to return in a later chapter. Jor-El is known to be neither irrational or impulsive to his peers, but his theory of the planet's destruction is quickly shunned by the others and he is forbidden to speak another word of it. As a result, Jor-El sends his child, Kal-El, to live on our planet Earth, where he would learn to live among us. After his departure, the planet of Krypton, along with his father and mother (Sussanah York) is destroyed. Enter Smallville, a quiet, southern town, where the two kindest farmers, Ma and Pa Kent (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford) adopt the newly landed Kal-El, and name him Clark Kent. In his teen years, following the death of his adoptive father, he returns to his routes, with the help of the crystals he arrived on our planet with. Within the confines of his Fortress of Sollitude, he learns from the spirit of his true father, Jor-El, and becomes Superman. <br /> <br />Upon his arrival at Metropolis, Kal-El/Superman assumes a new identity as the bumbling and pathetic Clark Kent. He is shown as a fool, who uses words like swelland slouches. Naturally appearing as a non-aggressive wimp to his boss (Jackie Cooper) and co-workers, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure). Eventually, Clark falls in love with Lois, who in fact, loves Superman. After the world meets and greets their new hero Superman, an evil plot is brewing below the streets of Metropolis. The \\"feindishly gifted\\" Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is planning the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Upon buying thousands of acres of useless land in California, he'll send a rocket towards the San Andreas fault, allowing the rest of California to fall into the sea. Luthor is joined by the dim-witted henchman, Otis (Ned Beatty) and the gorgeous and also dim-witted bad girl, Ms. Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine). <br /> <br />Gene Hackman is suitably assured and memorably hiss-able as the bad guy Lex Luthor while Marlon Brando provides a fittingly masterful and natural performance as Superman's biological father, Jor-El. Margot Kidder makes an unusual heroine who is a little more self-assured than the stereotypical female lead in adventure movies. She probably has the best scream of any damsel in distress but is not as physically beautiful as many other Hollywood actresses of the time. Christopher Reeve is, without doubt, the best Superman ever, blending his invulnerable macho charisma with the almost inept and wimpish Clark Kent to brilliant and humorous effect. Christopher Reeve actually looks as well as acts different while playing his alter egos and makes the entire outlandish premise just that little bit more believable.   <br /> <br />The turmoil Superman feels within is expressed neatly during the film and we see that, even if it looks like we have everything (perfection in Superman's case but it could just as easily be money or anything) we will still want what is free to all of us, love and affection from someone dear to us.  Special effects range from very good to brilliant and simply add to the film. Some clever moments include Superman rescuing Lois from a helicopter disaster atop a skyscraper, Superman dissuading a thief from making his escape, a scene where Superman flies off and, apparently without a cut, walks back in the door as Clark Kent and a frighteningly realistic and claustrophobic earthquake scene.  The music score is another memorable and stirring piece of music from master movie composer John Williams. The music is also completely fitting and is the final piece in the jigsaw.  Credit must also go to the director, Richard Donner (\\"Lethal Weapon\\" Series, \\"Maverick\\"), who manages to maintain a relentless pace throughout, piles on the action and humour right through to the memorable climax. Astonishingly, when this movie became successful, he was fired from completing \\"Superman II\\" (partially filmed at the same time as this first movie until financial support dried up). Director Richard Lester (\\"The Three Musketeers\\") was brought in to complete the filming of the second part of the Superman story. However, in Lester's hands the series went from solid to acceptable (\\"Superman II\\") to dreadful (\\"Superman III\\").  One of the better of its kind.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul is a definite classic! The album contains some of the Beatles' most recognizable tunes. <br /> <br />Each member contributes in some way to Rubber Soul, but it's McCartney and Lennon that take the lead: Paul's jamming Drive My Car, rocking I'm Looking Through You and You Won't See Me, and the soulful ballad Michelle, and John's experimental Norwegian Wood (the first song in which The Beatles would use the sitar, or Indian guitar), the irresistable Nowhere Man, the daring Girl, and the reflective In My Life. George contributes If I Needed Someone, which marks his first big break as singer/songwriter, and Think For Yourself, while Ringo gives his voice for the charming What Goes On. <br /> <br />Overall, Rubber Soul is a delightful collection of early Beatles songs. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A- <br /> <br />

B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles stunned critics, took their millions of fans by surprise, and literally outdid themselves when, in 1967, they presented the Grammy Award winning Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a rock album of epic proportions, after nearly a year on break (Revolver was their last album in 1966 before returning with Pepper).    38 years later - yes, that's right...it's been that long, Sgt Pepper's is still revered as the first real concept album. According to many people today, it was this album that would inspire other major rock bands' work like Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and, later on, The Wall, The Who's Tommy, and pretty much most, if not all, of Led Zeppelin's work (no pun intended).     Sgt Pepper contains some of The Beatles's most powerful work, something that might please Paul McCartney since he wrote most of the material himself. The opening title track is literally a curtain raiser, with the band welcoming us to the show. The song fades right into With A Little Help From My Friends, a remarkable tune sung wonderfully by Ringo. The 'rock opera' of Sgt Pepper ends there (or does it?), just in time for John Lennon's mesmerizing, and quite controversial, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds followed by a string of strong McCartney tunes: Getting Better, Fixing A Hole, and She's Leaving Home. Lennon returns with the extravagant Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite, followed by Harrison's Within You Without You, a song that inspired the boys to take a 'spiritual' journey to India to visit the maharishi, something George would later take seriously while the others shrugged off. Paul comes back after that with the witty When I'm Sixty Four and Lovely Rita before John makes the final and lasting appearance on the album with, first, the experimental Good Morning Good Morning and, after the Sgt Pepper show closing Reprise, the mindblowing A Day In The Life, the highlight album closing song that stirred heads, and remains to be one of Lennon's greatest contributions to the Beatle catalogue.    Recommended    A+
B000AMJDHY|4.0|I got this CD because of some nudging from an online friend, and as a male college student, I was not disappointed.  Their sound is much like Fall Out Boy, as formerly stated, but their lyrics are more memorable and meaningful.  No, they're not the next Hendrix/Green Day/Offspring/Satriani/; but they are a blast to listen to.    The sound they have is full throtle the whole way - there isn't much room for breaks.  Most of the songs are broken up into rotating A, B, and C melodies, which really works well for some songs and gets rather dull for others.    Most of the songs will get annoying if you listen to them over and over again - if you're used to techno or fall out boy, you understand what I mean.  But if you listen to it that much, that means that you like them anyway, right?  Some of them also seem to just be words strung together, and its hard to find a cohesive meaning.  Others, like \\"Lying is the..\\" hit the perfect mark - they have a solid theme, strong lyrics and great melody.    If you're expecting the next Green Day, you can keep looking, but if you're like me and just love hearing new material, this is the stop.
B000AL730O|5.0|Whenever a new McCartney cd comes out, I never really expect much.  Although McCartney is arguably the greatest all-around musician ever, I always think that with all that he has done, how could he possibly do anything more.  For this reason, people have been hard on Paul.  He has set such a high standard for songwriting and arranging as a Beatle and in the aftermath, that people want him to always be the best songwriter in the world.  If Coldplay or Jet were to come out with a cd of the songs from McCartney's last studio work, \\"Driving Rain,\\" and people thought Coldplay or Jet had written the songs, people (critics included) would write things like, \\"Coldplay have just written the best cd of their career.  They've really improved in their ability to come up with great melodies and brilliant arrangements.\\"  Yet, with Paul McCartney, they expect more, and he gets slagged for coming up with material that even at his worst, is better than most musicians could ever invent. <br />On \\"Chaos and Creation,\\" Paul McCartney plugs into the \\"Beatle Genius\\" mode, and delivers what may his best batch of songs since \\"Revolver.\\"  The album opens with the infectious \\"Fine Line,\\" and that is the last \\"good\\" song--the rest are great.  If this were 25 years ago, or if 20-somethings could open their minds to the fact that this old guy can still write, sing, and play circles around what their current heroes, and if program directors had the courage to play the best music coming out rather than shallow song after shallow song, all with the same beat and trite lyrics, this album would be at the top of the charts for six months (ala \\"Band on the Run\\")and would be currently producing a slew of monster hits.   <br />My impression of recent McCartney work (and aside from the spotty \\"Driving Rain,\\") is that it has been excellent, but that while McCartney could still rock out with the best of 'em, his ballads were not quite as good as they used to be.  \\"Chaos\\" changes all that.  I don't believethat ever in his career has he written so many breath-taking ballads.  These songs are heart felt and introspective . . . and, you know that feeling you get when you're listening to a great song and an especially great part of the song comes and you get that euphoric goose-bump moment?  Well, this cd has more such moments than any I've ever heard, and I've heard lots of 'em.  And I can't get enough of this album.  This hasn't happened to me in years.  This is Beatle-quality stuff. <br />Paul also plays virtually all the instruments, but instead of a slightly-homemade feel such as on \\"McCartney,\\" this is very polished.  His piano playing is the best of his career.  Not only is the technique excellent, but its fit into the mix of each song is very Moby-esque; his guitar work (most of it on a semi-hollow Epiphone Casino) integrates brilliantly with every song.  <br />On past cds, I'm always waiting for Paul to let lose, to give us some of that characteristic growling scream that only he can do, like on \\"Birthday\\" or \\"Oh Woman, Oh Why?\\", but this cd is so damned good that it doesn't even need it.  Admittedly, I never thought I'd like a McCartney record without some hard rock, but I guess he proved me wrong.  <br />What's more amazing is that even Beatles albums had a bit of filler.  This has none.  It's all superior stuff.  Paul might be coming into one of those super creative periods like he had in the late 60s.  Would that be cool or what! <br />It might take a year's worth of retrospect to figure out where this work rates on McCartney's list.  He's made more great ones than anyone else, at least in the pop/rock genre.  It certainly rates with \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" \\"The White Album,\\" \\"Sgt Pepper,\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" \\"Band on the Run,\\" \\"Wings Over America,\\" \\"Unplugged,\\" \\"Ram,\\" \\"Tug of War,\\" \\"Flowers in the Dirt,\\" \\"Run Devil Run,\\" and \\"Flaming Pie\\"--right now, after a dozen or so listens, I'm apt to call it his crowning achievement, the best record he has evermade.  <br /> <br />
B00000K19E|5.0|Not only is the plot original, but it is intelligent, keying a followable, original, action packed, and exiting movie.<br /><br />The acting is exellent, combined with a really good dialoug, just makes this movie better in every way. And let me ask you, what better way to end this kick a** movie then to some \\"Rage Against The Machine\\"? and what better song than \\"Wake Up\\"?<br /><br />BE WARNED- by the time this movie is over you will be desperate to see the sequel, try renting it, but know that it is NOWHERE as good as this. If you don;t like the sequel, then don;t even bother with the 3rd film becauae you will HATE it.<br /><br />-peace
B0007OY2P8|2.0|This movie was slightly bearable to watch. I only recommend it for true Jane Austen fans.  The problem is not with the plot, but with the horrid acting and directing.  It was impossible to like or hate each character, as they all seemed hollow and confused. The dialogue was truly mediocre.  The story line was without direction. I only bought it to complete my Jane Austen DVD collection. I was disappointed with this production.

B00005JNEI|1.0|This film was nothing more than a stupid attempt to influence the last election and a sad shameless cash in on the 9-11 tragedy and the war in Iraq. And yes I have seen the film because I had to watch it last year as part of a class. The attempts at humor are not funny and in bad taste as well. I didn't laugh at any one of those stupid attempts at a joke. The most disgusting thing though was when Micheal Moore used the images of a mother crying over her son who was killed in Iraq to make a political statement. He also edited footage that contradicted him. Go watch \\"Farrenhype 9/11\\" if you don't believe me. And the mother who was exploited in this film even criticized Moore for his potrayal of her son and her. Mr.Moore represents everything that is wrong with the American left these days. Hopefully though, he'll continue his stupid attempts because he only succeeds in making every left-minded person look bad. Guess who he's going to exploit next in his new movie \\"Sicko\\"? The mentally handicapped! Wait to go Mike! Your gonna profit off of someone else's suffering as well. Michael Moore is a propagandist, not a documentary film maker. He's the kind of person who could make Hitler look like a saint. Avoid this crockumentary at all costs along with all of his previous films.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|The movie really isn't as good as the TV series Firefly that it was based on. <br /> <br />I suppose the special effects are slightly better, but combine that with a boring story and worse acting (well they're the same actors, I'll blame that on the script), the result is something I'd recommend that fans of the series pass on. <br /> <br />Yeah, the movie will answer some of the \\"mysteries\\" of the series, but as other reviewers have pointed out some of the background story has been changed, so what exactly is being answered? The series was better with the mysteries unanswered. <br /> <br />If you're not a fan of the series, for only a bit more than the cost of this movie you can buy the four DVD and get four times as much entertainment.
0553278223|5.0|I picked up this book again after reading it as a child.  It has lost none of its lustre.  Bradbury's novel presents both an engaging metaphor of colonialism, as well as, an accurate portrait of human nature.  A must read.
0764110284|4.0|An excellent workbook for learning phrasal verbs in English. Its format is easy to understand, and a number of exercises are provided in each unit to help students master the phrasal verbs they have learned in the unit. However, I have found quite a few mistakes/misprints in the answer section. Some are minor: verbs and particles are separated where they should be put together one after the other; others a bit more serious: a phrasal verb that is appropriate in meaning but not covered in the given unit is offered as an answer to the quiz, or simply wrong ones are provided. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars. I hope that there aren't as many mistakes/misprints in the text itself, and that the publisher will correct them for the next edition.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden has always been one of my top favourite bands ever in Rock. Ever since I heard \\"Black Hole Sun\\" back in elementary school, their sound has stayed with me. That song is nothing compared to everything they did prior to Superunknown as many may already know. I of course got both Superunknown and their 1996 release Down on the Upside. As good as those albums were, I also remembered listening to an old song like \\"Nothing to Say.\\" Their older sound was more of what I was looking for, because that was essential Soundgarden. When I picked up Badmotorfinger, my expectations were met. This is probably one of the heaviest albums that I have ever heard with its ultra hard guitar riffs and Chris Cornell's screams. Kim Thayil is a legendary guitarist and his skills blow out your ears on this record. \\"Rusty Cage,\\" \\"Outshined,\\" \\"Slaves & Bulldozers,\\" \\"Searching with my Good Eye Closed,\\" \\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\\" and \\"Mind Riot\\" are my favourites off this. This is some of the best and catchiest that Soundgarden has ever been. It's highly recommended for those that love early 90s Rock or Soundgarden in general.
0440234743|4.0|I've resisted reading Grisham novels because of a personal bias, mainly, I'm disgusted in things dealing with lawyers.  But putting that aside this one time last October because I was looking to expand what I read, I'm pleasantly surprised by the outcome.    The lives of the multibillionaire, Troy Phelan, and of his big money-grubbing family were a delicious read.  There's a tabloid flavor whenever you get to those Phelan heir sections.  The lawyer protagonist character, Nate, was semi-sympathetic (many problems in his life like alcohol abuse, alienation from family members, financial problems, bad habits stemming from a wild life).  But I found that I didn't care for him much, although I did root for him at the end. I also found that I wanted him to face life's consequences, as almost all of us have to, who don't have the privileges that Nate had.      Reading about the Pantanal was great.  It is hard for Westerners to fathom living in a place so remote and isolated from modern conveniences (like hospitals!).  It is so true that what our society tries to make you care about (headlines in newspapers and news stories on TV) seem so unimportant when given the backdrop of a Pantanal lifestyle where life is simple, fragile, and deeply affected by the weather, where death from treatable conditions and sicknesses (snakebites, malaria, and dengue fever in the book) happen easily.  It is one of those places you'd want to visit but would think twice about living in. I am glad that Grisham found and worked this location into the story.
B000002UB3|5.0|It sounds like a weighty task, coming up with your favorite album of all time. But for me, it was an easy, no-contest kind of thing, which is testament to how much I love this record: Abbey Road by the Beatles. It's an amazingly cohesive piece of music, innovative and timeless. All that, plus the knowledge that this was the band's last work together. A brilliant, unforgettable farewell.  <br /> <br />As John Lennon himself griped, talking about music is a bit like talking about sex; it's better to experience it than describe it. That being said, I will do my best to articulate why this album rests comfortably at the top of my list. Before getting in to those specifics, I will also say I think it's especially important in the case of Abbey Road to look beyond the actual songs to what was going on behind the scenes at the time of its making.  <br /> <br />Only five years after their appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, the Beatles had weathered insanely crazed tours, changing fashions and social mores (which they helped define), the growing drug culture, and the increasing demands of their personal lives. While three of the four members had met as teenagers, they were -- all still in their 20s -- worldly beyond their years.  <br /> <br />Most recently, the Beatles survived the debacle of Let It Be, but barely. (While Let It Be was released after Abbey Road -- and after the announcement of the breakup in April 1970 -- it was recorded first, during a miserable winter of the band's discontent in early 1969). So discouraged were the Fabs by the final product, that Paul -- ever the cheerleader -- convinced the others that they could, indeed, do better. George Martin, turned off by the captured-on-film squabbling during the Let It Be sessions, agreed to return to the studio only if he could have real authority and \\"the boys\\" were better behaved.  <br /> <br />While tensions remained during the recording, of Abbey Road in the summer of 1969, the Beatles made a concerted effort to make a great album. And they succeeded. George Martin himself has called it his favorite Beatles album.  <br /> <br />In the context of my own life, I was just starting sixth grade when Abbey Road was released in September 1969; by the time the school year was out, the band was no more. I remember listening to Abbey Road over and over till every song was embedded in my 12-year-old brain. The fact this album still enthralls me so is testament to its timelessness.  <br /> <br />I felt very grown-up buying Abbey Road with my babysitting money -- it was the first real \\"rock\\" album I ever owned. This was a less esoteric and more radio-friendly record than 1968's The Beatles, a.k.a. \\"The White Album\\". In addition to the obsessive playing of Abbey Road, I recall getting fully caught up in the \\"Paul Is Dead\\" brouhaha that followed its release. (Remember the \\"meaning\\" of the album cover? John, in white, was \\"God\\"; Ringo, in black, the \\"undertaker\\"; dungarees-dressed George was the \\"gravedigger\\". And Paul ... well, Paul was striding across that album cover barefoot, which meant -- in some ancient culture that was always very vague -- that he was the \\"dead man\\".) Ah, the memories. Now onto to the music.  <br /> <br />It's the summer of Woodstock, of the Manson murders, of Chappaquidick, and despite the growing tension within the band, Abbey Road is recorded without any major hassles, proving that the Beatles retained their musical magic right 'til the end. Their chemistry was so perfect, so right-on that even their splintering existence could not tarnish it. They quit at the top of their game; perhaps that's why fans never could quite accept that break-up, constantly asking them when, if they would ever reunite.  <br /> <br />From the potent opener, \\"Come Together\\" -- with its weirdly ominous \\"Shoot Me\\" sung by Lennon -- to the final strains of \\"The End\\", Abbey Road managed to give each member of the band a chance to shine on their own, while contributing to the bigger picture as a seemingly cohesive foursome.  <br /> <br />Abbey Road is especially noteworthy in my book because it contains two of George Harrison's best songs as a Beatle: \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". While Harrison's work was always overshadowed by the Lennon/McCartney hitmaking machine, I've never failed to be impressed by what good songs he did write, with hardly any support or attention given by the aforementioned leaders.  <br /> <br />On \\"Something\\", George's passionate guitar solo fleshes out the lyrics' sense of yearning, and George Martin's subtle, sophisticated orchestral score frames the song itself. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", meanwhile, has an amazingly catchy hook -- so pure that it gets lodged in the brain in a matter of seconds through the expert finger-picking that opens the song.  <br /> <br />Other highlights on Abbey Road include Paul's bluesy, wailing, \\"Oh! Darling\\", (which Lennon reportedly wanted to sing, he liked it so much) and John's equally impassioned but more avant-garde \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\". Even Ringo's \\"Octopus's Garden\\" has a certain whimsical charm that works.  <br /> <br />The highlight of Abbey Road, for me, has to be the 16-minute medley that, back in the days when there were albums with two sides, closed out side two. Paul has to be given credit for this; structurally, the medley was his baby and his songs -- \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"She Came in through the Bathroom Window\\", \\"Golden Slumbers\\", and \\"Carry That Weight\\" -- are the standouts. Still, the medley wouldn't work without Lennon's contributions -- his \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"Sun King\\" add to the effortless flow of the musical stream-of-consciousness.  <br /> <br />While the band wasn't aware of its impending breakup -- at least, not on the surface -- the closing track, \\"The End\\" truly did signify just that, and each Beatle got a chance to shine individually before they closed up shop and went away to become the Plastic Ono Band and Wings.  <br /> <br />Firstwe get Ringo's one-and-only drum solo, and it's a catchy, inspired, rollicking gem. Then comes the \\"Love You\\" choruses that lead into the amazing guitar round robin. Paul starts it off (showing that he was always a kick-ass guitarist despite being relegated to bass), then comes George's distinctive riffs, followed by John's howling, wailing guitar. A lone piano emerges from the din, and all three sing the line, \\"And in the end / The love you take / Is equal to the love you make\\", closing out the record with a sense of, well, completion.  <br /> <br />(Ends up, though, that \\"The End\\" wasn't quite the end; the then-hidden ditty, \\"Her Majesty\\", followed after a brief pause, having the record end on an \\"up\\", rather than solemn, note).  <br /> <br />While the creepy-cheerful \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" always seemed a bit out of place to me on Abbey Road, I can't flog Paul too much over that since it was basically his pushing and prodding and nudging and nagging that got the band back into the studio for this final masterpiece the first place.  <br /> <br />While it bugs the heck out of me that McCartney wants have his name to come first on Beatles's songs now -- how big is this guy's ego, anyway? -- I have to begrudgingly forgive all that because of the amazing, timeless Abbey Road. For this record alone, he deserved to be knighted.  <br /> <br />

Bottom line:  Pass it by!
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Of course the big difference between Volume 1 and Volume 2 is that Volume 1 was all sung in Spanish; Volume 2 is in English. <br />Too often artists release a volume 2 that is just more of the same stuff as volume 1 and not generally as good.  Volume 2 is completely different than Volume 1 and is enjoyable.  In my mind, no particular song stands out, but it's all easy to listen to.  Shakira seems to do her best in her native tongue (Spanish) and her English singing does seem slightly more strained; not quite as natural sounding as the Spanish.  Still she does a more than admirable job in English and this album is better than 90% of the stuff out there.  There aren't a lot of artists who can be a success in music in two languages, so it is is noteworthy that she can pull it off.  It's also somewhat amazing that non-Spanish speakers enjoy her Spanish only albums a great deal, even though they may not understand a word of what she is singing.  I don't think she is any flash in the pan and may have some lasting power, depending on where she goes from here.   Her gorgeous face doesn't hurt either, but you can enjoy her albums a lot without seeing what she looks like. That's not true of some artists who look great on video, but don't hold up as well on recordings.  I haven't yet seen her on video, so I am looking forward to it.
B0007TKH66|3.0|and it's still good.  Since every philisophical, social, and even action type sequence has already been experienced in the Star Trek universe, there's only one thing to do: Relive it all again and pretend it's the first time that Klingons threaten to kill your family, the borg attack, the ferengi comically appear, ect.  If you completely ignore all of the \\"origin\\" story arcs in the original show and Next Generation, you'll be ready to reel in suspense, laughter, and on occasion, think deeply about the oppressed third sex of some weird alien culture.  People complain that the series is being ruined, a dead horse is being kicked, and that Jolene Blalock is being used as a sex-object.  Well guess what, the horse is an immortal super horse that can never die, no matter how much the fans try to bury it and live in the past/future, however you look at it from a temporal cold war perspective.  And on the subject matter of poor, poor T'Pol being objectified :(, have you forgotten Seven of Nine?  Deanna Troi?  And let's get off our high horse and think about the SEVENTY THREE women that Kirk's been with.  Sexuality was more suble in the past shows, were a more open audience now.  It's not as great as Next Generation or Voyager, but it's going places.  You may not like where it's going, but it's kept Trek alive.  Sure it's cancelled now, but when you're older \\"fans of this show\\" remember, you'll be cursing that \\"New\\" show that will air within the next decade or two.  With an alien captain, a gay commander, and a penguin connected to a super computer to make them coffee.  Then, then you will curse it's name and declare Enterprise \\"true\\" Trek.  Conclusion: It's a good show, keep Trek alive and watch it.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Good movie.  Which now explains the \\"Vote for Pedro\\" T-shirt craze.  Napoleon's dance scene is priceless, and so is the audience reaction.<br /><br />Lot's of off the wall one liner's like \\"I caught you a delicious bass\\"  or \\"I'm sorry I'm late but I had to tame a wild honeymoon stallion\\"  Give me a break...  that's low key humor...  and not low-brow toilet talk so common with \\"comedy\\" lately.<br /><br />It was actually rather refreshing.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it.

I m not oneof the people who r sayin that 50 cent is not hip hop or is a pop artist! he is not! he is a rapper because music is entertaintment! Rap is music so it is also entertaintment. and that's what 50 Cent is doing. He is a entertainer!! <br /> <br />Now going towards the album, there is not much to say except it is not what i expected! after listening to \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Lil' Bit\\" i was expecting the same thing as GRODT but obviously it is not!  <br /> <br />What I don't understand is why 50 wants beef wit NAS!!!! I mean if he really wanted a promo stunt, beef wit Jada and Fat Joe is enough! There is NO WAY he gonna be able to beat Nas!  <br /> <br />I gave this album 2 stars becuz of the beats and \\"I'm Suppose to Die Tonite\\"!  <br /> <br />Download the album if u really want to listen it or u can just download few songs cuz rest of the album is wack!

B000AL730O|5.0|You know what? A friend of mine gave me this CD because she didn't like it. I thoroughly loved it! It is an important aesthetic statement in the Beatles oeuvre that Paul has presented in the best he has to give. Which is light years ahead of most pop music around today. Remember all the Beatles songs were co authored by Lennon and McCartney.<br /><br />I doubt that this effort will be great rating on the charts. But this the real deal. This is the Beatle's afterlife.
B000003S0K|5.0|Holy Toledo!  What a mix of unbelievable sounds. From the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you've never imagined.  It's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they can't be sure they're really hearing what they've just heard.  Highly addictive.  Highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience.  \\"Baby's on Fire\\" and \\"Cindy tells me\\" are worth the price by themselves. <br />     I can't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight. <br />     I'm going to shut up now because I have to go listen to it again.  All the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on.  This is one amazing album that I will be drawn to 30 years from now and I've had the vinyl since '74.  The CD is perfection. This is an underground classic.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|These people who don't like this movie must have seen the chronicles of Narnia instead. This movie rocks! King Kong and the dinosaurs look so cool!! Peter Jackson's love for the mighty gorilla made him make a remake of the 1933 film. This movie has the same idea that the 1933 version did. This movie just is a lot scarier and more violent. Jack Black (Carl Denham) is hillarios in this film. This is a lot better than a Godzilla fan. By the way, King Kong easily creamed the oversized lizard (Godzilla). Even though I love Godzilla, King Kong is a lot cooler, and a lot better.
0307276902|5.0|I wouldn't have bought this for myself.  My sister-in-law gave it to me for Christmas and I read it in 3 days with two kids to take care of and in-laws visiting.  Needless to say, I stayed up late at night and read.  It was amazing.  I am not an addict nor is anyone close to me.  This book made me realize there are a whole lot of people in a whole lot of pain out there.  James Frey is a very brave person.
B000BP86OG|5.0|Lovely music. I actually tried to masturbate to the beat of track 3, didn't work out so well. I love when the lead singer screams like an 8 year old boy-it's really arousing.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie was SO funny! I love it so much! Who ever doesn't like this movie does not know comedy at all! How could you not laugh at the scene when Napoleon started dancing on stage?! I read a lot of the reviews for this movie, and the ones where the people gave the movie 1 star, said that they laughed a little. They still thought some parts were funny. My favorite part of the movie is when the farmer loads up the shotgun, aims it at the cows face at point blank range and then the school bus pulls up and you here the gun shot and all the kids saw the cow get shot in the face and all of the kids screamed. NOW THATS COMEDY!          POOP SMELLS GOOD!
0307276902|5.0|The book is a must read.  I was unable to put the book down.  It was an amazingly honest portrayal and an amazing story.  I highly recommend this book.
B00097DXZS|2.0|Getting away from the whole spyware issue, this is a depressingly weak Santana album. <br /> <br />It plays like a Santana tribute album more than anything else. <br /> <br />The album begins with promise, as he leads off with two Latin rock tracks sounding like definitive Santana. <br /> <br />Then, all the songs \\"featuring\\" somebody come on, and it's as if he only shows up to add a little guitar lick here and there. <br /> <br />There will also be the requisite guitar solo somewhere in the last minute of the song. <br /> <br />Michelle Branch's song is an abysmal sequel to \\"The Game of Love\\" from \\"Shaman\\"; it makes THAT song sound as good as \\"Smooth\\", which it is not. The hip-hop/rap interjections over the next tracks are forced, disruptive...it's clearly an attempt to connect with \\"modern\\" audiences, and it fails miserably. <br /> <br />I will say that Anthony Hamilton contributes some terrific vocals on \\"Twisted\\", probably the best track on the album that has to \\"feature\\" somebody. <br /> <br />The album ends wonderfully with the celebratory \\"Da Tu Amor\\"...a record filled with this sort of energy, melody and rhythm would have to be considered one of the albums of the year. <br /> <br />This one will simply end up as one of the bigger disappointments, in a year filled with them.
B000683VI4|3.0|I'll explain my reasoning for renting this despite the fact I'm not dating anyone: I'm a fan of Rachel McAdams. Not only really hot, she's a great actress and given the right roles she can really deliver. So one of her well-known films is Notebook so I thought I'd check it out well of course she's great here but then the film she's in doesn't quite cut it half the time. <br /> <br />The story follows an old man reading a story to an elderly couple(James Garner and Gena Rowlands respectively). He's telling the story of 2 lovers Noah and Allie who meet at a carnival. They fall in love but Noah's a lower class and Allie's rich(Titanic anyone?) Parents don't approve and just as fast neither does he so she moves. Years later by chance he sees her only to find her with someone else. She also gets reminded of him and goes back to him and reconcile. But she's getting married. Who will she pick? <br /> <br />If you've seen a romantic comedy in the past 30 years you know who she's going to pick. Hell, halfway James Garner's character has his family come visit and one distinctly says mom. You obviously know who the elderly couple are. So what happens is that the love story loses some of its impact and it's not as engaging as it should be. Plus what Gena Rowland's character suffers from doesn't work that way at all. It's just a reality bend that's not supposed to bend. <br /> <br />Enough bashing, the leads are great. The elderly couple as well as Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the younger version. The 2 have a chemistry(and they should've, they're dating for real, sorry guys...GRR!). Ryan's character for some reason to me looked like Ryan Reynolds in Amityville remake. Just saying, is all. <br /> <br />Women will love it, men will be like \\"can we make out now?....ooh Rachel's hot! but seriously when's this done?\\"

067101756X|1.0|I'm always open-minded, including regarding the events on that fateful night in Roswell, New Mexico. And for the first 30, 40 pages or so, Corso really had me going. (and the numerous fake 5-star reviews for this book might trick you into buying it).    Then it started to come together: why would the U.S. government entrust a no-name, low-level military man to single-handedly reverse engineer technology found on a crashed UFO? Corso claims to be personally responsible for everything from fiber optics to stealth technology.    The clues start coming together. For example, Corso claimed to have evidence the USA was planning a moonbase for battling aliens. His proof? A regular ol' picture of the moon, probably shot from his backyard with a Polaroid, which he labeled a \\"reconaissance picture\\" for the moonbase.    As the book goes on, the tales get taller and taller; I quit when Corso claimed the Soviets and aliens from outer space had a secret military alliance against the US.    Whatever and wherever the event, Corso just happened to be there, whether in Roswell that night, the following days when he accidentally caught a glimpse of the dead \\"ETs,\\" and meetings with the President himself. I didn't finish the book, but perhaps he went on to claim observing aliens building the Pyramids of Egypt. Kind of like Forest Gump. And Corso's about as bright as Gump, too.    Conveniently, the very elderly and certainly demented Corso died not long after the book was published. He left his wife and family a very nice life insurance policy in the form of a royalty payments from this very silly fish tale.    If you really want to learn about what happened at Roswell, visit the UFO museum there, which is filled with interesting (and factual) information that allows the individual to intelligently decide what really happened that evening long ago.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I should perhaps explain where I'm coming from to provide perspective and context for my review: I've been an avid sf reader for more than half a century, an active member of sf fandom almost as long and I'm a published writer of sf and fantasy. I'm also an unabashed Joss Whedon fan. (I didn't much care for the \\"Buffy\\" movie, so owe this to my daughter's urging to watch the tv series; I now have all seasons of Buffy and Angel on DVD, as well as Firefly and Serenity, and even Tim Minear's Wonder Falls.)  <br /> <br />But I'm something of a snob when it comes to movies. I make distinctions between sf and \\"sci fi\\"; the former are rare, the latter being generally distinguished by containing either \\"dumbed-down\\" science or, worse, stupid scientific mistakes (and are sometimes even anti-science). I never ran into the problem with Buffy or Angel because they're fantasy, where you can pretty much make it up as you go (although internal consistency is a definite plus).  <br /> <br />But when you lose all scientific credibility in sci fi, you generally lose the respect of any sf readers. Both Firefly and Serenity manage to come down with major scientific blunders, and while as an sf reader this does sadden me, you'll note I've still purchased the DVDs of both. Like fingernails on a blackboard, they're annoying; but it's possible to shudder and move on if there's any acceptable reason to do so.  <br /> <br />I've encountered my share of people who claim to be sf fans who are really just fans of sci fi SFX, but I'm afraid not even the finest eye candy has ever made me respect that segment of the genre; Firefly and Serenity are only rescued to the extent they are not by technical wizardry but by Joss Whedon's forte, compelling character-driven story telling. It's still sci fi, so the series and the movie are, for me at least, a guilty pleasure. And, sure, I wish Joss had a decent science advisor, because it would not have been hard to make his sci fi series and movie into real science fiction but, oh, well, I guess you really can't have everything. <br /> <br />The ignorance ranges from the far-reaching and general to the specific. Characters use words like 'verse (as in \\"universe\\") and galaxy apparently without any knowledge of what they really mean. Firefly/Serenity's basic premise is flawed: A star-system with a G-type sun relatively close to ours with \\"hundreds\\" of roughly Earth-sized planets and moons close enough to that sun for us to colonize and terraform them, yet far enough from each other that some would be \\"central\\" and others would be at a significantly greater distance away from that supposed \\"core,\\" is a contradiction too great to be believed even with both eyes closed real tight and your hands firmly covering them. One of the best-told stories of the series, the episode entitled \\"Out of Gas,\\" unfortunately highlights the fact that Whedon (and those working with him) is abysmally ignorant of basic science, as it violates Newton's First Law of Motion.   <br /> <br />But the story-telling! Oh, yeah! Fully realized flesh-and-blood three-dimensional characters doing and saying things that make us *care about* what happens to them.  You just won't find this in sci fi movies -- or most science fiction movies, either, I must admit.  It makes the series and the movie into sci fi that even an sf reader could love. <br /> <br />Regretfully, as a fan of the series, I must add that the movie was a bit of a disappointment. It was twice as long but had about half the emotional depth of a single average series episode -- and what emotional impact the movie had was almost entirely dependent on having seen the series. A couple of the Good Guys get it in the neck, but neither of them have been developed sufficiently in the movie to make their deaths meaningful to the movie audience; we haven't even seen enough of Zoe for most who may first come across her in the movie to realize how atypically nearly suicidal she becomes as the film is reaching its climax. Almost everything in the movie that has emotional resonance is dependent on knowing more about the characters than the movie chooses to tell the viewer. <br /> <br />The motion picture, finally, is not quite set in the same universe as the tv series. The opening scene shows Simon's rescue of his sister Summer, in which he takes a very active part and learns a great deal about what was done to her; in the series, Simon arranged (through the payment of a great deal of money) for her rescue but did not take part in it and had to learn what the Alliance had done to her over a period of time. The captain also appears to regard them as passengers who need to earn their keep, having apparently forgotten that in the series he had already made Simon part of the crew for his surgical expertise. <br /> <br />Then too, the only scene which gives the viewer any understanding of what a Companion is has been deleted from the final cut; given that Mal disguises himself as a monk to rescue Inara and that she lights incense (that isn't actually incense) and begins to pray for him when she first sees him while he is trying to do so would probably make movie-goers who'd not seen the series think she must be some kind of a nun. (Not a typo.) <br /> <br />The movie has not been a box office success, as it has yet to earn back its costs in ticket sales. It would appear that few people who were not fans of the series actually went to the theater to see it. If DVD sales are fairly high, it might yet wind up in the black, but alas those who canceled the series (and who may have opposed making the movie) appear to be vindicated, since these figures will almost certainly be cited to prove that the tv and movie-going audiences prefer cute aliens, wacky robot sidekicks and mindless SFX to character-driven stories in their sci fi (or, for that matter, even in the rare science fiction) movies and tv fare. The liklihood that there will be future films in the Serenity universe, giventhese facts, seems extremely low.                <br /> <br />It nonetheless earns, flaws and all, three stars from me. But a little more attention to detail, more character development for those who came new to it at the movies and putting in the effort to make it science fiction might have renderd this a five-star movie.  Alas. <br /> <br />--rich brown a.k.a. Dr Gafia
1400077915|5.0|It doesn't matter if you have heard of Alice Munro or not.  This collection of short stories by one of the best short writers in the world bespeaks of sensitivity and a high mastery of the craft of writing.<br /><br />The stories are about women and love in all of its forms.  Deceit, trust, love, desire and regret.  The protagonists in each story are well thought out individuals, not a false note in any of them.  Alice Munro succeeds in telling a story without slipping into a basket of clich's, rather telling stories as they really do happen in real life without a twinge of regret for having done so.  Her characters are introspective while very much being a part of the world they inhabit.  They are strong, weak, they have faults, in essence, they are believable which is the highest compliment a writer can receive.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to learn the craft of writing short stories would do well to start here.
B000021XR5|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots touched heavily upon their Beatles influence on 1996's strong but shaky TINY MUSIC. After such, singer Scott Weiland began to battle his troubling drug addictions, and he made the news quite frequently, even landing himself some jail time in the process. But when he finally recovered, the quartet got back together and made NO. 4, arguably a great record that, while not at all a failure, has very minor quibbles that are easily forgiven thanks to the dynamics that the band have recaptured quite nicely here. The DeLeo brothers still churn out monster riffs and a thumping bass to compliment drummer Eric Kretz's crazy fills, all providing solid ground for Scott Weiland's enigmatic performance...he really is a true vocalist, whether on-stage or on-studio.  <br /> <br />NO. 4 is big on variety, ranging from full-throttle rockers (leadoff single \\"Down\\") to fairly melancholy, even lush fare (tearjerking closer \\"Atlanta). But what's great is the music, for the most part, is particularly strong again, and on cuts like the break-neck \\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\", you can't help but shake, bang your head, or go crazy. It's full throttle of guitars and thwomping rhythms make it an easily memorable track. STP still harbor some Beatles influence on cuts like the likable and melodic \\"Sour Girl\\" and the 60s feel of \\"I Got You\\". But the all jam feel of the rockin' \\"MC5\\" and the blistering \\"Sex And Violence\\" bring you right back into the ring. Throughout this 11-song set, STP seem to feel good again about making music, and it shows in their performance and energy on this collection. <br /> <br />So while no true classic, NO. 4 is definitely a welcome surprise from STP who, while highly successful, have been plagued by their fair share of troubles. But while that's clear now, what is evident is that this disc rocks and rolls along, and it's good to hear this quartet finding their ground again.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris is at his best when writing about his family, as he does in many of the essays in ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. When he is not funny is when he is being self-depricating. (sp?)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this collection of essays - they are laugh outloud funny, and some, such as the story of his parents' Great Dane, or  \\"My Childhood in Africa\\", where Sedaris attempts to replace his boring childhood memories with his boyfriend's: field-trips to slaughterhouses, having a pet monkey, etc.<br /><br />They get particularly annoying, however, when Sedaris starts picking on himself. Sedaris is an incredibly capable writer, one who can tell a mundane story in a way that will have even the most stoned-faced person spitting milk out of their nose, and yet he continues to ruminate on his own stupidity, which makes average writers like myself hate him. He also seems to possess aa sort of vain attachment to his faults, and this too is annoying.<br /><br />This collection is highly recommended, but don't expect to enjoy every essay.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Wow.  I didn't know that, but I like this album a lot.  It is very funny, yet a little perverted.  But that can be excused!  I love this album!
B00005JNJV|4.0|For once a Batman film catches the edgy darkness required to make it all the more apetizing.This time around Batman does alot more then just prowl dark alleys in search of baddies.<br /><br />The main enemy (Scare Crow) isn't all to powerful,but is innovative with many tricks up his sleeve making him a much trickier opponent the nin previous Batman films.Scare Crow isn't shown too much thoug hi nthe film wich is kinda odd as he's the main Villian.<br /><br />Many May enjoy the fact that this shows a long indepth view of Batmans life and past in order for hi mto become such a powerhouse.The movie seems alot more realsitic and grim,but still has enough time to throw in some pretty hilarious jokes.The movie also has a point carried through the entire film,it's all about fear and to face it.All of Batmans large inventery has been updated into the modern scene.The Bat mobile has never looked nicer.Scenes in the movie are presented in widescreen very clear and crisp.The plot is very original and this movie can apeal to a large array of people.<br /><br />Overall a must rent and a potential must have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just borrowed this DVD set from a co-worker to see what all the fuss was about.  I finished it in a day and a half...I couldn't stop!!  I was kind of skeptical at first because this same person recommended Smallville (BARF!!)to me (Sorry, I'm a Superman purist).   <br /> <br />Firefly felt entertaining and fresh from the start.  I'll admit the idea of treating a sci-fi fantasy with a heavy injection of the Old West sounded as ignorant as Lex Luthor living in Smallville as a friend of Clark Kent's at first but Mr. Whedon pulled it off remarkably.  I was never remotely interested in watching Buffy or Angel (and I'm still not & don't regret it) but having watched the entire Firefly series I can safely say that Joss Whedon is not only ambitious but he is also a very gifted story-teller. <br /> <br />The characters are perfectly cast and come across as both tangible and believable.  Each of the actors fills out their role with captivating personality and draw you into their struggles.  The dilemma of their desire to make money by any means necessary and remain honorable at the same time brings heart to any show.  Combine that with intense action sequences, well developed characters and a decent plot and you have a recipe for great television.  Too bad nearsighted television execs don't have a clue as to what constitutes a great show.  I mean, Fox fought to keep Paris Hilton & Nicole Richie on the air but passed on this gem of a show...'nuff said! <br /> <br />Sorry if I'm catching the train late but, hey...better late than never!  If you haven't checked out this show get it and, trust me, Serenity (the motion picture follow-up) is a \\"must-have\\"!  I am now seeking to purchase both to add to my DVD collection.
B000002MTR|5.0|Guitarist Dave Navaro is a fine dark addition to The Red Hot Chili Peppers.Dave gives tracks like \\"My Friends\\" a sad soft sound while songs like \\"Coffee Shop\\"<br /><br />sound dark and heavier then any former RHCP material.Flea of RHCP should really be credited in tracks like \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\" as his frantic bass lines are better then ever.Everyone contributed just enough to here each of the their proffesions shine.<br /><br />All the songsm ay take a great amount of time to apreciate if you're a average RHCP fan.The songs aren't as polished and light and crisp sounding.With exceptions of funky \\"Aeroplane\\" and \\"My Friends\\" alot of these songs weren't to succesful.Although you may recall \\"Warped\\" and \\"Coffee Shop\\" being played on t.v. as music videos.<br /><br />All the tracks are great the guitar is fantastic and overall i could careless for RHCP's old guitarist John Frusciante if music like this were to of kept up.Not a must have like RHCP's \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\",but a deffinate borrow or buy used album.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Who cares what anyone else says.  Oasis fans know this is true. <br /> <br />The reason Oasis are not well know in America anymore is because they don't release singles here, which is probly why their new material is not played on the radio. <br /> <br />This Album is easily their best since BE HERE NOW. <br /> <br />It is pointless to even write a detailed review because TRUE OASIS FANS like most who are reading this already know how great it is. <br /> <br />Buy it, don't buy it, it doesn't matter.  Oasis are already rich beyond belief and we are too because we get to own on CD, the brilliance of the BEST BAND IN THE WORLD.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I'll start by saying that this is one of the best movies to come out on DVD in some time. The reviews here give enough detail, however, the most important point to make is that this is based on a true story. It is not really a horror movie in the true sense, although there are some very frightening moments. It is a movie that will make you think. If you want a horror movie full of special effects that will make you sleep with the light on for days...this is not it. If you want something unique and intellectual that will make you ask \\"what if?\\", then you will enjoy this film.
B000286RKW|3.0|I read the editorial review on this website, where it says that this movie is every bit as good as The Godfather.  Baloney.  The Godfather, part 1, is far superior to Goodfellas.  You gotta be kidding.<br /><br />This is a well told story until the day of Henry Hill's capture.  Then suddenly the film goes way downhill.  The day of capture has time captions on the screen, and is terribly drawn out.  The movie is pretty bad from that moment on.  It is like two different movies - a very good one followed by a pretty bad one.<br /><br />Breaking his capture day into such long and stupid segments, chronicling what time it is, is just so way off base.  That day is important to Henry but it is not important to me.  And this is not the most interesting or important event in the movie.  It is to Henry but not to me.  I don't give a damn about Henry Hill or the fact that he was caught.  He cares, I don't.<br /><br />I would have expected better from such a well known director.  He blew it big time.<br /><br />The movie is too long.  The capture should have been shortened 90%.  Then the whole movie should have been wrapped up.  It would have been a much tighter film, and much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are terrific in this movie.
B000001DTM|5.0|I unabashedly love U2 and this is my favorite by far.  i never tire of the inventiveness on this album.  From the opening salvo roar of the edge to the quiet finale.  This for me is one of the greatest Rock and Roll albums.
B000002KET|5.0|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath(1973). Black Sabbath's Fifth Album.<br /><br />In 1973, Black Sabbath were still a heavy-hitter, but instead of playing arena concerts they were playing modest-sized concerts. After Master of Reality, Sabbath couldn't seem to get a big hit, but their albums still sold well because of Black Sabbath's huge fanbase. No. 4, while being a great album, failed to produce a solid hit, so Black Sabbath went on tour and went to the studio to record Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath would go on to be considered Black Sabbath's finest moment to many, boasting such fan favorites as \\"Sabbra Caddabra\\", \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", and \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\". It was clear that Sabbath were still in their prime, and fans went out and bought the album even without the help of a hit single.<br /><br />With Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Black Sabbath stuck to their tried and true formula of crunching guitar, evil lyrics, and piercing singing, but they added some new elements to their sound, such as keyboards and synthesizers. Black Sabbath would later go on to make this a major part of their sound, and this is the first album where they experimented with it. Black Sabbath opens with \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", the classic Black Sabbath masterpiece. Heavy and thundering, Black Sabbath quickly shows that this is one of their all-time best. \\"A National Acrobat\\", while not being very well known, is a pump-your-fist and headbang metal classic. Slow and progressive, the track is a perfect mix of powerful riffs and haunting singing. While Sabbath is not very well known for being \\"progressive\\", where bands continually shift their sound within a song, many times on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath they seem very progressive. \\"Fluff\\", as the title might suggest is some very basic filler, but it's not bad at all. A nice beautiful little acoustic guitar piece from Tony Iommi may not fit in well with the album, but it's a good offering. \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" is another Black Sabbath favorite, a loud and dirty hard rocker that never fails to get your head banging. Insanely powerful riffs and vocals make this song one of Black Sabbath's most agressive offerings. Metallica made their own cover of this classic, but Black Sabbath couldn't be outdone, their version is much better! \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" is a classic groovy metal tune, starting off slow and picking up into an evil and powerful rocker. Very catchy, Iommi displays his insane guitar talents on this track. \\"Who Are You?\\" is a rather bland synthesizer driven tune, and it suffers from repetisism. There is some nice keyboard work here, but this track still stands as the only mediocre song to be found. \\"Spiral Architect\\" does *not* sound like Black Sabbath, but more like Rush or Yes. A truly beautiful and haunting track, it's a very progressive and thunderous tune that serves as one of Sabbath's finest moments. The album closes with \\"Looking For Today\\", a punkish hard rocker full of attitude. Black Sabbath uses some very soothing orchestration to great effect here. Perfect way to close an album.<br /><br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a classic heavy metal album, and to me clearly Black Sabbath's finest effort. Every song here, with the exception of \\"Fluff\\" and \\"Who Are You?\\" are classics. Black Sabbath's use of keyboards, synths, and orchestration shows them branching out musically, and their song structures became much more progressive and focused on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. To put it simply, this album rocks. I encourage any fan of hard rock, heavy metal, or Black Sabbath to pick this up or your collection isn't complete!<br /><br />Also Recommended<br /><br />Black Sabbath - Paranoid<br /><br />Deep Purple - Machine Head<br /><br />Ted Nugent - Cat Scratch Fever<br /><br />Thanks For Readingath favorite, a loud and dirty hard rocker that never fails to get your head banging.

Yes, it qualifes as such accordingly, however, I find it thoroughly enjoyable @ home, unwinding after a hectic day @ the office, and also, while in the car as great travelling music. Every single song, which beautifully blends in from one to the next, qualifies for a top 10 hit!  If it's not already, trust me, it will be.      They're all GREAT, but my favorite stand-outs are cuts #3, the fantastic bass driven \\"Sorry\\" ; #5, an extremely powerful \\"I Love New York\\" ; #7, the very sensitive/heart tugging  \\"Forbidden Love\\" ; #8, the dreamy and strong \\"Jump\\"; and #12, the snap your fingers, clap your hands, and /or tap your feet \\"Like It Or Not\\" . Now, I saved THE best one for last, ..... #4 , the Donna Summer-I Feel Love/Madonna-Ray Of Light influenced \\"Future Lovers\\". Absolutely  riviting!  Wow!! ....\\"There is no love like the future love\\".........   P.S. You have my blessings to put this track on repeat mode.     P.S.S. Note to Madonna:I hope to meet you someday in person so I can thank you for the music and congratulate you on a brilliant masterpiece ! ...... John Pollack , Glendale Heights, IL
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This film is inevitably going to gain a word-of-mouth cult following.  My interest in this film was piqued when \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" listed it as one of the year's ten best DVDs.  They were not wrong.  It would be a disservice for me to say too much about this intricate tale of a man mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years who upon release is torn between vengeance and curiousity about the identity and reason for his captivity.  The best I can offer about this Korean import is that it can honestly compared to such latter day classics such as \\"Chinatown\\", \\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"L.A. Confidential\\", and \\"Memento\\".
B00005JO9J|1.0|I love this show and have from the start.Do not be fooled-this is for Episode 1,the pilot and not Season 1!Please don't be disappointed and think you are getting the first season.If it were, there would be more than one disc that was only 60 minutes long.
B00006RCNW|3.0|small timer-like drama, annoying hip-hop music. unconvincing baldy guy playing tough, totally absurd strike team leader could kick police captian's behind all the time and anytime he wants. 100% copycatting 'ny blue'(even the setting of the police station looks alike)+'law&order'+'soprono', but twisted and ridiculed the ethics of policing and organization chart to the extreme. making the city of los angeles uglier than ever, angelinos more pathetic than ever. <br />if you could accept bad guy is also a good father, a good collegue, a sometimes good, sometimes evil and that's human, and that's normal, what else's new? what else could be impossible? anything goes, man, if you could really accept it, enjoy the ride.
B00003CX5P|4.0|to me the best of the series is still espisode 4 a new hope!!! i can still remember seeing it in 1977( WAS IT THAT LONG AGO) and i have been waiting for this one for a long time, but i found this one a little less than i hoped it would be. it still rates better than most movies out there but this one felt a little to rushed story wise, as if mr. lucus was eager to get to II and III and just wanted to get I under his belt. not a bad film just slow in spots. but still worth the price to see this begining of the best series in movie history!!!!
B0008GNJZY|2.0|education, education and education. who needs them? in nowadays america, education is for the purpose of those of the non-talents not for the so-called young talents who can shoot basketball from afar or different angles to the basket, running faster than others, singing and dancing better than the others. why waste two more years for education when you're already too good for nba, nfl, 'pop star search'? if you decide to finish two more years to get a paper diploma, you might lost 14 millions dollars contract already, or might not be recruited for the nba, nfl, or that tv show looking for young talented singers already off the air... <br />the purpose of getting diploma is for you to get a better job for  better pay, but if you could get better job with outrageous pay, why waste another year? yeah, you'd say education is for life enhancement, it cannot be evaluated by how much money you could make for now? yeah, that's deep, but could it deeper than your pockets, or thicker than your wallet? in nowadays america,  singing, dancing, running, -18 holes, 980 yards dash, 49 points a game is everything, entertainment is everything, music is everything, mp3 is everything, businesscard thin ipod is everything, once you get into the car and on the road, music, hip-hop is everything, you just can't live without music, without boom-boom-boom!!! all the time in your cab, not one second without music....does education really that important? if the american social cultral could only provide you with all the same strip malls, chain stroes, and you could only accept these national chains and afraid of trying anything else, why you still need education? when you feel hungry or don't want to cook tonight, you only know to call for pizza deliveries, buying and eating the 'don't bother me, i'm eating' 6-dollar burger, why you need any high school or college education? why you have to patch so many bumper stickers such as 'my child is a student of the month at xxxx school!', 'my son iscitizen of the month at yyy school!', 'my daughter is honored student of this month at zzz school!' but never know who else care! when a society full of leather jackets, leather boots showing off on remodelled harley-davison motorbikes, crazy about the deafening and boring noise out of the exhaust pipe, who needs more education and wants to stay at school? if all the people with  college or high school diplomas got the same taste of remodelling their homes or kitcheons, accepting the popularity of the granites for their kitcheon countertops but refusing to accept the fact that such granites are also being used for tombstones, what difference any kind of education really makes? you tell me.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has surprised her fans and shocked others; and this time is no different. Confessions on a Dancefloor is a 'mircacle' in todays age.  Mature lyrics, spiritual themes, and yet simplistic and modern.  In many ways her growth is relfected in her art.  This LP was by far one of her best and like 'wine' she only gets better with age.  Here's to Madonna...til next album we meet!
0307276902|5.0|I have just got done reading A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard.  I read them both in 4 days.  Both books are wonderful, thought provoking, disturbing, sad, and enlightening.  I have already passed the first book off to my brother, and I continue to tell anyone who will listen that these books are a must read.  So blunt, so real, so...life.  These are books that I will cherish, share, and love forever.  I find hope and strength within each page.  Bless James Frey for writing these books and giving us these gifts.  I have laughed and cried, and I have enjoyed every minute of it.  Mr Frey, if you ever read these comments THANK YOU!
B000B8QG0O|5.0|What could be better than the 2-disc \\"Toy Story\\"? Well, you can try the equally-superb \\"Toy Story 2\\" in the same 2-disc format. Yes, your Pixar collection is now complete thanks to this, the movie that took Woody and Buzz to places no toy had yet gone before. <br />        As with the first installment, the movie looks and sounds terrific thanks to a cleaned-up print and, again, the good work of sound master Gary Rydstrom. You can see the bright toy colors and clickety-clack sounds like new. Also, the computer process had advanced enough by now that both the human characters and the action settings looked more realistic- especially the airport in the final segments. <br />        \\"Toy Story 2\\" also boasts a very clever story line that's both a loving throwback to vintage kiddie shows and good- <br />natured satire on both mega-toy stores and collectible mania. Both are exemplified in a wacky new character, Al the Toy Guy (voice of Wayne Knight), the rotund and manic toy retailer who's also crazy about his \\"Woody's Roundup\\" memorabilia.  <br />        \\"Woody's Roundup\\"? Here's what I really love about this movie. The greatest old-time kiddie show never aired, this is \\"Howdy Doody\\" meets \\"Hopalong Cassidy\\" and Woody's unknown-to-Andy roots. Through a roomful of '50s-style toys, a kinescope- <br />style flashback, three new come-to-life characters and a nifty cowboy-style theme song, Pixar's John Lasseter and his team create a delightful homage to vintage children's TV. The collectible part? Al's made a lucrative deal to deliver Woody and the gang, personally, to a Japanese toy museum. <br />          Between the mysterious disappearance of Woody and the exciting rescue from a Tokyo-bound jet, we revisit all the much- <br />loved characters from the first \\"Toy Story\\". Particularly funny are Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the gruff piggy bank, and both Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. Estelle Harris makes the latter into a classic Brooklyn Jewish/Edith Bunker mother, a perfect match for Don Rickles (\\"I'm a married spud!\\"). Of course, of all the things Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have done, it's their wonderful Woody-and-Buzz banter that might last longer than anything. Don't miss a fusty (is he anything else?) Kelsey Grammer as Stinky Pete the Prospector, either. <br />         The format of this edition is identical to the one for the first \\"Toy Story\\", with a great batch of bonus items on Disc 2. Character and set-design galleries give you a detailed look at how elaborate film construction unfolds. Lasseter's the proverbial kid in the candy store as he displays all those cheesy \\"Woody's Roundup\\" toys. Rydstrom's back with a game that lets you see how sound mixing works. There's even a welcome appearance by Riders in the Sky, a veteran Western-billy band that does a lively \\"Roundup\\" medley. Both that song and \\"When She Loved Me\\", Jessie the cowgirl's soft, nostalgic ballad (sung by Sarah McLachlan), were penned- as was all Pixar-related music until 2002- by the wonderful Randy Newman. <br />        \\"Toy Story 2\\"- and \\"Toy Story\\", too!- are movies whose appeal is across the board, easy enough for four-year-olds, witty enough for college kids, and well-drawn (both design and character) enough for literate adults. They're, as I like to say, \\"awesomely simple\\". The beauty of Pixar is that, though the technology, bells and whistles get ever more sophisticated, they never lose track of making movies that are about strong characters and realistic situations- whether they're working with piggy banks or one-eyed green monsters. What more could a movie maker or viewer ask for?  <br />       We're told that a \\"Toy Story 3\\" is on the storyboards. Can Pixar- and, hopefully, its once and future business partners at Disney- keep this franchise fresh and wondrous? I certainly think so. Meanwhile, there's much to enjoy here.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The early reviews were some of the best ever for a \\"popcorn\\" film, and King Kong lives up to that acclaim. For pure action, excitement and cinema awe, there is no equal. Audiences are glued to their seats during the chase and fight scenes, and many people are moved to tears with the tender moments between Kong and Ann (Naomi Watts). But people are staying away, and those who attend do not describe it as a rewarding experience. Why? Because the film is too massive, too exciting. In a word, it is \\"overwhelming\\".<br /><br />The story is well known: a group of filmmakers (lead by Jack Black as the crew's director) travel to the remote Skull Island, a hidden world that does not appear on maps and can only be found by wayward ships lost in the fog. The island is one forgotten by time. Dinosaurs inhabit the island, but the king beast is Kong, a massive ape-like figure who uproots trees and de-jaws T-Rexs during his daily activities.<br /><br />Of course, the ship's beautiful blonde passenger becomes the object of Kong's desire and they develop a relationship that drives the film's action. Unlike previous incarnations of this story, Peter Jackson's version of King Kong allows the Ape and the girl to actually bond. In the PC world, he doesn't like her \\"only\\" because she is beautiful and blonde; he likes her because they share some happy moments together, making the final all the more tragic.<br /><br />The photography is beautiful, from the haunting jungles of Skull Island to the flapper-era street scenes of New York. Of course, the film's iconic moment takes place stop the Empire State Building, a scene brought to life under a stunning Monet-like sky. The most awesome visual feature is Kong himself. So real and so lifelike that viewers quickly forget they are watching a fantasy story.<br /><br />There is nothing bad to say about the film. The performances fit the story perfectly, with Jack Black irresistible as the gung-ho showman. The effects, sets, costumes, etc all show how great movies can look when their monumental budgets are used responsibly. But again, people only like this film; they don't love it. Why?<br /><br />It is just too much. The film could really use a thriftier editing. By removing an hour, the experience of viewing the film would leave people excited about the story without being exhausted from the viewing. And removing an hour would not damage the story. The most obvious subplots to cut involve the other passengers on the ship, especially their journey to rescue Ann on Skull Island. While they search for her, the film becomes unwisely similar to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. The group of ragtag would-be rescuers battles all kinds of adversities (giant bugs, dinosaurs, dangerous cliffs, etc) to get to Ann and her captor. This action has little to do with the main story (Ann and Kong's relationship) and could be removed without damaging the story.<br /><br />It is not a perfect film, and clearly improvements can be made. But there is still a lot to like, especially for young viewers (or the kid in all of us). In its current form, King Kong is to teenage boys what Titanic was to teenage girls; the kind of film that will find its way into the dreams of its viewers for many years.tc all show how great movies can look when their monumental budgets are used responsibly.

B000BMSTMS|3.0|As you look through the reviews on this Korn album, I think you will see two different styles of reviews:      Reviews from people who love anything and everything Korn puts out.  Seriously, it could be 75 minutes of Jonathan Davis farting and they will give it 5 stars,     or Reviews from people who hate Korn, who grew tired of them in 1999 (or hate them because everyone else says they do), and will say that \\"See You on the Other Side\\" sounds \\"like every other album they've ever done\\".  They won't really say WHY it is a bad CD, but they will probably end their review by recommending a bunch of obscure death metal bands instead.    Well, I'm going to try and be a third type of reviewer:  A die-hard Korn fan who is realistic.  I encourage you to read my reviews of \\"Untouchables\\" and \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" to understand the Korn story and how long I have listened to them.  In short, I have all the albums, have listened to them since 1995, and have seen them 5 times in concert.    Well, 2005 was an interesting year for the 5 (now 4) members of Korn.  Longtime guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch announced he had found Jesus and left the band, citing Jonathan's vulgar lyrics and his own personal drug problem.  It became sort of a running joke, with Tool/A Perfect Circle vocalist Maynard James Keenan parodying the whole thing as an April Fool's Day joke.  Head still has not been replaced, but former Otep guitarist Rob Patterson has filled in as a touring guitarist---off stage.  Yeah, the band won't let him play out there with them.  I thought it was strange too.  Hey, Green Day has a touring guitarist.  What's his name?  Heck, I don't know, but at least he can stand out there with them.    Anyway, back to the album.  Like every Korn CD of the past 6 years, the band announced that \\"See You on the Other Side\\" was \\"the best thing we've ever done\\".  Well, I thought \\"Untouchables\\" was.  Or maybe it was \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\", since the band said the same thing about both ofthose CD's.  Well, the one thing they were forthcoming about was that they were experimenting with new sounds, and that they had hired pop producers The Matrix (no, not the movie, but the 3 person team who produced and wrote Avril Lavigne's \\"Let Go\\" album) and Dallas Clark to produce, engineer, and *GASP!* help write songs on the album.    Korn fans around the country were horrified that a mainstream pop producing act might have taken over writing duties for the band.  The rumor was that Head was the one with all the talent, and that the band couldn't work well without him (much like Limp Bizkit without Wes Borland).  Well, Korn DID write most of the music.  The Matrix and Clark simply contributed to arrangement ideas and song structure.  It works very well on some songs, but not on others.    The opening track (and single), \\"Twisted Transistor\\", is the one song you've probably heard.  It's pop sounding, but not in a \\"Commercial Radio\\" way.  More like a \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" (by Nine Inch Nails, obviously) way.  It's really not a good song, and it seems like a lame attempt by Korn to write a catchy, radio friendly hit.  After \\"Ya'll Want a Single\\" and it's subsequent video, I thought they weren't about that.  There is a overuse of samples and overdubbing on this song.  What is Jonathan saying in the pre-chorus?  \\"Use it to?\\"  \\"Music Do?\\"  It sounds like when the radio version of the song bleeps out a swear word.  Not a good start.    However, \\"Politics\\" is amazing.  Jonathan's lyrics are a little hokey, but the overall song structure and chorus are especially well done.  \\"Hypocrites\\" takes an obvious stab at Head (\\"Your messiah was never mine\\")--even though Jonathan says it is directed at RELIGION, not Head.  Uh huh.  Another good song, one of the few that sound like the old Korn.    \\"Souvenir\\" was originally titled \\"Souvenir of Sadness\\", which was the original title of the album.  Why it was changed, I have no idea.  It is slower than most Korn songs, but just asheavy.  Not in a \\"bang your head\\" way, but it has a lot of weight in it's sound.  \\"10 or a 2-Way\\" is a pretty generic song.  Some have said Jonathan's heavy breathing at the end is supposed to be Darth Vader.  I think it's supposed to simulate sex, even though it does sound like the Sith Lord.    \\"Throw Me Away\\" is very Nine Inch Nails like, and sounds like \\"Hollow Life\\" from \\"Untouchables\\".  It's a song very heavy on samples, and falls into the \\"experimental\\" category.  \\"Love Song\\" isn't the famous song by The Cure, in case you were wondering.  Other than the chorus, it isn't anything special.    Man, this is getting tedious.  Let me cut to the chase.  \\"Open Up\\", \\"Getting Off\\" and \\"For No One\\" are all throwaways.  Not that they are bad songs, and they all have their catchy parts, but your life won't change when you listen to them.  \\"Seen it All\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" are failed \\"experiments\\".  It was like they were trying to write some legendary quirky breakthrough song, like Tool's \\"Third Eye\\".  Sorry guys, but it didn't work.    \\"Coming Undone\\"  will be the 2nd single, and is more catchy (and a better song) than \\"Twisted Transistor\\".  \\"Liar\\" is the most \\"Original flavor\\" Korn song on the CD, and the one getting the most love from the die-hards.  I thought it was good, but there are other heavy songs that are better, like \\"Politics\\" and \\"Hypocrites\\".    I bought the Special Edition of this album, which is the one to get if you decide to buy it.  The extra tracks are, shall I dare say--better than the actual album.  \\"It's Me Again\\" has a terrific pre-chorus (\\"You see beauty, I see pain/You see sky and I see acid rain\\"), but Jonathan screams \\"It's Me Again\\" way, way too many times.  \\"Eaten Up Inside\\" is the best track on EITHER CD, with an outstanding chorus (\\"I never got what I wanted/I never got what I needed\\") and the first appearance of David using a DOUBLE KICK DRUM.    \\"Last Legal Drug\\" is slow, like \\"Souvenir\\", and better.  It has a catchy hook like \\"Coming Undone\\".  And yes, the chorus of this song is included as a bridge in \\"10 or a 2-Way\\".  The Bonus disc rounds out with 2 \\"Twisted Transistor\\" remixes (the \\"Dummies Club\\" one has become quite the hit around the club circuit) and live videos of \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and Hypocrites\\" from Moscow (only via a CD-ROM--it's not a DVD like the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album).    I've never been one to review each SONG on a CD, but I thought it was necessary this time around, because it's hard to describe this to Korn fans.  Most of the album doesn't sound anything like previous Korn releases.  Well, it's obvious Korn is trying to evolve and get away from the \\"Nu-Metal\\" movement, which has become more of a dirty word in music than \\"Grunge\\".  Every band, from Limp Bizkit to Papa Roach sounds nothing like they did on their first album, Korn included.  The problem is that Korn pioneered the sound, so everyone around them forced them to change.  I commend the guys for changing their sound up a bit and trying to evolve, but it just doesn't work.    Based on public reaction, the problem with \\"Untouchables\\" seemed to be that it was too polished, too overproduced, too straightforward, and too perfect.  At the time, I thought it was the greatest CD ever made, but now I barely listen to it, because I can't discover anything new when it's already perfected and fine tuned like it is.      The problem with \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" was that it was too much like the old Korn.  I personally loved it (see my review!), and found it interesting that everyone complained that it sounded too much like the self-titled album when that's the only album anyone admits to loving.    Of course, hardcore Korn fans will buy this album (like I did) and a good portion of them will call it the greatest CD ever made.  Not me.  To me, this album is a lot like \\"Issues\\"--a average album with a few great songs, and a lot of filler.  It's an average album that is hurt and brought down by the obvious desire of the 4 remaining members to evolve and become commercially viable again.  1998 and the success of \\"Follow the Leader\\" should have never happened to this band, because they seem to be obsessed with reaching that level again.  They won't admit that, of course, but it's obvious when the last 4 CD's are all different.  Korn seems like they were desperate to evolve on this album, and really, it seems like they tried too hard.  I was hoping for another \\"Take a Look In the Mirror\\".  But that album didn't sell, so I guess we won't see that side of Korn again.    I really, really, really wanted to like this album.  But because of the desire to evolve, I just couldn't get into it, even after multiple listens.  I recommend it, but not unless you either are a die-hard Korn fan, listen to their other albums first, or are open minded and understanding.  Much like Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\", I love the band, but the experiment of a CD just doesn't work.    Yes, money talks, apparantly, and we got a bloated album with intricate artwork.  And when this album doesn't sell 8 million copies like \\"Follow the Leader\\" did, expect the process to start all over again, with new producers, a new sound, and a new CD that will be \\"the best thing we've ever done\\".    EDIT:  I've never edited one of my reviews before.  However, I checked back this morning to see if my review had posted, and it had.  I then read a few pages of reviews for this CD, and discovered that my prediction about what the reviews would be like was pretty accurate.  One guy even said I was targeting HIM!  I honestly read NO reviews of this CD before I wrote mine.  Since when did Amazon turn into a message board to flame each other about the content of their reviews, OR to bash the band/director/author/politician themselves?  I guess writing under \\"A Kid's Review\\" is the hip thing to do, since no one can tell who you are.  Amazon really needs to regulate who posts on their site--and have a spell and grammar check too.  It's gotten absurd.  That isall.
B000A78Z82|4.0|Some of you might already know this, but I didn't read any mention of it in the other reviews. There is a separate or \\"hidden\\" track that is about 8 minutes long called \\"White Reggae Troll/Africa\\". So, actually, this album has 23 tracks. I think this track's title further identifies the subtle Reggae influences, infused with folk, rock, alternative, bluegrass and other genres that amalgamate into the entirety of Cripple Crow. <br /> <br />Banhart is an excellent neo-folk talent whom I first heard on Antony and the Johnson's \\"I Am a Bird Now\\" album. The tracks are musically and lyrically diverse, performed in both Spanish and English, united by a calm, earthy undertone that is pleasant like Iron and Wine (though comfortably distinct). Though these tracks are largely mellow, it grooves with enough soul to keep the listener from falling asleep. <br /> <br />The music has an indigenous quality to it; I'm using that term a little loosely. It just makes me think of the music that the aboriginal musicians would be making today if most of them hadn't been killed off.  <br /> <br />Cripple Crow will make a superb addition to your collection. The album offers a nice balance of longer songs interspersed with shorter ones, which comprise about 80 minutes worth of fun, contemplative and poetic tunes to keep your heart at peace. <br /> <br />I rate this album at 4.2 stars. It improves after several listens, like Nick Drake albums did for me.
0060899190|5.0|This book is the sum of all addictions. It is funny, sad, angry, horrifying, hopeless, innocent, devilish and a whole lot more. Once you pick it up you will not put it down. Each post card puts you in a 30 second world of the author/artist. They are like a little window into lives you will probably never meet, but have been known for years. Highly recommended.
0060594888|4.0|I had to buy this book as soon as it hit the shelf--and I wasn't disappointed.  I took a long time to read this book because there is a lot of meat (and a lot of filler).  The author spends a lot of time patting himself on the back for his biggest coauthored series,  \\"Chicken Soup...\\".  I read the first in that series and that was enough for me.  I highly recommend this book.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Wil (Hugh Grant) is the ultimate dilettante.  His father wrote a famous Christmas song and he has been living off the royalties all his life.  He thinks of everything in terms of 30 minute intervals.  Everyone in his life tells him he is wasting his life and it has no substance. <br /> <br />He is looking for relationships that fit into his lifestyle - no strings short term.  So he decides to date single moms.  The problem is how to meet them.  His first idea is to attend a single parents mixer.  This creates its own problem because he doesn't have a kid.  So he creates a 2 year old but he doesn't have any idea how a two year old acts or what a two year old can do.  This blows up in his face. <br /> <br />One day a boy shows up on his doorstep, Marcus (newcomer Nicholas Hoult) - (it's a little more complicated than that).  And he hires him to pretend to be his son.  He meets a beautiful single mom, Rachael (Rachael Wiess).  But things get complicated when Marcus has ideas of his own.  He wants Wil as his dad and tries to set him up with his offbeat mom (Toni Collette).   <br /> <br />The real story is not Wil trying to find a temporary mate but that of Wil and Marcus.  Wil is the real child, a man who has never had to grow up, and Marcus the child adult, a boy forced to grow up too fast.  These are the wonderfully touching and truly inspirational scenes. <br /> <br />Of course, the Wil and Rachael story has to blow up and does.  The movie has a touching and almost over the top ending but it works. <br /> <br />This is the typical Hugh Grant character but he has found a way to make it interesting and new.  Toni Collette continues to amaze me.  She can do anything.  And Nicholas Hoult is perfect, let's see if he can keep it up. <br /> <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Spotlight on Location: Making of About a Boy - A typical promo featurette running 11 minutes with book author Nick Hornby, directors Chris & Peter Weitz, actors Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Rachael Weiss andToni Collette.

I prefer the director's comments as you are told why the scene was deleted.   <br /> <br />Music Videos - Silent Sigh and Something to Talk About by Badly Drawn Boy plus About a Boy Soundtrack spot <br /> <br />Badly Drawn Boy - 21 minute interview with the singer Badly Drawn Boy <br /> <br />Santa Super Sleigh - The full song in video form <br /> <br />English to English dictionary - This really should be British to American dictionary.  It shows a scene with a typical British term then an American definition.  Most words are well known but it is still fun to watch (3 minutes) <br />
0767827694|4.0|The mind wants what the mind wants and when you're watching a movie it is usually to know what is going on. Orlando defies all logic spanning a couple centuries without really explaining why or how but it is beautiful to watch; the costumes, the scenery and of course Tilda Swinton. At points it does seem a bit long with no end in site but if you can lift yourself above storyline, lack of plot and the usual things that carry a movie you may find enjoyment in getting to know the struggle of one man who becomes a woman and the times they live in as they learn about love, deception, jealousy, devotion, admiration, honor and the rights of the sexes. This movie is not completely true to the book as the director added on a world war in an attempt to update the movie had Woolf written the story later. I have seen this movie a few times and still enjoy it. It is worth watching at least twice to wrap your mind around it. Orlando made me fall in love with Tilda. If you're a fan of Billy Zane you get to see him ride in on a horse, sweep Orlando off her feet and depart as quickly as he came. The movie isn't about him or their relationship, as the title stipulates, it's about Orlando.
