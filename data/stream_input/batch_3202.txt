B007HOOAH6|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son thinks this is the best book ever.  He is always asking me to read him the &#34;Potty book&#34; and he &#34;reads&#34; along with me.  It has helped him be more in tune with what his potty is for, but it hasn't exactly helped us progress in the potty training arena.  However, I give it 5 stars because he adores this book so much.
B001UG4VWQ|5.0|LOVE THE MOVIE! Great purchase!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is by far a lot better than the first one so far I like the graphics and it is not the same scene all the time
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I am very addicted to this game! Love the colors and how easy it is to play it. Totally recommended.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is the best comedy show on TV and I really enjoyed the added gag reels and interviews about the cast.  I now have every season of The Big Bang Theory.  It's a must for fans of the show.<br />If you have never watched I suggest you buy season one and you will be hooked.  My husband an I watch several episodes every night.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|Cast, sets, characters, music -- all great! Fine pacing. Favorite line, Sheb Wooley, after the horse kissed Kevin Kline: &#34;I had a girl do that to me once -- didn't make her my wife.&#34;
B00C5R71U8|5.0|a very good inside view of apple design and effect on the company.<br />When design win over engineering, the best product is borned.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|This weather tool is easy to read and is very accurate.  I love it.  I use it several times each day.
0761158820|5.0|This book is so much fun!  I thought it might be kiddish for my 11 year old origami loving nephew. He and,other members of our family had fun making these over the holidays. We placed in many a Christmas scene and took funny pics. I hope to check out more of what they do!
B0090SI582|1.0|We went to see this in the theater.  What a pathetic waste of time and money.  This was one lame movie.  I was ready to leave, it just drug on, and on, and on.  The action was all seen in the trailer.  Wolverine limps around whining a lot in this movie.  This was a big let down, we were hoping for an action packed thriller, unfortunately this is not what we got.  Save your money, Redbox it if you have to.  Wolverine could have been an amazing flick.
B00EPFEY44|3.0|Fantastic scenery, Andrea's voice is beyond compare, great arrangements by David Foster. What's missing is about  half of the original broadcast as seen on PBS. I wanted more, and really missed the other half of the concert.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Kinda hard to bring up on Kindle. I guess you don't get the full monty on the Kindles like you do computers though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun I hate that if you don't complete the levels after a few tries it locks you out. That should be changed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The first time playing the game it is not easy. But I love it.<br />I got used to It. BUT LOVE THIS GAME! I love the difference between Temple run and this game.
B00006GO99|5.0|I've loved Thelonious for almost half a century and it's impossible to explain why.  Give it a listen and you'll understand.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love the series: the history, the characters, the costuming, the plot twists, the insight into an earlier time.  Can't wait to view Season 3.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|&#34;The Greatest Film Ever&#34; is what many say about this film.  While it's true that it tops the AFI for American movies, followed by Casablanca and 3rd place The Godfather this film is not the greatest every time.  CK has been dethroned by movies like Tokyo Story or Vertigo in the &#34;Sight & Sounds&#34; which is the snuff movie guys favorite internationally respected poll.<br /><br />While I recommend people watch this movie if you like movies, I also remind them that this is a movie from 1941.  This movie while amazingly done for its time, in this day and age of modern acting it would be considered a weak movie, with mediocre actors and a long-winded story that could have been done in a 45 min short.  But, we must remember this movie in it's time was very advanced compared to its peers.<br /><br />As for me I don't consider this the best overall film, I do think is better than Casablanca or Gone with the Wind, there are many other later films are so much better like The Godfather or Dr. Zhivago.  I can put this movie in the double digits in my own list and will probably never top it.<br /><br />This movie gets a lot of attention because these same movie snuff that love it now, the snuffs from yesteryear of this movie were trying to get it removed due to the similarities (even though it's fiction) to the real life William Randolph Hearst which tried to get it removed by any $$$ means necessary.
B004GK2B6Q|5.0|If you are a birder, you cannot help but love looking at all these birds.  The technology is astounding as well, so if you're a tech buff, you'll appreciate what went into creating this movie.  The story is good vs evil, classic.  The personalities given to the birds were in sync with the essence of the different species in real life, right down to the nervous Burrowing Owl.  Fascinating to watch.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very addictive.  Some rooms very difficult to complete so do need to use  Facebook to get your friends to help.
B004GYY714|2.0|The ad for this app makes you believe that it is free. It is not. The ad is a come on.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Cool slow motion shots and it's awesome you can hunt deer ducks Turkey wolves and other big game. Neat guns and upgrades. It would be cool if they added archery hunting, like compound bows and long bows.
B001MRYWZO|4.0|This is a great and spooky tale. I also watched the movie and it stayed quite true to the book. This really sent chills down my spill. It was a haunting yet sad tale. My only problem was that I wasn't too happy with the ending.
B000QRIGJY|1.0|Not one of Connelly s best works....was difficult finishing this one, I was let down as I liked most of his novels :-(
B00080Z53O|5.0|Amazing movie!! This is a story that everybody should see. Very moving... leaves you breathless. And Javier Bardem is simply magnificent. Incredible actor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I ever read! A moving, adrenalin pumping book that I will never forget thanks a lot!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a good series of books. You have to read all three, though. Otherwise, you do not get the full story. The 3rd book closes a good trilogy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Do you like dragons? Then you will love DragonVale! Breeding, selling, buying, feeding, quests, and so much more! I recommend this awesome game to anybody!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I am 35 and usually hear of a good book or series after it's been made into a movie. I love sci-fi modern, ancient and futuristic. The comedy in this book really is laugh out loud or at least a good chuckle. The Iron Druid would be like that of a god to regular humans but within the world of magic, this guy is an extremely hard worker at staying alive and enjoying the good times when they can be had. A great page turner and I enjoyed the lively tone of the orator in audio enhanced form. This should be an easy pg13 movie or mini series on sci-fi channel some day.
B0012QCZ54|3.0|Better than one, but still terrible acting... I love the music and choreography ... Theme is good also :) Keeper
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Doesn't work and takes up too much storage. Simple game, in real life. Stay away, not worth it or the headache.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|For people looking for a family friendly movie that keeps the adults entertained at every viewing this is the way to go.  A creative story line, great acting by some well-known actors (and some relatively unknowns) and a hope-filled and uplifting conclusion are all here.  We ended up buying copies for other members of our family and have watched it several times with friends, enjoying it all over again every time.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Yay I'm so happy it works know omg I can't believe it and it's even updated and awesome  :) :)
B00BC5FN2C|4.0|When I first heard that they were remaking Michael Dobbs' \\"House of Cards\\", my first reaction was \\"Why?\\" Because the British original with Ian Richardson as the plausibly charming but malevolent chief whip of the Tory government in the House of Commons was so pitch perfect. Nevertheless, I decided to order it along with the BluRay of the original British series, \\"House of Cards\\" (which, since it has been remastered, is *splendid*).<br /><br />Although Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright turn in outstanding performances in their roles as the formidable Chief Whip and his even more formidable wife, who share an almost mesmeric relationship in their marriage, and the series kept me absorbed from episode to episode, I had to divorce myself from the British original and consider the series on its own terms in order to enjoy it. You will enjoy it, too, if you do not compare it to the original.<br /><br />That being said, the story has become transmogrified beyond recognition in its journey across the Atlantic. The pace has become far more leisurely than the original that had me glued to my seat for every episode. Unlike Francis Urquhart, whose evident charm and polished manners drew me into his spell--his initially confidential asides put me in the position of a willing co-conspirator, enjoying the intrigue, until I gradually realised that I had been trapped, unable to evade his eyes, which had taken on the aspect of a cobra's--Francis Underwood [Urquhart's American counterpart] is unmitigatedly nasty from the get-go. In fact, I found him and all of the Washington characters charmless. The series has also lost its sense of humour, and what was subtly suggested has become rather coarsely stated.<br /><br />I do think that the scenario works better in the Westminster parliamentary context, since the seductive dynamic of power was turned on its head in the American Production by making Francis Underwood visit his little reporter in her tacky downmarket apartment. Francis Urquhart wouldn't have been caught dead visiting Mattie Storin's eminently respectable mews flat. The thrill came from Mattie's clandestine visits to Francis's elegant townhouse. Power is far more seductive in a Savile Row suit and silk tie than it is in Francis Underwood's shirtsleeve slumming in an area of Washington DC that Francis Urquhart would have termed a neighbourhood of 'knocking shops'.<br /><br />Like other viewers, I found the discs difficult to extract from their sleeves, but luckily I do not seem to have scratched them, and the images in the Blu-Ray are sharp.<br /><br />Again, if you watch this as a well-acted and interesting American political drama, on its own terms, you will not have wasted your time. But you might find yourself turning back to the splendid remastered Blu-Ray of the British original. 3.5 stars.wouldn't have been caught dead visiting Mattie Storin's eminently respectable mews flat.

0316096199|5.0|I love the book. And the used book is in good condition. When I read some chapters in the bookstore, then i decided to buy it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love the concept... There's still some content issues, but the device itself is great. I've used it mostly to stream content from Chrome from my laptop to the TV and so far it works good.
B000AY74OG|5.0|OK so if you have grandchildren, this is a must for rainy day watching.  Just good clean wholesome fun.  Good stuff.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent!  Wonderful story and full of suspense.  I like the interwoven story line too.  I would highly recommend this book.  The secret made me gasp out loud.  Great book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Simply excellent.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pops or classical type music.  Well worth the money paid.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|The HD 681's exhibit very full but well defined bass. I've noticed that the mids and highs which were a bit too much in the beginning have mellowed out at 60 hours of listening. If you put these on my head 10 years ago and played a few pieces of music and then asked me the price I would guess somewhere around $150-200. At 1/10th the price they a great value. I bought them because an Amazon review reader asked about how they compare to the Panasonic RP HT660 I had bought. I like owning both, the 681's are better for acoustic jazz and rock. The only neutral comment I have is that they are pretty bright sounding so for longer listening sessions you might reach listener fatigue earlier than the RP HT660's.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the very best ever!  Everyone should read this book and if possible see the movie.  It reminds me of ann frank and reminds us all of the horrors of war and what happens when bullies are in control!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Works Good on the 3 computers I have them on.  On my older p67 mobo at work had to do some playing around to get the usb3 to work right, but that's not the hubs fault.  I did wish they had one with a 6 foot cable instead of having to purchase a usb 3 extender separately, but it's not a deal breaker.  Just got a usb 3.0 flash drive, and it transfers super fast with this hub.  I have also used it to clone ssd's.
1439170916|5.0|This book is an outstanding and inspirational book for physicians, patients, and their families.  It is accurate and well-presented.  I could not put it down!<br />Robert S. Toth, M.D.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|Entertaining noisy fun from the Super Hero Support Team. Typically implausible missions carried out against bad guys who can't hit a stationary target with 100 rounds made interesting by Joss Whedon's multiple story arcs and smart(ass) dialogue and fully realized  characters.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|I really love that Ashlynn and Hunter come together with there starter stories. They are very lovely and because we moved I haven't had time to open it yet, but they are very close to the show. Ashlynn's shoes are a bit darker than the photo, more like a Turquoise color than a blue other wise its very beautiful. I wasn't too excited to get hunter and orginally just wanted Ashlynn, but he does complete her. It's cheeper to get them on Amazon than at Justice or Toys are us. The only thing I wish is that Amazon would get them much faster like Justice does. Don't give these dolls to children under 5 because of smaller pieces like Ashlynns headband and ring and her clock purse I think opens. Be careful not to lose anything small because the only way to get it back is to get new dolls. Other wise I would love more clothes for them. Ashlynn is as tall as Raven, and Hunter is taller than them but Hunter is about as tall as barbie and a maybe an inch shorter than Ken. :3 A huge fan or Ever after high.<br /><br />- Roberts Daughter
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I had initially thought that it might just be a toy that would be returned or forgotten in a dresser drawer.  I was wrong, I have been using it for almost 2 months now and it's with me day and night.  I make sure that I get my 10,000 steps in each day even if I have to walk around the block before bed.  As hokie as it may seem I like to break my daily step record for badges.  I doubt I will ever make 30,000 but you never know.  I equate it to a carrot in front of a donkey or ass if you prefer ;)  I have had it since they came out and with each firmware update it just keeps getting better and better.  It's remarkable that they can get a step counter, jog counter, height counter, sleep counter and heart beat measuring device all with Bluetooth transmission in a device that small and weights next to nothing.  The only issue is remembering to remove it from your pocket before laundry  ;)  Highly recommended and has been to friends that have purchased one.
B003274QH6|5.0|I just love this series. Incredibly well written episodes with plenty of surprises. Combine that with incredible casting.<br />I marathon watched this series because I couldn't stop watching.
0780619951|5.0|One of my favorites.  Just as good as the original.  Love the combination of actors.  Makes you wonder if something like this actually did happen to spark this book, then movie to come into play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!<br />I am reading this book I. School it relates kind of to me. I have the SAME problem!!!
0525244581|5.0|My son's in Taekwondo and this is one of the books his Master recommended he read.  It gives some great concepts for children.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|This is an amazing game.  It's a platform game, you move the cat across a beautiful and mysterious world.<br /><br />You have three options--button control, accelerometer and drag control.  You use one of these options to tilt and rotate the screen world which causes the cat to move through the world picking up jewels and avoiding pitfalls.<br /><br />I recommend the accelerometer.  I couldn't get &#34;drag control&#34; to really work, and the button mode made things move too fast and abruptly.<br /><br />You have three jewels to pick up on each level.  There's no penalty for moving slowly in the regular game, but there is a time trial.  You do have to be alert to the pitfalls, which can be hard to pick out.  You don't seem to have any penalty for losing lives, but I'm not sure...<br /><br />You pick up seeds along the level that allow you to create &#34;continue&#34; portals.  These will allow you to restart the game from that point.<br /><br />There is a little round floating eye that is the spirt of the tree.  You can touch the eye to go back to the main menu; it will also apparently alert you to the presence of important or dangerous objects.<br /><br />I recommend reading the &#34;How to Play&#34; on the main menu.<br /><br />Once you have collected all three diamonds in that level, you can play it in Time Trial mode.<br /><br />Some of the pitfalls are obvious spikey things.  But sometimes, the cat is swallowed up, and this isn't a pitfall, it's access to another set of passages.<br /><br />I really found this game mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Love the series, and gave this a great review because I'm afraid of what may happen to me if I don't.....
0395389496|5.0|My son and I love reading this book together!  I am very happy with this purchase I made, highly recommend.

0316204366|5.0|The best non-fiction writer out there.  Gladwell delivers every time and this time is no exception.  A must read across the board.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a great series. We are watching an episode of it almost every night and we really love it. Thanks for offering such a great series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this app to get rid of all those other apps that won't shut down completely.  Too many apps just reside in memory when you turn them off.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love game except for each update is making harder to win anything. Need to be elite to win and that isn't right since it is supposed to be free game.
B003O85W44|5.0|This album is amazing but the vinyl is warped. I was so sad when I played it because its sounds awful!
B004UID2LC|5.0|the most app is really useful and i can download any song i want .. my friend always ask me about it
1439153663|4.0|read lots of books always good to have extras on hand so I keep a good supply on hand when I need too
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I found it to be tedious and wordy. Cornwell has lost the art of story telling.  There is too much introspection and too little credibility.  This was the last of her books that I will read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like mincraft and all, but it wasn't worth the whole 7 dollars. For example, it dosent have all of the things that the original mincraft has on the xbox or Pc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but also easier. I really enjoyed this game! I can't wait for additional levels to open!
B003FSTN52|5.0|Bought it as a gift for my daughter who started watching the series late. She will be thrilled.  Arrived on time and perfect as expected.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|What an amazing series! Unexpected ending that was fitting to the story. Can't wait  to reading  this again in time.
1449305172|5.0|When I saw this book, I get loved with it and wanted to translate this book. Unfortunately, I'm late. You know, I even have the 1st chapter translated. :D 《Running Lean》 is an excellent choice for people who want to get started on Lean startup right away. This book is a good supporting and reference book on《Lean Startup》、《Business Model Generation》and 《The Startup Owner's Manual》，similar as the book 《ATDD by Examples》, it gives real cases to show readers how to apply the methods in practice. When I translated 《ATDD by Examples》, I really feel the beautiful readiness and smoothy wording, which make it easy and joyful to follow up and finish the book in few days. Ash, excellent job!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is just the best game for family and friends.I think u should get minion rush so u van have fun
0792164903|5.0|Funny, romantic, and a period story. Could you want more? Both leads at the top of thier game with a really good supporting cast.
B008OHV4PG|2.0|Didnt expect this to be this bad would not reccomend this dvd I love Neil youugs stuff,,to diffrent ,very unuasl
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Just as good as the first one. Leaves you wanting more. Great mix of characters. Malkovitch and Willis are very funny. Mirren's sarcasm is slick, edgy and makes you smile.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Very poor ending to the series. The main protagonist's efforts were so unfortunately irrelevant that it made the series end on a very sour note. Surprising, and possibly more realistic, but not very satisfying to the reader.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|This was how real men used to behave-with morals and virtues and self sacrifice. Something a woman could look up to and didn't mind deferring to. Nothing like what is walking around today-selfish , sniveling, all about me type men. Lead actor should be proud to have chosen a role that is so full of good personality traits.
B00CGG4CPK|1.0|It was completely broken!  We changed out their batteries.  No light!  No sound! It didn't even come in the original packaging!  Very disappointed!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Action packed nonstop thrills and humore. Each character is distinct and very much a product of their purported generations. Mingleing of the characters is also well done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book not only made me smile and laugh, but also made me bawl my eyes out. It is such a beautiful and inspirational love story. I loved every single minute of it.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Lead actor is wooden. Story line is twisted and contrived. The writers and authors were unable to make an Elphaba from a Wicked Witch in this adaptation.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Was very slow and was nothing like the original.  Guess the actors are showing their age.  Wouldn't buy and won't rent again.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|My granddaughter likes this.  Not much to it. Blow hair. Cut hair. Comb hair. But you don't have a lot of control over how it goes.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Ending sucked, but how can you not read it after you've committed to the trilogy? Go ahead and read it lol
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game.  There's no brain strain involved.  No puzzles to solve. Only a game to enjoy alone to destress.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What more can I say.  This is a believable novel but the absolute best author of our time. Although I saw The Shining, I bought it again.  I now will begin my second read.  King at his best.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Very good app. Up to date weather for your location.  Good to know how to dress for the weather of the day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game in the world . you should really play this game.  I promise you'll have fun. I hope you like it and one thing you have to update a lot so be prepared
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is very well written.  You never get bored with it. I had no idea what Steve Jobs was like before reading this book, and Isaacson writes it in a point blank and interest-keepping way.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I have been waiting to receive this and when I did the case was broken, the plastic cover ripped, & I am not to sure of the dvd itself, I'm to afraid to play it with all the damage to the cover case.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is the story of a young man in North Korea, written in a way that if you aren't familiar with history and political events, you'd never know if it was set fifty years ago, twenty years ago, or five years ago. The story is almost built upon an Odyssey-like storyline, with multiple settings and a multitude of characters. Each character, no matter how insignificant he or she may seem when introduced, serves an important role in the story, and it's woven together in an artful way.<br /><br />This book is a captivating story and unlike so many books that are being published nowadays, it is written in such a way that the prose itself contributes to the mood and the story progression. It's a book that you have to pay attention to as you read, because if you let your attention wander for a page or two, you will be lost.<br /><br />The book is 400+ pages, but I will admit that it took me almost 100 pages to really become involved in the story. For that, I detract one star. The rest of the book was amazing and left me wanting more.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The best shooting game you can get on kindle fire I was amazed in the graphics in the game and for 6 dollars it's worth every penny keep up the good work gameloft
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This movie, while not action packed, is almost hypnotizing.  The story is farcical and the acting follows suit.  This is a must see for any vampire fan.  Sharon Tate is lovely throughout the picture. Makes one wonder what other roles she would have had had she not been taken from us.  If you haven't seen this movie you should!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've had this app for to days and so far I like it. Its better than temple run 1 anyway
B000002OYB|5.0|Had this album on tape and could not find it anywhere since then.  Great Meatloaf album. Original Sin is a great song and only found on this album.  Meatloaf fans pick this up.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I rated the product based on the ease of setup & use...so far.  I received it in the mail today. It only took 5 minutes to install & get going. After the automatic program update, I was watching Netflix in no time! I think I'm gonna love it!!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Funny for the kids with too much adult's humor, not necessarily offensive or inappropriate humor. Creative thinking is not in this movie.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Great movie! Got just in time and have watched it soooo many times. My brother his 12 years old and he won't stop watching.
B000002MU3|5.0|Of Automatic For the People, Michael Stipe has stated that it was done heavily in response to the band members turning 30, steering them toward the melancholic and reflective.  It's almost as if Monster, the follow-up to AFTP, is a need to reach back and grab the last strands of something youthfully uninhibited and wildly energetic.  And it is a terribly fun, energetic, highly enjoyable, and even sexy album, but Monster also feels like a throw-back to something R.E.M. never really was.  Having said that, I love it, as R.E.M. is my all-time favorite band, and Monster, to me, is another indelible part of the incredible cannon they have amassed.  Even if it seems as though they are stretching for something not quite theirs, they are simply too good to not pull it off.    On a side note, and to further illustrate just how amazing this band was, they followed up Monster with ANOTHER rock album, though completely different, New Adventures in Hi-Fi.  It appears to be much more reflective, in both writing and production, to who the band now saw themselves to be, and it's one of their very best.    For many bands, Monster would have been a definitive, representative work.  For R.E.M., and in the context of their entire portfolio, it was a fun side trip that also happened to debut at #1 and go 4x platinum, selling 4,000,000 copies...in the US alone.  Their absolute best, most representative work is not here, but I would never diminish Monster's success (as some snobbish, jaded R.E.M. fans will do), nor stop celebrating what it is.  It's an infectious work.  As I sometimes find myself doing, I'll hem and haw as to whether I should pop it in or not, but when I finally relent and do it, every track spins before I chastise myself for ever debating its merits in the first place.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Quality movie, didn't expect it to be as good, only down fall was the lack of intimacy that's a must in most bond movies
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is a great album, probably one of the best albums ever in its entirety.  The only problem I have with ordering cds from amazon, is that sometime they come cracked.  The instant I took this cd out of the case, the little circle thing in the middle broke, and there was a crack in the case after day one.  I don't know if this is fault from amazon, the manufacturer, or the shipping service.  I also order gnr lies, and that case is fine, so it may be the manufacturer, but I believe it is ultimately Amazons fault.  So 5 stars for the cd, but 2 stars for amazon.
031623480X|5.0|Game changer.  Researched and believable.  I care about sharing information like this with my clients.  It's a refreshing twist that any discussion of weight is secondary:  it's about preserving your marbles!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game. Great graphics. A little tricky learning to fly and shoot at the same time. Definitely worth the time.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I enjoy all the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.  She has a great story line, with humor and suspense.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|My kids and I loved the movie and we love to sing along with the songs! I even play the instrumental selections in my classroom while students are working.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|OMG I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH ITZ SO ADDICTING I COULD PLAY IT ALL DAY BUT THEN MY POWER ALWAYS DIES OUT ANX IN LIKE WHATS GOOD???
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I have a child with a genetic disorder. They're not in school yet. Gave me a glimpse of what it might be like. People can be so unkind. But this book reminded me that people can also be wonderfully kind.
0399157573|5.0|Scarpetta fans have long suffered the last 5 books in the series, the dark years where our favorite crime solving quartet has been blanketed by hate and the FBI and Marino's incident. Yes, Kay got the wolf man, saved the world from a deadly toxin, but the novels were so dark and the relationship between Kay, Benton, Marino and Lucy seemed so fractured some readers probably gave up on Kay Scarpetta. But, what joy returns with reading \\"dust\\". Sure, some tensions remain, but this book takes off like a rocket and by page 300 only 6 hours of actual time has expired as a death scene leads to much larger implications in a story where Kay and Benton and Marino and Lucy together again work their magic like the old Virginia ME stories that first captured our amazement with their non-stop action and relentless pursuit of justice. This may be the best Kay Scarpetta novel that Patricia Cornwell has ever written!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love all Nicholas Sparks novels.  I can't wait to read his new books every time a new one comes out.  He is an awesome writter.

B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Picture isn't very clear.  Quality of the picture isn't very clear, the colors are not very vibrant either.  But it's ok for a quick photo.
0375847227|4.0|The product was in excellent condition and the story is great.  I bought this book because I liked the movie &#34;The Golden Compass&#34;.  Although the book is vastly different from the book it is still good reading.  I wouldn't recommend this for children under the age of 13 however because of the violence.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game.  I have never played it before, it is quite addicting.  Easy for all ages and good to help young people consentrate.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It was fun, but I got pretty far along and then it stopped working so I now have to redo all of the levels.
098478280X|1.0|In general, a coding interview book is a good idea if it tries and help you learn. I see this book mere compilation of good questions but not great solutions. This is more like a question bank and nothing more. This book is not meant for learning at all. This book looks pretty shoddy while explaining some details.<br />for instance -  &#34;What is the running time of this algorithm? One way of looking at this is to see how many times each node is touched. Covers touches every child node, so we know that every single node in the tree must be touched at least once, and many nodes are touched multiple times.&#34;<br />I personally take interviews for one of the companies mentioned in the book and this kind of answer is pretty inappropriate. Also i see lot of inconsistencies in the solving pattern of some questions, looks to me a compilation of answers from various places/persons.<br />Well i am not satisfied with the quality of the book considering author herself was an interviewer with Google.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Very cute game. My five year old and seven year old absolutely adore it and so do I for keeping them occupied. I would recommend it to anyone.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Well done conclusion to series.  Saw Part 1 with my nephew.  We needed to get Part 2 to see before he went home.  Quick delivery made that possible.

B000021Y7X|5.0|One of the greatest achievements in any concert format it is a must own for any serious David Byrne fan
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|So much better than the first racing game. This one has so many more features including voice overs and its own drum n bass soundtrack!!! How awesome!! Only thing, i wish it had more cars available in the game like in the previous one
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hesitated to start playing this game not knowing what it was all about.  One night I started playing and found out that I love it!  The games are challenging and fun!  I like how it interfaces with facebook to allow friends to give life's and you can help your friends.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Definitely convenient and useful whenever you want to watch a thriller and a great storyline about zombies. Best to get started with this first season, which goes for any show as you should know....anyways...GET IT! You won't regret it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Totally captivated by this series. Awesome read!! Since reading the first book in this novel I have been captivated by the breadth and detail of this series. Great read!!
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Awesome movie especially for guys and people who like a twisted storyline. Very nice and convenient to have on DVD as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had often wondered with King would provide a sequel to The Shining, which BTW i rank near the top of his novels, to me anyway. And he did not disappoint: after the first 5 pages I was hooked, line and sinker both. I could not put it down until the book was completed. Thanks Stephen King for two sleepless nights. May you provide many more.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Loved this movie! It's great if you want to see Robin Williams acting as a child the whole time and growing up slowly. I personally want to become a child psychologist and recommend this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|My Chromecast HDMI is working great, so I bought another for my son.  He's tried everything and can't get it to work.  We've gone over all the installation instructions, with no luck---so my rating is 2,5 -- an average, 5 for mine and 0 for his.
B004G600A4|5.0|My girlfriend was really into this movie, which I have yet to see, so I got it for her. Thus, it could definitely be a nice gift and something to set up a date with;)
B000B8QEYC|4.0|If you love Enya, this is a must have.  This album contains more emotional songs than most her albums, but are truly touching.  There are more than enough songs on this album to make it worth buyinig.

B00EPVTLKU|5.0|Get it ari, get that! Ooh this album is the jam no no no it's the j a m. Ok if you don't own it you obviously have no life. I got mind fit 1.99 but just lawd it's good. Favorite track so far: YOU&#34;LL NEVER KNOW. Ariana's r & b flavor is just amazing on that track. Popular song with Mika I just can't but all the tracks are amazing so yep dueces I'm outies. ✌🙈😜
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't have Facebook &won't have it. This is the only way to get more lives. Otherwise you have to wait 25 minutes to restart the round. I will be deleting the game soon.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|A very good read for people who are in to the series recommend highly can't wait for the next one of the series a good read hard to put down
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Do not buy the ($1.99) downloader. It doesn't work. I had to ask for a refund. It just doesn't download the videos.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Many readers know that John Steinbeck famously wrote almost all of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; in one draft in under a year. Perhaps as brilliant as that was it has tainted our image of his talent to assume he could produce some a masterpiece with such seeming ease. Shouldn't we instead be wondering how the same person could write repeated classics that all retain freshness and originality into the modern day. His craft is to tell stories in the simplest of language that lures us into thinking it's a simple story.<br /><br />&#34;East of Eden&#34; is just such a trap. The story flows with such ease and fluidity that one floats through it enjoying each passage from the ever deepening plot. But as one progresses through the book I'd hope one might appreciate the same profound awakening that hit me. &#34;He wait a minute, these are very nuanced and rich characters and this is one very special story about one side of real America absent cliche or sell out to perception or expectation&#34;.<br /><br />For me I could almost feel Glen Ford or Henry Fonda reading the story aloud. Steinbeck tiptoes between idealism and reality which such delicate footsteps. He has a common touch and a the brilliance of keen insight into the human experience. A reader is rewarded with dialogue earnestly debating good and evil and a storyline that captures a late 19th century/early 20th century America this is as well depicted as I have experienced.<br /><br />There is brotherhood, love, deceit, exploitation, guilt, deplorable morals and inspiring characters. And overall there is a story that I thankfully knew nothing about prior to turning the first page and will therefore reveal nada here. So this is probably more a celebration than a review and I hope others will forever equally enjoy it.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is purely for entertainment and I was entertained.  It was worth watching more than one time.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Very enjoyable with enough plot twists to satisfy even the pickiest critic. Highly recommended read. You will not regret it.
0316322407|5.0|Well written and makes a wonderful stand for young women's rights to education around the world. A must for ALL home libraries.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I worked in high tech for over 45 years, lived in Silicon Valley sadly only for two, but traveled there endlessly from the east coast and Texas. I watched Fairchild grow and die,Intel grow and nearly die, IBM nearly die, H-P mostly die, and Apple return from the dead.  After buying the first IBM PC in 1981, I finally converted to MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad after 30 years. Perfect? Not at all.  But fun.  Thanks, Steve.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|In great condition! I bought it as a gift for Christmas and is absolutely perfect for my aunt, considering it's new :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great story and a great message, well written and with compelling characters who it's easy to root for. Read it!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this gadget.  Compact high-quality and functional at an unbeatable price.  I highly recommend Chromecast And I love all things Google
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It has been a long time since I have read a Scarpetta novel and the first third of this book had me wondering why I was reading this one.  But then it started getting into the meat of the story and kept getting better.  By the end, I was glad I continued reading.  I had always enjoyed the early Scarpetta books and don't remember Ms. Cornwall being so negative.  Fortunately, the relationship narrations became less frequent as the book went on and the suspense took over.  I did think it odd that the book description hinges on the Alberta dinosaur dig when that was actually a minor portion of the plot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the best tame ever I have it on the ipad and I was just waiting for it to come on my kindle I checked every day intill I found it is so addicting
B00GH4R95C|3.0|I wasn't able to finish the movie, not because I didn't like it, but because Amazon deleted it from my video library before I was able to watch the whole movie.
0761172726|5.0|I purchase this for my daughter-in-law every year - she loves it, and the kids enjoy it, too! I was unable to find it one year and they were all very disappointed. I learned my lesson and now order it as soon as it comes out. A great gift, lots of room for all those family appointments, lovely illustrations and other great features!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'd like to start off first by saying that my expectations were SUPER low for this book due to reviews. It is kinda annoying and there are many flaws, but I just went along with them to get to the ending.  Go in expecting the worse and it won't be quite AS bad as it seems.  Yeah, I wish it ended better.  It had to end though, and this was a way to do it with no possibility of beating a dead horse by adding more.  (at least I hope).  Kinda sucked, but at the same time it ended kinda how I expected it to.  Not the ending I wanted, but suitableish for the plot of the book.
B00BAXFACO|2.0|When asked, I have always said without hesitation that Michael Connelly is my favorite author.  But sadly, in my view, his writing has been on a steady decline for several years.  &#34;The Gods of Guilt&#34; continues the downward trajectory.  I finished the book feeling that the Michael Connelly I've always revered for his compulsively readable fiction has, like Elvis Presley, &#34;left the building&#34;.  Perhaps success has made Michael too focused on the prize ( book sales ), maybe he's bored, but the finely tuned plots and sympathetic characters have become watered down and uninteresting.  In this book, our Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller, came across ( to me ) as a really self-centered jerk, self absorbed and whiny. I did enjoy the courtroom scenes, but the plot was rather convoluted and, honestly, at the end, it was all so neatly wrapped up that it seemed too easy.  Michael, I miss your real writing.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book is well worth the money and time (it's long) you will spend on it.  It's different and a little disturbing but I would totally recommend it.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|Not very sensitive sometimes you move the puck (or intend too) and nothing happens except the computer scores. It's OK
B000UVT3OI|5.0|What not to love about Garth Brooks down home singing.Give this one 10 stars.Will tell others about this one.ULTIMATE HITS IS YES!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun. I've been waiting so long for it to come out on Amazon. I always made fun of my mom for being addicted to it and now I'm just as hooked
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This story portrays Matt Damon as an unwilling Medium - who dislikes having this 'curse'. This movie starts in three separate directions about Matt's character, a woman reporter in Paris and twin boys in England. They keep calling him a 'Psychic' - but I say 'Medium'.<br />I love hearing this actress speak in her french accent - but got tired of reading the subtitles (that were Not through the whole movie).<br />I think this movie is too loose with piecing together these three stories - and waiting to the end to try to do so.<br />One thing I LOVE about this movie - No Nudity and No Swearing!!<br />And - I wish they went more into facets of the afterlife - more glazed over.<br />Still - all in all - pretty good! Scott. M.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Big thumbs up! Daughter and granddaughter captivated by Sully and Mike. If you loved Monsters Inc, you will surely want this movie.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is very enjoyable and exciting. I have a lot of fun with it and think it is a great buy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works very well. I just wish there was more support for standard movie playback.. Running videos through Chrome just to get them on to my Tv seems silly. But for all the stuff its built into Netflix, etc... it works very well.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Pretty good even though it did have a book to compare against. Still isn't as clear or in depth as the book, but most movies based on books are not.  As a movie by itself great!
B005OZE9SA|2.0|To give you a background of who I am. I went to school for audio engineering. I have been recording music for 10 years.<br /><br />PROS: Quality of recording is great. Easy install and setup. Powered by USB cable, so literally you can be in a park with your laptop and record stuff. Direct monitoring is latency free. Small, light weight.<br /><br />CONS: Latency without direct monitoring is bad. If you want to hear the effects on your voice while recording (Input monitoring), then there will be a bad latency (.30 or so).  It sucks. This is my only negative, but it's such a big deal to me, I'm debating on returning it. I have a brand new Samsung laptop with 4GB RAM, 500GB HD and nothing else running except my Sony recording software.<br /><br />I am very disappointed.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Six months ago I sold my house and got rid of 75% of my possessions. I moved into a small apartment. I did not know at the time that this book existed!  This book has inspired me to keep going. I am glad to know there's someone else out there who shares this annoyance with over abundance of well, overrated and excessive ownership of a bunch of crap. Even in this small apartment it still seems like I have too much. Thanks to the author I have decided to empty my small storage unit. Can't wait.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Why I love this product...powers through TV so no need to run another cord to the power strip, tiny in total, no need for another &#34;box&#34;', works so well with my Nexus 7 -- simple interface for CC and volume and thumbnails for dragging though streaming, costs so little, now I can view Netflix et al on my new TV. For folks without Bluray or Wii who have TVs new enough to have ports needed and tablet or pad to operate,this is the best thing ever.  Ordered through Amazon. Quick delivery, well packaged, easy to install and use.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love the Piano Guys!!  Very talented, awesome, amazing musicians!!  They are an inspiration!!  And their YouTube videos are so fun to watch too!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is a fun and educational app that my 2 and 4 year old LOVE. You do have to purchase the whole set or the kid gets bored, but the extra buck or two is worth it. After doing these my 2 year old got better at actual puzzles too!!
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|love it and enjoy watching alone and with my grandchildren they love it also thank you for the great price!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game!  I just got a kindle and this was the first thing we downloaded to it.  My 11 year old is a pro at it!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Outstanding game, this game has such an addictive premise and many many different ways to play.  I remember playing the first and second games in this series, it appears they keep getting much better!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works great but often loses connection with my network.  It never even realizes that it is not connected, which means I have to restart my router to force it to recognize that it has lost it...
1884883338|3.0|Pretty good... but odd hits and misses. For example... it has the j200 75th anniversary acoustic, but it doesnt have the same model in full size listed (the SJ200 75th anniversary). some info is just plain wrong... Jackson neck through RR Pro guitars... the info they have is just wrong, but the info in zach fjestads guide is correct.<br /><br />it is my normal go to, however because of the missing info, i would suggest ordering every other year and getting another priceguide in the alternate years to round things out. Good that it covers guitars, amps, basses, steels etc where others dont.
B000002GQJ|1.0|This was remastered, and didn't sound like the original, very disappointed. Not much more that I can say, but I have to add words.
B00FLML7HW|4.0|Update 12-24-2013:<br /><br />I just got the claw package for my younger brother's gift, so now I can review both the [[ASIN:B00E6D4HHO Adamantium Collection]] and the [[ASIN:B00FLML7HW X-Men and the Wolverine Collection]]. To be honest, I had every intention to keep the claw for myself, but I guess I am getting too old, and it didn't help that the claw is not as extra ordinary as I would like it to be. I think this package is not worth the list price. It would be a nice product if the list price was around $80, because the quality of the claw and the stand is too cheap for the hefty list price. If you forget about the price, it will be a nice package, and the new printed labels for all the discs are nicer than previous releases. The claw is a little smaller than what I thought it would be; precisely, it is 15\\" tall and 6.5\\" wide. The discs contents are the same as the [[ASIN:B00FLML7HW X-Men and the Wolverine Collection]] that I previously got, but there is one extra disc called Legacy X. Legacy X disc is about one hour, and it has 6 short clips that are exclusive to the Adamantium package: X-Men, X2, X-Men Last Stand, Wolverine, X-Men First class, and \\"What's Next.\\" These clips go through the history of casting and making of the X-Men universe.<br /><br />Update 12-11-2013:<br /><br />My review was for the [[ASIN:B00FLML7HW X-Men and the Wolverine Collection]]. You know, the normal one with 6 bare discs and no bells and whistles. Amazon has merged my review and many others' into other products like the claw package and Adamantium collection, and theirs into the Wolverine collection!! It is a mess I know, and I think is misleading. If you are reading any review on any of these items, you probably need to track which product the review is written for.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I got this the other day. First impression, it doesn't look anything like other box sets like TDK Trilogy; precisely, the box is too narrow/thin. The picture here has an impression that the box is at least one inches in depth, but the whole box is almost as thick as a normal BD case. You can see the pictures I've uploaded for more details.<br /><br />The cover artwork of this box set looks the same as the normal [[ASIN:B00FOJ0ROQ Adamantium Collection ]] (not the [[ASIN:B00E6D4HHO limited claw package]]); however unlike Adamantium, there is nothing special about this set. You only get 6 bare/plain discs. They have the same artwork as the individual discs previously found in earlier X-Men releases, so nothing special here either. There is only one disc for each movie, so don't expect special features and extras from this set. The Wolverine is only in 2D version, and it is not the uncut/unleashed version.<br /><br />There is one strange issue with this box set. When I first got home, I noticed 4 spots an inch from each corner in the back of the box set cover. The two top-left and top-right ones are more pronounced, and they look like water/oil leakages half an inch in diameter. I didn't open the first box, and went to another BB store to exchange it. They had 9 available, but to my surprise, they all had this leakage problem. They were almost in the same spot, but different patterns. Upon close inspection, I noticed that there is something inside the cardboard that has a bumpy feeling to the touch. My guess is, underneath the cardboard there are security devices or glue or something that have exploded or over leaked. Since all the 10 boxes that I examined had this problem, if you are too picky about your box sets, make sure you can return the item if needed. You can also go to a store and check this out yourself.<br /><br />Overall, even with the leakage spots, I kept the box set. I didn't own any of these movies in Blu-ray format, and buying them separately would've cost a little more. Of course, if you buy them separately, you will end up with two discs or three discs sets which will contain extras and bonuses. My first idea was to get the [[ASIN:B001PPGAKS X-Men Trilogy box set]], and then get the First Class, Origins, and The Wolverine separately. It would end up being a little more than this box set, but I would have had all the bonus features. I changed my mind at the end, because having all these movies in a one small package is more convenient, and the next X-Men movie is due for next year, so there will be more appealing box sets soon.<br /><br />List of Special Features:<br /><br />X-Men: Audio Commentary by Bryan Singer<br />X2: Audio Commentary Bryan Singer + Marvel Universe Trailers<br />X-Men Last Stand: Audio Commentary + Marvel Universe Trailers + Deleted Scenes[ASIN:B001PPGAKS X-Men Trilogy box set]], and then get the First Class, Origins, and The Wolverine separately.

1451613520|5.0|Misters Kusnick and Stone have given forth what should be required reading for each classroom in high school history.  Many may see this work as subversive, however that is not the truth.  We need in America to know the truth of how government works, how the individuals in government portray of their dichotomous personality.  Capable of making statements to influence the humanistic side of their constituents, and adversely act in barbaric manner.  We need to understand this book's thesis to force a real accountability from our leaders.  Before we elect them forcing the truth to the surface and making it illegal to portray lies in advertisement  for candidates or products.

6305428387|5.0|I have loved this moving since renting it years ago.  I have it on VHS and wanted it on DVD.  It is a warm and touching film about finding out what is most important to you in your life and becoming the person you are meant to be.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The story and the action are hard to follow-the actors did a good job-rather violent . Not really worth the time to watch.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Please do not let children read these books.  These are fantastic stories that deal with real issues about the worst sociopaths imaginable.  The central character is a strong, brilliant, and determined heroine who fearlessly finds and dispatches the monsters of the society, including her own father.  All three books are exciting and full of action and intrigue, but also numerous disturbing images.
B008602KQI|5.0|Better than even the hype -- worth owning! Went to see the new movie Catching Fire right away at the theatre.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Sci Fi at its best.  Compelling story of a future Dystopia and the citizens who survive, love, compete, conquer, flourish, and rebel.
B00AEBB8YW|2.0|I always loved this movie and looked forward to watching it with my granddaughter. Well as we were a third of the movie in  it began to skip. Very disappointing.
B00FHEP9XM|5.0|This Swype keyboard is so smooth, I'm writing this review using it on my phone.<br /><br />I've been using Swype on my Android phones for 2+ years. It's gotten quite polished in that time, but has always been super-fast and functional versus tap to type keyboards.<br /><br />I've hooked a few co-workers with its fluidity. It seems those who don't take to it struggle with touch typing on a full-sized keyboard, and I guess it makes sense that you have to know your qwerty layout well, to make this app actually work as intended: \\"hunting and pecking\\" with Swype is difficult with a finger blocking the screen!<br /><br />The custom dictionary is quite handy in learning odd street names, places and people. It's not as contextually aware as Google's version, but that doesn't make it bad -- corrections are very easy. And stock \\"nuisance\\" words can be deleted: 's'likes to pop up place of 'a', but long-pressing 's' on the word selection bar provides the option to delete it from the dictionary.<br /><br />The predictive text is ok. But where it comes in handy is its contextual awareness, when I'm going back to edit a line, it realized the word it thought I wanted is probably no longer correct, and highlights the word it thinks matches the sentence. (For example, word= weird and it= out in the previous sentence.) As I mentioned, Google does this better a higher percentage of the time, but Swype is close behind.<br /><br />Numbers are a key press away, or I can long press an alpha character if I just want a single digit or two, or long press the number key to get a handy number keypad. Symbols are similarly accessible, but many common symbols are buried two keypresses deep, and some aren't accessible from the number keyboard (-dash- - hello?). Much better implementation than Google, which requires entering the sub-keyboards for all but numerals.<br /><br />Capitalizing or apostrophizing an already-typed word is done with a single swipe. These types of after the fact edits aren't possible on Google's keyboard without repositioning the cursor and making the correction manually.<br /><br />It also features single-keypress speech recognition using Nuance/Dragon Naturally Speaking, which seems every bit as accurate as using Google Now's voice recognition.<br /><br />Get this keyboard, try it out, learn the shortcuts for apostrophes and capitalization, and I'm pretty sure you'll love it.possible on Google's keyboard without repositioning the cursor and making the correction manually.<br /><br />It also features single-keypress speech recognition using Nuance/Dragon Naturally Speaking, which seems every bit as accurate as using Google Now's voice recognition.<br /><br />Get this keyboard, try it out, learn the shortcuts for apostrophes and capitalization, and I'm pretty sure you'll love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|this  compelling fast paced story, with its colorful and well drawn characters, is one of the few books I have read in the past years that made me look forward to making time to see 'what comes next' (often that time was at 4:00 in the morning). The story is set in late 20th century rural Mississippi and the author beautifully portrays the changes that  have occurred in average folks ( the jurors) over the past 50 years.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Addictive.  Glad I limit my time to the game other wise I would not get anything done.  Good luck to anyone playing it.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|The raunchiness of this movie brought the starts down. The plot I enjoyed as I couldn't tell where it would go next.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This was a great book to read.  If you like Michael Connelly books you will like this one.  The ending has an unexpected twist.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This opera was made for Anna and Rolando.  It is funny, upbeat and exceptionally sung. Rolando even gets called to do an encore during the libretto.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is cute and is a good game for kids and adults. My three heart old grandchild loves this game.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I bought this as a present for my girlfriend because it is her favorite movie. I received the movie when they said I would.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad kindle finally got it...it's the greatest!!!!<br />Hopefully we will get more of the apps other devices have.
0446343129|4.0|A little rambling sometimes but nonetheless very interesting. I have given up refined/processed sugar forever. Considering our national obsession with this white poison, it is not hard to understand why diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and a host of other illnesses are at epidemic proportions.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Awesome - like everthing else you do!!  Thank you for sharing your collective gift of music!  Best wishes to each of you....
B0039208JE|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater in the summer of 1989 after managing to survive the tidal wave of hype that preceded it. The movie of course does not live up to the hype but is a visually dynamic and enjoyable spin on the Batman mythology. My biggest gripes are the way the Joker is handled and the idiotic and jarring inclusion of several lame Prince songs in the soundtrack. Great idea to mix Batman and Prince...they go together as well as a paper cut and lemon juice.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is very well done and features a beautiful transfer that highlights the dark and moody atmosphere and the wonderful creations of the real star of this movie production designer Anton Furst. I must also give praise to the wonderful music score by Danny Elfman that sounds terrific on the Blu-ray. I would recommend picking this up if you're a Batman fan or just a fan of big over the top extravagant films productions.
0061122416|5.0|I love this book. As many have said, it's a beautiful story that will almost certainly become a classic. It is, at its core a simple fable, but so elegant, beautiful, and full of wisdom that, as you read, the simplicity becomes endearing rather than tedious. I don't think I will ever tire of this book.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Great app for tasks! Especially like that you can enter a quick to-do or a lot of detail if needed.
0062513346|3.0|I'm a big fan of Paulo Coelho and I really love the majority of his books. This one didn't resonate with me as much as some of his others. This may be because it is largely autobiographical or perhaps because it has a significant Christian slant as oppose to his other books which are simply spiritual/mystical or fascinatingly pagan/wiccan. In it, Coehlo recounts time he spent traveling the Mojave Desert with his wife and &#34;the Valkyries&#34;. The Valkyries are a band of women who travel the desert on motorcycles and spread their teachings to those who will listen. All in all it was a good and interesting read but once I was halfway through, it became more of a chore to finish rather than a pleasure. Considering the length of Coelho's books this didn't take long, but I wasn't nearly as invested in the journey or outcome as I was with say, &#34;Brida&#34; or &#34;The Witch of Portobello&#34;. And, ironically (considering these characters were real people), I didn't much care what happened to them. It feels a little unfair to give this book a numerical rating because what a reader takes from the book can be largely subjective, but this piece of writing failed to move me in ways that other books of his have.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Game is okay. Cute graphics. Just like most app games they make it difficult to level and afford goals so you will spend money at app store.
1593078684|3.0|Beautiful artwork from the early Final Fantasies, but overall the collection feels a little sparse for the price. Maybe worth it for purists and dedicated fans (which I am) but those who aren't should probably pass.
1619695006|4.0|This was a lot better than Cuckoos calling.  It was very interesting and we got to see another side of this great author
1595825045|5.0|This art-book is truly one of the best I've ever seen and I love how Konietzko and Dimartino walk you through their stories of creating the wonderful cartoon. Any fan would love this collection.
0553801473|4.0|I've read the 5 books of A Song of Ice and Fire series in a row.  George R.R. Martin is brilliant in this convoluted story line.  I found A Dance with Dragons to have the biggest cliffhanger of an ending.<br /><br />Okay - now the advice section!<br /><br />- Do you become emotionally invested in the novels you are reading?  Yes? DON'T READ THIS SERIES<br />- Do you need a straight, easy to follow story timeline? Yes? For the love of all things holy PUT DOWN THE BOOK!<br />- Do you tend to root for one character throughout a series?  Yes?  Oh Honey.  STOP NOW!<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book (if you are set on it) with a buddy.  You need someone to commiserate with. If I didn't love books the way I do I think this sucker would have gone flying out the window/across the room a few times!<br /><br />**********Spoiler Alert = George R.R. Martin will kill your favorite character!!!*******************
B002SRQ214|5.0|I bought one in 2009 and another one in 2012 for a different build, it's a great processor and worked amazingly while I had it. I upgraded to a Haswell i5 4670k this year though, as this processor is starting to show its age.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I loved the Games of Thrones books and I like the Home BoxOffice series, but...  I wish they had left out the full nudity, sex acts and disgusting language. The series would have been just as good - perhaps better. Not sure if I will buy Season Three!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love games where you build and explore and the fact that your friends can also play is a plus.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Not as good as the Fever Dream, Cold Vengeance & Two Graves, but still an entertaining read. It was great to have a story about Corrie Swanson. I loved the setting - Roaring Fork - aka Aspen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the fact that it is age appropriate according to the birthday  insert,so the kids could play also! I hope this interview is helpful to you. From Jasmine and her kindle
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Way too long - I should have got the shorter version. The movies ae better - I like the 1939 black & white version.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Came very well packaged. It looked like nobody had even touched it. In better shape than most retail store items are on the shelves!!! I haven't given it as a gift or inspected it yet. That is why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. Looks great though!
0679805273|5.0|Very cute book I bought for my kids for their teachers to sign each year to someday give as a graduation present.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a wonderful story, my grandson just loves the movie. 'Wonderful graphics, too. Tom Hanks is great! We watched this movie already over and over again!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this was a fun and entertaining game.  made me think of what might really happen.  different levels provide different challenges.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's not just good it's like having state farm and Facebook together in one. So save up room to get this app
B001P3SA94|5.0|great movie not historically accurate but a great movie more than just a documentarey of course you can watch the commentaries to get the actual facts straight. very entertaining .
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|i hate it when games are awesome but they make it impossible to really progress without real monies. would adore this game uber much if it wasn't for the monies.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|It's a decent movie for those of you who have'nt seen it before. I do have to say it is fun to watch this just because of the 90's special effects
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book<br />Pretty accurate to the movie in my opinion<br />Its definitely a must read<br />I look forward to reading the others
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is the best fighting game I've ever played. You can create your own robot and everything. This game is awesome.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This games is awesome, the only problem I have had is progress not be save SOMETIMES, if they fix that it get a five star.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|A little slow to begin with but once it gets going it's hard to put down. This tale has a great twist to it.<br /><br />Reacher's investigative prowess is called upon to help a veteran mercenary but all is not as it seems. Reacher must call on all his powers of observation to realise the truth & bring the bad guys down.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is such a great show. When I first read about it, I thought it would be ridiculous, a modern-day Sherlock Holmes in New York with a female Watson. However, it WORKS, and I bought the first season, which I missed because of my preconceived notion, paying way more than I usually pay for a season. I enjoyed it completely. I especially like the psychological aspect of Holmes' and Watson's relationship in the modern context. It's fascinating to hear Jonny Lee Miller speaking in his normal accent after seeing him in Eli Stone for two wonderful seasons, as an American, not British. One minor complaint about the physical product: the 6th DVD does not stay in its place, which is annoying, but I can live with that for such a good program.
B0031RS44S|5.0|When Reacher gets a call for help from a former colleague, you just know that for someone it's bad luck & a whole lot of trouble is on its way. Imagine Jack Reacher with a bunch of similarly talented buddies... You don't want to be on the wrong side of that argument.
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|One of my favorite books.  I love Jane Austin.  The watercolor illustrations were a nice addition.  Interesting to see the styles of the period.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this game. I could play it for hours. It would be better if some things didn't take so much time to complete.
B0090SI56Y|5.0|Spoiler Alert!  I've revealed some plot points of the new Wolverine movie on DVD! So you have been told before you start this review. What I did see, before the movie put me to sleep, is revealed in the  review! I didn't reveal too much if you saw the trailer on line or TV.<br /><br />After watching most of the Wolverine movie on DVD, I have to admit, it put me to sleep! I'm  giving you my first impression of what this alleged action extravaganza  was while watching it! The resemblance to the Frank Miller  and Chris Claremont  comic novel was very thin indeed! Wolverine has to go up against larger than life characters to make a good film. He did in this one. However, it was at the very end, with a battle against  Silver Samurai.<br /><br />Like any a good actor or show biz personality, you can tolerate an actor in a bad film.  Usually the actor, if they are good, can transcend any of the bad material that passes for a script. This was the case in Wolverine.  I can forgive the first movie because they threw so many heroes and villains up on the screen.  The producers wanted to see what concepts would stick.<br /><br />This plot brings our favorite X Man to Japan where he finds an old friend he rescued from \\"the bomb\\" in World War II. His friend, who turns out not to be,  takes away his immortality along with his healing powers. After that it all goes downhill.  Sony, the company that owns the X-Men, doesn't have the slightest idea of what the character is about.  When you put the character up against ordinary villains, you get an ordinary movie!<br /><br />If the producers and writers of this film read the comics, it might have been a worthwhile endeavor.  Directors disassociate them from the source material, because they find it below their intellectual threshold.  While it was better than the first entry, this one is marginally better.  That isn't saying much because Wolverine is known world wide as the best character in the X-Men.  When will we see an actual movie that is worthy of character?  Perhaps in X-Men: Days of Future Past. That's the next entry in the Bryan Singer directed movie coming out next year.  If that one is anything like \\"The Wolverine\\"; I'll be waiting for that movie to hit the $5 Wal-Mart bin.<br /><br />When Wolverine made his debut in 1974 in The Incredible Hulk comic #181; he actually fought the Hulk!  Why couldn't one of the movies recreate that battle on screen? You'd have fans world wide waiting weeks to get tickets for that event!<br /><br />My final verdict on this movie is yes, it's worth watching again.  I expected a lot better on the part of the film makers and the studio that made the X-Men.  Where was their research and development department in this one?  Did anyone out there ask the fans what might make a good film they would want to  see?that is worthy of character?  Perhaps in X-Men: Days of Future Past.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game.  It's a little warped but exactly what I was looking for. Something to challenge me without getting boring. The graphics are good and the sound effects are better!
0812993845|2.0|Ugh. Mindless drivel written to fill pages. I didn't like a single character and couldn't care less how it ended. Really disappointing, even as far as mindless chick lit goes.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Love the dinosaurs. Very nice quality. I purchased three different dinosaurs but when I received the box from Amazon the three dinosaurs were in a plastic bag in the shipping box. I was giving them as a Christmas gift and was expecting them to each be in a individual box by the company. For the cost of the dinosaurs I thought they would be nicely packaged. Do they all come like this? No box or no package of any kind. I only care because they will be a Christmas gift. Not a deal breaker because they are cool and really realistic. Thanks for any feedback.
B00139XZF4|3.0|The movie was okay (and very pretty), but looses most of the things I liked about the book. This might be fun to rent, but since Amber Spyglass and Subtle Knife don't follow in movie form, the story here just feels incomplete. Read the books instead!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Pretty cool and crazy.  loved this.  Odd and fun.  A litle scary but more thoughtful and creative.  I did enjoy this and I would love to waatch more.  Did kinda scare me a bit, but I am a pretty sissy person.............LOL
0385537131|5.0|Excellent book by Grisham! Couldn't put it down, I wouldn't expect less from him. Enjoy all his books, waiting for the next one
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've had to use this app a lot lately.  I can't be more satisfied. Works great. I love the large buttons on the kindle fire. Easy to see and use.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|this is a book that I could not lay down. it tells a store of history in the South that we should not forget.
0992251656|4.0|This game deserved 5 stars but because if Amazon's poor customer service I had to subtract a star. The game is cool. Love all the little components it comes with. The rules are a bit lengthy and the first time you read then to a group you'll feel like you're reading a will. But once that is over and you dive in The Verse takes over and you are back in the black aim'n to miss behave!<br /><br />I received my NEW game with damage to the packaging. When I open the package I found my new still wrapper game smashed in one corner. This game was not packaged correctly being only protected on two of its sux sides and was smashed on one corner when I took the wrapping off I found that corner was actually split. Perfectly new game with an already ruined container. I wrote amazon immediately. Still have had no response. That was a month ago at least. Love firefly love the game. This is not the first purchase from amazon but definitely the worst ecoeriance so far.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I need to get this I love to watch youtubers play this. thanks giant oh ya on youtube search videogamscanada as spelled they are the best
B0081SRJSY|2.0|True to the board game, but crashed five times during my first play.  Also the board starts each turn zoomed out, and it's kind of annoying to have to zoom back in each turn.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|so nice a lot more stuff. now they need mods and maybe more trucks. ok giants did way better on this one
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I am terrible at rating books seeing as the only ones I read through (which are a lot) are the ones I really like (all  Brandon sanderson's books). Therefore I tend to give a lot of 6 star ratings, but this book really REALLY deserves it... in my honest opinion.<br />the way the world is explained to you throughout the story gradually pulls you deeper and deeper into it, and you can easily loose yourself in the book for hours, which is a good thing!<br />all the characters are awesome and feel real, and you get very interested in their backstroke.<br />this is a great book and I had a blast as I blasted through it... can't wait for the next one!
B00GLRLZ0K|5.0|I cant believe it hes back he was fun before but even better naught is back Yahoo yay yay. I love naught
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is a new and improved version of its Facebook self. It fixes most of my complaints: this game loads fast, you can play the game without friends' help, the crops don't wither! You can play once a day or multiple times without hurting your quests. The game allows you to set your own pace, while bringing characters you liked back, such as Yvette and Rafael. It also allows for a continuous storyline: you created the kingdom, but left, so the gloom ate it. The only negative is the game lacks sufficient tutorials.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|great gamplay really spooky looking I kinda  think it looks weird hey but its a great day anything can happen

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great sound from an up-and-coming band.  The language isn't dirty or suggestive--it is well-written music with great beats.  You should enjoy it.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I'll be honest - I loves the movie and I like continuous running games of this style.  I have been playing this game off and on for about 9 months.<br /><br />Unlike some people, I don't totally hate the Jelly Lab update.  I think the different challenges add some interest to the game.  However, I think the difficultly level ramps up way too quickly.  This is probably especially true for newer players who don't get to start with all the banana-purchasable characters purchased and the puzzle-piece characters unlocked.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the game (and judging by the numerous comments on the developer forum I am not alone) is that the game only sporadically decides to connect with the game's servers.  You can play offline, but you need to connect at least daily to be able to access contest leaderboard, get your progressively-better login prize-of-the-day, and claim any prizes you won in the contests (there are 3-4 a week, one weekly, one Monday, Wednesday, and one on the weekend).<br /><br />Before the Jelly Lab, there were four stages of daily prizes for collecting apples at three locations, and you got a gold pod every fifth day. However, if the game didn't let me connect, no big deal, I could start the five days over. After the Jelly Lab upgrade, the prizes seem to increment up forever (with no gold pods in sight).  I managed to somehow register daily logins (even though sometimes this did not occur until late evening) long enough to see the better coin rewards and pod rewards were there.  But, then, the game's fickleness kicked in, it refused to see me, and I got booted back to Day One.  (Turning my device on and off, turning the wireless router on and off, rebooted the modem, nothing helped).<br /><br />Even more annoying (at least if you are trying to accumulate coins), even though I was shown and could participate in the contests, I stopped being able to connect to the leaderboard on a consistent basis.  So my progress never registered and I never got a chance at prizes.<br /><br />From what I can glean, this problem exists across numerous platforms, has existed for quite a while (months), and for this reason I am downgrading my review to 3 stars.  I like the game, I love the graphics and the minions, and I will probably still play it, but I don't feel that in its current incarnation and with all its issues that is is worthy of more stars.m what I can glean, this problem exists across numerous platforms, has existed for quite a while (months), and for this reason I am downgrading my review to 3 stars.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|A lot of reviewers seem to be upset because the ending was not the way that they wanted. I am not one to give spoilers but I will say that the ending was needed for Roth to fully give her point. This series was not intended for happy ever afters but it was made to display the point of government control and the revolutions. People have to make sacrifices and just like in real life not everyone is going to get happily ever after because they must do what is right for their people. Roth created a beautiful story that had a much deeper meaning than many YA books today as she portrayed true sacrifice. Her writing hooked me from divergent and held me all the way through Allegiant. This series is essential for anyone living in todays world as she is educating the youth to question the government and ultimately to do what is right.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves this movie. It's super cute, and it's some thing we enjoy watching with her.

This book provided insight as to why they were not as successful as I had expected. I highly recommended that anyone considering starting a business read this book first.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This kept getting recommended and as I refuse to join the borg on facebook I seemed a natural candidate to enjoy it. Eggers creates a truly scary but utterly plausible world of ubiquitous social media and surveillance. Most of the technology he mentions is feasible now. Just hope that governments see sense and stop before you too have  to succumb to zing envy. You could look at this as a dark social satire (and you'd be right) or as a comedy of manners (also true) but mostly take it as an entertaining warning. Remember Zuckerberg might just get his way and then we're all doomed.

B00BEXB18M|2.0|I noticed three things immediately upon listening to Super Collider. First, it is so similar to [[ASIN:B005LRWRZ8 TH1RT3EN]] the band could have released the two records as a double album and it would have worked. Whatever you thought of Th1rt3en you will likely also think of Super Collider (case in point: I rated both albums two stars). Second, this is not a metal record, nor does it try to be. Third, the lyrics are incredibly bad.<br /><br />Th1rt3en sounded very rushed, and I have heard rumors that Dave spit it out quickly to fulfill his contractual obligation with Roadrunner. Super Collider is different in that the songs feel more complete and flow better, at least musically speaking. There are numerous riffs and solos to be appreciated on this record. \\"Kingmaker\\" and \\"Dance in the Rain\\" are the heaviest songs on the album, so if those don't do it for you then don't bother with the rest of Super Collider. The remainder of the album has a very [[ASIN:B0002EXH4U Cryptic Writings]] feel to it with elements from other Megadeth albums mixed in. For example, the subpar title track would not be out of place on [[ASIN:B0002EXH5E Risk]], and \\"Burn!\\" would fit in fine on [[ASIN:B00005EBQE World Needs a Hero]]. In fact, the verse riff on \\"Burn!\\" is almost a direct lift of Dave's own \\"Burning Bridges\\" from that album.<br /><br />Regrettably, the lyrics on Super Collider leave a lot to be desired. Half the songs contain politically driven lyrics; if you're a Megadeth fan, you know that this has been a recipe for disaster in recent years with turkeys like \\"Bite the Hand,\\" \\"We the People,\\" and \\"Amerikhistan.\\" I'm all for intelligent political commentary in music, especially in metal, but Dave doesn't offer any here. \\"Beginning of Sorrow\\" in particular is ruined by Dave's pitiful attempt at social commentary on orphans. Yes... orphans. Which is a shame considering that, strictly musically speaking, \\"Beginning of Sorrow\\" is one of the few formidable tracks on the album.<br /><br />Some of the lyrical gems we're subjected to on Super Collider:<br /><br />\\"Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good / Burn, baby burn... like I knew it would\\"<br /><br />\\"Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!\\"<br /><br />\\"Three letter groups listening in on you / Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car\\"<br /><br />\\"Delinquent in a foster home / His heart is so full of rage / His first name's 'Ward' / His last name is 'Of the State' \\"<br /><br />...and plenty of other treasures just like these. Gag me.<br /><br />In the end, the poor lyrics completely undermine the better aspects of Super Collider. Even so, there is not a lot here to love from a musical standpoint. Broderick still shreds, but it has become a habit of his to limit himself only to shredding; often his solos lack melody or do not fit the songs. His best stuff is on \\"Cold Sweat,\\" which isn't even his (I realized later it's a Thin Lizzy cover). Drover is predictably limited by the style of the music on Super Collider and is rarely able to show off his chops on the cans. Ellefeson is lost in the background again. Dave provides boring vocals to go with his lame lyrics. For what it's worth, the artwork is cool and the liner notes are entertaining, but that does nothing to improve the music.<br /><br />I thought [[ASIN:B002C6K7N0 Endgame]] was a big step in the right direction for Megadeth, but they have gone in the opposite direction since its release. Super Collider is a hard rock record, which would be great if Megadeth did hard rock well. But they don't. Cryptic Writings was a solid album for what it was; we don't need two more attempts (Th1rt3en and Super Collider) at the same thing fifteen years later. The bottom line is that Super Collider is the first Megadeth album I have owned that contains no obvious standouts. Dave has been running his mouth about the criticism Super Collider has received from critics, even going so far as to insult the fans that don't like it. He seems to think people are ragging on Super Collider because it's not [[ASIN:B0002EXH5O Rust In Peace]]. I'm ragging on it because it isn't a good album. Save your money and wait for the next one, folks.on't like it. He seems to think people are ragging on Super Collider because it's not [[ASIN:B0002EXH5O Rust In Peace]]. I'm ragging on it because it isn't a good album. Save your money and wait for the next one, folks.

B004Q7CIFI|4.0|This book is a compulsive, if rather slow-going, thriller with benefits.  The benefits are the rounded and (mostly) likable characters, and the time trip back to 1958-63. All in all, it's a very good read, which I will recommend to friends as such. But it's not a book I will reread, or one I would recommend in &#34;you must read&#34; terms. It's more an entertainment, as Graham Green was wont to say, than a major work.<br /><br />First, the novel qua thriller -- this is the first King I have ever read, so I don't know how much of what's going on here is characteristic. I was struck by the careful plotting, which held up for me with no incongruities, quite a feat given the switches in time and place. I was also struck by the propulsive quality of the book. I actually found the next to last section (no plot spoilers here) rather over-extended, but that didn't stop me from reading it (quickly). But despite that propulsive character the novel does drag. From a plot perspective, the hero's doings in New England past are awfully drawn out, and they do create almost two separate halves. Still, this really is a book I couldn't put down (even if I wished there were less of it) which is the main qualification for a thriller.<br /><br />Second, the novel qua novel -- the characters are notably well developed and sympathetic, for characters in a thriller. That applies to the two central characters, but also to several of the minor characters. Most of the people in this book stood out as individuals after I was done reading it, which is not the case in many thrillers.<br /><br />Third, the novel qua time travel -- this part is very well done and very engrossing. King was there to observe the late 50's/early 60's, and has clearly done lots of research to get the particulars right. As someone who was also there at the time, his recreation gave me lots of &#34;oh yeah&#34; moments. The only point here with which I might cavil is the sense he creates that the era was better than the present day, in most respects. There certainly was a lot right -- a sense of community that is sorely missing today, for example. Also, King explicitly acknowledges what was wrong -- the treatment of African-Americans, and the treatment of women. My different feeling about the era may simply reflect the fact that those matter more to me than to the author. For white maies, it probably was a better time.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a quick and compelling read that makes you think a bit, not a bad combination/present day, in most respects.

B00C7JGDBW|1.0|When you sit back and think about it, making ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ was not only a really risky move, but a rather stupid one.  First of all, ‘The Wizard of Oz’ is one of the most beloved films OF ALL TIME.  It is probably the most famous, popular and well known film ever made and has legions of fans of all ages.  It is reference possibly more than any other film, quoted more than any other film and immortalized throughout the years in the hearts and in the mind’s eye of many, many, many people.  Latching yourself to any resemblance of the film is cause for instant and unavoidable scrutiny.  But then you have another factor, the ‘Wicked’ factor.  While ‘The Wizard of Oz’ is beloved by film buffs, ‘Wicked’ is beloved by the theater crowd, and the film buffs have been salivating at the mouth for YEARS waiting for ‘Wicked’ to come to the big screen.  Cinephiles have pondered who would star in the film, how they could film it, who would get the big musical numbers, and quite frankly we can all agree that the story development in ‘Wicked’ trumps ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and so taking it on could result in something unforgettable.<br /><br />Why on earth would you decide to make an ‘Oz’ movie and NOT make that movie ‘Wicked’?<br /><br />I was skeptical from the moment I saw James Franco was cast in this, since he’s become one of those actors I have no time for anymore.  I love how he started his career as this degrading presence most film lovers tried to avoid only to have his status shift during the 2008-2010 years when he latched onto better directors and for a brief moment we thought we had a real talent on our hands, and now he’s turned into this pretentious slab of annoying that we all wish would just go away.<br /><br />And yes, I thought he was brilliant in ‘Spring Breakers’.<br /><br />With ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’, I was ready for a disaster.  I think what makes this particular disaster so upsetting though is that the opening sequence is so magically perfect that I started to get my hopes up.  Sadly, the minute that the film gains color and thrusts us into Oz the film falls apart faster than the tickets sold to Justin Timberlake’s last tour.  You could liken this to Burton’s disastrous ‘Alice in Wonderland’, and the comparison would be obvious and understandable, but I’m almost tempted to say that ‘Alice’ was a better film.  I mean, ‘Alice in Wonderland’ is already kind of a camp classic and one that lends itself to interpretation.  What Raimi and company do here though is completely desecrate a classic that shouldn’t have been so poorly deconstructed.  It’s almost offensive how much they’ve twisted the original story and stomped all over what could have been perfect.<br /><br />THIS STORY HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!  WHY REWRITE IT?!?!<br /><br />While I can fault it forever for NOT being ‘Wicked’, I should try and look at it for what it is, which is the story of the wizard himself.  But really, is it?  I mean, the film seems very uninterested with that particular character, making him nothing more than a self-centered and arrogant idiot who has a strange tinge of redemption in the finale (which felt ripped from ‘Inglourious Basterds’) and was made completely forgettable (and nearly loathsome) thanks to Franco’s ridiculous performance (which was all sorts of perfect theatrics in the opening sequence but lost all manipulative charm once the film actually started).  No, this is really the story of the witches, which is why I fault it for NOT being ‘Wicked’.  The main focus here is on a hammy Rachel Weisz, and out of her depth Mila Kunis and a ‘dead behind the eyes’ Michelle Williams (I love Williams as an actress, but this was Razzy worthy).<br /><br />This retelling of the story we already know has become a joke, and one that isn’t fun to laugh at.<br /><br />Like ‘Alice in Wonderland’ before it, this is technically unevenas well.  Many of the special effects and production design elements are admirable and even really, really good and yet so many of them are also so overproduced that they appear inauthentic and ugly.  Emerald City is a dazzling delight, until you walk inside a building and that fake green color coats the walls and looks trashy.  That fog created by Glinda looks like clouds of milk and lets not even get started on the effects used on the Wicked Witch herself.  That transformation was such a mess.<br /><br />And that brings me to the fact that this film is such a tacky and campy retelling of a story that doesn’t need to, nor deserve to be, told in such a manner.<br /><br />If you want to experience ‘Wicked’ this year, go see ‘Frozen’.as well.

0545586178|5.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins is the predecessor of her first book called The Hunger Games. It is based in post-apocalyptic America where there are only 12 districts in the country and they are controlled by what is called the Capitol. In the past the Capitol had some problems maintaining leadership over the districts and so each year a male and female tribute are chosen to fight against each other to the death until there is only one victor. In Catching Fire, this year’s game is called the quarter quell and it is every 25 years. The previous games had caused some uprisings in the districts so the ones that were chosen to fight had come from the pool of existing victors who had won before, and they would all have to fight each other to the death once again. But throughout the fighting and blood shed there were those who joined together in a secret plan to try and defeat the capital in a secret uprising but that will all be in the third book. This book is overall a very good read, and it is very enjoyable. You get hooked on to it wanting to know what happens next that it is nearly impossible to put it down. Some strengths would be how elaborate it goes into detail, for example: describing the scenery of the arena, the outfits the tributes where, features and characteristics, and you can even know their personal thoughts. A weakness would be that at times it kind of gives you too much of the plot, so it really doesn’t let you think much and guess what will happen before the author tells you. But overall I really enjoyed reading this book, you will absolutely fall in love with the characters and you feel like you really get to know them while reading it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves action, romance, and a bit of a twist and hidden agenda.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|This was one of the cutest books I've ever read. The star of the show, Pusheen, started out as an internet meme and worked her way into her own graphic novel. I read the kind of graphic novels that have superheroes, violence and capes. This book was the opposite of that (though Pusheen did model the \\"Superhero\\" sleeping position). It was cutesy and full of fat and fluffy cats. The graphic novel is organized by into five parts, each shows the reader different parts of Pusheen's life on--and off--the computer screen. Unlike the other fat cat (you know who you are), Pusheen is likable and downright adorable. You know the books of funny photos of animals that are supposed to brighten your day? This is one of them.<br />More reviews at [...]

This is a fantastic album and the band is great too. It walks the line between rock and roll, metal, and outlaw western music. I guarantee it's unlike anything you've ever heard before. Some of my favorite tracks are &#34;the Nameless One,&#34; &#34;Dead But Rising,&#34; &#34;Lola Montez,&#34; and &#34;Doc Holliday,&#34; and the rest are great as well. Would definitely recommend.

After reading the book, I can say without blushing, gasping, or raising my eyebrow, that I watched once a documentary about dung beetles copulating and only this book has finally raised my level of awareness about  mental flagellation.  I am sure there must be an intelligent explanation for the success of this bestseller. I am open to any conspiracy theory. Anything that reassures me that one day I will not be dumped for a sex toy with a dominant male voice.

B002RI9PS6|5.0|This quite extraordinary book with an even more extraordinary title was recommended to me by a good friend who neither revealed anything about the contents nor genre – she simply said, “read it, I think you’ll enjoy it.”<br />She was right.<br />A strange book in that it’s at once both incredibly comical and tragic, A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian basically tells the story of two estranged sisters, Vera and Nadezhda (Nadia), who are appalled to discover that their widowed and elderly father is about to remarry a luscious Ukrainian woman, Valentina, many decades his junior. Valentina also has a teenage son whom she believes is a “genius”. And so a tale of reckless marriage, love thwarted, dishonour, honour, the past, memory, family and the human capacity to survive unfolds.<br />The opening of the book is quite stunning and sets a deceptive tone:<br />“Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blonde Ukrainian divorcee. He was eight-four and she was thirty-six. She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade, churning up the murky waters, bringing to the surface a sludge of sloughed-off memories, giving the family ghosts a kick up the backside.”<br />Enter Valentina: stage right, a ruthless, cunning and beautiful woman who seduces the old man into marriage believing that, as someone who has forged a life in a Western country, he must have money, and who intends, through wedlock to make a better life for herself and her gifted son.<br />Forcing the two angry sisters to co-operate in order to first prevent their father’s marriage and later, instigate his divorce, the book is told mainly from Nadia’s point of view. Filled with eccentric characters (none more so than the elderly father and Valentina), passion, purpose, and desperation, it is at once very funny and moving.<br />Like Nadia, we’re drawn into her father’s alternating states of misery and jubilation as his young, mercenary wife, both abuses and thrills him with her flirtatious and calculating ways. Just when you think she’s the “slut” and “gold-digger” the eldest sister, Vera, is persuaded she is, the book also exposes the pathos and hardship that faces those who are displaced – through war, politics and Otherness. Moving back in time to war-time Europe, we’re given insights into what faced inhabitants of occupied countries; the horror of camps, of having loved ones torn from your side and the constant fear that becomes a part of life – fear of loss, of dreams unfulfilled and so much more.<br />Having experienced this herself (indirectly – Nadia was a peace-time baby who nonetheless witnessed what the war did to her family and became an immigrant too) and through her family who suffered greatly and quietly during the war, Nadia is able to view Valentina and her actions differently to most. Seguing from anger to empathy, the sociologist in her struggles to understand, not only Valentina, but her father and sister and later, the other besotted and desperate characters who Valentina, as her marriage deteriorates, drags into their lives.<br />Running parallel to all the emotional and psychological chaos of the present is not only the upheavals and horror of the past, but the ordered and academic work that the father works on – the history of tractors. Functioning as analogous to the main narrative, it takes the reader through the glory of agriculture, the boons that technology offered, the abilities of humans to create and harness the power such technology and the ability to control nature offered, but also the huge dangers that lie in succumbing to progress without balance. It also offers a cautionary tale about the seductions of the West – something the Ukrainian refugees know all too well.<br />The book is also about families, old age, tenderness, love, the ties that bind even when we don’t want them too. It’s about loss, forgiveness and the capacity to both remember and forget. It’s about passion, compassion and human’s dreadful facility for cruelty – even the unintended kind.<br />Delightful, moving, funny and utterly unforgettable, A Short History is a book that will resonate with me for a long time to come.get.

I was just so disappointed in this movie. The only small saving point is the HOT actor who portrayed Bruce's grown son. WOOF!!! The plot is very predictable and so you get bored after just 10 mins into the film. Yawn!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish I could rate &#34;I love it&#34; AND &#34;I hate it&#34;. It's addicting. . . so addicting trying to get to the next level. I hate when I get stuck on a level for a week or two and break down and buy a power up just to beat the level. WARNING: You WILL get addicted. . . but you will have fun ;)

B00G32TD98|5.0|Easy buy. I accidentally ordeded the standard viewing addition, contacted Amazon, and they swapped them out at no extra cost. I don't quite know if I liked the movie or not but I do know that it was much better than some of the ones out there.
B000TDDHQ2|3.0|Not as good as Ambient 1:Music for Airports, but still an enjoyable listen.<br /><br />Not much else to say, it's Brian Eno so it isn't mindless ambient, it'll tickle a  brain cell or two in background while it plays.That's what I want/expect when I get ambient.<br /><br />I guess by that criteria, Music For Airports isn't good ambient because it commands my attention at times... but *man* is that good album!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|A tale of poverty vs. wealth and heartbreak no matter how much money one has.  The storyline is different though in a different culture and follows a little girl who was sold by her father to a wealthy family, and what happens to her as she becomes an indulged adult.  But war comes to Afghanistan and things change.
076790592X|5.0|A very heartfelt story from beginning to end. The emotions felt were as if I was there often and found myself speaking to them mentally throughout the book. The images in my mind as I read were so vivid and emotion filled. Loved the book and read it with my Shades Book Club. I also sent this book as a gift to a son who loved it as well!!!
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Just an absolutely great  cd. Can't say enough about Phil Collins and Genesis. I love the 80's and 90's. Must have cd.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|If you have a NFC capable device, these are a must have. If you don't know what these does, you owe yourself to do some research. These comes very handy. WhizTags makes the best high quality tags. The customer service is exceptional. I bought these and some of them were not working properly (I think it was because of my older phone), but they gave me many suggestions and most of them worked. They even gave me a whole new set for free just because some was not working. Good product and good seller.

B005NKGEP2|1.0|One of the worst books I've read in years.  Disorienting, poorly constructed, and with weak character construction.  The fact that &#34;professional&#34; reviewers suggested the author, Chris Pavone, compared to a young John Grisham or early Ken Follet is bizarre at best and insulting at worst.  These reviewers need to self-enroll in remedial American Literature.
B0058VW36U|5.0|fun and challenging. I have to admit that I had to go online to the cheats because a few of the levels I just could not get three stars on!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was such a lovely film about finding a new life even when one is not so young anymore.  One is never too old to find joy in being alive; one just has to rediscover it occasionally.  The film has an excellent cast, who seem to enjoy their roles, and it's very much an ensemble of amazing actors working together.  I especially loved how the color and vibrancy of India as a culture and a county is clearly showcased without it being done in a patronizing way.  In summary:  seven seniors from England journey to India for various reasons, and all of them come away with something beautiful and life-affirming.  As someone on the wrong side of 40 myself, I think that's a good enough reason by itself to watch the film.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really fun. The only thing I do not like is how I run out of lives and have to wait up to 20 minutes to play again. On the other hand, this is good because it makes me go do something else. Otherwise, I may have just played and played and played.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|This is not a standalone app.  There seems to be no way to enter data without going to an office productivity suite.<br /><br />By way of follow-up to this original review:  I have uninstalled this program which immediately asked for $4.99 for fonts and installation of an office suite.  One star is too generous a rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this is now available for my Kindle Fire.  WARNING--THIS GAME IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!  You can play most of the time without having to purchase a booster,  but it is nice to have the option of getting 3 for 99 cents if you get stuck on a level repeatedly.  Also lets you see the highest scores of your Facebook friends if you connect it with fb.  Love playing it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Wow! This is terrific, fractions made incredibly simple. This app renders errors a moot point. Never need to struggle over equations, again.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|*SPOILER : This review is subjective, obviously.<br /><br />I think this is a great album and the previews don't seem to do it justice. I previewed the album on iTunes when it first came out and thought, &#34;bleh,&#34; but I found the whole album available for listening on youtube and I listened to the whole thing at least 3-4 times and each time the album got better and better. I'd have to say that I basically went through the same process before I purchased BTW, sans the listening to the album in full, I listened to the previews over and over and decided to buy it because the clips grew on me. I feel like Gaga's music always grows on me and then i'm addicted and this still holds true with ARTPOP. I wouldn't make my decision on buying the album just by the preview clips because they don't do the songs justice. Youtube is great as you can find a majority of the songs performed live and you can make your decision from there.<br /><br />There are about 2 songs that I'm not really a fan of - Jewels N' Drugs and Swine - however, they're not something that I can't stand listening to, i'm just not crazy about them. This album is definitely different from the others and I love seeing the progression of Gaga's work. There is a track-by-track explanation of the album from Gaga herself available on youtube that I found. I'd highly recommend listening to that to get an idea of what she was thinking and going through while creating the songs and the messages behind them.<br /><br />Now they just need to release the collaborations Gaga did in her Holiday special (watched those on youtube too) with Elton John for ARTPOP and RuPaul for Fashion!<br /><br />Happy listening everyone! :D
B003VANOFY|5.0|Why this headset is great:<br /><br />-Wireless! It's pretty freaky good to have the thing disconnected from your computer while you're listening to music on it. I've even done it across multiple rooms in my home.<br /><br />-Mike mutes when folded a up. No more fiddling for that mute button in Skype! (There's also a mute button on the headset as well, if you prefer buttons)<br /><br />-Sweet jog wheel for volume control. Because hey, jog wheels!<br /><br />There isn't full Mac support (boo!) but the G buttons act as Fast-forward/Skip-forward, Pause/Play, Rewind/Skip-Back (respectively) which is pretty nice.

B000063UR2|4.0|I just have to write this review. Make sure when you purchase legend you purchase the ultimate addition. So you get both<br />disc. The director's cut (terrible!) and the original. Or just buy the original. The director's cut is just horrible horrible horrible!!!<br />I watched that one this pass weekend. I think it's actually longer than the original. The music is most annoying. It's not quiet like the old. Tom Cruise talks to much and Mia sings YUK!!! Although the directors cut is visually prettier because they digitally enhance it. But totally not worth it. The dance part, they ruined it by changing the music to this disney version. It's horrible and less creepy.<br />So get the original if your looking for the film from when you were a kid. I gave this 4 stars for the old legend not the horrible director's cut. The old edit was just fine why did they have to go and ruin it. I just can't get over the music is was just terrible terrible!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The author is funny; has a great delivery; easy read and have great quotes through out. I found myself laughing out loud with their humor.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I was initially skeptical when it came to Game Of Thrones because the fantasy drama genre is not normally my cup of tea. I kept hearing how good it was so I gave it a shot & bought both season 1 & 2 on blu ray and dived in. It took about 2 episodes to get me hooked and that was all she wrote. Just finished season 2.  I love it. My favorite tv shows of all time are, in order, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Justified, Mad Men. I never though that any show would ever approach The Sopranos for pure viewing pleasure and blanket quality. GOT comes close. Very close. Now for the picture quality. From the first frame to the last is a reference blu ray. If you doubt me just go check out the reviews at bluraycom and highdefdigest. HBO has delivered the highest quality picture ever seen on a television show (or movie for that matter),  by carefully spreading out ten episodes on five discs. The results are spectacular. GOT is not for children. Though (almost) always in service to the plot, it is loaded with sex & violence.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I am getting an Australian Shepherd in a couple of days and this book had some great info on how to raise a dog right. I have read a bunch of different books, read countless articles on the internet, and etc. but this was by far the best one yet!

B004ZJZQFG|5.0|12-05-2013  U-571 is a fast paced, taught WWII submarine thriller that tells the tale of the US contribution to capturing the Nazi's &#34;Enigma&#34; deocding machines, they looked like ordinary typewriters, and thereby gaing advanced intelligence concerning the German's moves at sea.  The British were largely responsible for the overall success of these operationsa, and I missed any referemnce to the Royal Navy's role, which, in truth, waS SIGNIFICANT.  AS A BOY, GROWING UP IN CHICAGO, I REMEMBER THE THRILL OF MAKING MY EVERYOTHER YEAR TRIP THE Windy City's Museum of Science and Industry on the near south side of Grqant PARK AT THE LAKEFRONT, KIND OF LIKE A SCENIC CENTRAL PARK BUT ON THE SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.  AS A BOY WHO FAVORED THE NAVY DUE TO MY BELIEF THAT MY DAD WAS A NAVAL HERO IN THE BIG WAR, I THOUGHT THE LAKE WAS THE NORTH ATLANTIC OR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PACIFIC.  I WAS AN OFFICER FIGHTING EITHER THE NAZI'S OR THE JAPS On the high seas.  For a boy with a vivid and healthy imagination, I even managed to put the momentary slip on a Museum submarine toyr guide so as to find my self, for a minute or two completely alone in some section of the U-505, the captured German U-boat taken by the Us Navy on  and afer the waar , brought to Chicago as an exzhibit on the east side of the great museum.<br />  When alone, I silently barked out commands, &#34;come to course 050, 15 degree down plaNE  ON THE STARBOARD RUDDER, RIG FOR DEPTH CHARGE, ALL AHEAD FLANK SPEED.&#34;  MAN, I WAS SOMETHING.  A 12 yerar old naval hero, along with my execd&#34; Lt. Cmdr. John Wayne and my diving officer CPO. Lee Marvin, USN.  Ah, youthful imaginatione !  Ain't it grand?  There is some imaginatiuon in this film, from 2000, &#34;U-571&#60;&#34; aqnd, despite it's political and actual historical inaccuracies, the everyday life  and dangers of submarine life in wartime are more factual than most people realize<br />  Service on a sub, from any country, demaNDED A SPECIAL MAN, SOMEONE N OT CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND ABLE TO REMAIN SHARP AND FOCUSED IN MOMENTS OF GREAT STRESS.The scenes earlie on of the German u-571, the boat that the Americans will capture, is under depthcharge attack, prewsaumably by the Royal Navy and , with my 7.1 Onkyto and surround sound listening mode, and a kick in volume, it's get the popcorn, sir, aye-aye, get the pop eye,eye, rig for depthcharge!&#34; and hang on<br />  Asplendid reaklistic presentation by the folks at Universal Studios in giving us what almost amounts to a deep ocean version of the opening 20-30 minutes on Omaha Beach&#34; in &#34;Saving Pvt Ryan.  I've never seen &#34;Das BOOTE BUT I HEAR IT IS TERRIFIC, BUT MORE asa s<br />a human drama and study of men in war, but this is pure adventure with lots and lots ofgripping and edge of your seat tension, expecially as you are being depth charged.  I simply can't imagine such terror, but thousand of men did, from the Axis to the Allies.  Seamen are  seamen, and, in the film, &#34;Sink the Bismark from the 1960's , the victorious British officers are genuinely remorsefull as they watch, through their binoculars, the carnage on the devks of the Bismark that they have been orderd to inflict upon the greatest battleship in history.  The watch sadly, as she slips beneath the waves.  I wonder, if any english sailors aboard the trio of crussiers that sank the great pocket battleship, might of been humming WILKKLE'S  &#34;ETERNAL FATRHER, STRONG TO SAVE&#34;.  BE THEY G.I.S. OR MARINES, AIRMEN OR sailors, they were men, men doing a terrible and horrible thing in order to defend their nations and their homes.  At a social, early on in the film, the main characters are aT A N OFFICER'S WEDDING AND THEY ARE DECKED OUT IN ALL WHITE WITH BLACK SHOULODER MOUNTED &#34;MORTARBOARDS,' and gold appointments, medals , buttons and insignia of rank.  To me, a wide eyed lad with a preference for the Navy, they were knights, perhaps resurrected from an olden age and redressed in modernattire.  The film stars Matthew McConaughey  is Lt Andy Tyler, the exec of the mission,<br />.  He is disappointed at his most recent request for a command of his own and while voicing his displeasure to the captasin, Bill Paxton, the crews 's party is cut off witrh orders to sail immediatelyon a mission they will be told bout once at sea.  A marine officer, played firmly by David  Keith, comes abouard and the officers soon learn their mission.  They are going to attempt to steal a German Enigma machine from a German uboatthaT HAS BEEN CRIPPLED, BY THE FILMS OPENING DEPTHCHARGE FOOTAGE.  By the way, the American sub has been redesigned to resemble a real U-boat and the American's with the aid of one of their seamen, a kid from a us farm, who speaks perfect German, will help convince the RAl Germans that they are the rescue  sailors come to their aid.  Got it??Soon at sea, the Americans go over the raiding plans under the leadership of Major Coonan (Keith) and as they approach the real  U -Boat, someone panics and sjots are fired.  In a quick and violkent exchange, both sides loose men, but the Us previals .  They begin to transfer the &#34;Enugma&#34; and all valuable intelligence to the disguizaed American &#34;U BOAT&#34; when the real German sub, sent to aid their Nazi comrades, torpedoes the US sub, sinking it and killing their Captain, (Paxton).  This leaves the eager to command Tyler (MCConaugheyin charge.  So, he gets what he's been wanting, bu the HrAD way.  Not sure that Berlin Knows what has happened, they must now get back to base and, hopefully, the German High Command hasn't discovered the theft of their &#34;Enigma&#34; device, or else, it is a waisted mission---The Germans will simply change their codes tonulify the American's efforts, and men will have died for nothing.<br />  We don't find out, till the end of the movie, that the mission has been a success, but they must contend with a Nazi destroyer they encounter immediately after they have beenforced to take over the real German boat, as their's has been sunk.  Lt Mr. Tyler is now Captain Tyler, and as he is close to his nmen, too close according to his tough CPO (Harvey Kitel) he must make draSTIC AND AWFUL DCISIONS CONCERNING THE LIVES OF HIS MEN, WHO LOOK TO HIM LIKE A BIG BROTHER.  KITEL SETS TYLER STRAIGHT and impresses upon the newq commander, the grimness of being a captain.  .<br />  The business with the Nazi Destroyer is too long to relate here, and you should see it for yourself.  It is a clever and nailbitting episode that occupies a large middle section of the movie.  Captain Tyle devise, purely on his own a plan for sinking the German Destroyer and , while severly damaged a dangerous sequence of events involving the flooding of part of the damaged U-571, with the Americans onboard.  Mr. Tyler, now capotain , must order the sealing of a hatch that will result directly in the death of some of the young American sailors.  It is a guttwrenching and terrible decision for Tyler but he gives the order, thereby allowing the crippled U-571 to survive with most of it's crew alive.  When ytou see the plan, you'll be impressed as I was.<br />  You will just have to buy this movie and see the reast of it, and I think you will agree, it is a VERY,VERY exciting picture.  Despite the spotty real history of this project inWWII, this film redeemd itself with a tough realistic portrayal of navy tactics and the day to day lives of submariners.  A blockbuster with a great story and screenplay by<br />Jonathan Mostow and great performances by McConaUGHEY, PAXTON AND KITEL WITH OTHER SMALLER YET COMPELLING CONTRIBUTIONS.  SUPERB
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Excellent content and I found myself laughing out loud while reading it. The author has definitely been around the block a couple of times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. My 4 1/2 year old loves it and is entertained by it til I tell him time's up. Our whole family has fun with this game. The only thing I think they could change, is making it easier to get more tokens. You use them to buy things and also to start at different maps and get power-ups. Being able to earn them a lil easier would make this app a lot better! I definitely recommend this to anyone who want a good running game and to anyone who has kids.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I've had the mouse for right around a year now, and have been, for the most part pleased with this item.<br /><br />The feature set at the price point at time of purchase simply could not be beat, and I was impressed with the grip, button placement, and functionality right from the get-go (and remain so.)<br /><br />What was NOT great, and is slowly getting worse, is the quality of the components. While I wouldn't say they feel \\"cheap,\\" they're not the sturdiest materials you're likely to find in a mouse. For the price, that's understandable.<br /><br />But I'm worried about wear and tear going forward. I've been away from my PC for a good portion of the year since I purchased this mouse, and haven't put it through much rigorous action, but things are noticeably wearing down, particularly, buttons are beginning to feel noticeably looser, and the scroll wheel... SOMEthing's going on in there, and it doesn't sound good.  It works fine (for now), but there's an unpleasant high pitched scraping when I scroll up, and it's getting worse daily. Something inside there is looser than it should be; right now, it's just an irritation. Down the road, we'll see.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Yes, but maybe not for marathon power gaming, or if you have it in mind that this is going to be your go-to mouse for the next 5 years.

B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Oh man is this bad.<br /><br />The total lack of hooks is a crime against all that is/was right about Boston.  That which is Boston/Scholz has been flagging for years but this is brutal. I paid for it despite the reviews just to support the effort but I'm feeling ripped off at this point. This makes the recent crappy Hagar record look like a masterpiece.  This took 10+ years ? might be time to stick a fork in Boston. The magic seems to have left with Mr. Delp.  In the past with Fran and others singing it worked.  I even like Kimberly before but here ? fail.  Shoot, I just heard Brad and it still can't lift this sinking ship.<br /><br />EDIT: Docked a star cause after forcing myself to listen repeatedly, it still sucks.
1465414444|5.0|I have a rocky past with World of Warcraft. I beta tested the game, waited a little while after launch to actually start playing it and then played off and on through Cataclysm. I'm not writing this as a review of the game, but I feel it's best that you know where I stand, going into this \\"Visual Guide\\" in terms of the game proper. Throughout my love/hate relationship with the game, one aspect always held my interest; the story and mythology surrounding the world and denizens of Azeroth. I have read the War of the Ancients (fantastic BTW) as well as several of the other novels. I always felt that the lore was well thought out and, while obviously rooted in other mythologies, Blizzard has always excelled in taking the familiar and making it their own.<br /><br />The Ultimate Visual Guide carries on this tradition. The book is large and filled with brilliantly colored, heavy stock, pages. It's sectioned off nicely to provide you with the information you're looking for without overwhelming you. The guide is very comprehensive, going over the worlds and their creation/destruction, the Aspects, The Titans, The Old Gods, The Heroes and Villains, Spanning back, prior to the events of World of Warcraft. Even the legendary items/weapons are detailed.<br /><br />Keep in mind, however, this is not a game guide. While it outlines and details much of the content in the game, you're not going to find information on where to find items, mounts, how to complete quests or how to get through the dungeons. This is a Visual Guide to the story and lore of the Warcraft Universe.<br /><br />Overall, this is everything you could possibly want in a visual guide. While, obviously, the information is more detailed in the actual novels written about the universe or by playing through all the games, this is meant to be a quick reference. This would be particularly helpful for those fans who came on late in the game and are consistently confused regarding names and locations. Even having played the games and read several books, I find it difficult to keep everything straight sometime. It was very enjoyable flipping through this guide and refreshing my memory. In fact, it made me want to start playing again. This would be a great addition to the collection of any WOW-head.the games and read several books, I find it difficult to keep everything straight sometime.

B00DRGQZRG|4.0|Dave Holland returns to electric music (while playing upright acoustic bass, though) with an excellent line-up and some heavy new material. Very different from Holland's other recent works, but this will satisfy those who appreciated Gateway and other louder offerings from Dave with sometime collaborator Kevin Eubanks. Much of the sound is dominated via keyboardist Craig Taborn and Eubanks, and some busy drumming provided by Eric Harland. Still, it is good to hear Dave Holland in this element again, as the tight arrangements make for some very interesting and adventurous listening with this line-up and recording.

While his boyishness is grating to some people, I love it.  I am not a big fan of a Kate and Castle pairing but I am in the minority in that field.  If you enjoyed Murder She Wrote, I think you will enjoy Castle.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|If you are a fan of the Boston sound at all, and you appreciate a little evolution, buy this album!  While preference in music is certainly a personal thing, those who give this album a low rating based on musicality or production must not be listening closely.  The quintessential Boston sound is there (sure, more Delp would be a good thing, but not possible), more than some of their more recent (yes, I realize recent in Boston time means is quite a few years ago) albums.  There is more depth and intricacy than before.  Give this album a few listens before you decide--you won't be disappointed.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|I don't play golf but I like this game. It's easy to get started with the tutorial and of course,  the more you play the better you get.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|The original campy, kinky comedy musical, straight from the 1970s.  With Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry, and Barry Bostwick, it combines great acting with a delightful musical score (&#34;Time Warp&#34; and &#34;Dammit, Janet&#34; among other songs.)  Definitely not for the kiddies, but a great Saturday movie night choice!  I originally saw this in the theatre on my college campus, and I love being able to relive that fun in my own home!  At the Cyber Monday price, it was a great bargain.  This is a must-have for college students and hip parents alike!
B005XOPEOU|2.0|I don't really like this album, I remember seeing it advertised everywhere, and now that I bought it and listened to it I sit and think to myself.. why did I ever buy this?

B00CRS5HII|5.0|Wagon Wheel is one of my favorite songs right now.  I was surprised when I bought the album and started listening to it that I liked a whole lot more of the songs on there, it's worth giving it a try.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Charges relatively quickly using the wall wart that came with the Nexus. More importantly it connects easily but doesn't just fall off. A little effort is needed to disconnect it but not enough that the tablet would be hurled to the floor if one were to snag the cord.  Also it saves the miniusb port from being abused by my kids when they go to recharge.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Love this movie, it has always been one of my favorites. Got a great deal on it and in a timely manner.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|I liked it<br />It was different from the console version but still fun to play.<br />Plenty of goals to work towards
B001EBV0IA|5.0|This is undoubtably one of, if not the best westerns I've ever seen. If you like period clothes, houses etc. then you'll like this movie. One other thing that is realistic, you don't see in many movies are the fights. I've watched scenes in a movie, that I had liked until then, ruin the rest of the movie. Rocky is a good example of unreal fights. I was raised in a place that had been mining towns a few years before, and fought most of my life. I've never seen a man take a full shot to the face and maybe spin around, then come back into the fight. If I had ever hit someone with my best shot, that didn't at least go to their knees, I would have offered him my keys, all my money etc. I'm not saying I'm a bada-s, but as much as we fought you had to be able to hold your own, or give up your lunch money and anything else we wanted.<br />  So, if you like realistic movies you'll love this one.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|perfect cast. very exciting. interesting to see how people lived a thousand years ago. I watched the entire first season in two days.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|Yes, I like this game. Well thought out, nice game play, smooth actions and easy to master (but complex enough to challenge &aacute;ll the time).
B003Y74KC0|4.0|I upgraded my iPhone and handed my iPhone 4 down to my daughter to use as an iPod. My Otterbox case was a little big for her hands so I was looking for something inexpensive, but that would protect the phone from inevitably being dropped down the stairs a few times.<br /><br />I am frankly surprised that something priced this low is exactly what I wanted. It is not made of an incredibly strong silcone... and it won't replace your Otterbox, but it has some silicone around the front to protect the screen when it's dropped onto the floor. Is soft and comfortable to hold, and looks nice. It has a nice little texture to it as well so it's not completely smooth and hard.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially for people who don't want to pay a lot to lightly protect an older device being used just for car tunes, as a kids iPod, or at the gym for example.
B003O86FMW|5.0|have not seen the movie but the book is really good, entertaining and creative. You have to read it if you like science fiction

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|What a waste of money!  This product was released WAY before it should have.  This was an impulse buy after seeing the ad and I will be promptly returning it.  This products allows only 5 apps to run on it and barely operates on Apple devices.  Your better off getting a Roku.  The ad makes it look like you can chromecast playing games on your IPhone to your HD TV which isn't true.  This is definitely a MUST PASS on device.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I think this was another good example of Gaiman and his way of bending our reality. All of his stories are precious but leave me unsettled in some unfinished way. Maybe because none of them ever really have a happy ending. I think the closest to that was Coraline but even she had an unsatisfying family life, as her parents are way too consumed in their own lives and neglect Coraline. His adult stories are much darker and show regret in all the characters, as they feel they've wasted their lives in some way. Or didn't become extraordinary people, as they had hoped they would as children. But just as there is a sense of regret, there is always some sliver of hope.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really love this game. My 5 year old has the app on his kid tablet and I have it on mine.<br /><br />I love the way that it teaches you a new language by testing you in several different ways with phrases and words.<br />I love that you have to respond after hearing the spoken text, multiple choice, speaking an answer into the mic, picking the right picture, translating the words, and more. You have a few stars so you get chances to keep playing if you miss a few. I like how if you lose a certain amount of stars, you have to start all over again.<br /><br />My favorite part is that I am really learning more and more each time I play. It is very easy to understand and use. It's fun and challenging at the same time. Guess what? And the app is actually free! Take that Rosetta Stone!<br /><br />I love, love, love this app!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It took me a while to read this book and I had to concentrate to keep all the characters straight.  But I did enjoy it and learned a lot about history.  I usually read a book in 2-3 days, this one took much longer but worth the time.
0385341008|5.0|Well written. Great read and entertainment for a rainy day. I'll look for more by this author. Book shipped on time.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I like the whole Pendergast Series.  I have read them all and find Douglas Preston to be a fine writer who can keep your interest. He gives great descriptions and I can see everything happening in my mind.  Keeps me on the edge of my chair and wanting to read more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really love this game. I played it for about a year then uninstalled it when I disabled my Facebook. I spent 3 months without it then missed it, so I reinstalled it. Such a fun game. Very addicted
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm young and I love this game! (I love anything with dragons) I have it on a kindle fire and it works fine.also for those who have trouble getting some Dragons I got the breeding guide on my phone and it's helps alot I have tons of rare dragons ready and a gemstone egg almost ready to hatch(gemstone dragons give gems)
B00BHWG5C2|5.0|For me, getting flawless recordings of the unreleased portions of this concert was like a dead sea scrolls scholar getting the remaining fragments of a book for which he had only recovered 60% of the text. As a collector and afficianado of Stones recording history, this was a platinum moment...second only to my first acquisition of the Brussels 1973 recordings back in the 1970s: then 'Nasty Songs', finally released legitimately as 'Brussels Affair' (albeit, to my delight, with mostly different takes of half the tunes). I do wish they'd assimilated all the new tracks into the original CD...and in the order they were played...like the Who did with the Leeds deluxe edition, but that would have bit into ABKCO's all important priority of 'cost of goods sold'.<br /><br />I appreciate B.B. King and the Turners, but confess I've only listened to that CD once. I also 'get' that ABKCO's pretenses of cultural altruism veil the true agenda of gouging rabid Stones fans for these tidbits of treasure even though they could have served up alot more that is in the can from that series of recordings.<br /><br />But I don't care about that, any more than an art collector would pay a million for a Van Gogh that some hack found in the garage sale of an art illiterate and bought for $5.<br /><br />I found the DVD of 'Gimme Shelter' outtakes / deleted scenes, and the performance footage of Prodigal etc. (which are different takes than the CD bonus track, which no-one seems to have noticed) delightful and have no doubt it represents the best of the rest of what was in the Maysles dusty old cuttings box marked 'Shelter scraps'. I do confess, however, that if the footage of the rest of the concert, which they presumably shot, could be digitally restored and patched together for release (ala Who's Isle of Wight 1970) I would pay almost anything for it.<br /><br />Finally the little book had some great stuff, some of which I never knew (like the original cover getting scrapped because Ethan Russell put a joint in Mick's mock travel bag, and he was up to his eyeballs enough in drug charges at the time). And who better than Stanley Booth to write the rest...he was THERE every step of the way.<br /><br />Review the MUSIC people...not the (albeit justifiable) critique of ABKCO as they continue Allen Klein's single minded legacy of greed, or the inclusion of the opening acts that are great artists whether you...and I...are into them or not (Ya Yas was originally intended as a double LP that included those recordings but Decca vetoed it).

He didn't know what to make of Ana, that was the start of a new life for Christian! It also shows that we can over come a bad start in life when we start with abusive parents!
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I purchased two of these for my girls DVD players in the car as they where hard to hear with the road noise. After reading many of the reviews on them I purchased them reluctantly as I thought they would only minimally amplify the sound. Much to my surprise they worked past my expectations and are quite loud and have to be kept at a nominal level so they do not blast your ears out. I am very happy with it and would highly recommend this unit.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think all three of these books were very good! There is a lot of substance to all three books!  The first book has a lot of misconceptions about the sex. But if you don't share that partof the books , the rest doesn'take since!
B00005R5G9|5.0|One of my favorite 80s movies. I'm typically not a fan of either of these actors, but they pulled this movie off well. Both very lovable.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Blending together the sizeable, serrated guitar chops, stark atmospheres, and harsh dissonance of heavy metal music with the beats, vocals, and samples of industrial music, Gothic rock-derived keyboards, and the kind of hooks that are usually saved for pop music, the sound captured on 1998’s “Mechanical Animals” could not be more true or adherent to the following phrase: Industrial metal. And needless to say, it is another excellent release from Brian Warner (a.k.a. Marilyn Manson) and the gang. Furthermore, it gets better with repeat listens, as each time it is spun after the first time, there is a hook, memorable refrain, noteworthy bass line, or some other kind of musical nook and cranny revealed to the listener.<br /><br />“Great Big White World” serves as a strong set opener, and a very catchy one at that, thanks to its dreary synth-vocals, a programmed drum beat, ominously grumbling bass, and looming, new wavy-sounding synth work. But later tracks, like “The Dope Show” and “Rock Is Dead,” are even stronger cuts still, and they both are hit singles, and rightfully so. The former is one extremely infectious and even danceable number with Ministry-esque stomping rhythms; and the latter is, in addition to being the album’s hookiest song, also the album’s heaviest and most straightforwardly hard rocking piece. It is an irresistible mosh pit anthem with a strong bass grumble, some heavy guitars, and positively anthemic and unforgettable choruses. A tangible, fist-pumping energy is also present, here.<br /><br />Elsewhere, “Mechanical Animals” (the song) begins to showcase Manson’s more melodic side, as it is complete with clean singing, big, soaring choruses, and all. But it is on tracks like “Dissociative,” “The Speed Of Pain,” and “Fundamentally Loathsome” that Marilyn really starts to explore an experimental, ballad-esque approach. All three of these songs feature dreary clean vocals and lovely acoustic strumming, but the latter two are acoustic ditties that could rival anything off of Alice In Chains’ “Jar Of Flies,” or any other acoustic metal album. They both (but especially “The Speed Of Pain”) boldly showcase MM’s tender, melancholy, and dare I say even sweet side, and do so with a melody that is positively bright-sounding.<br /><br />Back on heavier ground, “Posthuman” is a more up-tempo and profusely hard rocking number with buzzing synths, anthemic vocals, and noteworthy synths. And what about a truckload of memorable hooks, too? Oh yeah, you can definitely expect that, as well! And “I Want To Disappear” and “I Don’t Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)” are two other heavy odes to the mosh pit, with a heavy and memorable guitar/bass groove to go along with their killer choruses and memorable vocal patterns.<br /><br />“New Model No. 13” and “User Friendly” are two other insanely hooky fist pumpers with lurching guitar rhythms and instinctively memorable vo-kills, though the second of these two songs distinguishes itself by also boasting some deft DJ-scratching and a trippy, synth-heavy vocal part, too. And nearing the end, “The Last Day On Earth” is driven by some positively spooky, and even borderline operatic-sounding synths. And “Coma White” is another big standout, thus ensuring the “Mechanical Animals” goes out on a strong and memorable note, what with its lovely acoustic guitar plucking in its intro that permits the arrangements to breathe nicely.<br /><br />“Mechanical Animals” cannot quite be said to be quite as excellent has Marilyn Manson’s last release, 1996’s watershed-worthy “Antichrist Superstar.” But if this review, and its beaming five-star rating implies anything to you but another strong piece of industrial metal, then the point has clearly (and very sorely) been missed.atter two are acoustic ditties that could rival anything off of Alice In Chains’ “Jar Of Flies,” or any other acoustic metal album.

006202406X|3.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. I liked Divergent, I LOVED Insurgent. I had a little schoolgirl crush on Four. This was a series that I came to after I finished Hunger Games, and in some ways I liked it better. The love story was hotter and there was no Peeta to get on my nerves.<br /><br />This final book in the series was just not as strong, and there are a couple of reasons for this.<br /><br />1.) The split perspective. If you've read the book, you understand why the author did it. However, if you pick the book up mid-chapter, you have no idea who's speaking. Tris' and Tobias' thoughts, actions and perspectives are so similar as to be unidentifiable. I suppose you could make an argument that it was intentional, that the author wanted to show that they are basically two sides of the same coin. But literally, the only reason you recognize the voice of one or the other is when they refer to each other by name or pronoun. Even if it was intentional, it didn't work for me. Broody Four and flinty but vulnerable Tris should have at least some distinguishing characteristics to their inner lives. I wish the author had either made Tobias' perspective richer, or dispensed with it entirely (and yes, I do think that would have been possible). He's hotter when he's mysterious.<br /><br />2.) That this book was plot-driven instead of character-driven. While I do think that Tris stayed true to her character at the end, I don't think that the book stayed true to its roots. The author has said that Tris' fate was destined from the beginning (although I've also heard that she said she wasn't sure where all this was going) and in order to Tris to meet her destiny the plot had to take her there. The challenge, of course, would be that the ways for Tris to get there are ad infinitum. This leads the reader to ask a lot of &#34;why&#34; questions--for example, why didn't Tris, Tobias, et al mobilize the Fringe? Why didn't they explore any options for the final showdown besides the one idea that had already been executed and ended in disaster? For me, the plot didn't add up to the inevitable conclusion, but I could have ignored that completely if it hand't been for the lack of empathy for the characters this time around (see #1 above).<br /><br />I've read a few of the reviews on this site. There are a ridiculous amount of them, all of them with very strong opinions about the story, the characters. Some are angry, some have the audacity to trash the author. To that I will say two things: The first is that Veronica Roth should be proud that she created these characters and this world and made people care about them to this degree--brava to her. The second is that if the reviewers think they can write a better series of books, they should totally do that, and THEN offer up smug, sanctimonious advice to Veronica Roth.<br /><br />Now, to go get some birds tattooed on my collarbone...
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Loved this movie. Jen is as hilarious as she is adorable. This movie has a freshness to the same old 'strangers meet and become couple' theme. Background score and the theme/song &#34;my sweetheart&#34; was the best part of the movie other than the actors themselves.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wow! This is a great story! The night I started this book I was very tired and it was not making any sense at all. But then a day or so later I restarted it and I could understand that the narrator of the book was Death. Death was very busy during WWII Germany. The book is about a young girl who found comfort in the words of books during her difficulties during a very unforgiving war. When she is allowed into a library, her reaction is priceless! But in the end she realizes that words have been the enemy. But she tries to use words to tell her story. This book is a great story of the common German people in Germany during WWII and how they were mislead and ended up paying with their lives. The story is about 2 young people that lived their lives while their world was deteriorating around them. I really, really liked this book!
1609611543|4.0|I have suspected for a while that I have a wheat allergy and this book helped clarify some things for me personally.  I see so many of my problems tied to what I now recognize as more of a sensitivity than an actual allergy.  Looking back, my mother and daughters have many of the same problems.  Probably, there are many people experiencing the same issues  now that perhaps could be alleviated if our grains were not genetically modified to such extreme degrees.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After reading so many rave reviews I FINALLY read it! What intrigue. What bad girl fun! Can't wait for a movie....each main character would be a role to fight for!

B00DNB9RXO|5.0|All of the art is done in black and white. There is a story book that goes along with the game. You only get to see the first 3 pages of the comic story book and you have to complete levels to add pages. The game is a maze/gravity game that you have to go through so it is fun and a mind challenger. You have to collect the seeds as you travel. You use 5 seeds to unlock portals, 10 seeds to unlock doors. You also collect diamonds and if you collect them all you can play the level in time trial mode. You can play the game using virtual buttons to rotate the screen, the accelerometer control or you can touch and drag the screen to rotate it.<br /><br />The game contains 40 levels but only the first 5 are unlocked. All you have to do is to goes through the maze and collect the seeds, diamonds and make your way to the portal. Oh wait! Did I tell you about the floating eye or about the walls that contain sharp spikes that kill you. Be careful!<br /><br />The game is challenging and fun. There are several types of obstacles that can kill you and you don't really know what they are until it happens and you learn how to avoid them. I like playing using the accelerometer mode for the controls on my Kindle Fire. I like this game a lot.<br /><br />I like this game a lot and I rate it as a 5 star item. Get it while it is a FAOTD but if you miss getting it then it is still worth the price to buy it.

B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litagator, indeed another great read by the brilliant writer, John Grisham. If you are a fan like I am, surely you have already held this book, read his words and was as engrossed as I. If not, what are you waiting for?<br />It's in all the book stores, libraries, it can be on you Kindle in seconds. Go, now.! You will be talking and sharing this book for months. Mr Grisham never fails to entice his readers, the pages can't get turned quick enough. This will make a great Christmas gift<br />Remember my reviews do not give anything away from the books, why would I spoil your reading? No, no, you have to get right on it now. My word is my word, I loved it, I'm a huge fan so I'm giving this message back to you. Basically I'm another happy lady who can't wait to start my next John Grisham novel. Thank you Mr Grisham.
B003O86FMW|5.0|best so far! (of the 2 I read). more complexity, and a more complete plot than the first book. looking forward to the finale
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|This wasn't a great movie, it was decent.  It was entertaining, not a lot of depth to the story or characters.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Looks cheap, turns yellow very soon
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'm not necessarily a fan of biographies but this was a great read. Even though I was already familiar with the Jobs story still I hardly could put it down. Author and subject both great!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|A bit too much self aggrandizement for me. A fair read. If you're a Tina Fey fan, you'll probably love it. I'm not so it was just okay.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|I have played this over and over again. Can,t get enough. I also can,t stop dancing as soon as the first song plays. Good quality sound!
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine is Celine. I just love her voice in English, French, Spanish, whatever! I have listened to Celine for years and she never disappoints.
0321525655|4.0|Anyone looking to improve their presentations and make them more interesting and inviting should read this book. It has lots of examples and is one of the better books on the subject.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|AMAZING young girl. Someone for young girls to look up to. Actually, ALL of us can and should look to this girl for inspiration. She stood up for what she believed in. Even in the face of the threat of death. Let's all remember what is truly important.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I am working towards reading several classics, and I thought that this would be a perfect Christmastime read. Charles Dickens is delightful to read and really draws you into the story. I recommend this quick but joyful read!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Love zombie movies! This has put a slightly different spin on that tale. All zombie movies are essentially apocalyptic movies. If you love the genre, this is a great film
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I love Persuasion and have it in hardback, but got this for reading on the go.  It was the reight price and relatively free of errors in the text.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! There are two modes: survival mode and creative mode. Survival mode is fun because of the assortment of bad guys. In creative mode it is fun to create you o an world with unlimited resources.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This is a fun filled movie everyone of any age can enjoy.  It was a huge hit with the whole crowd.
0812550706|3.0|I enjoyed this book, very interesting ideas and story.  I think it is kind of a must read for Fantasy/Sci Fi readers.  The problem i have with it is the ending. It just comes too quickly and then wraps everything up with a ton of story condensed in a few pages.  I liked it though, good quick read, nice ideas.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Couldn't stop laughing at all the comical things that were going on. Modern day Flintstones!  The Dad was too funny with his attitude on things. But the real start of the show was the teen age daughter.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is difficult for me to put into words.  This story evoked a huge range of emotions.  I want my friends to read it so we can process it together.  Who knew the other side of the fence was so difficult.  Of course we know. We just are unable to express the horror and pain.  Well done Mr. Zusak.  Well done.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen is one of my favorite comedians! I could hear her voice as I read her book because she writes like she talks. It made me giggle and smile so it was worth the price!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|You can't beat the classics no matter how hard you try, Charles Dickens for life and for a lovely death
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was the best game of its type that I have played. Worth the money. It was challenging, engaging, and long enough to satisfy without being boring. Great ending. I don't know what is up with the bad ending games, life has enough of those, HELLO. Games are supposed to entertain, not depress us. The graphics were fantastic, very cool sound effects too. If other game makers want a role model, this is it. Liked the option to switch from hos games to dominoes. Loved the &quot;gotcha&quot; scenes. GOOD BONUS LEVEL. All in all a very fine game. Cynthia
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I wanted to watch this in the theater.  Finally got to watch this and it was entertaining and funny.  Good movie if you need a good laugh.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging and fun. A great way to kill time. I highly recommend this game to players of any age. Lot's of FUN.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It is a compelling story about a time in the history of the word that many are unaware such an event even took place. Death was the most qualified to tell it. Liesel and her foster family were one of the many  that witnessed it. Fiction based on true events; very well written. Once you begin reading it will be very hard to put down.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This is one of the best hip-hop/rap albums released in the last ten years, honestly. While there are some tracks I dislike, the overall cohesion of the album just plain works.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great strong female leads--yay!<br /><br />The violence is over the top, but where else can you get a dragon mama and beheadings in one episode?
0061950726|4.0|I’m not sure that I have ever heard of orphan trains that took 200,000 children from the coast to the midland to find their families. Another good, sometimes tragic event in American history. This book poses a question: What would be the important things you take with you throughout your life from past experiences? This book also had an interesting way of combining and melding the past and present. While there is some strong adult language, this book is a great read for those who enjoy historical fiction.
B004EPZ034|5.0|The movie arrived quickly.  It was in excellent condition.  My entire family loved the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies.  We have enjoyed this one.  The Chipmunks' adventure in this movie made everyone in the family laugh.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I can play fur Elise, how the cats walk, and way more songs! I love how you get to switch instruments like you get to play the drums, the tambourine, and the triangle. Recommended for anybody.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|I had never heard of Bruder toys until my grand kids showed me what they would like &#34;Santa&#34; to bring them if they were good. Don't know why they told me..., but I decided to help &#34;Santa&#34; out and look into the Bruder line. I was impressed on how realistic they were for the price. Santa told me that the grand kids were good and they could have the toys they wanted. I picked up 5 different sets (2 for me, I was good too) and put my 2 in the toy box as to give them &#34;The Test&#34;. So far they are standing up to the punishment.<br />The other reason I gave this 5 stars is because of AMAZON! When I received the Bruder JCB Midi CX Loader Backhoe it had a fracture in a part, probably done in assembly?, I notified Amazon and within 2 days I had a replacement!! &#34;WOW&#34; Sad to say but the replacement was fractured in the same place. I notified Amazon of this and I also decided to keep the toy as it would be of no avail to get another. I am pretty good at fixing things so if it breaks &#34;Grandpa will fix it&#34;. Amazon agreed to this and even gave me 30% credit on the toy! I was totally amazed!<br />Thanks and God Bless
B00899F0G8|5.0|Great show, and great group of girls. It makes me crazy sometimes because things are drug out so long, but the conclusion is always worth the wait.  Big shock about the teacher.  Didn't see that coming.  Cant wait to see what happens next.
B0038P80CO|3.0|Christian Alvart’s Pandorum is a typical science fiction thriller on the surface; however, upon closer review, it reveals a myriad of evolutionary themes. The film follows the flight crew (Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster) on a Noah’s Ark themed ship, which we learn has departed from an overpopulated Earth with an “ideal” population sample to restart life on a new habitable planet. The trip is supposed to take 123 years, so the pilots must take shifts where the off duty officers are in “hyper sleep” along with the other passengers. When the protagonists awake to discover something has gone awry, they encounter a new cannibalism practicing - human-like species that has taken over the ship.<br /><br />Though this film does not need to be viewed with a critical eye to be enjoyed, one can uncover the aforementioned ideas. A culturally appropriate depiction of overpopulation connects to the contemporary ideas of depleting resources. Next, eugenics and artificial selection are featured prominently through the choice of humans determined to be the only hope of a future for the race. What Pandorum lacks in character depth, it greatly compensates for in these areas and I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.
031623480X|5.0|Great information on inflammation and the effects not only on the body but the brain. This got my attention! This is a must read as it will explain why we are seeing so many neurological issues in our population.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|There is nothing really to say.  Indiana Jones... Blu-ray.  With hours of bonus material this is an excellent addition to any collection.  Enjoyed the trilogy as a kid.  Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is... fun, I guess, but I really bought it for the original three.
B00F522C7C|2.0|My 4 year old grandson doesn't seem to get interested in this story.  He loved the Cars movies......both of them.  He and his 2-y/o brother walk out of the room to play elsewhere.  Toy Story or Cars will hold their attention all the way through....even after 2000 times of playing.  I can only tell you what my grandsons seem to like....or not.  I was surprised.
B00D6DVRX2|5.0|Sting is one of my favorite performers so I always jump on anything new he comes up with.  This is a wonderful double album and should be made into a stage play musical.  Most of the songs can stand on their own, but they all go together and tell a story.  I think it is amazing.
B000063Y8F|3.0|We've own this now for about 1.5 years and we &#34;like&#34; it. It is a little better than our oxo one. It does not press garlic with the skins on very well; however with the skins off, it does an excellent job. We paid this high price in hopes of having one that would press with the skins on so to us this press was too costly. We use it semi regularly and it has no signs of wear (nor rust).
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It is a fun game. but I can't give the game five stars because it uses in-app purchasing, which is extremely annoying.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Only down side is the time drain, I do not want to put it down.<br />Reminds me of Granville but a better storyline.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|wont load now after upgrade.  freezes when checking for updates. tried uninstalling and. reinstalling still no help. guess I'm out of luck on this. one
B002LMV7TS|5.0|This is Jim Carrey at his best. They couldn't have picked a better actor to be the Grinch. The picture , and sound quality are what you would expect for a Blu-Ray movie, crystal clear.  This is another great family holiday movie to add to your collection.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I haven't even finished it, but may eventually do so ... not sure about that.  I think that he comes off better in his travel episodes on TV.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Unbelievable picture quality. They remastered every bit of this movie frame by frame. The remastered sound track will blow you away. If you are a Beatle fan, you must get this version.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wish amazon prime was also included in this. But awesome product to stream youtube for now. I have netflix too, but I am going to give up netflix for amazon prime.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|The transfer to Blu-Ray is outstanding for a movie this old. This is a must have, in your Christmas movie collection. Enjoy a classic movie with the entire family.
B00CIAYTL6|5.0|Almost as good as the original IP Man Kung Fu movie.  This is the story of the master fighting the battles (Kung Fu and otherwise) in an attempt to establish a martial arts studio and following in Hong Kong following his escape from mainland China.  The subtitles are so well done that you kind of forget about them after a while and the translations don't feel corny at all.  Someone knew how to capture the subtleties of the language to make you feel like you could really have been there experiencing it.  This is beyond rare in Kung Fu movies.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|Great Blu-Ray conversion. This movie has a great story line. It's action packed too. Very clear picture & excellent sound track quality.
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|This is just about the best kung fu movie I have ever seen.  It is authentic and it feels right at home having subtitles.  In fact, after watching it for a while, you kind of forget that you are reading sub titles.  Its the story of an interesting but normally humble man who also happens to be the finest master of kung fu in the known area.  He is a fairly wealthy man before the Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland in the 1930s.  The story moves from a prosperous small town backdrop with Kung Fu as an interesting hobby to the struggles to survive during a military occupation.  It turns out the invading general in the area is a fan of martial arts and things start to get really interesting.  You likely already know that the lead character in the movie is actually the man who eventually taught the future superstar, Bruce Lee, personally.  This is the story before that story.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|Crystal clear picture & great sound track. This is a cute version of the original classic movie. Grab some popcorn, and enjoy a great family movie.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|My rating is for the overall set. It's rare to see a Bluray Book aside from the ones released by Warner, and this is a good example on why Fox may not release more movies in this format. Even when the photos in the book are great, the fact that the disc must be slide into the book is really a shame, and also the lack of extra liner notes or essays on it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. People's feedback really help me play the game without buying anything. This game is very addictive. I would highly recommend!!!!
B00005JPAO|5.0|A classic!  With Helen Mirren - what else can you say!  Although I wonder what the royal family really thought of this movie?
0385338694|3.0|This was a good book, overall. Samantha was a likable character and I loved her and Nathaniel together. But, I have to say, the writing and dialogue was very sloppy and seemed rushed. It took me a long time to get into this book, and once I finally did I felt like the story went along too quickly. It didn't quite give me enough time to *really* care about the characters before all the drama unfolded. By the end, I was left feeling unsatisfied and slightly confused.<br /><br />Overall, this wasn't a bad story. But the writing was sloppy and poorly-paced and I probably wouldn't read it again.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|The meta narrative of all Zombie movies and books is the same, that is when the world is going to hell in a handbasket, humans will still have conflict with one another even when united for a common cause. Max Brooks though tells this story in the refreshingly unique way of recorded interviews which I enjoyed. He has also gone into a great amount of detail in the writing of the book and his arguments are quite conceivable. I'm not usually one for horror fiction but with this I will make an exception
B003ASLJRW|5.0|SOME WERE GOOD AND SOME WHERE BAD. ON SOME GAMES THEY WOULD NOT PLAY RIGHT AND JAM UP AND OTHERS DID OK
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Able to our small town listed for weather. The reports have been much more accurate than any news print or forecast from larger cities.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Could not have come out sooner for kindle. Been waiting for this so I could finish the game. Love the unlocks.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|For a while this game was fun, but it gets boring. Once you figure out how to become good at it, it looses the attraction it had at first. Stopped playing after a few weeks.
B000AP04OM|5.0|What is there not to like?  An item that should be in every dvd collection of the film hobbiest.  Excellent.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|One of the best movies! Ya can't beat an Anthony Hopkins movie. And Alec Baldwin is really good, too. Highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing candy crush ,also get disgusted when seem unable to get close to clearing all the candies. I have only been to get to level 33.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is always good and this book is no exception.  Not as scary as some of his other tales, but it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat!  I have always wondered what happened to Danny and Wendy Torrance after the Overlook, and this book brings everything full circle.  A must read for any King fan!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I think that this is the best racing game on the market for all around options and events and all the different cars able to be obtained! GREAT GAME.
B00BOL22GY|5.0|A superb historical or period drama that has the intensity, acting, direction, and quality of premium channel show without the pornographic level of nudity and sex. The show is captivating, interesting and plays on historical figures and legends well with its own twist. This show is not for the faint of heart, both the battle scenes and the tender moments are incredible! It is definetely worth giving a try, especially if you are waiting for Game of Thrones to return.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Well written and suspence filled episodes. Entertaining without boring or dragging story out. A good watch. I am now looking for seasons 1-3
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I've seen Hundreds of Star Trek episodes across multiple versions of the franchise but my love for this movie exceeds that nostalgia. Anyone I have ever forced to sit down and view this film have experienced tears of laughter. This movie is just freaking funny. Hey, it is a great parody, but the heart of the film is universally funny.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love kik, because I have a lot of friends around the world and this is how I talk to them.  When they took it off, I was mad.  Now they have it, and I am not joking I jumped out of my bed!!(:  Super Pumped!!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|An Inconvenient Truth is an appeal to emotion, flitting back and forth from the author's personal life to his claims regarding global warming. Heart rending personal events do not science make.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|The content itself is enough to make this a good read, but the small challenges are what make it fun.
B00GMONG90|5.0|The singers are great both individually and within their group. The music is upbeat, fun and you'd think they had a band behind them!
B00280LYIC|4.0|I loved this book since the second i read the first page, i definitely recommend it to anyone with a great imagination and open eye to anything. I loved it mainly because of my insane interest in the Greek gods, so if you like them to you should really read.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart is a great read!  I have read several of Brandon Sanderson's books and not been disappointed by any of them.  Steelheart is a non-stop action thriller that is very hard to put down once you start reading.
0671646788|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AN AWESOME ACCOUNT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BE ALL YOU CAN BE. FROM A GREAT MENTAL<br />ATTITUDE, A COMPASSIONATE HEART TO HAVING NO LIMITATIONS ON WHAT IS POSSIBLE. IT'S AN EXCITING READ.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|All I can say is &#34;Wow&#34;!  I couldn't put The Husband's Secret down.  This is one of those novels that grips the reader from the first word and never lets go.<br /><br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick is living the perfect married life, raising her three daughters and successfully selling Tupperware. Tess O'Leary runs to her mother's home in Sydney with her son, Liam, in tow when she learns her husband has fallen in love with her cousin, Felicity. Rachel Crowley is the school secretary who is still grieving for her daughter, Janie, who was murdered twenty three years ago.  She's convinced herself that the school's PE teacher, Connor Whitby is the murderer. All of these lives become intertwined because of an envelope Cecilia finds from her husband that is labeled, &#34;To be opened in the event of my death&#34;.<br /><br />What I absolutely loved about this book is the author's ability to put the reader inside each character's head.  The way Cecilia's thoughts raced, Tess's actions frozen by her lack of self esteem, and Rachel's unresolved grief were all captured precisely by the written word.  I'm not going to give the secret away.  The story is too good.  You have to experience it for yourself.  The Husband's Secret is  the best book I've read in a long time.  I can't wait to read more by Liane Moriarty.  No wonder it's a bestseller.  It's that good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I find myself playing many times a day.lots of fun. cant wait to see what will happen in the next level.
B00F2NOPFG|5.0|great gift the movie was a reat remake love the way the movie redid kan my kids watch a lot.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|An expertly spun tale of murder and the legal process of securing a not guilty verdict. Very suspenseful. Connelly at his best.
B00486UF52|5.0|I'm married to an Englishman, and this book explains a lot to my family.  Most of what is in it I was already familiar with but hadn't put into words.  My husband got a big kick out of the parts I read to him-I don't think he had even thought anything was different about some of his mannerisms til he heard about them from the outside.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have really been enjoying the game. Figuring out where to head next is sometimes a real challenge. But once you have figured it out it is very satisfying. Great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft on HD awesome get it now and get pocketinveditor it helps you on minecaft really is fun loved it get it now Now Now Now Now Now Now Now Now Now
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love love love this app! Best app as in game category I have on my kindle fired HD I love it!!! If you don't have it, get it while it's free because a great game like this won't be free for long!!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My three year old son LOVES this game! He especially love the balloons he can pop after he finishes a puzzle! A great app!
0553382179|3.0|This book is based on the system in Sidetracked-Home-Executives, and while I do like some of the changes that Flylady introduced, I prefer the original authors' presentation. Flylady adds a religious aspect to housecleaning that doesn't resonate with me. I don't see what place spiritual views have in the day-to-day aspects of keeping a clean house or achieving an organized life.  That said, I find her free online tools invaluable and many of the tools she sells on her site to be of great help.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My family loves this movie and we watch it year round. I mean really... who doesn't love this movie? If you don't, you are the Grinch and there is no hope for you.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Great as a free application<br />Challenging but fun as you improve<br />Lots of techniques to figure out<br />Beautiful graphics<br />Recommended
B003ASLJQS|5.0|One of the best movies ever made!  And this is due to not only great Direction, but because so many incredible actors were willing to come together in the same movie!  Nowadays this doesn't happen too often, because most movie budgets can't afford to pay zillions to more than 1 at a time!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I love uno, and this is a really nice app. I love the graphics and the gameplay. But it's not worth having to sit through 30 seconds ads every single match. You can't skip them, either.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|One of the best movies out there!  I've said this before; anytime you have several GREAT actors in one movie, there is just no chance of it being bad....and this movie proves it!  The story has many turns and keeps you on the edge...and the ending: priceless!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|This game is so cool.  Awesome graphics, cool sounds, trash talk, hot cars,  you name it; it's got it!  The only trouble, it's so much fun, you can't put it down.  I have lost so much sleep....It will take most people some time to make it through all levels; which translates into &quot; much fun!&quot;  Great game!
B000M341QE|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again, and still love it!  It has some real strong language and killing scenes- but everything is so well done, it fit like a glove!  One of the best movies made, but then again....Jack's in it :)
B00466HM28|5.0|This is great. i was having trouble getting sound being new to this I forgot to turn on the ACID 7, which I recommend greatly with this...sooooo many extras with Acid.<br />Even at first I got no sound and started watching youtube videos and searching forums, nothing. I learned a lot about the MPKmini and suggest everyone new to these do the same. But when I would hit the keys nothing. I had everything configured correctly as I found on a forum on the Akai website. Loaded presets downloaded from Akais website. Still no sound. I was frustrated and I turned off the MPKmini editor, hit the keys on the virtual keyboard (that pops up after you load the MPKmini into Acid 7 for Input and Output) and then hit the keys on the MPKmini and whalah, sound to my ears. It has been nothing but fun since. I read a lot of reviews that Acid 7 is to complicated for beginners but i find it perfect for the MPKmini and not so hard to pick up either just playing with it. You can also download it here from Amazon without having to go to the store or wait 5 days to get it in the mail.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|There is little of her work out there and this is good. Perhaps not her best, but needs to be heard.<br />I miss this artist.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|not a lot of intresting games will make you buy coins to play ..had to put parental control on to keep grandson from buying coins
B002RV01QI|5.0|Classic Enya!!!  You can not go wrong with this CD.  It even had a Christmas song bonus which was nice.  I had no idea
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game. I had fun playing. Kept me very interested. So much so that I even had a DREAM of driving the wrecked car. Hahaha
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got to work late this morning because I couldn't put this book down last night.  Best story I've read in a long, long time.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|ok I LOVE playing terraria just because of the possibleity that there is in the game I can just chill in my room now instead of at my desk i'm allways in my chair or bed playing and having SO much fun good game =3
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have literally been playing this game for almost a year. I love it!!!  Whenever people ask what I'm doing all I have to say is &quot;my game&quot; and they know that it's Restaurant Story :)
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This flashlight is awesome , numerous light settings , performance versus size is the reason I rate this light with 5 stars , very easy to handle & comfortable grip , I would also recommend the rechargeable Sanyo batteries as well they perform as advertised
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy Pinterest and really like that it is available on my Kindle. Try it out on your Kindle it's fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was incredible. Read it and then the next two right away. Very interesting world and a compelling story.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Good Series and I enjoyed Jeaniene Frost's writing style.  If you want a good series to start try reading this group.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|One of the best purchases I've ever made. The only issue I have is how it hurts my head if I wear it for too long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game makes me so sad. they shoulda named this game candy crush your dreams. progressively gets harder. makes ur brain sweat
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is the cools game ever I love this game so much I do not want to ever stop playing it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|was very entertaining and fun I had a great time playing it and it is a good game to play will you are traveling
B00ESY77LO|5.0|It's a tragic story, but it kept me interested the whole way through.  And, the visual were great.  One of my friends said she didn't like that they played modern music rather than stay true to the era.  But, I love that.  And, you have to love Lana Del Ray.  There are also some deep morals to the story if you want to analyze it.  But, it's a very enjoyable movie just for entertainment.
1587143879|4.0|I bought this book to finally focus on getting certified this winter and to have the latest updates needed for the exam.  It is thorough and I love all of the extra study materials and videos that are included. I think it will help me accomplish my goal. The drawback is sometimes the explanations and concepts aren't explained in a way that makes is easy to grasp. I've had the 2008 Todd Lammle version of the CCNA book and for me that one did a better job of providing clarity and explaining concepts in a more interesting and even fun manner. Having learned subnet math previously and then reviewing it in this book again, I was actually more confused about the calculation methods than I was before as it was more complicated in this book than Lammle's previous version. I don't think you can go wrong using this for your studies but the writing is a little more cryptic than other CCNA books in the past. I have a long way to go before taking my exam so I can't share the results yet but hopefully it helps me get there.
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|It was very challenging and fun, until I reloaded the app and saw that the character and world I had invested hundreds of hours was completely gone.  I had golden weapons and tools, and just begun to mine demonite.  Needless to say I'm upset and hesitant to start another session.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Netflix, Hulu, YouTube ... $35 ... How can you go wrong? This thing is really great for watching YouTube ... The only thing Roku is currently missing. Chrome cast is an awesome product. Easy to set up, easy to use. Totally worth the price.
B00775D77Y|5.0|Not so \\"80's new wave\\" is it?<br /><br />Simply incredible. At times devastating....but incredible. It intrigues me how most people i know that revere Peter Gabriel's work as sheer brilliance (and cutting edge - of course) are unresponsive to the crushing beauty of Colour Of Spring which makes Gabriel's 1986 effort \\"So\\" seem rather dated and weak.<br />Sorry kids, take back the love and the anger!<br /><br />As far as the \\"remastered import\\" goes, by comparison i find nothing different from the previous EMI edition which leads me to think these Talk Talk reissues pertain more to licensing than sound quality but the price is great for a TIMELESS (\\"80's\\") masterpiece.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an awesome book. I loved it. I would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to read it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game! Only thing I don't like is the Facebook stuff.  Make the game free of Facebook and the game would get 5 stars.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great series with amazing direction, casting, writing and sets. Entertaining and educational as well. Look forward to the next season
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|I think the plot idea was good but not fully developed.  Mae was really not too bright and I hated that she didn't catch on to the obvious. Made this not believable. Very disappointing and stupid ending.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Really fun game. Now I can finally unlock the extras in the console game like the Batman Beyond skin and the Arkham City Hartley Quinn skin. It's great that it is free as well. If you are a DC fan or you have the console version this is a must have.
0307931803|5.0|I choose the 5 star rating based on my experience with the book as a parent and know as a great aunt.  According to my niece, my great niece who is 11/2 years old is enchanted with the rhymes and the illustrations.  She had developed into quite a book lover - gathering several books and hanging out in the corner &#34;reading&#34; her books for up to an hour at a time.
B00594XOZU|5.0|thank you thank you thank you I love this text app thanks amazon this app lets you text your friends
B00C1040TO|5.0|This app is beyond its competitors by lightyears. Its visuals is much more helpful than I though and now to me, essential.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Goodbye housework : -)!My addiction use to be solitare, this game has taken top billing. I recommend it to everyone.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this movie!! Everybody that starred in this movie was extrodinary! This is one of my MOST favorite movies, and I simply fell head over heels in love with Bruce Willis after this! A great thriller, lots of action and amazing stories. A great great movie for a great Amazon price!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Awesome story.  Two story tellers gave a look at the strength of the African-American  family and how they relied on each<br />other.  The goodness of a master was rare indeed.<br /><br /> What a wonderful sense of  the possibility of a white person becoming so intertwined in that world that she has no fear of being shunned . Her innocence was well portrayed.<br />Jeanette Keisling
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Fast delivery. Its a little awkward to use at first. But after cutting a couple bottles, I got the hang of it. If you follow the directions you should be able to cut bottles with ease. I love it. glad I made the purchase
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|From all the reviews from people in the field that this covers I couldn't find one that took general issue with the scholarship.  I bought it on that basis and found it to be an easy read, seemingly fair and factually very revealing.  The things that are never discussed in a proper Christian upbringing!  I have re-calibrated my view of both Christianity, Judaism and the bible/gospels as a result of reading this.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|It is impossible for a soprano of 71 years to produce this kind of singing.  She is truly amazing.  Her instrument continues to knock us out.  Lots of old chestnuts on this album, but if your are a Stresiand fan, it is a MUST
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I just don't get this game, it seems pointless.  I never play it and will probably delete it. Whoever created this I hope that they have a Plan B.
B007SGM084|5.0|the story between Ana & Christian is so moving to the point that you wanted to be part of the story while you're reading it!!...
B00275EHJG|5.0|My Daughter loves This movie, It is a little sad but great movie watches it over and over. great price.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't know why I play this game so much.  It's my go-to whenever a moment of boredom or need for relaxation arises.  This version on my Acer A200 works fast and reliably.  Only takes a second to click thru the advertising.
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|What's more exciting than Matt Damon running around in an exo-skeleton suit for nearly 2 hours? Apparently alot of things. I must have stopped and started this movie 5 different times due to persistent and consistent and insistent boredom. The story wasn't anything I haven't seen before; hence poor, ravished, broken and desolate, hard working people vs  the evil rich who are indifferent to worldly troubles and lived worry-free. Set in the future of course where Earth is in shambles. The story had little build up and as a result I couldn't find myself to actually care about anything that was taking place.
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|I liked it.  For a free Amazon Prime offering it was worth the trouble.  Not as powerful a character set as the original, but the story was still there.  Watched the whole thing which is rare for me.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Great story set in Ford County with the same attorney as in &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34;  I found it a bit predictable but that did not detract from the story.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app keeps the battery working and lets me know how much time is left for each category of use.  It comes up on the screen when I open my Kindle HD to show this information.  Also, I am surprised at how much time I have for reading, surfing, games, etc. Great app to help you keep on your toes when using your tablet.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Always, Always, Always, love Sherlock Holmes and the settings of these stories.  So much so that I actually visiting 221B Baker Street.
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|I like Spider Solitaire better than this one.  Didn't have a chance to try it further to figure it out, but still I like Spider Solitaire better.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Quiet - cooling. I have two of these on separate computers. They are not as big as some of the competition but they are Quiet and cool my systems perfectly.  Not the easiest to install but once installed they are rock solid.  You can remove the fans without talking the whole cooler off to clean them.  I am not sure you can beat these for the price.  The difference between one and two fans is minimal and the fans are easily replaceable with generic units  ( you do not have to buy special fans like some other hi priced units)
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a challenging and fun mahjong game.  It is a challenge to find the matches in the chosen game and gives a good feeling when you clear the board.
B0026P3G12|3.0|impress the famous song by her, but I found only a few song I like among this CD. So keep it for member of dream time.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I like The Weather Channel on TV, but this uses too much power in the Kindle.  I found another app that does the same job and is easier to understand.  One of the reviews I read on this app said the program had changed and made it more difficult to understand.  I've noticed The Weather Channel on TV is different now, and I liked the previous one better.
B00336G7HI|5.0|the second time buy it . work well and last long,  it match well with my camera.  the package is difficult to open.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game at some time each day.  Usually while watching TV at night.  It is challenging, but keeps you going back to try again to clear the board.  My granddaughter has gotten up to 400 challenges in Candy Crush - it is a game that will keep you coming back to try and get to the next level.  The only adversity I can see is the $.99 fees if you want to get further faster.  I try to work around them and spend more time on a challenge, but it seems to come through at some point in time.  The $.99 fees add up, but it's a choice you can make if you want to get through faster.  I'm glad Amazon adapted Candy Crush Saga to the Kindle.
B003TNW044|5.0|I am a big fan for friends, never tired to see it again and again, so I bought forever save.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|What A great list of very the very best Guitar greats the one Beatles song( Don't Let Me Down) that John Mayer and Keith Urbam<br />diod together blew me away! And Eric Clapton sure put a great concert together over four hours of great entertainmet. I highly recomendthis album.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my Husband. She is one of his favorite singers and he loves this album. It's good and upbeat, I don't really care for the song she sings with her husband, because I don't like his voice. Over all, a good buy for fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love love this book. I love the development of the story, i love the characters, i love the ending, i love it all!!!
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Im more a space opera sci fi reader, but this was some fun s-t! Like a mix of R. Scott Bakker, The Black Company series, and a little dash of Gene Wolfe. It's a big world, so be ready to make a significant investment. I'm on book 8, so I have to say the story has been compelling and fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely amazing, and i dont mean it only for the hot scenes. i mean Mr. Grey!! Yummy... Cant' wait to see the movie...
B0057KXXFM|5.0|If you like Limp Bizkit you will like this. As always for them it is a good listen. Enjoy it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is my favorite book of the Saga, it all comes to a close on this one, Bella finally finds her place, and Nessie is absolutely perfect.
B004GJYROG|5.0|YES! What can I say about Space Jam? I can remember watching this movie when it first came out in 1996 and is still the best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By far my favorite book of the. trilogy. I LOVE Fifty and all his messed up ness. a bit predictable but we all know Anna so it shouldnt be so surprising.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|After getting crowns on levels 1-10 in worlds 1, 2, and 3 the game froze and got rid of my 2  day progress. After repeating levels. 4x in a row for the crowns I'm not really interested in going through all the levels again. It's a shame bc it really is an interesting and original game concept.
B00D2PIUAM|3.0|Meh.<br /><br />It's Placebo, so it's automatically better than most of the crap out there today, but as far as Placebo albums go, this feels like the weakest showing yet. The whole album sounds like they pressed play on the &#34;placebo song generator&#34;, there's nothing here we haven't heard before. Other than really, really, terrible lyrics (&#34;My computer think's i'm gay...&#34;)
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Garbage marketing strategy... got to a level where I cannot proceed unless I pay, or beg for assistance from my Facebook pals. Ah, well, Candy Deluxe Pro it is.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is a great stylus! It is the best stylus I have used. The three tips work well and are especially useful working with different size icons when using a smartphone and touchscreen laptop together. The stylus is properly weighted, providing a good balance whether the cap is on or off. You won't need or want another stylus after using this one. With this stylus, you really get what you pay for :-)
B00D3LA71K|4.0|A couple of boys find a man living alone on an island under somewhat unusual circumstances and decide to help him in his cause.<br />Good plot with good acting.
0439796644|5.0|I have seen the movie and the stage play. Both were exceedingly well done. But to get the best sense of Joey's spirit, read the book. The story is told from Joey's point of view. The relationships between Joey and his fellow war horses seem almost human, and one can't help but love this heroic animal. This is among the best books I have read -- ever -- and the reader forgets that it was not written for adults.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, OK? I grew up loving Godzilla, Jonny Sokko, Ultraman, and the Space Giants, so I have a soft sot for monsters stomping on Tokyo. Still, director Del Toro understands the genre and gives the audience interesting characters and frightening monsters. It's nowhere near as dumb as most Hollywood blockbusters, which I guess may not say much.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Exellent movie in new condition, cast of thousands of zombies some CG the locations made film seem so real great prouction values<br />Did not include the digital copy, understandable had already been redemed so not included.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I was under the impression  that it was a free game , after playing for a short time I am being ask to buy cards in order to continue and when I did not purchase a card I am block and I can not access the game . I guess  I got fooled by the advertisement  FREE  BINGO
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Well, I'll tell ya.  My daughter read this book in hard copy. She gave it to me, but I forwarded it to my sister-in-law.  She raved about the story, so I bought it for my Kindle (which is the only way I read).  I just start it, but so far so good.
B00F49BK4W|2.0|Consumers be aware that you can't play the DVD in America. I'm guessing you can't play it in any country, but Japan. The special edition was made for people from Japan.  The new album also only has 3 good songs. I am very disappointed with her new album. The lyrics are not that great or the music. The only amazing thing about purchasing the Deluxe Edition for people outside of Japan is the fact that there are more photos. I am a big Lady Gaga fan, but I am very disappointed with her current work. Also, people outside of Japan should not have to pay 50.00 dollars for a DVD that will not even play for them. Lady Gaga has fans all over the world who support her and love her. Every fan from every country should be able to watch the DVD. She says that she is all about equality and that she loves her fans so much, but most of us are being excluded from being able to watch the DVD. I don't know why she even approved of this marketing strategy!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this book. It truly is a sweet and gentle book. The author has a powerful philosophy that one seeking \\"a\\" meaning in life will definitely enjoy.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This is horrifying & scary & my 8 year old ordered it without my knowledge.  How do I delete it; refund or no refund?  I then set up parent controls, but they require a password on all of her kid games now.  Plzs help.  Judy Lawson<br />billjudylawson@aol.com; 808 879-3088
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty decent game. Just started playing a couple of hours ago.  Use hints if you don't understand at first.  It's easy to catch onto
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It does everything I wanted it to do when I decided to make the purchase. Can't go wrong in buying..
B0053FANQS|5.0|PAUL WALKER AND VAN DIESEL ARE JUST PLAIN TERRIFIC.  THE ACTION CAN NOT BE BEAT.  THE MUSIC IS RIGHT ON.PAUL IS JUST WAY TOO CUTE AND SEXY.
B003NTMREM|4.0|The Torchwood series is exciting, unpredictable, and addicting. Overall, it is an excellent production and will be enjoyed by those who favor police-type who-dunnits as well as the sci-fi crowd. However, I found the utterly unnecessary promotion of homosexuality disgusting and inappropriate for viewing by younger audiences. I am not a homophobe but on the other hand, I think it tasteless of the writers to force the audience to endure scenes of male to male fondling and French-kissing which contributed little or nothing to the plot or theme of the story. I would wager that there is a homosexual writer on the staff of the Torchwood series who enjoyed taking the opportunity of shoving his lifestyle down the throats of the audience (no pun intended).  Not recommended for adolescent audiences. Just my 2 cents.
B0019IMVDG|4.0|Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem!!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I enjoy being able to network and connect with friends, co-workers, former co-workers and people I may not have met yet.  This site allows for those connections without the invasiveness of other social media websites.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|this keeps kicking me out -.- &amp;&amp; turns off my kindle. i have to wait till my kindle runs out of battery to make it work again. yall should fix picsart to make it work better on kindles &amp;&amp; other phones &amp;&amp; tablets.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Read this book in 2 days.  It was hard to put down.  It gave a real insight into the life of Jaycee and answered a lot of questions that would never have been addressed in the media.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Good design and details quality is great wish could get more coins to get better characters and upgrades other than that great game
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best app I have ever downloaded.  I love the site on laptop and on smart phone.  I also enjoy being able to to access the app on my Kindle.
0802473156|4.0|I purchased this book for my daughter who just got engaged. Young people are so in love that they are blinded from the warning signs. I wanted her to understand love, marriage and relationships before she takes the big step of marriage.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|All I can say is BUY THIS BOOK!!! The movie although great is still not like this book.  So good.  Many sleepless nights reading this to the end.  And the best part was that the zombies are not scary at all!!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Love these movies and couldn't have got this set for a better price. Entertaining and action filled. Great,  great item.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hmm what can I say?  You will not regret buying this book.  Engaging, logical, clear, and even paced.  A page turner and it's an easy to read book.  I don't expect the movie to even touch the level of all that is this book.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Recently bought a fujifilm camera, the film is very cheap compared to some other polaroid films. Smaller size than the traditional polaroid.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual a great read.  No regrets.  Totally enjoyed this book.  It had me reading late into the night trying to find out what eventually happened and it was not a let down.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater and really enjoyed it; decided to pick it up on dvd. Great soundtrack aswell.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I thought it was ok. Very anticlimactic... I really can't believe this is the end. I'm not sure I liked the way it just petered out.
B00EPZEU70|5.0|Nice design, features, and film is cheap(compared to other Polaroid cameras). Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and although she hasn't fiddled around with it yet, she loves it. Best polaroid camera on the market in my opinion.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really enjoy the game. I think it's detailed and is an easy game to get into. I think the game is great game to spend time and money on
1465414444|5.0|I've been a Blizzard fan since the old PC Warcraft days, and an on-and-off WoW subscriber since day one. I love the lore of Warcraft and although it has gotten pretty jumbled here and there, I think it's still a pretty interesting little saga.<br /><br />Pairing the Warcraft world with DK was just an awesome match. DK's Visual line is simply awesome for every book they put out. I haven't seen one that's really let me down yet. As with most of the DK line, this book is targeted for a younger audience, so even the kids can enjoy both the pictures and the text. However it's also extensive enough that adults will feel the tug of nostalgia.<br /><br />There are some errors in the book that will nag the most nit-picky readers, such as a Shaman shown wearing full Cenarion gear, or some title headers written in white on a white background, but for the most part, the book is very well done. The quality of the book is on par with other DK hardbacks - not as nice as the artbooks included with the Collector's Edition of Blizzard games, but the pictures are sharp, and the pages are glossy.<br /><br />If you follow the WoW art books and comics, there's probably not a lot of art that'll be new to you. The text is also a rehash of everything from the War of the Ancients (covered in Knaak's books) through Pandaria's release. You'll note that this does not cover the current content patches since Pandaria, so Garrosh is still running the Horde in this guide.<br /><br />If you're a Warcraft fan, it's definitely a well put-together book, worth picking up.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|She is hot...that's why i got it hahahah plot is wack she's the only real good thing about this crap move lol
B00CQTKGY8|3.0|Too simplistic.  18 more words required before submission is accepted by web site so here they come off the top
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|everything i wanted it to be.It's not as good as Lord Of The Rings... but I still liked the story
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|I bought this for my husband's HTC One because he had gotten used to the kickstand on his HTC Evo and wanted a case with a kickstand. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on one, so I got him this. He says he gets compliments on the case all the time. I deducted a star because I think the case is bent too far and slides a bit too far forward. It's not quite the perfect angle for watching shows. It's REALLY easy to pop this case on and off too, which is a plus for us, but not so much for someone who drops their phone all the time.
B00F0N61AU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and the auto-rip option is incredible. I would have just bought the digital downloads but she really wanted the hard case (probably so she could look at the pictures).
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie is funny and sad.  We get caught up in life and forget the ones we love.  They have great chemistry.
B0090SI582|5.0|This is a great movie. I thought with based on what I read that I may be disappointed, but it surpassed my expectations.
B0058SNKME|5.0|If you have problems with your legs.  Crocs are the shoes for you.  They are soft and are like walking on cushions.  I buy them in all colors to keep myself covered.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys are great musicians. This album is incredible. I bought the CD but with AutoRip was able to listen right away. It's excellent.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Good game but can be confusing what to do. Overall it was fun. It wasn't cheap though at 5 dollars.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|After the first (new) Superman movie i didn't really have high expectations with this one. It's is full of action and i think they cast it very well. I really enjoyed this movie
B003B02O0A|5.0|Classic John Grisham. Kept you in the story to the very end. Love stories of suspense and court action.  Great!!!
B005VPRGB0|5.0|good product, good quality for the price I paid, my son enjoy it so much, he is 8 years old.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I can not wait to see what happens next.  I will buy the new book as soon as it comes out.
B00BU9DXAY|3.0|I know it was only four dollars but I felt that for four dollars I should have gotten more pages of funny!!
B00FQ53NIA|1.0|This is by far the worst music spears has ever put out in her career. If you are an old fan of hers you will know what I mean when you listen to this album. \\"Work b****\\" has to be the worst radio single anyone has come out with in years. I can't listen to that song for more than 30 seconds without my ears starting to bleed
B00594XOZU|5.0|My kik on my Kindle works but wen I exit the screen to do something and then go back to it a white screen comes up. Can you please fix it thank you very much
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I love the zombie genre but this book simply moves too slow and struggled hard to hold my interest. I finally gave up about 3/4 in.
B000EULJLU|1.0|Album was wrapped brand new and didn't work !!! Started skipping at song 3 tried in multiple players , not pleased
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle's Home for Christmas is soothing to the spirit and a beautiful celebration to the season. I will listen to the &#34;Lord Prayer&#34; often after the season of Christmas is over.

B00EEDJHXA|4.0|A friend recommended this game and at first I thought it was a child's game, which it can be. I started playing and realized it takes strategy to play. I really enjoy it and think you will too!
B00GINENG0|5.0|There are no other nationalities that can pronunce hungarian the way like this little cat :) no matter what u say for him.

B009LDCXNY|2.0|i trusted Amazon to give me a good copy of any DVDs. but just like eBay, supernatural season 8 came with a badly FADED slipcover. i am very disappointed, i really want another copy that's not faded, that be great, but i really don't want to to deal with with all that shipping, but i can't believe it came badly faded, it looked like it was in the sun for a long time, i didn't expect amazon to sell something like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife's favorite game any free time and she's playing, she can't seem to put it down. Well at least it distracts her from asking me to  get some work done around the house. lol
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Its easy to setup and works like a charm. I was very happy with it. BTW don't depend on the sound from your PC for knowing how good it is.<br /><br />I recommend using headphones to hear yourself playing and not main speakers while using this device.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun great to play when u want to waist a little time yet challenging as well. Would recommend to others.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's probably the worst written book on the bookshelves. If you want to read porn, there has to be better trashy novels out there. This can't be the crown jewel.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Beautiful doll - at the time I ordered this Catty Noir could not be found in stores ANYWHERE. I've since seen it at Target and Wal-mart, but this is still a great value and Prime eligible and will make a wonderful Christmas gift from &#34;Santa&#34; for my Monster High loving youngest daughter :)
B000KJT8IG|1.0|It is true that this is a Blu-Ray and it does contain the described movie.  I bought this as the old DVD transfer I own is a terrible fuzzy/grainy mess.  Now I own a terrible fuzzy/grainy 1080p (Dolby Digital 2.0?!) version on Blu-Ray.  The Blu-Ray is no more in quality than the DVD.  100% waste of money.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|fun game, try to open slots in different ways,  Nice pass the time game/  3D match game.  Turning the cube in *real* space was fun

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really fun and challenging! The secret stage was really fun too! I am glad I purchased this app. Well worth the money!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It was a very good movie.<br />Lots of action and a very good plot.<br />I thought it was the best Bond movie...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a tough start, I really enjoyed it once I made it past the many characters initial stories. The ending made me sit in the quiet and ponder what would've happened to my life story had I made other choices...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fabulous story.  Marvelous characters.  A great read and adventure.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a terrific story.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Underrated!  As a former Comic Book Collector, and a huge fan of comic based movies... There's been a lot of trash and then mostly so-so, then a few great comic book movies. (Avengers, Iron Man 1 & 2, Batman (Christopher Nolan), X-Men: First Class, are just a few quick great examples that come to mind); And I think this movie should easily be placed in that short list of great comic book movies of late. It had an excellent storyline and to show that far in to the past of Superman lore by showing Krypton was an amazing thing to watch. Not to mention the breathtaking visuals... this is a good solid movie and you won't be disappointed. I was blown away!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I absolutely loved the first 2 books in this series, but unfortunately can not say the same about this book.  The plot wasn't as intriguing and without giving anything away, I didn't like the ending.  She killed off way too many characters unnecessarily.
0345528581|5.0|For anyone who has ever been discouraged by overpriced gyms or the high price of home health equipment, this is the book for you! There are so many exercises addressed in here, many of which are so simple! There are clear and concise instructions, as well as explanations as to HOW the exercises work. There is something for every level of fitness, from beginner to expert!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|brad pitt did a great job I enjoyed this movie amazing work a must buy in my opinion cant go wrong with this film

B008JFUR10|5.0|this movie is visually amazing overall it was not bad it had it's moment great fight scene and the cast was great also the storyline was not bad compare to transformer it didn't reach it
B005MLOKXA|3.0|It kind of lulls quite a bit, but the guest stars and Christine Baranski and Alan Cumming steal the show!
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|great box set and the price it was for I couldn't turn it down the film is amazing and looks amazing
1250038820|5.0|The choice of photos was excellent. Depicts NY the way it really is. The accompanying captions were creative and honest.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|amazing film the cast was amazing and the storyline which is based on true events was amazing I really enjoyed this movie
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love  this series when i first read it back  2011. I just 're read it again for a second  time and it  still had  me on the edge of my seat. This has got to be hands down one of my favorite books. I'm so ready  for the movies. They have  a lot  to live  up to. This  is not your typical love story ended. This was  real people and it was just truly an amazingly written book series. Congrats to you Suzanne Collins :)
B002LMV7TS|5.0|this is one of my favorite dr. seuss movies the cast was great jim carey did an amazing job in my opinion playing the Grinch great family movie and for the holidays.

B00DWZHTRW|5.0|this film turned out to be great for me the cast was great storyline amazing never expected the ending and you have james franco brother in the film
B000FCK65W|5.0|great read, old time classic, how hard life was back then makes you realize how hard your parents and grandparents had to work just to survive
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|good film I enjoyed it storyline was actually great the ending is where people hated it but it does not make the film bad
B005DZMODI|5.0|If I could, I would assign more stars.  Many of the pieces are presented in a fresh way.  I play this so much, my husband is tired of it.  Forget ear buds; it ain't the same.
B009LFVV6M|5.0|this film was great it really did have a great storyline and the ending was amazing to me a must buy for couples
B00942G4UA|5.0|Great facts. Very informative documentary. This one will really open your eyes to what we all are really eating and the methods of producing food in USA today. Hope you have a strong stomach.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Play th I s game it's a lot of fun just slightly frustrating also takes forever .for the energy to recharge<br />But it's still one of the best games on here
B001MKQS4O|5.0|I really learned a lot about one of my favorite writers, not just he is Gay but he is also a great humanitarian with a great mind too. A must see for all Capote fans as well as others who really want to know Truman Copote for what he really is...
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are great!  Love cooking with them.  I like the rest that is on them so I don't get my counter top all gross.  Would buy again in a heartbeat!  In fact, I'm buying some for my mother in law for Christmas, since she seemed jealous of them :)  The seem like a good quality and hold up in the dishwasher well!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love Pintrest!! It is so awesome, fun and interesting. This app works great on my kindle fire. I am so glad that it is available.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I bought this item as a Christmas present for a friend of mine! They love they Predator movies so I am sure they will enjoy this gift.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Mesmerizing story.......have read all of their novels and most of their individual works.  This one rates up with Still Life With Crows and the Relic as my favorites........
0340364777|4.0|This book was a gift for a friend! I know she loves this particular author, and she requested I buy her this book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Wow kik is just so cool talking to friends  so much fun!!you should get tis app because you will really like it and it's free come on so get I ad try it hope you have fun!!

0804161380|5.0|just a great item to have for any zelda enthusiest. even if you dont ever use them for a play thru they just look amazing and the bookmark is awsome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was my first John Green book and I was pleasantly surprised. It was the type of book you can connect with in many different ways. John Green finds a way to make this book relate to everyone. Be prepared to cry.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is certainly fast paced and the author does do a good job with trying to keep the readers attention although the premise is kind of shaky for me.
B0093WVND4|5.0|My 4 year old son loved this book so much. We read the whole thing in two sittings and he still talks about it.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Honestly its a good sharpener but, doesn't have a very good ceramic sharpener. I would Recommend the  Lansky sharpener with the white ceramic. The carbide feels better when running knives through and the ceramic gives it a finer edge than Smith's PP1. The lansky also features a ceramic serrated sharpener.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is my favorite show!  It is a TV based show so language and such is acceptable.  Very enjoyable show...  interesting learning about the 'biker' culture.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|It's simple I LOOOOVVVVVE THE TWILIGHT SAGA .I LOVE ACTRESS KRISTEN STEWART. ROBERT PATTINSON ,TAYLOR LAUTNER and the ENTIRE CAST. Each and every one played there part beautifully and it seems like you are in this never never land. I am not a young person but I really enjoyed the books and the movie. So I think it's a movie for teenagers and adults of all ages.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|The book is an easy read but it is filled with inaccurate information. One small example is on Barbara Streisand, she states that Streisand was the only singer in her family when both her mother and sister sing as well. Also she quotes Streisand's high school guidance counselor who  uses karaem Abdul Jabar in a quote yet,he is younger than Streisand and was not a professional athlete when she was a high school student. I could go on with the errors and mis truths Grout states as fact however, the reader needs to keep in mind that Grout is not an expert in any area and should read her book as fiction and just for fun.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This is a cool game that is really fun to play but there are 3 faults to it<br />1. You have to wait for your characters to recharge.<br />2. After a while the computer gets really hard<br />3.you never get enough money to buy strong people like superman<br />But don't let this list stop you from  getting it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|there is alot of levels and the only bad thing is that if you want the full version its 3 dollars
B003V4ASV8|5.0|A very comprehensive portrait of the real life in North Korea. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in knowing about the social dynamics in NK.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a great book.One of the best I have ever read.  I would recommend it to any one . LOVED IT
0321934318|5.0|As a somewhat advanced amateur photographer, Kelby's style and explanations are perfectly suited to my needs.  I've been working with Lightroom since it first came out and I've purchased one of his books for an earlier release of Lightroom.  Yet I find this new book very helpful in learning about the latest features of LR 5 and, even, to discover features of previous versions of Lightroom that I did not know about..<br /><br />Over the years I've read other authors books on Lightroom but either they were too complex or discussed issues that did not pertain to an amateur enthusiast.  This book would be excellent for beginners and, as described above, is also good for experienced Lightroom users to learn about new features.  Kelby's irreverent style keeps the instructions entertaining.  Highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If I had known the outcome I would not have wasted my time on these books.  I loved the first two books they were amazing and I read them quickly.  This book boring and I took over 3 weeks to read it!  If you love the other books just stop<br />now and don't waste your time or money<br />On this book!  I will not see the movie now!  This<br />Book should have waited until after the release of the movie because I have a feeling lots of people will<br />Change their minds about the series!  I really loved the first two!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|It was great to be reacquainted with Bridget!  Her latest adventures had me laughing and crying. So mAny of her struggles and observations rang true for me. Hope there's more to come!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie over all. Good story and pretty good acting. Can't wait to watch the second movie once it comes out on Amazon Prime.
B0071R43MG|5.0|As always his performance was brilliant, The 3D is not wow! but is OK for the money I paid. Thank you
1439199388|3.0|I find books written by journalists ineffectual - they typically assemble info from others (here, scientists or people involved at various title in the field) into what they probably consider a well-prepared &#34;cake&#34; but which tends toward sensation/impressing the reader and usually lacks new insight or rigor (often even a coherent line of reasoning). They should limit themselves to reporting news or stories, which is their job and in which (if good) they are competent. This book makes no exception. However at least the menu is complete (I believe that more or less all has been said on the subject is present inthe book) and the reader is free to pick up his preferred course. As an obvious paranthetical note, &#34;parassitism&#34; can be metaphorically used also for this kind of journalistic books.
0811870413|5.0|Excellent! Chad Robertson shows you step by step how to make his wonderful bread. This book needs to be read in detail do not skip over details.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I had to force myself to finish this book. I can not imagine what about this book appealed to anyone. Theo existed in a suicidal drugged out funk.I'm sorry I wasted my time on it. And I do mean TIME it was blah blah,blah on and on.
140006922X|5.0|You need to read this book with an open and critical mind. This book is not for everyone but I found it a very interesting approach to showing Jesus as we never saw him before.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Really great family movie we love watching this with all of us together my 11 year old my 2 year old and my 7 month old!  Great movie good job Sony.
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|Annoying and trite.  No mature woman having been married to a high flying lawyer would act in such an infantile manner.  One of the very few books I could not bear to finish and threw in down in disgust.  It deserves no star ratings what-so-ever.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is exactly what I was wanting from the series!!! I felt like the fourth title had dragged on a bit, but this definitely satisfied my need for action! Half way through, I hit that point in reading that I was furiously flipping through the pages, muttering &#34;Oh my GOD!&#34; on the bus.
B00ESF2772|5.0|This is such a great book for a new reader.  Fun, funny and your kid will do many pages better than you do. You will love it
B008YE9226|5.0|One of the few books I stared reading before bed and finished as the sun was coming up. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a gripping read
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|Easily the best VG soundtrack I've ever listened to. It elevates an already amazing game. There is so much power in subtlety and  nuance.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Despite what sounds like a sad story, this tale is uplifting and an inspiration on multiple levels.  It's also a really fascinating love story with gravitas...
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|Loved almost all the songs, it has a balance between electronic and cool kind-of ballads. They even mixed well the album between electronic vocals and cool clear Spears' vocals. I liked it!
B0085YAGMA|5.0|I laughed untill it hurt and I watched it before years ago and still its that funny.  This is orders of magnitude better than the newer version in my opinion.  The actors I had never heard of but were really believable as if the situations happening in this movie were actually happening to them.  Very glad I now own this film.
0553801473|3.0|I would have rather seen more on the existing characters fans of the series know and love. It seems like Martin felt like he HAD to make new characters to make Dance a big book. It is good but a little disappointing given how long we had to wait for it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nikola Tesla is the man! More people need to know how great of a man he was, and not for money, but for the future of mankind. This genius is responsible for more technology and theories than anyone really understands.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|I love being able to see my new gold iphone 5S. The rubber bumper gives me more confidence when holding it. I had a hard plastic case, but I kept feeling like I would drop the phone too easily.
1451624468|5.0|Great book from a knowledgeable person. Enjoyed his take on the philosophical and physics side of things. A little tongue and cheek at times but a scientific take that I appreciate.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This bag fits my camera perfectly and the side pockets are great for storing cords, memory cards, etc. I look forward to traveling with this camera bag as it is lightweight and makes me feel secure knowing my camera is safe in there. I highly recommend this bag for anyone who wants to bring their camera along and all the necessary accessories in one convenient place.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|One of my all time favorite novels. Funny, imaginative, ironic, thoughtful, and even more more relevant now than when it was published. Near perfect science fiction novel. If you have seen the Ridley Scott movie - which was also excellent - don't make the mistake of thinking you know what is in the novel. Much of the &#34;meat&#34; of the novel had to be cut from the screenplay to make a coherent film. Read the novel please.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|Starts out witty and you become somewhat curious about the story. Then it loses you with too much preaching about the issue of animal rights.<br />Skips around chronologically till you are dizzy. Soon you don't care about the characters very  much and find them too eccentric and misguided.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins writes in a clear, literalist fashion about a subject most people discuss using fact obscuring deepities. Read this book please.<br /><br />Not a fan of Dawkins? For a more philosophically erudite, and more polite, discussion, check out Daniel C. Dennett. Dawkins is the better scientist, but often Dennett is the better debater and addresses &#34;philosophical&#34; questions with a bit more consideration.
B008JFURII|5.0|I thought that Red2 was even better than Red!! There was a lot of action and comedy and a lot of shoot em up!!
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This is one of my favorites. Anything from Fire Maple Games is good. They are the best adventure games I have  played. Hope to see more.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Much needed information, and very well written.  Have not quite finished  reading yet, but the information in this book can change your health and your life!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|The ideas are intriguing and have reach all aspects of life.  Especially like what can be used in teaching with regard to boosting performances on tests.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Excellent movie.  It shows what's going in a German U-Boat.  It was definitely worth the time.  Makes you happy you were not on a German U-boat.
0240815807|5.0|Amazing book, chalked full of extremely useful tips and insights.  I've been writing/mixing/producing for some time now, and while I've always felt my productions were very good, they always seem fall just shy of professional.  I have been looking for a resource to help me bring my music to that professional level, and this book contains everything I need to get it there (the rest is up to me!).  The quick summaries at the end of each chapter are extremely helpful for going back and referencing things you've already read.  If you're interested in bringing your mixes or music up to a professional level, this is your book!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|One of the best things on tv ever! Bought as a gift, but he will love it. Super funny show.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great app to keep by the bedside. I like all the info on display. My only suggestion would be to make the info display larger.  Overall I like this app.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Finally out for Android. Thanks Warner Brothers. This game is great if hooked up to your console. When you get it make an account it definitely helps.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very hard to put down. Awesome game to have to pass time. Just don't let it consume your life lol
B009YMKL4A|5.0|Definitely the best of the X-men movies.  Great to see the origins of Professor X, Magneto, Beast and others etc
B007VDN1PA|4.0|It doesn't handle half-frame slides very well, which I should have expected,  but regular 35mm slides are reproduced nicely.<br /><br />I'm quite satisfied wit this Scanner, since I can now go back to my early pics and get copies of my &#34;Kodachrome golden oldies&#34;, though most of my Ektachrome slides have lost their colour, and are no longer retrievable.
B00AZQGZVM|5.0|K.K. Slider is just plain cool. I can still remember the first time I played Animal Crossing on the GameCube and saw the little dude sitting there by himself, telling me to sit back while he played some rad riffs. Sadly, there aren't any real K.K. Slider albums out there to buy, but there is this little plush of him! There have been several stuffed K.K. Sliders over the years, and I think this is one of the best.<br /><br />K.K. stands at about 7 inches tall and is super soft. This is definitely a toy that a young child could cuddle with for bed time, as I'm sure my daughter will when she opens him up in just a few weeks. It's hard to get the look of K.K. Slider wrong, given how basic his design is, and he translates to plush form here perfectly. The eyebrows, the little mellow smile, the crossed legs...you know this is! He's also sitting on a little brown cushion, which works surprisingly well. I only had to adjust it a little bit to get him to sit up on his own. The guitar looks as good as a stuffed guitar in this scale can get, with the tuners being slightly misshapen. It's not a big deal though.<br /><br />K.K.'s nose is made of a hard plastic, while his eyes are sewn. Aside from the nose, there's really nothing to watch out for if you're giving this to a young kid (and even then, the nose is going to take a lot of work to remove). This stuffed K.K. Slider is a must for any fans of the game, and we'll definitely be getting the new DJ one too! The only thing that could make this toy better is if it had a sound feature and maybe if he was showing his teeth like he does when he sings. I always thought it was funny when he showed his teeth for some reason.<br /><br />Don't wait, buy one today before he sells out!<br /><br />...wait, would K.K. ever sell out? He seems like more of an indie kinda guy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it's very entertaining!!!! It's an addicting game. As soon as I get home I get on my kindle and play it!!!
B000083C49|5.0|Arrived on time and in great condition.  Of all the Star Trek movies featuring the original crew, this movie was by far and away the best one!!!
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|Fun movie found the pacing to be a flaw. Overall i recommend. Good blu ray PQ. Not a movie I will rewatch frequently.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game it is very addictive. Hard to put down. I find myself playing it all day. Get it you won't be disappointed.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Excellent game. Lots of fun. Recommended for a rainy day. Kills the boredom. A delightfully fun filled game for all ages.
B009APMNB0|5.0|I love my ColorMunki Smile. X-Rite did the right thing with this product. They allowed me to calibrate all the devices in my house without trying to charge me for each product I own as the main competitor does. I was able to do my laptop, my wife's laptop. The 27&#34; screen we plug into, and even the 60&#34; plasma TV. and WOW they all benefit from it. Having a consistent experience across all our displays and also printed material has made life much nicer. And for Xmas cards it has reduced the annoyance when pictures look great on the screen, but not as good on print!
B00062PN6I|5.0|These headphones are an amazing deal for the price. Sound quality is quite balanced, allowing a full range of highs and lows to come through clearly and crisply, even at high volume. The headphones fit somewhat awkwardly on my head, but that is easy to overlook considering I only paid $10 for them. I take them outdoors and in the rain with no fear because I can just order a new pair if they break. The Behringer HPM1000 is the essential, basic headphones for anyone.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Great product.  Worked exactly as advertised.  Clear images on 2 different screens.  Used on a video wall at a Trade Show and very pleased with the product
B004GJYROG|5.0|I bought this because my fiance is a huge Micheal Jordan fan and we always talk about how we watched it when we were little. You're never to old to recreate the good old times.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A convincing tale of the potential dark side of big social media. Authentic, compelling dialogue, well executed portrayal of the current tech setting and people. The ending wrapped up too fast; after taking time to develop some complex and brainy characters in a mesmerizing locale (GooglePlex on steroids) there should have been more of a drawn out battle of wills and power. Just when you are getting ready for some ongoing edgy plot development, the story abruptly ends.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This is such a cute movie! I actually haven't seen it for years. I always used to watch it with my mom and am now getting it for her for Christmas! She's going to be so excited!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a fan of King but not a blind loyalist, for example I gave up on Liseys Story and didn't care for Bag of Bones, but loved Duma Key and Under the Dome (even with the weak ending). Doctor Sleep was fantastic, a much faster paced, less prosaic work than traditional King novels. And it's really cool to find out what happened to Danny Torrance. Well worth it!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This was an incredibly enjoyable and accessible film of &#34;Much Ado About Nothing,&#34; performed by a great ensemble cast in pitch perfect comedic and dramatic form. It's that simple. Watch it, enjoy it, and watch it again.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|I am a Michael Connelly fan, but this one was painful to me. My rating reflects my disappointment in an otherwise exemplary series.The plot seems so thin, that much of the book is page-filling pulp. It should have been a short story. I skipped many pages.<br />In his defense, I suppose that all successful authors must succumb to the pressure to get something on paper.<br />Yet, there is real value in this book! It well displays the corruption in our legal system. But there are many capable authors on that bandstand.<br />Mike, you are capable of real classics, e.g. &#34;Black Box&#34;. I do not wish to mourn your standards of excellence, nor your characters, who have become like family to me.<br />Remember what happened when James Michener hired ghost writers?
0060899220|5.0|I'm a fan of Anthony Bourdain's exploits on cable TV and this book provided additional insight into an interesting personality ... having spent time in a kitchen, I was able to visualize the atmosphere and chaos ... highly recommended!
B00A757EFW|3.0|Downloaded this for the grandkids to play on my kindle.  So they played more so than me. I've played Pac Man before so Im sure it was ok
B0025HM13K|5.0|Great series - completely opposite from the &#34;Annoying Housewives&#34; or &#34;Dancing with Washed Up Stars&#34; type shows that have taken over regular TV.  The series is actually better than the later Terminator movies and really adds to the Terminator story overall.<br /><br />It is a shame that it was cancelled, but definitely worth watching.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun. I like the pups! Wish it were a little more fast paced but overall a  nice game. Thumbs up!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another good Grisham book! Thoroughly enjoyed it and actually read rather quickly. I found myself totally absorbed as it was very enjoyable reading.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game. Hate in-game purchasing. I would rather pay for a game and get all the content than play a &quot;free&quot; game that you have to purchase anything good. Other than that it's fun.
B002N57KG2|1.0|A lame excuse for a film production.  A waste of time. Too bad the producer was so immature. Do not waste time viewing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Too addicting<br />Got hooked on this game during checking out games on Facebook. Fell in love big time.  Hooked on this
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Such great promise.  Such poor delivery.  You can see the actors struggling to be professional and give good performances, but the characters come off as stiff.  Third rate CGI and CGI in all the most inappropriate places. Nice try, but no joy.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Excellent bag. Sturdy, comfortable, and spacious. Even when loaded to the gills for my long grad school days, it doesn't feel like much of a burden when it's on my back.
B000056K04|5.0|Now, andy DMB CD is going to be great in my opinion. This one including. Bought it for my wife and she loved it. CDs are getting to be a thing of the past, so get them while you can. Good music, great price!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this cd & realized I liked more songs than what was played on the radio. I keep the cd in my car so that I can listen to it when I can't find anything on the radio or just because.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|My first Gladwell book! Captivating and compelling. Perhaps pointing the way to a better future for modern society. He's also not saying anything new. The Bible has been teaching us this lesson for thousands of years. Maybe now that the research is proving it's veracity we'll start listening. Great read!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Classic, left me wanting more, I hope the 14th Mitch Rapp gets published posthumously in honor of Flynn. Just when you thought he couldn't develop Rapp's character further, he does. I for one will sincerely miss his books.
B0081336FO|5.0|As good if not better than Season 1.  Love the story line can't wait for Season3 to<br />find out what happens.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great movie!  Action-packed, keeps you guessing, and good acting by Jennifer Lawrence.  I can't wait to see the second one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love too the book but the ending was I hard because a lot of people die and especially because everybody lost
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Great storyline, interesting characters.  Beautiful setting in Paris.  Owen Wilson is perfectly cast.  Great performances by Michael Sheen, Rachel McAdams, and others.  Woody Allen has done it again!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The movie did not have a LOT of the details the book had. I absolutely loved the book and was pretty disappointed that the movie didn't Go into detail on some very specific important details for the story line. I bought the movie so my husband could share my excitement in The book and found that I had to explaina lot to him so he understood what was really going on. It was hard to enjoy it.

B0083Q4NCO|4.0|Ishmael Beah's story really touched my heart.  I think this is an extremely good book that teaches others of the tragic lives of others in different countries.  War is a serious issue and we are quite blessed not to experience such tragedy and fall to the fate of becoming child soldiers here in the US.  Hearing the story from a child soldier himself and how he overcame the tragedy really helps you get an understanding of violence of war in other places and the tolls it takes.  It completely changes a person, losing their family and friends, killing to survive, their way of thinking and actions completely change.  Ishmael Beah explains exactly how it changed him, and what it took for him to recover from it all.  Programs like UNICEF and the warm good hearts of those out there are what save these children.  You notice its mostly boys that suffer to this fate, how it's a masculinity thing.  This is a great book and I recommend it to other students learning about and interested in globalization, feminism or what goes on in other parts of the world.

B008602KQI|3.0|This movie is good and enjoyable to watch (good pace and no objectionable plot flaws), but not great (4 stars) and not a classic for me (5 stars. The comments by others rating this a 3 star seem accurate and give more information.  I had read the books so the story did not seem confusing.
B004PYWRQC|4.0|Great movie.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I think this is one of the most under rated movies of Johnny Depp.  Much better than the cheesy pirate themed content.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I laughed. I cried. I ate a whole gallon of ice cream.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant here and carries herself on the same platform as the rest of her all star cast. Bradley Cooper sells the awkward chemistry between them well. Absolutely worth checking out.
0316055433|5.0|long but always satisfying novel, worth all the time it requires. the characters repay your absorption in them. the plot keeps you going.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!  Lots of twists and turns.  There are many secrets, and each overlaps and influences the other secrets.  I had to re-read several parts to fully appreciate them.
0385537131|5.0|I thought A TIME TO KILL  was a terrrific book and this is a worthy sequel, despite the passage of many years and many books.  It takes a little while to get going and to re-introduce all of the characters from the first book but Grisham gets that out of the way pretty quickly and then it's off to the races with a totally different legal issue and the accompanying racial ones.  Grisham is a master of providing plenty of detail to set the scene and create full-bodied characters.  As he approaches the courtroom denoument, he makes it impossible to put the book down.  Then, when all the action is over, he adds an O. Henry-type ending......for a little extra oomph.<br /><br />Excellent book, quick read and highly recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have deliberately not read this series due to all the hype. So, the trilogy on sale for under 8 bucks....ok, I give. I really had low expectations. The best part of the saga isn't the sex. While for the most part it's all well and good, the sex isn't the attraction. It's the characters. I actually liked them and getting to know them. I wanted even more of the dialogue back and forth. I was thoroughly entertained and want more. Isn't that what the book is about after all?
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a family member and they loved it. They watch this movie over and over.

B002FU42NE|5.0|This is one of the greatest statements in 90s alternative history. I can feel so much when I listen to this album, the loss of Brandon Lee, the coldness of the film, memories of the dark 90s, an entire sub cultural movement, and so far the last great rock and roll movement. There is so much going on in this album but yet it is so cohesive. I feel like this entire album was written for Brandon Lee, what a way to send him off. I can't imagine the pain and hurt his family feels. He was a great loss to our generation, one that'll remember him with dignity and grace. A great album! 5 stars!! This album just about sums up the alternative grunge rock movement of the 90s. No movement of today (2000s) even comes close. The grittiness, the madness, darkness, grunginess, anger, sadness, rawness, aggression...they just don't make em like this anymore
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game its fun and easy yet challenging at the same time and I can't get enough of it.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a book which strives for Greatness.<br /><br />In most respects, it actually succeeds.<br /><br />Author David Mitchell proves himself to be a good storyteller,  but even more importantly, Mitchell demonstrates  he is a great commander of the English language.<br /><br />The book consists of six (almost) entirely separate stories - three take place in the past, one is contemporary (circa 2012), and two are located at different times and places in an increasingly dystopian future.<br /><br />Each story stands by itself as an eminently readable short. The stories and characters are all quite distinct from one another, each possessing  its own unique rhythm and sound.<br /><br />When you read them all together, it gradually dawns on you - this author is a linguistic virtuoso; Mitchell is able to use language in a way that convincingly makes you believe you are hearing the voices of, respectively:<br /><br />- Mid-nineteenth century upper-middle class sea-voyaging Anglo-American Man.<br />- Dissipated Lost Generation English Remittance Man.<br />-1970's California feminist investigative Reporter Person.<br />- Contemporary, aging, London-based, educated-but-business-and-personal-life Failure Man.<br />- A slave-clone from a future neocorporate Greater Korean Empire.<br />- A degenerated descendant of a fallen American civilization in post-apocalyptic Hawaii.<br /><br />For these reasons alone, I would recommend you read this book...<br /><br />but there are other reasons as well...<br /><br />The author tries taking on big philosophical and metaphysical issues - endless cycles of karma, sin, death, rebirth, and redemption for the individual, set against an ever changing social context of greed, lust, class and racial conflict, and the resulting environmental and ultimately spiritual degradation which ensues.<br /><br />In the book, there are subtle hints that the characters in the successive stories are interconnected, somehow - but the precise nature ofthat connection never became apparent to me, until I watched the movie and saw Tom Hanks and Halle Berry (and several others) reappearing in different guises and relationships to one another in the successive stories.<br /><br />But God help the poor soul whose first introduction to Cloud Atlas is the movie.<br /><br />For those of us who read the book first, the movie is visually impressive, has some good performances, and can be useful as a value-added clarifier of authorial intent (though Hollywood does take its share of liberties with the original text). On the other hand, being exposed to the theatrical version first would have to make the project seem incomprehensible to the uninitiated.<br /><br />Read the book BEFORE you watch the movie!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was tragically beautiful. It was written so wonderfully. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the book.

B0049U4NQO|5.0|I have loved this series from the very beginning and have followed it faithfully.  It has been a fine ride, Alex Ryder, and worth every minute I have spent with you (which is quite a compliment when you consider how many pages are in each book!).<br /><br />In this last installment, Alex is absolutely fed up with MI6.  He's been an unwilling spy at the expense of his childhood, but he is determined to enjoy being a teenager.  Once again, though, he's roped into an espionage game that is way above his head.  He is sent to the far East to pose as a schoolboy.  He seems to hate everything about this new mission and, yet, he pursues it with the most passion I've seen yet.  As Alex is getting more mature, more dangerous and more grown up, so are the villains.  This one seemed impossible to beat.  The reader also gets to see much more of Jack in this book than every before.  It made their situation more dire to see the devotion between the two of them.<br /><br />The pages just flip themselves, so eager was I find out what happened next.  This book did my time, and the series, justice.  My biggest wish is that Horowitz would take Alex into adulthood and launch a new generation of 'James Bond' era books.  I would love for Alex to continue!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I got this in lieu of a couple cords I would have had to get to connect my MacBook Pro to my TV because I thought it'd be easier to have something wireless. Have had a lot of difficulty with it so far.. I've basically had to go through the entire setup process every time I want to use it, and sometimes in the middle of using it if it's been on for a long block of time. When it does work, however, it works well, especially for Netflix, which is what I primarily use it for anyway. Hoping that the kinks will get worked out in the near future and that more popular apps will jump on board.
B00GIXY4M8|1.0|I wanted so badly to like this movie and say that it was great, but I can't. It's not so much of what the movie was, but what it could have been. I never thought I would say this but its time for a wolverine reboot, someone needs to do this legendary character justice.

B003BV8I3Q|5.0|I never knew much about Malcolm X so this made for interesting viewing.  From all appearances Denzel Washington did a fantastic job and I couldn't help but like the beginning of the movie with Spike Lee and Denzel in their zoot suits.  On the more serious side I did a good idea of who Malcolm X was and who he was becomming had he not been killed.
1455521310|2.0|I've read a few reviews here, and I'd like to respond to the people who say you should read the earlier books, as well.  This is the first of this series I've read, and I think he did a good job of referencing the backstory, but not making anything dependent upon it.<br /><br />There are four main things I really disliked about this book.<br /><br />The first is the author's technique of being too cute.  Instead of letting the mystery unfold in a natural way, he would do things like have the narrator deliberately withhold information. \\"Somebody texted something\\".  The narrator would say that someone was doing something, but pointedly not say what it was.  I consider that really sloppy writing, and very irritating, and it put me in a bad mood, to the point that I was looking for faults after that had occurred three or four times.<br /><br />The second thing that I found really dismaying was how the whole crux of the story revolved around being friends with a computer genius that in a few minutes or hours could crack into anything anywhere, and who is available at the drop of a hat for however long they want to use him.  That is completely unrealistic.  It's up there with having superman come in and bend the Bad Guys gun barrels into a U.  [Reference to 1950s TV, if it's before your time.]<br /><br />The third thing I disliked was the dialogue.  It was the kind of dialog you would see inked into an adventure comic book.<br /><br />The fourth thing is how very unlikely it is that the opening scene would really happen - that any official agency would send that kind of cargo across hostile territory in the care of one person, armed as poorly as this was purported to be.  I could go on about the other outrageous plot holes, from officials conveniently changing their minds, with no evidence, to technical exploits that belong in an Austin Powers flick, but I get tired just thinking about it. Not to mention the double-talk revisionist history of the Iran-Contra affair that conveniently left out a lot of embarrassing but crucial details, like the fact that the whole point was to bribe the Iranians into keeping the American hostages until Reagan was inaugurated.onveniently left out a lot of embarrassing but crucial details, like the fact that the whole point was to bribe the Iranians into keeping the American hostages until Reagan was inaugurated.

B000FBJHT4|5.0|This book has caused me to look at UFOs differently. It is hard not to believe that a UFO crashed at Roswell after reading it. Corso's relationships with presidents and generals, coupled with his position in charge of research and development for the US Army, makes him appear to be a credible witness as he describes the cover-up at Roswell, producing tons of supporting information, while describing the benefits that emerged from reverse engineering parts of the alien spacecraft.

B0099Y2MYK|3.0|Without being pretentious, in the end this show is addictive (like any soap opera) yet is lacking in certain elements of reality that are annoying. I get it, it is TV and compared to everything else out there this is well done. However, how many deaths realistically happen in a family? Why is it that TV shows have to keep going with a continuous plot for four seasons? Why can't the story pick up later in life where some characters are absent instead of adjusting the entire storyline by causing tragedy? Sure, a certain amount of drama has to be created with the roller coaster of tragedy and happiness, but in the end I'm a bit weary of 3 seasons of bi polar madness and am moving on...

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|If religion were simply a private affair providing consolation, guidance to one's life, and hope for eternal existence; or it were kept within the circles of like-minded followers, this book wouldn't have been necessary. While several religions exist with focusing on the personal spiritual needs and not on the dispersion of the Supreme Being's presumed wish (see Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and to some degree perhaps Buddhism), many of today's major religions advocate their own belief systems as the only praiseworthy ones. On the small scale the result is proselytizing but on the large scale the consequences can culminate in worldwide religious violence--a key menace of our days. Therefore, I consider Dawkins' book timely and of extreme importance.<br /><br />Although Richard Dawkins has a theoretical aversion to the idea of supernatural power itself, his main vexation and the reason for writing this book seem to be his concern about the spill-over of religious zeal from the personal level or domains of small groups to the global scene. When a handful of major religions with close to a billion members and tremendous destructive technology at hand face off against each other ready to fight for their one and only true way of life, the question comes naturally: is this for real? Is scoring brownie points with a never seen supreme judge or the promise of various heavens worth the risk of exterminating life that came about by the grace of a yet unknown and therefore mysterious force or process? Does it really matter that much whether the circumstances that brought us together on planet Earth came from this or that god or simply from the physical reality of the Universe?<br /><br />Although these questions seem important to religious people, for an agnostic or a forbearing atheist they could be ignored altogether. Unfortunately, certain religions leave the door open for extreme interpretations of the above questions and thus allow the sprouting of groups that would stop at nothing to establish the supremacy of their world view. This is why staunch atheists have declared war on religion and this is why even agnostics and less hardcore atheists should join forces with them.<br /><br />To his credit, Dawkins discusses that staunch atheists may seem to fall into the same class as the religious fanatics because of their readiness to pick any fight to eliminate irrational thinking. However, he draws an important distinction between religious extremists and \\"hell-bent\\" atheists, like himself: although their allegiance to the cause is very similar to religious devotees, atheists would never resort to violence in the name of \\"atheism.\\" Can we say the same about religions that produced the crusades, the inquisition, the murderous conversion of natives to Christianity, the recent religious hostilities between Christians fractions in Ireland, between Muslims and Hindus in India, or, hard as it is to believe, but recent deadly collisions between Buddhists and Muslims in a few Asian countries?<br /><br />Dawkins classifies people into seven incremental categories from unconditionally religious to absolute atheist. Surprisingly for me, in this ranking he places himself in the sixth, and not the seventh category: a god may exist with a very low, but not zero probability. He never explains why, as an atheist, he would assign any likelihood at tall to the existence of god. Is it possible that, in the face of emerging statistical views of reality reflected in both thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, he cannot justify making an absolute statement? Indeed, at one point in the book he calls god a scientific hypothesis and this may hint at the answer to his surprising self-categorization.<br /><br />I am aware of all the controversy that this book has generated. For one, I mostly enjoyed Dawkins' reasoning about religion based on scientific modus operandi, that is, reproducible observations and testable predictions. He expanded the Darwinist principle of gradual development by natural selection from biology all the way to the social sphere including culture and spirituality. In a section on \\"memes\\" he acquaints the reader with the elemental unit of \\"social norms,\\" such as culture, spirituality, and expected behavior. It is not an easy notion to grasp and the book doesn't have room for in-depth scrutiny of this relatively obscure new field. Although the concept is not generally accepted in social sciences, memes seem to fit in Dawkins' Darwinist approach: they follow certain rules of genetic inheritance although with far less fidelity than genes do. Dawkins goes on to suggest several religious memes that increased the survival likelihood of religions such as the promise of eternal life (who wouldn't go for that?), eliminating blasphemy (eradicate the opposition!), and the notion that to understand certain theses of religion may destroy the theses itself (see the virgin delivery), etc.<br /><br />Dawkins addresses several lines of arguments for the existence of god starting with Thomas Aquinas's five aposteriory \\"proofs.\\" Then, he moves through the ontological argument based on the notion that \\"nonexistence\\" is less perfect than \\"existence.\\" After several more stops he finally arrives at Stephen Unwin's application of Bayesian probability theorem with an apparent 95% likelihood that god exists. I particularly enjoyed the way he discounted Pascal's Wager, a presumed argument for a revengeful Christian God that I heard more than once in real life debates. In Dawkins' opinion, this wager promotes a \\"feigned\\" belief based on practicality as opposed to a genuine trust in god. Here he aptly refers to his good friend's, Douglas Adams' book, the Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Adams' fitting humor should secure at least a faint smile even from the most religious readers.<br /><br />One interesting insight into how religions may have evolved is the so-called \\"Cargo Cult\\" of a few South Pacific islands. On those islandsa peculiar belief system developed and evolved within one generation, as if a gene with extreme survival value would have taken over the population. What survival benefit could have this cult offered to its followers to spread out so fast? Dawkins doesn't attempt to give an answer. Nonetheless, the brief history of the Cargo Cult is one of many thought-provoking sections of the book.<br /><br />Dawkins' ultimate intent is to reveal the \\"king's clothing\\" on religions in general. However large sections of the book are directed specifically at Christianity with much less scrutiny of Islam and Judaism, minimal references to Buddhism and none to Hinduism. He offers critical review of various Christian religious claims and practices including moral superiority, the power of prayer, the value of blind faith, belief as source of happiness, etc. He even ventures into well-deserved critical interpretations of selected chapters of the Bible. Dawkins treats the horrific events of the Old Testament with particular harshness, but he also finds plenty of objectionable teachings in the New Testament. Among the most disturbing Christian dogmas with great impact on society, Dawkins discusses its sanctimonious stand against abortion while accepting and even encouraging the killing of fully developed human beings in various situations such as \\"just\\" wars. (I can't help reflecting here on the latest such \\"just war\\" approved by masses, although not all, of the American religious community, including the Born-again Christian President. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, having nothing to do with the American victims of 9/11, were killed in that war, the infamous Operation Iraqi Freedom.)<br /><br />On the surface, the book seems to have a distinctive flavor of anti-Christianity for which the author has received a lot of flak. Christian scholars have discounted the book as the failed attempt of an amateur with no theological background to explain Christianity. Indeed, well read as Dawkins is, he cannot compete with those who spend much of their lives on studying the almost impenetrable lattice of various Christian texts. However, most of such critics have missed Dawkins' point. He never claimed to offer a critical review of the itty-bitty details of Christianity. Rather, he attempted to discredit the foundation of all religions since their basic premises are untenable in the face of observational experience and deduction, that is science. Despite claims to the opposite, the book is not any more anti-Christian than it is anti-Buddhist or anti-Bahá'i. Dawkins simply uses the religion he knows the best as an example to dissect religion in general.<br /><br />I do see however an inherent weakness in Dawkins' emphasis on the Abrahamic religions. With this approach he introduces a certain imbalance to the narrative and thus dilutes the intended main message which is arguing against the existence of \\"supernatural power\\" using scientific deliberation. At any rate, what is the point of getting into a dispute over Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac and other Biblical nightmares when the author considers the very existence of god little more than a fidget of overactive imagination or worse, a deliberate attempt to control people's mind?<br /><br />Does religion enjoy undeserved respect in today's societies? Dawkins and my personal experience have convinced me that in it does. Perhaps the most obvious attempt to keep a well-regarded place for religion in society is NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magistaria), a proposition that acknowledges the role of science in the \\"empirical realm\\" but reserves the ultimate meaning and moral values of existence for the realm of religion. This, and similar attempts to appease science and religion with each other, don't sit well with Dawkins. Although in the case of NOMA I happen to agree with his viewpoint, his rigidity to accept people's longing for a supernatural power doesn't serve his cause well.<br /><br />There are many religions, some more benevolent and therefore more respectable than others. Several Asian religions advocate nonviolence and a sense of true sanctity of life even to the extreme, that is, not to kill even an insect. I think that despite their underlying scientifically unapproachable tenet these religions would have deserved at least a genial nod from Dawkins for their overall benevolence. It wouldn't hurt the author's case either if he acknowledged that even more violent religions such as Christianity and Islam, have respectable aspects to them. There have been certainly countless great minds in history with Abrahamic convictions who have made important contributions to humanity. To his credit, Dawkins does give vague recognition to religiously inspired art.<br /><br />Without going into more detail of the ample material in the book, I want to praise its rich repository of scientific thought, abundant references, and the great example it provides for scientific inquiry. In this spirit I took the liberty to conclude this review with a critical observation.<br /><br />The desire to believe in a supernatural power (could we call it the \\"Supernatural meme?\\") has been innate to humanity in its first 1 million year or so of evolution. Despite his firm commitment to Darwinian evolution and application of the Darwinian principles even for social and spiritual progression, Dawkins doesn't seem to consider the possibility that religion itself, with such deep roots in humanity, is a natural extension of a Darwinian-like evolution. As such it should be given a chance for its own evolutionary process. Dawkins even goes as far as considering god a \\"scientific theory;\\" and I am willing to buy it. Although there is not as strong empirical support for god as for traditional scientific theories, let's say the Big Bang, nonetheless, it would deserve the same treatment once Dawkins labeled it as such. As knowledge accumulates, one would expect that the concept of god will undergo changes in our mind just as species changed over the millennia. Eventually we should reach a point where sufficient evidence may be gathered to repel the whole idea of god--or else, god will reveal itself to empirical probing.<br /><br />During the evolutionary process of religion I see only one concern a scientific atheist should have: the danger that dogmatic anti-knowledge fractions of religion will succeed in putting a stop to knowledge acquisition and thus interfere with the natural process of spiritual evolution. Therefore, the scientific atheist, like Dawkins, should not focus as much on how low the likelihood of god's existence is rather, on the high likelihood of danger coming from fundamentalism that, without a hint of questioning, takes its exclusive god at face value
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard about 4 songs on here( I have the best buy version) that were previously released, but I really like this record.The 8 new songs are excellent. No this is not Boston, or Don't Look Back. It is a natural progression from the last record.<br />A lot goes into a Boston record these days, and you won't hear it all or appreciate it the first or second time you hear it. I'm on my third listen now and I 'm sold. I was out at lunch time and sat in the car until I had to come back into work because I didn't want to stop listening. That's what I'm talking about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game every single day. I can not stop. I love that it syncs on all my devices. At first I thought this was simple but the game changes enough to keep it challenging especially the melting chocolate and bombs. I have come to hate chocolate! LOL Some levels are very hard but eventually I got through them. Now on level 165 or so.
B0034G4OZE|1.0|The dvd was incredibly scratched so it was basically impossible to watch. I love the movie but there were parts that it was unrecognizable because of the stopping and starting.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|When a technoology exists it will be used for better or for worse.  This story focuses an important light on the loss of privacy and shallow relationships that can develop through on-line communites. The writing was a bit tedious and predictable.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this story at many levels.  Tough topic told through the prism of flowers. Story structure is interesting, challenging and refreshing.

B00E8JTSVG|5.0|With the second book in the Dwellers of Ahwahnee series, author Sheryl Seal continues her exploration of a unique mystical world.  The viewpoints through which the book is told are unique and enlightening, and have you rooting for Oria the whole way.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and am looking forward to book 3!
0761169253|3.0|I didn't find this little book to be helpful. I thought it was over hyped. The point of the book to me was made in the title and that's all you needed to know.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Galactic Energies has a little bit of everything, and then some, in the scifi genre.  Its collection of short stories are each unique in their own right, and provide thoughtful -- and sometimes erotic -- viewpoints on modern life through the lens of scifi.  I applaud Rossi for his ingenuity and ambition.  Definitively give this one a go if you are a fan of scifi!
0143124838|2.0|As soon as I heard that Alexa Chung was writing a book I jumped on amazon and pre-ordered. I wish her book had more substance. Reading her book was a painful experience. She is an amazing host and has amazing style...  Maybe she should stick to what she knows best.  The book is aesthetically pleasing. The pictures makeup for the lack of effort that seems to have gone into the writing.

B005M0R4X4|5.0|Love the series, cannot wait till Series 4  comes out.  Not much else to say except once you start watching the series you will want all four
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun. Plenty of challenges. Even my grandsons play and they are only 2 and 3 1/2. It is amazing to watch how fast they manage to avoid running into trains.  Kind of hummed though be aide I had over 307,000 points and I lost it all from my grandson accidentally unregistering my kindle fire. Starting all over.  So I must like it to go through all of the challenges again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun . But it will probably scare you when the guy dies and snaps his neck  it  makes a weird cracking sound.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does exactly what I need it to. Send a video I found on YouTube on my iPhone and send it to my TV. The only drawback, hence only four stars, is that the sound goes thru the TV and doesn't get piped thru my stereo system when I have it set for TV.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Long download, takes up 1 gb but defiantly worth it. And it's free!<br />Can it get any better, I've been waiting over a year for this game!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|THIS IS AN ADORABLE ITEM. BABY HOLDS IT ON ITS OWN. ITS A NATURAL. BABY LOVES IT. A MUST HAVE
B00005NTJK|5.0|My favorite Tull album. This one doesn't get a lot of mentions, and none of their biggest hits are on this disk, but I think this is the disk where their early blues mixed perfectly with their future artistic directions. Darker and more acerbic than most of their records, the melody lines are challenging on Benefit, and it's certianly a &#34;rock&#34; record. Highest recommendation.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|The case is thin (which I want) and well-built.  The lifting-tab feature works for me.  I should have anticipated that the tan-suede gets dirty fast - I would choose a dark colour next time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss seems so real to me, as well as all the other characters, witch i love. The romance is sizzling and crackling and i can only hope katniss ends up with peeta. On to catching fire!! :)

B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I couldn't imagine being interested in a book about a woman who devotes her life to the study of moss. Total credit to Elizabeth Gilbert for painting such vivid characters with a well-crafted backstory and forward trajectory. I was interested, and really enjoyed this book. It is a STRANGE story - but a good one, well told and very engrossing.
B00BATG18K|5.0|It depicted a world that I knew little about and in fact didn't even know it existed with such devestating effects.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Answers many questions I've long had and some I didn't know I had!  Corrects many popular myths long-perpetuated by organized religion.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|It carried the story on of the lives of her main characters, bu it didn't have much of a plot.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this book down; amazing writing. It's a suspenseful, engaging thriller. Throughout most of the book I thought I knew the truth behind the crime. However, I finally figured it out in Chapter 36 - which comes as a total shock. The final few chapters are intense, but so good. Just when you think you've figured it out, another twist but then you realize you were right all along. Then, just when it starts to wrap up in a njce ending, bam! Another shocking twist, that you mind of saw coming. Then another surprise that's too obvious but still turns into a good ending twist.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Great film, excellent story, highly recommended. No movies currently being made in this century can even come close to this. Movies now seem to lack the kind of imaginative ideas and visuals this film offers.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|It is a good story with suspense, but it helps if one has read several of Cornwell's prior novels about these characters so one understands the history between the protagonists. Cornwell attempts to provide a little of this throughout the book, but not nearly enough for full understanding of the relationships between the characters.
0307719774|5.0|I love this little book. I am usually bad at keeping up with journals and such, but this makes it so easy by giving you a jumping off point for every day. I am already on year 2 and I love comparing it to what I wrote the same day, last year. I only wish the space were bigger because I notice that I run over a lot of the spaces. Makes a great gift too!

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This hunter is a bit gory . It almost looks like it was made by somebody who want,s kids never to hunt for real. That may be why all the guns are fake near look alike and Don't come drone real companies. Example they have an up side down Kel Tech shot gun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the only book that has ever been able to fill the void that Harry Potter's ending has created in my life. Such a fantastic series. I couldn't take my co-workers seriously after reading this; all i wanted to say was &#34;you think you've got problems? KATNISS has got some problems&#34;...
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love this app. I have been searching for an app to create and edit 'Office' files for months. I was not disappointed with this one
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun game for all ages. Find it much better than temple run. So fun for grown ups and kids plus minions are funny.
B00006674X|5.0|I loved this movie.  Of course, I enjoy all of Elvis Presley's movies.  This one is good clean fun and worth watching.
140006922X|3.0|Clever, but deeply disturbing. For Aslan, Jesus was an illiterate, uneducated peasant, seeking a violent overthrow of the regime,  and the vast majority of the Jews in the holy land were either, wealthy, greedy priests and landowners, roving bandits, or ignorant angry peasants.  The book plays into every negative stereotype of Jews throughout recorded history.<br />Len Lamensdorf<br />Westlake Village, CA
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This movie is just so hilarious, I have to admit the Croods remind me of my own family, lol. It's the best animated film I've seen in a long time.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I was looking through weather forecast apps and found this one, its so detailed and I love how it says &quot; its 30, feels like 15&quot; and such. so helpful for knowing if I should straighten my hair or leave it if the humidity is high. Love this.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was recommended and just finished a book so I was ready for something new.  This book has all the bells and whistle of all the emotions that any human can deal with.  Most of the time and in most circumstance you can do more than you think your capable  of doing.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|I been waiting for this game for so long! I just love Injustice. Now I can unlock things for the counsel version.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Grisham writes stories like no one else.  Events like those in the story still startle me.  I cheered for Lettie thoughout the book.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a must read for just about everyone and I am giving it for Christmas to some of my friends.<br />The book was in like new condition and a great price!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. If you are looking for an easy entertainment, you should definitely get this game. I think everyone should get it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Black and White, both sides now of a character that although flawed, showed a brilliance that has translated into a world changed for all of us.  Many so called financial \\"leaders\\" would benefit from his vision and willingness to allow risk when based on intuition garnered from intense involvement in his product.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|it was shocking,emotional,and sad. the story was amazing and striking. yay for pests and katniss. crying for prim poor girl.
B00FG1Q5J8|3.0|I made the mistake of purchasing this game without realizing an article I had read earlier reviewing it. And to the games fault I quickly found myself agreeing with article on almost every topic. At its core, the game promises far more than whats really offered. The story is extremely linear, and is driven by very repetitive dynamics. You start the game initially with the smallest ship available and you quickly find that you have done about all you can to your ship that is possible. This leaves you accumulating resources and experience with no real benefit, and really your only reason to continue the game is to see the story through completion. You can of course go back and try using a different ship style, which will open up a few more options, however, the result is really the same.<br /> This game can perhaps be saved, however, its going to require some serious updates. The largest of these being options for the player; make the different races relevant, offer more selection and increase the variety of play types.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Anthropologically speaking, this was the best season of Bones I've seen yet. This show just continues to get better and better with each season.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Being a bit of a historical buff and someone who enjoys attempts at period works, The Tudors, proved to be overall enjoyable series. While the writers clearly used poetic license in order to drive the story making historical inaccuracies abundant, the feel of the period is still there.  While a bit more action would have been appreciated, the drama is overall engaging and you will find yourself jumping from routing for one character to another in the blink of an eye. The series is long enough that you can get vested in it, yet short enough that it doesn't become a chore to finish.
B004LROUW2|3.0|While the premise of parallel universes drew me to this book, it is very slow to develop.  The characters are well drawn but the plot line plods along, re visiting previously explored events repeatedly.  I am assuming that the sexual overtones that are a major part of the plot, may prove relevant at some point, but that is unclear.  I am not finished with the book and it is debatable whether I will.<br />I had hoped for more science fiction and less sexual fiction!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Helped me learn quickly and efficiently. A very good app to use for short learning spans in which you only need a general basic knowledge.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Stryper keeps going strong!  The album has the trademark harmonies and guitar hooks.  The songs are weaved together into a fine tapestry of music.
B007WPM7SO|4.0|The main character's performance is startling. He subtly communicates deep emotions without a word. However, most of the other characters are not well developed, especially his love interest. Their romance begins slowly, but then they are suddenly, passionately in love with very little development. Some of her decisions make very little sense, leaving the audience confused about why we should care about her. Another character to watch is Firebrace, in whom the main character finds an unlikely kindred spirit. The scenes that feature the bond among the soldiers were the most moving in the film. I strongly recommend this beautifully-shot movie.
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|This is a different sounding Boston, somewhat softer, particularly towards the end of the album.  But, different is NOT bad.  I've been a Boston fan since I can remember.  I really liked the album.  Sure, it's a little softer, but you can still hear the harmonies, the rythms of the guitars and the melodic voices.  It doesn't bother me that they sometimes have a femal singing lead.  It's a nice addition to the songs she sings on.  Well worth the 10+ year wait.  But c'mon Tom!  Can you work on an album with a little more frequency so we don't have to wait so long?
1451666179|5.0|I've been following Allie for many years now and bought her book as soon as I saw it in the bookstore. NEW MATERIAL! WOOOOO!
B000BH4YJ0|3.0|I bought this because it had El Reloj on it which he sings beautifully; a real treat. Nothing wrong with the other ballads but nothing exceptional.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is an awesome CD, every song is good. This was worth every penny, the CD recording quality was perfect.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|At times the book dragged, I considered giving up on the novel. But the writing style of the author always had me coming back for more. I feel that the overly verbose descriptions of the characters actions lent itself to helping the reader become more involved with the story. I can see why some people would not enjoy this book. It is not an easy read. I personally liked all the scientific and historical references. I felt it added more interest than just a standard fare romance. The author is good at keeping the reader wondering what will happen with Diana and Matthew. I found it to be exciting and frustrating at the same time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent twists in the story. Also great plot all together, keeps you on the edge always wanting more details. Marvelous.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been a big fan of this series, thought it was wonderful from the start, couldn't wait to read this final book in the series. However, I hate the fact that the author killed off the main character. It seems like a poorly constructed ending to a series as if the author had writer's block and couldn't come up with an interesting way to end it. It wasn't necessary and has completely taken away my love of the books, respect for the author, and any interest to see the upcoming movie.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Wow, that was pretty hot. The book was an entertaining and quick read, but really needed copy editing. In a way, it was an X rated Twilight: just substitute an S&M fetish with the need to drink blood and you've the same deal. Good ending and good, sexy descriptive writing.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Just when I was feeling good for this family that had been through so much the bottom dropped out.  Tough book to read I especially if you have a son. What rating to give? 5 stars as it was a great page turner or 2 stars due to the depressed feeling it leaves you with?
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|If I knew my wife wanted to leave the theatre too I would have gotten up after an hour of this lame attempt at entertainment.  I thought it was over several times, seems like they finished the movie and then thought they had another idea about how to destroy a building or crumple pavement.  I have no idea what movie these people watched that rated it so high.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This is a review for the product itself.  I was a little upset to see that this title was not released by Disney, but my feelings changed immediately upon receiving the product.  The case and slipcase both look fine, and the &#34;booklet&#34; inside of the case is much better than I would have expected.  I haven't tried playing the DVD yet, but the Blu-ray Disc looks fantastic.  The image does jump around ever so slightly, but it's hard to notice as the movie goes on and you continue to be absorbed into the world it portrays.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Touch subject matter but, the writing was wonderful. Great story writer.  Would definitely recommend reading this book. Don't know if the movie can do it justice
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|The best-looking version of The Evil Dead 2 I have ever seen.  My one complaint about the physical product itself has to do with the case.  There must have been some sort of incident during production or shipment involving a number of copies (or I could just be unlucky...), as both of the copies of this film I've purchased have had significant flaws.  The first one was not purchased from Amazon (Best Buy) and had much of the side of the case rubbed off.  The second copy (which I just decided to keep) had these pin-sized holes on the side of the case.  Don't let my review keep you from picking up a copy of this masterpiece.  If you do happen to receive a copy that is too damaged for you to tolerate, send it back for a replacement.  I've done a few returns with Amazon over the past few year, and I've also been pleased their handling of the entire process.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|There, to my knowledge, does not exist a better work of modern fiction (the Count of Monte Cristo is still my favorite fiction book haha).  This book is a masterpiece and I am unbelievably excited for Brandon Sanderson to continue this series.  Can. Not. Wait!
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I built my own computer a few weeks ago using this case.  So far, everything about it has been fine.  The front of the case feels a little cheap, but that is the only negative I've noticed about this case.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It honestly was tough to name this my second favorite modern fantasy book.  (See my Way of Kings review for my favorite!)<br /><br />Kvothe is, without a doubt, one of the best written main characters in a book.  Patrick Rothfuss manages to put incredible detail into his characters without bogging down in wordy descriptions.  I am currently trying to convince my wife that Kvothe is, in fact, an amazing name for our first son.<br /><br />Seriously, read this book.<br /><br />edit: spelling
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|You'll either love it or hate it.  Giant machines battle giant monsters in order to save the world from destruction.  This movie doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done, but the presentation of the material made me fall in love with it.  The music and visuals are some of the best I've seen in recent years (for movies with characters of such sizes).  I saw this movie when it was still in theaters, and I instantly knew I was going to be buying it once it released on Blu-ray.  I'm pleased to say that the film looks absolutely amazing in this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />As much as I love it, I highly recommend watching this movie somewhere before making your purchase.  Either find a friend who owns it. or rent it for yourself.  Many of my family members and friends feel that the movie was only okay, so impressions definitely vary from person-to-person.

052118939X|5.0|I used this book many years ago when I was in the very beginning of my journey with the English language. Since, I used hundreds of books, guides, reference books and textbooks to learn and to teach the language but this one still is THE BEST in my list! It has helped me tremendously and continues helping my students. It is great for classes with a teacher as well as for self-studies (it has keys to all the exercises). This grammar guide is NOT a textbook but a great complementary material to any textbook for those who want speak English not only fast but also correctly.
B00BC254I8|4.0|I haven't finished reading yet, it may end up having a 5 star rating.  So far, an easy read - not simple but the words flow through my mind like water in a channel.  Many of the things he describes from his childhood sound shocking; but taking a step back I remember similiar incidents that he recounts happening in my Queens NYC childhood.  Worth the price to this point.  Will add more when done.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Just my opinion but I found it laborious and slow for at least 1/2 to 3/4.  Too many character details that ended up not being relevant .  Last 1/4 to End of story really good .  Read it in book club. everyone else loved it.  I am a big Grisham fan and have read all his books. This one was just slow. Too many years between a time to kill and this one. I couldn't remember most of that story as it related to this one.

0307352153|1.0|Couldn't get through this politically correct, vacuous book. Give me a break. I highly recommend the straightforward &#34;The Introvert Advantage,&#34; rather than this pretentious book.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Who better to narrate a story about human destructiveness than Death, a tormentor and a liberator?! I've never looked up to a thief. Until now.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about when this film won the Academy Award - then I watched the movie!<br />Wow! What a great story with intrigue, danger, romance, and - best of all - a happy ending!

B002MW50KO|1.0|After a couple of nights of spinning straw into gold, Rumpelstiltskin is back and he either wants you to guess his name or listen to his Christmas album. Should you choose not to, he will apprehend your first born child.  If you should choose to buy this album and start listening, my only hope is that your child will have successfully left the premises and gotten safely to a neighbor's house before you change your mind.  This album will seriously force your hand and have you entertaining the idea of actually sending your young one with a megalomaniacal psychotic dwarf to end the pain of having listen to all 15 songs.<br /><br />This album has all the elements in place to deliver irreversible psychological damage to all who listen.  Sure, it starts off harmlessly enough with a nice little friendly intro to &#34;Here Comes Santa Claus&#34; until the omnipresent off key mumbling of a tortured former genius starts turning a beloved holiday into something to fear.  I am here to tell you that as a 33 year old man, by the time track 3 started, I had turned on every light in my house and hid under the dining room table.  I made a blanket fort and took 2 days off from work.  I have worn adult diapers every December since 2009 and spent hundreds in psychiatrist visits.<br />This album is simply too much for the human heart.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter is the one of Phillippa Gregory's best books so far and that says a lot when I have read all of them. This book takes place in the 1300 hundreds during the War of the Roses between two royal and powerful house The House of York and The House of Lancaster. The book's main character is Lady Anne Nevile, The daughter of Earl of Warick and Countess of Beauchamp. The book is her point of view it describes in great and strongly worded detail the hardships she endured being a pawn in her father's ambition to put himself near the throne. She is a great heroine and also the antagonist in some points of view. The facts are very accurate and you see how she ends up controlling her own future after being called &#34;spoils of war&#34;. The Kingmaker's Daughter is very thrilling and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a real story about murder and ambition and even a bit of love.

0590259385|5.0|I LOVE this book. The rhyme is truly beautiful and draws you right in. I love reading it to my munchkin... and honestly, I've read it to myself a few times (not kidding)! Please give this book a try. I've read quite a few children's books where I've questioned how they could have possibly been picked up by publishers, but this book is not one of those at all. It is an instant classic. I am so glad I discovered it.
0385366450|5.0|Grisham is at his storytelling best in this one.  We thoroughly enjoyed 'listening&#34; to the book.  It makes our long trips so much more enjoyable.  Highly recommend this one, but for those who enjoy deep leagalese it is not quite where some of his other novels were, still an excellent read with just enough twists to keep it interesting
B00E9A656K|4.0|One realistic game. It's easy to controlling,has many options while your earning money,for u upgrades. Very addicting if you like a challenging game. Best one yet.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It's not very interesting. It needs the games it's just not exiting cause the rebels are BORING!<br /> Just my personal opinion
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Love this app would love it more if u did not have to pay for extra coins or Hunter bucks
B0089LOG02|4.0|I admired that the novel was based on the true historical stories of children. The characters were thoughtful and portrayed what a life would have truly been in reality. That orphan children could be used in the way they were and still manage to overcome it  is a very compelling survival story.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I really enjoyed the Delirium trilogy and wasn't looking forward to it ending, especially since I recently finished the Divergent trilogy and wasn't sure I could handle two conclusions so close to each other. But I've been waiting to get my hands on Requiem for a while so of course I couldn't really hold myself back from reading it. This book is pretty long, at nearly four hundred pages, and throughout most of it I honestly felt like I was just waiting for more to happen.<br /><br />Lena spends a lot of the book talking about Alex and focusing on Alex and wondering what Alex is doing and why Alex isn't with her or speaking with her. There were some good parts where it was obvious that Lena had grown during her time in the Wilds. She's willing to stand up for herself, voice her opinion, and risk her life for the ones she now cares about as well as the cause. But she can't seem to stop fixating on boys, even when there are more important things to think about. Even when they're in danger. And I feel like she was really unfair to Julian in parts of this book; I knew she was confused, and I understand that, but I really liked Julian after Pandemonium and some of the decisions she made regarding her love life were . . . lacking.<br /><br />Most of the tension in the book builds up to one big scene which I thought made some parts of the plot drag on but also made me appreciate the action that much more. I wanted Lena to finally have the opportunity to show off how much of a badass she was.<br /><br />The book is told half through her point of view, half from Hana's. While both characters were distinct and I didn't get confused between them, I think I liked Lena's sections because hers were less predictable. I liked being able to see what happened with Hana after she'd been cured and is now living in the city, a life that Lena easily could have had. I liked seeing it as a comparison between Wilds Lena and conventional Lena, her two possible futures, rather than her life set against her best friend's.<br /><br />Overall, this ending really disappointed me. Some of the elements I loved from the first two books were gone. There wasn't much action or intrigue until the end and the conclusion wasn't satisfying to me at all. I think there are some people who would be able to read it and appreciate it for what it is. Not me. I feel like I'm still searching for answers.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to people who like love triangles, dystopian settings, and don't mind waiting for some action.t against her best friend's.<br /><br />Overall, this ending really disappointed me.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I started to view this series during the fourth season.  I have always wondered how the characters fit together.  Purchasing the previous seasons helped me to catch up.  The quaility of the boxed disc is excellent, and I have enjoyed the segements.
1609611543|4.0|Very thought provoking book...I am not sensitive to gluten and in fact feel that I was pretty much addicted to carbs.  Give me a loaf of warm sourdough bread and some butter, and I'm a very happy camper!  I decided to give up wheat, and there really are a LOT of things that I don't eat now that I used to eat frequently (cereal, crackers, cookies, my beloved sourdough) and I find that I don't have cravings for carbs anymore, or sweets.  That pretty much leaves veggies and proteins, and I've lost about 10 lbs without even really trying or suffering.  The scientific aspect of how genetically-altered wheat may not be properly metabolized by our bodies makes perfect sense to me; I would recommend buying the audio version of the book; it was easier for me to understand the scientific explanations that are sometimes hard to wade through when you're reading them.
B000TV25XU|5.0|The case was a little worn like the description said, but the rest was in mint condition. It was well taken care of and I have enjoyed listening to this record since I received it. Thank you for the awesome customer service.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Moriarty has skillfully constructed a deeply interesting storyline. Her characters are well developed and believable versus being trivial or contrived, and help us examine the complexities and constructs we create from our lives without seeming preachy or pompous. The reader gets an authentic and relevant experience through each character's voice.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|great movie all most as good as the original enjoyed it anything with Daniel Craig is worth a look !
