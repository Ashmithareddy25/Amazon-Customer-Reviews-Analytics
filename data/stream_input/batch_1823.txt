B004QMW1NM|3.0|I bought this album after hearing &#34;Young Blood&#34; on the radio.  This is still my favorite song on the album, but I also enjoy &#34;All of This&#34; and &#34;Eyes.&#34; Overall, it's a good album -- along the lines of Lush (but feels a lot more polished).

B006C1DH92|5.0|Good execution for an unusual successor. Retains the addictive and repetitive fun elements from the first and even adds on new elements like a story mode that make this game highly enjoyable. Great for tablet users as well. Runs smoothly and is a load of fun on my Nexus 7 as well as my Galaxy S3.

UI is very smooth and user friendly and the graphics are good. Replay value is amazing because the dev added a lot of levels and has even released a sequel. Highly recommend for tablet users.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|Interesting to say the least, does what it's supposed to do but does not have any intent to keep me using the app much less have it installed. It is just something to have if you really enjoy what it does.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|Adding perk balls and a buck system that doesn't require you to pay out for it adds to the replay value tremendously. I find it fun to pass and play with my girlfriend using my Nexus 7. Runs smoothly and UI is very responsive. Highly recommend.

B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is definitely not something you see very often. It's a sound mixer that uses nodes placed by your finger to visually display the sound you're hearing. It works amazingly well, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes sound, and messing around. Fun on a tablet.

B001EBV0NU|5.0|This movie seems like it  could have been written yesterday. Love the little martian guys, they are like politicians themselves.<br /><br />KEEP in mind, there is a newer edition that was re-made with the same cast, I didn't like it nearly as much. The older graphic are funnier and not so over the top as the new graphics.  Just my preference.<br /><br />Enjoy!

0307341550|4.0|This is my first novel by Gillian Flynn, and I enjoyed the book.  Certain scenes were simply brilliant; They were psychologically very scary and gave me real chill.  There were a number of strong characters, including Camille, which made the story very interesting; however, I did not particularly like any of them.  It had very strong matured contents, which was a little too heavy for my taste.  However, there are a lot of things going on and kept me interested throughout the book.  The twist at the end was great.  What seemed to be was and was not.
B009JBZH54|5.0|the batman of the past are reamable but the Batman of now its like wow i think they could not do better actor to play him the movies are hot well told easy to follow nd well written for this type of movie super heros and vilians
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Should never have been cancelled. Writing was more consistently fluid than in most series of this genre and plot was strong with sensible resolution and character interaction throughout the series. The production was great. I watched the whole series on Netflix over a relatively short course of time, and I found that while each and every episode wasn't as great as the best episodes, the majority of episodes were far, far above average. Usually a series with a continuing story line to the extent of this one doesn't hold my attention because the characters are ultimately too shallow, are shown to do things against relative logic (especially annoying if said character has been presented as intelligent or logical) or against their character without the audience being informed of the change or reason. I don't have much patience for drama that is contrived by characters not communicating well or not being true to the story as presented thus far. There is a sense of inspiration and hopefulness encouraged by the episodes on the whole, and I actually found them uplifting.
B000F8O35U|5.0|another clasic must have seen it as a KID and loved it so another one to add to my collection
B008KW43TE|3.0|I was anxious to hear this album after hearing Frank Ocean perform &#34;Bad Religion&#34; on Jimmy Fallon. Unfortunately, After listening to the whole thing, that song and another, &#34;Thinkin' Bout You&#34;, are the only ones I really like. He has a great voice and a smooth style, but the other songs just don't move me. I have to say that the &#34;Pyramid&#34; song is especially undeserving of the good reviews it has received. Having said all that, I think a lot of people will find the album overall to be a worthwhile purchase, and I don't regret buying it.
B003XU02QG|4.0|easy to sit through the hour and half narration. a movie one can relax to, without much effort in absorbing the storyline - which is pretty basic; Nothing obtrusive in it.
0307720950|5.0|This was a great book.<br />It opened my eyes to opportunities that are all around.  It particularly showed me how I can use my technical background to help influence the New Industrial Revolution!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fast paced game that works well. I am sure I will have hours of fun with this game. It has different levels you can play the game at.
B004I744AS|4.0|This app helps a great deal when I'm unsure of the meaning of a word. It's quick and efficient and I highly recommend it.

0321857895|5.0|Mike Rohde is extremely talented! The Sketchcnotes Handbook provides expert advice on visual note taking including the techniques, the tools, and methods for drawing. The book is fun and a very quick read. Mike includes sketchnotes from other artists and also encourages you to actually practice the skills he teaches. If you enjoy doodling visual notes at conferences or events - or have thought about it - then you need to invest in this book. I am thankful this great resource is available!
B000I0QL82|2.0|However, when it is posted as a Special Edition, with. Color enhanced cover, I assumed, stupid me, it was the colorized version
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great little sequil from the origanl game. i wondnt say that it was an exact copy what so ever. my overall impression is to get this game stat
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie.  Our family has watched this movie over 30 times and we finally bought it.  It's silly and fun, with a great soundtrack and lots of Christmas spirit.  I normally think Will Ferrell is an idiot, but I love him here.  Again, very silly but a nice message in the end and overall.  My children all enjoy this movie, too.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Now, this is the film in the entire trilogy that should've been the end to the Dark Knight saga...because it &#34;simply is the very best of the three!!!&#34; I've seen, and watched this film 4 times now...and I plan to see it again, and again, and so on.... My man, Heath Ledger truly gave the &#34;most incredible performance ever depicted of &#34;The Joker&#34; persona!!&#34;  Bar none!!!  And...Christian Bale as always &#34;showed us the man wearing the suit...NOT the suit wearing the man!!&#34;  It' a damn shame, Christopher Nolan couldn't produce or direct a &#34;feasible, and plausible epilogue to &#34;The Batman Trilogy!?!?&#34; I'm hoping he comes back w/ the same cast intact for another go round w/ the Dark Knight...because after that &#34;unforgiving dreadful mess&#34; called &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; we deserve a &#34;proper ending to our favorite anti-hero...wouldn't you guys agree!?&#34; -Mikey
B005I6EVUG|5.0|While I keep changing out my iPad cover, I never change my Kindle cover.  I loooooove this cover.  This has the names of many cities written on it.  I think it's lovely.  It is thick but not too thick.  I feel like I have a book in my hand when I am reading from my Kindle.  I really do like this cover, a lot.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I enjoyes this game until I reached level 13-1. After that level, the game exits out. I can't go any further. I have sent emails to Amazon and Nevosoft. Amazon just says &#34;sorry&#34;, and I have not gotten a response from Nevosoft yet. Amazon won't even refund my purchase price, even though the game has some programming problem! Not happy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|All of us love Angry Birds.  My favorite is this version, Rio.  I love the backgrounds and the music.  Very cute game but also challenging as you go along.  Very fun.
B002RSU9PY|4.0|Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) plays a bad guy.  That's the only bummer in this Hitchcock mystery.  James Stewart has the lead role.  They don't make mysteries like this anymore.  HD movie makes the difference on my 55&#34; screen. It creeps you out like you're right there.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat. See if you can see Alfred Hitchcock in the opening few scenes.  He made a cameo in all the movies he directed if you didn't know that bit of trivia.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|A GREAT SERIES WE TOOK IT ON VACATION TO  ENTERTAIN OUR SELFS AT NIGHT.<br />REALLY GOT HOOKED ON THE STORY. ALREADY PREORDERED THE SECOND SEASON.

B008BDZOXQ|3.0|I mistakenly ordered an album instead of a CD.  But I was able to return it and get a refund.  This was not for me, but a gift.
B000IDCJK8|4.0|Watched it today and it was great and will watch it again and again and maybe even again and again loved it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed the overall concept of the book, but sadly there was just a little more I would've liked to see the book go into. I felt Katniss too easily found herself in sticky situations and even more easily got herself out. The writing style is very informal making it a very quick and easy read. However, I occasionally found it annoying in its colloquial prose.<br /><br />Originality 5/5<br />Execution 4/5<br />Writing 4/5<br />Overall 4/5
B0055EDCGU|5.0|My son wanted this CD and he plays it over and over.  He's enjoying it.  This CD was a good buy.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the nice quality and details of this doll.  I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it!  I wish they had the same one of Peeta to match.....
B00004YRQA|5.0|this was a great buy and it came so fast. There were so many out there but this one was definately a much better buy and was received befor expected date
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I loved this movie.<br />It is basically the prequel to Alien. Very interesting and not what I would have expected had I gave it any thought.<br />[[ASIN:B009AJD5E0 Prometheus]]

B000FCKGPC|1.0|there are only two semi-interesting events in this book, all in the last 50 pages of a 780 page book...the fact that the book includes a mea culpa statement on the last pages indicates even he knows this book stinks...this book appears to have been written to maximize profits off of fans
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Not horrible but it ends up being just another hidden object game. No good reason to buy it. 10 inch tablet let's me avoid some of the picture complaints but I think a phone would be brutal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of the Walking Dead. I was just excited that Amazon had indiviual episode to watch whenever you want!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very entertaining book! Not the best written but it is an interesting look into the world of American special forces.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|There should've also been Rupanzel and Princess Jasmine...also felt that the castles and carriage in the set should've been a bit larger. My daughter is a huge fan of the Disney Princesses and she loved these on her wall.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a phenomenal show! I really hope this continues to stay on the air for years to come and are looking forward to seeing how they are going to solve the issues that if I mention will ruin it for those who haven't watched yet.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Maybe it's because I love England and I love a good romance movie, but this movies is one of my favorites.  A good story with Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz.  LOVE IT!  One of my favorite holiday tales.
B000WDQMWU|5.0|This is when the show is still great. Please beware that by the time you get to season 7 it sucks... but, I am now invested in the show so, I continue to watch. But, it does jump the shark in then...
0345803493|4.0|I love this book.  It's really good and the story becomes a lot clearer.  A must read and will have you unable to put it down.  It's a very interesting read, that is for sure!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|what I found out is that you can charge it. I can go to work buy this alarm. my family love it
0446580848|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Nelson DeMille did it again with John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield. What I loved even more is the fact that he brought back another great character (about time too) and that would be Paul Brenner. I won't go into what the book is about because if you are reading this review you already know. Let me say that the story moves at a good pace and the interaction between Corey and Brenner is classic. I'm hoping that because of the ending we may be seeing another joint effort of the two. You won't want to miss this addition to the John Corey series, you won't be disappointed.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett's Fall of Giants lured me into the series.  I got a better picture of what happened during WWI from his book than from any history book I've read.  Winter of the World picks up where Fall of Giants ends.  I can hardly wait for the third volume.
B002TG3ACI|4.0|I had seen the Zombieland in the theatre and enjoyed its dry/warped sense of humor. Not a movie for young children.  I wanted to see it again and wanted to purchase a copy rather than rent.  I have used MovieMars in the past with no complaint, but the Zombieland DVD I received from them would not boot up and indicated &#34;Regional Code Error&#34;.  I live in the USA, they appear to have a disclaimer about DVDs with a &#34;Regional Code Error&#34;, that they are not responsible for the fault.  They will accept returns, but did not appear to include shipping either way in the refund, so for the $5 transaction, I would have spent more in gas to the post office than I would get back in the refund. I chose not to return it, and will throw it away or use it as a drink coaster.
B002PQ7JQK|1.0|When I opened the first blue Disk box a hand full, not exaggerating a Handful of blue plastic shards fell out.  The rods that hold the disk “pages” in the box were shattered,  the disks look OK but the box that holds them is trash.  The second box I opened seemed OK but the third is split up the back hinge so only the cover that holes the label is keeping the two parts together.  Again the disks seem OK but of the three boxes the disks came in two are trash when they got here.  Not happy.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is very challinging but it is really fun worth the<br />.99 cents. so I think that who ever is reading this would buy it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We laughed, we cried, we talked about the movie afterward.<br /><br />It is a good family movie showing the imporance of family and faith.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I previously wrote a much more negative review of this movie but I didn't think it was entirely fair; I saw it in 48 FPS and the accelerated frame rate was so distracting that I had a really hard time following the story. Today I saw it in 2D and enjoyed the film much more. So with that said:<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Luckily, most of the flaws with this movie are in the 48 fps version. 48 fps makes a lot of the CGI effects look cheap, plus it makes the characters appear to sporadically speed up, like you accidentally hit the fast forward button. The landscape shots are great (as expected), but I also felt like I was watching a documentary.<br /><br />Aside from my 48 fps complaints, I felt like Peter Jackson used more CGI than he had to. I think most (if not all) of the orcs and all of the goblins were CGI this time around, rather than people in costumes (like in the LOTR movies). This isn't a huge complaint, it's just that when I think LOTR orcs, I don't think of the ones in The Hobbit, kind of video gamey. The stone trolls weren't done very well either, kind of like low budget transformers.<br /><br />While the music is great in this movie, a lot of it is recycled from the previous trilogy. While subtle nods to LOTR musically are to be expected, I didn't expect \\"Ok, this is where Galadriel makes her first appearance, cue \\"Lothlorien\\" off the Fellowship soundtrack!\\" and \\"Bilbo found the ring, cue the mournful violin solo from the trilogy!\\" I feel like the \\"blunt the knives and chip the plates\\" song and \\"misty mountains cold\\" song felt a bit out of place, but I think with repeat viewings i'll get behind it a bit more.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Considering that they are splitting The Hobbit into 3 movies AND adding stuff from the appendices as well as fleshing out things that Tolkien only hinted at in his books, the team did a bang up job with this film. They spun the story so there was a (greater) focus on Bilbo's transformation. With so many characters and storylines keeping Bilbo at the center was difficult, but they (more or less) pulled it off. The dwarves in the books (aside from Thorin) weren't really developed too well and I really like that all thirteen dwarves have their own personality in the film. Granted, An Unexpected Journey didn't get to give all the dwarves a chance to shine, but that's what the other two movies are for.<br /><br />The casting and acting is spot on as well. Martin Freeman does an excellent job as Bilbo. Gandalf and Thorin are great as well. I was a little worried about Radagast (who of course wasn't in The Hobbit) but they added him in well. He's a bit kooky, but not overly so (I read one review where he compared Radagast to Jar Jar Binks...ridiculous). Gollum is a tad different in this movie than the trilogy, there's a touch more humor in his arguments with himself (which I think works very well), the whole riddles in the dark scene is great. Overall, plot-wise, no complaints.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's great to be back in Middle Earth, but lightning doesn't strike twice. I definitely liked An Unexpected Journey, but nothing in it really \\"wowed\\" me, and I guess I was hoping for a similar experience to when I first viewed LOTR. I would definitely recommend going to see this, just not in the high frame rate.
B003L20ICE|5.0|The movie deals with what could happen if the children of the 2 lesbians meet their sperm bank donor dad. The cast is fantastic and the story is engaging. Julianne Moore is great actress and shines. Mark Ruffalo does a good job as the sperm donor, who struggles with paternalistic feelings with his progeny. The story gets complicated when Julianne and Mark develop feelings for each other and act on them. An added bonus is Mark Ruffalo baring his hairy bubble butt. Woof!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|A little tough to see on the Fire., but overall a fun little game. I would recommend this game. Good graphics.
0345803485|1.0|The reviews giving this book ONE Star are SPOT ON!! Take heed! This laughable attempt at literature is an epic fail. I'm seriously reconsidering my friendships with the many people I know who gushed nonstop about the awesomeness if this book. A third of the way  through this mockery of a good read and So far It seems that this beyond awkward converse rocking, punch buggy driving, never been kissed, NEVER EVEN SHAVED, virgin, cornball brunette has this chance encounter with the richest, sexiest, gray eyed, tousled hair, huge package having guy on the planet and he is simply smitten with her in an instant and..... Ugh I'm annoyed even talking about it! Do yourself a favor and don't believe the hype!!

1455527475|5.0|A book about being honest and sincere first of all to yourself. About adhering to your values. About audacity. Greg Smith is absolutely an example of all of the above. In a turbulent environment that we live in, with Trust Erosion, we need such people!
1599290642|5.0|Love these books even though I only really get wowed by a fraction of the art - there's a lot of big fantasy boobs and swords stuff which we've all seen way too much of  already but I'm over 60 so what do I know - and then you turn a page and see a real masterpiece that really tickles the old brain and makes it all worthwhile
B004PR71JC|5.0|We love this CD. We listen to it all the time in the car.  It upbeat and fun.  There are actually a couple of songs I have on my running playlist because they are so energizing.
0307887448|5.0|great little distopian novel - I've read so many, I thought I couldn't take anymore but this really ties into all the crazed new stuff the world is turning into you may be starving in a desicated landscape but you'll have great electronic gizmos. Heard it's going to be a movie
0920668364|4.0|I'm giving it as a gift and this version is smaller than the one that I have. . . I'm sure it says that in the product description, but it's just not what I expected since I own the book.  Beautiful story though. . . great baby-gift.

1400052181|5.0|An excellent non-fiction.  Historical reading written in a story telling form that totally engages the reader with one or more of the characters as if they were personal family!  The reality of racism in the 50's to 70's was shocking as seen through the implications and results for the the Lacks family and its individuals.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good<br />Awesome and great ya I did not have a lot to right but the book is good read it it really good
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Entertaining, imaginative story. A lot of trials vary from the movie. Recommended as a great fantasy read for kids or a quick read for adults.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I thought the soundtrack would include Adele's song and it did not.  Without the song it is not that exciting --which the movie was and music sounded more intense in the theatre. nancy from vienna

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|We have home seminars & classes, & needed a mic that you don't have to hold in your hand. This one pins right to your shirt. It has a very long cord, but the cord is thin & flimsy. If you sit in one place, you won't be as likely to get tangled up in it. I like the ease of use, just pin it on, & remember to turn the tiny unit on, too. If you forget to turn that part off, you will have a dead battery when you come back. Fortunately Radio Shack carries their size. Keep backup batteries. The unit plugs into any karaoke speaker, making it possible to travel with this. One small drawback- keep it pinned close to your face. More than 6&#34; away and it does not pick up your voice.

Since the success of knitting is in the details and finishing touches, this book will help your projects look their best and professionally made whether you're a new, intermediate, advanced, or just a bit rusty knitter. I have the Kindle version which I refer to on my iPad which I can conveniently take with me...it's very helpful!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is one app that simply works the way you would expect it.<br /><br />This should be the standard for all like minded apps.
B007S3S8HO|3.0|I'm going to put right up at the top that you should heed the warning about not for children three years old. When you open up the package, you get a plastic bag full of tiny, tiny little plastic parts which are going to go straight into the mouth of any kid that's so inclines.<br /><br />Because of all the small parts, you're not going to want to get this for any little kid who needs his toys assembled for him, either. If so, then you're going to be spending hours crouched on your hands and knees figuring out how everything goes together while your kid is telling you to hurry up so he can launch another angry bird. Then after 5 seconds of fun, it's time to put it back together again. So do yourself a favor, don't buy this for anyone under grade-school age.
0525953728|5.0|The book was in AWESOME condition just as promised. Then to top it off it was an AMAZING book to read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is an awesome app I love it.there r no flaws even my Sissy likes it and she is very picky
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It came broken and it not worth the trouble!!! How can something called life proof come broken already? That is just ridiculous!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so awesome me ,my sis,and my brow loves it so so much!This app is awesome the new update is amazing.
0756655307|5.0|This is way cooler than I thought it would be. I bought this as a gift for a friend that loves comics and hopefully he loves it too. This gives the back stories and history of all the characters, tho I wish some were longer.
B00005NGAK|5.0|I enjoy watching Michael Flatley doing any kind of Irish dancing and this is no exception. I started watching him when Riverdance fist came out and all of his sequels were just as good and very entertaining. It's quality entertainment for the whole family to watch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an awesome game and you'll like it so much it is so so fun and awsoime thanks bye se you
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie in the theater and in DVD as it encompassed cartoon character that come to life in a movie form that works so well. Neil Patricik Harris and Jayma Mays were great together as they helped the Smurfs get away from Gargamel. It keeps one riveted to the screen as their is constant action that just keeps you going and waiting for the sequel to come out. Even the little kids will like this one.
0316228532|3.0|The book was OK.  Too much swearing for me, but an interesting plot.  I knew it wouldn't be Harry Potter, but that said this wasn't my favorite book.
B00973902K|5.0|My grand-daughter just loves this song. So for a surprise I got it for her to put in her Kindle.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My kids are big fans of Austin and Ally and listen to this soundtrack all the time. The music has a nice rhythm to it.
1595827684|5.0|I consider this book a must-have for anyone who is a fan of the Mass Effect story. It's got lots of great concept art as well as detailed drawings of various things as they appear in the game. Every once in a while I'll leaf through it and be reminded of various moments in the game, or just how awesome the Mass Effect universe is.<br /><br />The pages are printed in very high quality (as an art book should be) and the binding is solid. I would recommend this for anyone who likes Mass Effect, art books, or both.
B00631VJIC|5.0|THIS CD  is great ! I would recommend it to anyone who watches SONS !  I especially love Katey Segals songs, her voice is unique.  All of the artists perform fantastic !<br />We just can't stop playing it !
0811876373|1.0|Anyone can make cake balls. Her book may have a couple of decorating tips but I assure you it's not worth the cost.<br /><br />Here's my freebe cake ball recipe, for a cake pop just use paper sticks instead of toothpicks! [...]<br /><br />It may help to freeze the balls, then insert the sticks or toothpicks.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a fun game and really I enjoy building the village. I liked watching the previews as well. good game if you have time to spare.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I remember when i saw this in theaters,I knew i had to own it. Loved this movie so much,excellent job to the family & director.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|You reveiw suck.  If I rate it why do I have to write a reveiw.  I'm I getting payed for this.  Keep it simple.  I do not want to write a reveiw very time I watch a show.  Rating it should be good enough.  When I rate some thing on Netflex or Hulu I do not have to write a reveiw.  You should make it optional.  I'm retired from U.S. Army and one of the saying that stuck with me was keep it simple stupped.
6304698623|5.0|We got this in only a few days and it came packaged just fine.  My friend's sister loves this video, and boy, is she going to be surprised when she gets up and looks under the Christmas tree!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My entire family (ages 32 & 9-1 years) all enjoy this music Quality and Skill are great but still fun and memorable.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|When I saw the movie I was shocked to realize that it was about someone I had known years ago in Detroit when I was in college. I had to get the CD.  It is excellent. Back then I did not realize how great Rodriguez's music is.  I'm so glad that the world has a chance to hear him and his music has been preserved.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved this book...wish I would have been brave enough to do it myself!!<br /><br />You will enjoy this author's remembrances of her family and her journey with The Monster!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Nice game, the graphics are better than the screen shots look. People are stupid. A Mexican jumping bean, being a Mexican jumping bean isn't racist.
0425263916|5.0|Definitely recommend, for 50 Shade readers. This is a good series and can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoyed these puzzles. Doing these puzzles wile waiting in the doctors office or just in my down time, I found to be vary relaxing. Thank you! :)
B00170M2JY|5.0|It was a great movie, plus I was an extra in the movie, when it was filmed in Phoenix,  Tom Cruz, & Cuba Gooding Jr are two of my favorite actors
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I had previously purchased the single \\" If I Didn't Know Better\\"... I'd immediately fallen in love with it when it was performed on the show.  (At the time nothing else was available).<br />So excited the whole soundtrack was released!!  Not one bad song on this album.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is the most exciting book I could come across. Every chapter something challenging comes for the specially chosen demigods. 7 demigods from BOTH roman and Greek camps have to work together to save the world from the giants. But the Romans absolutely hate the Greeks. Can the demigods work together? Read the book and find out what happens to the demigods.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham-you did it again. You keep me glued to my Kindle as I hang on every word and every nuance of character interaction and feeling. Thank you and Bravo.
B0098460O4|5.0|Ever since I saw them on &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34; program, I have loved hearing them.  This album is primarily classic opera, which they perform EXCELLENTLY!!
B002RAREAK|3.0|It is perfect.  This is more than I wanted to write, but it will not allow me to submit without writing at least 17 words.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Am I the only one who bought it but it failed to download? Everytime I tried it said there was an error. I tried other apps but this was the only one that did it. So I wasted $3.
076790592X|3.0|It is perfect.  This is more than I wanted to write, but it will not allow me to submit without writing at least 17 words.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is very Addicting.  It is always being updated so it does not get old.  I also enjoy the holiday themes
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this blu-ray when it first came out and It was on sale 40% off. Great deal, good film at a very affordable price.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|It's a princess movie with lots of blonde hair!  Our daughter loves this movie and your kids will too.  Best of all, your kids will be convinced that you are a witch and abducted them at birth!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am presently reading David Baldacci's books and loving all of them.  Just can't wait to read the next one.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Very well made controllers from Sony. Long lasting, rechargeable built-in batteries, can take various drops and function well all the same.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is one of the best shows that has ever been on television. It is funny, suspenseful and a must see for any movie/TV lover or David Lynch fan.
0307279189|5.0|So I was first recommended this book by some people that I met during an interview.  They were all runners who had participated in marathons and such, so at first I was skeptical.  I like fitness but I'm much more of a weight room and traditional sports guy.  If I'm not going to tackle somebody at the end of my run, then what's the point? However, I ended up buying the book. As you can tell from my 5 star rating, I loved it.<br />McDougall really did put something special into this book and if you read it you will recognize good writing.  He certainly goes off on 'rabbit trails' but it's obvious how those bits of information and side story play into the overall theme and direction of the book. It's a book that certainly tells a story but once I finished the book I felt that I not only knew the story but understood the historical context which made the story new and exciting.<br />Overall, this book is an inspiration; not just about ultrarunning, but about the power of the human spirit along with the human body.  It kept me turning the pages and gave me an appreciation for a sport that I thought of as nothing but preparation for a real sport.  I think I might go for a run...
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Although this season isn't the best of the shows seasons it is still great. Sam and Dean are sexier than ever and they have added to the blood and gore in this season (maybe not the best choice) but the Monsters keep coming and the brothers keep taking them out. With the rumored end of the world (12/21/12) on our hands it's nice to imagine a Sam and Dean duo making sure we are all safe!
B00979CS50|5.0|There are vocals on this CD and they are perfectly embedded in some terrific guitar music that lets you wander as you listen.
B003L77G06|5.0|A great show and perfect for the family! A must have! I love this show and can't get enough of it.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|I tired of the songs after awhile with the exception of High Flyin Bird which I could listen to forever.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is fun if you can follow directions. it really can kill time and be a blast. I love it
030771652X|5.0|All I can say is it has been a long time since a novel has stirred such emotions in me and then left me \\"No Way!\\" at the end.  Not the who dunnit part.  I kind of had it narrowed down.  But the other revelation.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I ordered this on Blu Ray and was excited to get it.  Unfortunately, as I tried to start it up in my Samsung Blu Ray player, a message came up on the screen that I might have to update my player to be able to watch the movie, and it just wouldn't start.  There is nothing wrong with my Samsung Blu Ray player which works beautifully and on which I can view 99.9% of my Blu Rays and DVDs.  I think that if Prometheus' Blu Ray version is so \\"updated and sophisticated\\" as to be unplayable with an otherwise great Blu Ray player, there should be warning on the packaging and also in the product description front and center.  This disc is useless to me now.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I started and finished this game in one sitting. I loved it, a lot of fun, good storyline. Graphics were awesome, it ended too quick for me. Great game!
B00AHSINKO|3.0|The story was true to life, but I found some of it &#34;contrived&#34;.<br />I mean, had these people never talked their entire marriage?<br />The scene in the movie theater was unnecessary.  Clearly any couple that had not included such acts in their normal physical relationship would balk at such an assignment considering the setting and lack of &#34;experience&#34;.<br /><br />Regardless, it was a good rental with some moments of charm.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|This arrived quite quickly (Thankfully in time for Christmas) and it was in perfect condition.  The person we gave this to absolutely loved it as well, it ended up being everything he expected.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun point and click adventure game. The puzzles are fun with just the right amount of difficulty. This type of game translates well to tablet devices, so if you like point and click adventure games you'll enjoy this one.
1451696205|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I bought it right after I saw the movie because there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain and the book made everything so much and it was wayy better than the movie!!
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I was so excited when this set came out.  The sound is exceptional but the LP's are poorly pressed.  I have just returned my second set and have requested a refund.  Several LP's in each set were unplayable.  One LP wouldn't fit on the spindle on the turntable.  Due to the poor pressing and the heft of the package I have decided to pass on trying again.  I may decide to purchase individual LP's, but finished with the box set.
034580404X|5.0|Ordered this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Product arrived in what appears to be mint condition with original shrink wrap.
B006TTC5QS|5.0|It's kind of a bizarre experience to relate to cartoon characters and feel the human emotions they emote about their story. Pixar has made a few films that tug at your heartstrings (UP in particular). I was very pleased to watch this film with my son and connect with these odd characters surrounded by 3 adorable orphan girls. It was a very funny movie with a somewhat-typical ending of the hard-hearted villian finding love and acceptance. (This reminded me of the Grinch movies). Just because we recognize the theme from other films doesn't take away from this fun telling of this familiar story. I'm very glad that I made this purchase and that it now belongs in my movie collection! Recommended for the whole family!
030758836X|5.0|The book has some amazing twists and grey characters. Though some may say that the ending was abrupt, I can not think of a more logical way to end the book.
0385535147|3.0|a bit tedious - dragged-  not up to Grisham's usual standard -- it seemed to take a funny turn<br />in the middle of the book
B008VBYN80|5.0|I will rate this game under 5 categories.<br />1) Controls; In my opinion, controls are a big part of mobile games. Luckily, Kingdoms and Lords bring great controls to your device. Easy to use and simple, you can understand them right off the bat.<br />2) Combat; Personally, the combat system should be based off beating other peoples kingdoms. But since it dosent, I'll grade it off what it did. Turn-Based, Small fights, but strategic. 5/5<br />3) Multiplayer; Great! Works well.<br />4) Money System: Lots of money from taxes, and has an energy cap. Love it!<br />5) Overall Rank from 1 to 100; 94%, combat took of 6%, other than that great game.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is another great Mitch Rapp book!  It's one of those books that you hate to put down once you start reading,  When I get towards the end I start reading slower because I don't want it to end.  Can't wait for the next book in this series!  This is the best series I've read in years!
B004YF6MHW|1.0|Was starting to work, than it froze my phone right up and had to remove the battery.  To bad because it looked like it was a good app.  Trying to get my money back.
B009X01C64|2.0|I read alot, sitting, lying on the couch, in bed before I sleep.... When you fold the cover all the way back it is held closed by the elastic strap and you have the large elastric strap for your hand to hold the device as if it was book - just like the original I used for the 7&#34; fire - However the issue is the 8.9 device is not secure on one side. and suddenly falls forward as  you change position, or turn over. I just missed having it crack on the night stand. It is as if the manufacturer designed it so the hinge that attaches the device is opposite your thumb and your thumb should hold the unhinged side of the device against the cover - previous verstion the smaller of the elastic straps does this.Even if this is the design who would want to use it since when you turn over you would have to rotate the device in order to be able to secure it with your other thumb and one slip lets the device fly freely supported just by hinge. So if you like to read your kindle at times other than when at a desk and epecially at night before going so sleep then design does not work well.
0375703764|5.0|This is not an EASY book. It is not a book for people who want a page turning thriller (although it will keep you turning the pages if you let it hook you). It is not easily explicable, but \\"a horror story about literary criticism\\" is a good start. That premise is inherently Lovecraftian. That said, it's not the simplistic kind of metatextual horror where it's all about \\"what if what's inside this book kills you because it's actually real?\\" It's about the horror of realizing that it doesn't matter if a text is true or not, it's about what the text does to you, and how the ideas it contains change you.<br /><br />Basically, go into it with an open mind or it won't be scary - but once your mind is open, it's a truly affecting experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this book!  It was exciting and fascinating and fun and just the right amount of creepy.  The characters are so interesting, and the plot is truly original.  I highly recommend it!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The preview for Prometheus was promising so I planned to have a night in at the movies, which didn't work out. The plot thinned rapidly and midway through the show it plummeted into a sci-horror film, which was not of interest at all. I ended up catching up on the new catelogues & magazines that had arrived and glanced at the movie in hopes of a change in plot. It was not worth the time or money spent watching it, which was very disappointing.
B000002O1Q|4.0|This is an old iconic rock CD. If you're into the campy film, great. The sound track is better than the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is hard to beat the soccer game .<br />It is sum time hard to get money for the game but fun.
055338466X|5.0|El libro llegó en el tiempo estimado<br />Producto en muy buen estado,<br />No hay queja alguna o reclamo, todo en orden<br />Recomiendo al vendedor
0399157565|3.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta books. Either I have forgotten or didn't have this trouble before, but I found this story line disjointed, and hard to read.  I found myself going back and re-reading trying to figure out what was going on. Many times, in the same paragraph, Kay's thought are jumbled, making it hard to figure out just to whom or what she is referring.<br />There wasn't enough explanation at the end to pull it all together, and part of the mystery (can't give it away) is still a \\"mystery\\" to me. As I turned the last page I was hoping for another chapter or two. I actually toyed with the idea of reading the whole book over. Only the lure of a stack of unread books made me decide to chalk \\"The Bone Bed\\" up to disappointment and hope the next Scarpetta adventure will be better.
0740748475|5.0|This was a gift to an avid Calvin and Hobbes enthusiast who loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the humor and wit of Calvin and Hobbes.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|picsart is fun. it allows u to create birthday cards with ur own personal touch. lots of choices of clipart n text fonts. overall its just fun to use.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Only  complaint is if you want to see how long it takes for the person to guess your drawing, it goes slow.  Almost as slow as it takes for you to draw it.  My iphone is much faster but harder to drawn on the little screen.
B001TW69J4|4.0|In a way, this CD follows the path of projects such as Cynic or Gordian Knot: Very technical, fast, sometimes jazzy, metal music.
B0016BWACI|5.0|watching this childhood favorite was great. the imagination jim henson had is amazing. i love that we can get these old movies on blueray now!
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Another unapologetic attempt at cashing out with a Greatest Hits list. Despite the star power behind it, it's so predictable that I guess I'd rather see Mamma Mia again. Alec Baldwin is the best thing going on in this movie.
B002413TY2|4.0|I love Jason Statham in these movies!!!! I watched one after the other. The man definitely has swagger!!!!!! :)  These movies are very unique and appeal to guys and gals a like!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the red head was more than annoying!!!!!!  Transporter 1 & 2 are both 5 Star!!!

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moQKR7MGDXPYGS]]Anker is a company that I would not expect to find a gaming mouse. However with the release of this particular mouse is interesting and a step in the right direction. I took a chance because it was on sale and the features that it provides. I can safely say that I'm quite impressed with this budgeted mouse that is worthy for anyone upgrading from a simple 3 click or 5 click mouse. The Button layout is perfect and everything is customizable. Not one button will go unused. The form factor of the mouse fits well for those that claw or palm their mice. The middle part of the mouse is rubber and well as the thumb placement area, the rest is a glossy plastic. There are 3 buttons in the thumb area and three near the scroll wheel. The clicks are quite and light and on the bottom of the mouse is a profile mode switch and a compartment to add 8 weights. You can also change the lighting of the mouse to be any color you want and have up to 2 different profiles for different games. The software is basic and easy to use as its mostly just click the button you want to change and press a different one to change it or have it be from the list provided. An example would be changing the front button near the scroll wheel to mute my mic or have it set to cast a spell. The last thing that's great is the braded cable that a lot of companies are starting to do. Because of the price the product does feel cheap but the features outweigh that compared to higher quality mice that have a much higher price tag. If this is your first gaming mouse, then you will have a great experience with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|omg this is such a mind bending rush! plz get this game u wont regret it!!!! seriously it combines a puzzle with awesome plz get n enjoy
B0091REZMW|5.0|Since the few reviews on top are all whining about having to pay to continue the game, I felt it necessary to state that I've been playing this game for months, am at level 35 and have never spent a dime.  Yes if you are too impatient to wait for energy to restore or find the things you need or add friends to gift you both of these things, yes suppose you would have to pay and this is not the game for you.  This is not an instant gratification game that you sit and waste hours completing in one or two sittings.  It does seem to have no end but isn't that a good thing?  Sometimes it seems like I'm never going to find what I need to complete a quest but it makes it that much more exciting when I do.<br /><br />And by the way, you do need friends to play but it is not like facebook where you have to beg friends to join or invite strangers into your life, they are just other people who are already playing that you add with a tap of a button--no personal information is exchanged.<br /><br /> Bottom line I enjoy this game and I am disappointed when I run out of energy but then I close it and find more constructive things to do with my life for awhile.  I'd like to find more games like this--I had one, Forgotten Mysteries or something, but got to level 50 and couldn't seem to advance anymore.  I have higher hopes for this one.  I think an amazing amount of work went into creating this game and they probably deserve the money that some do feel the need to put into it.
B009157BWU|5.0|This was the cutest movie I have seen in a long time.  Well worth the $3.99.  We liked it so much, we watched it several times in the 48 hour rental period and then talked about it for days after to all of our friends.  I am such a softie (or a dork) LOL!

0375413405|2.0|I am a self-proclaimed foodie and ecstatic home cook that has amassed a strong cookbook collection to help me take my cooking to the next level.  I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more about French cooking.  My research consistently uncovered rave reviews of Julia Child as THE expert in French cooking.  I even saw the movie and it inspired to me to check this out for myself.  I didn't know what to expect since the reviews for this book can be polarizing.  In the end, I was quite disappointed in this book as well as her Volume 2.  I found Julia's style and mentality of cooking to be very outdated.  Here are a few examples:<br /><br />1) Julia uses much more butter than necessary for a lot of dishes.  There was a buttered green beans recipe that called for 4 to 8 Tbsps of butter!  That is one whole stick of butter!  As an amateur cook with intermediate skills and a lot of experience with cookbooks, I understand I can use discretion with receipes like these and just not add so much butter.  In that case, I could've just purchased another French cookbook with lighter recipes.  Granted, anything in butter tastes great, but we all know the health effects of such rich indulgences.<br /><br />2) Julia advises that we cook a pork roast to at least 180 degrees Farenheit.  She even cites that it has long been proved (since 1919) that Trichinella spiralis is killed at 137 degrees Farenheit.  So why the overkill?  Many other modern books have never advised such a high temperature and even the conservative USDA advises all pork be cooked to at least 145 degree F.  I had to reference other cookbooks just to be sure about what internal temperature to use.  Maybe this is how they cooked in the post-WWII era, but it is not necessary anymore.<br /><br />3) Julia's pie crust recipe includes vegetable shortening.  I know that there is still a loyal following out there for shortening.  I wont' get into the debate on shortening vs butter, but I will say this:  many cookbooksthe past decade or so have come out with fewer receipes using shortening for a reason.  Knowing what we know about shortening, there is no reason NOT to use butter for these kind of recipes.  The results are practically the same.<br /><br />In the end, we need to call a spade, a spade.  Julia Child was a culinary pioneer that just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  No doubt that she changed and shaped the food industry, but she did so in a bygone era.  At that time, there was no Food Network and food health science was in its infancy.  She was essentially the original \\"celebrity chef\\" that made cooking easy for the average housewife.  Anything beyond that is all hype.  To still hold Julia and this book as the holy grail of cooking is midguided and utter nonsense.  If you still want to get this book for nostalgia reasons or for cooking ideas then by all means do it.  But, I wouldn't cook from these recipes directly.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the number of quests to be completed can be overwhelming when it takes so long to collect items. it moves just quick enough to avoid boredom.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for over three months and I was not dissapointed!!!  Rick Riordan has struck once more.
B003M6P2LG|5.0|Awesome show.  If people give it a chance to get on its feet for the first few episodes they are in for an terrific ride.  Eliza is a very under rated actress.  Loved all the BSG cameos.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Much like Doo-Wops and Hooligans, I feel like it's too short! But that just makes me enjoy each song more. It is very similar to DW&H, but with a more refined sound. The lyrics are smooth, the singing is moving, and overall, I just don't think it's possible to hate it.

B008KW43TE|5.0|I had heard all the buzz about Frank. I finally gave him a listen and was hooked! And I was surprised too, because this typically isn't my genre of preference, but this album is so much more. The emotion and bittersweetness of songs like Thinkin Bout You, Pilot Jones, Bad Religion, Pink Matter, and Forrest Gump, is what drew me in. The stories these songs tell fascinate me. I would totally recommend it.

0099413140|5.0|This made a fun gift for a friend. My Grandchildren have this book & we always enjoy reading it as it is humerous & easy for littlies to understand the concepts.
B000VBP382|5.0|This is my favorite movie so this gift set was such a wonderful gift to myself! I love the soundtrack, very relaxing classical music. I loved the journal type book that comes in it talking about the movie and showing pictures from the filming of the movie. For lovers of this movie this is a great gift.
B007RTAR64|4.0|Great gift to my daughter who is big fan of the Hunger Games series (books and movie). She loved it.
B000TFINY6|4.0|The set is new but is missing the hard cover that goes with the case. I have the other seasons and they have it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent Read. Recommend seeing the movie, Lincoln, as a follow-up. From reading the book you realize what is missing in politics today and what we could and should learn from history.
1601251831|1.0|One star, book fell apart fast..( in fact, all the PATHFINDER books i have fell part)<br />This rating is based on qualtiy of the builde, not so mush as content, althought i gave information on that too.<br /><br />The book was amazing(For the first 5 sessions). The monsters in this book are great, the organization is wonderful, the art is beautiful . I LOVE the way they wrote the book, and designed the art and chapters. HOWEVER, the book felt sturdy and strong( My core rule book fell apart, i thought maybe it was a fluke) and dispelled any fear i had. I protect and respect my books as a book lover. I don't throw it on the floor and i don't bend it in weird ways to read it..Still, with the book being treated naturally, and read no more than 20 times, it fell part..The book is held together by string, no glue it used. After awhile the tiny thin string comes out and the book dies.<br /><br />The Book feels great and strong at first, but it WILL fall apart..Its not just a bad defect in mine, I bought three books. The Pathfinder Core Rule Book, The Inner Sea Guide , And the Bestiary and they all fell apart with LIGHT use( Except the core rule book, it seen heavy use, but was still taken care of)<br /><br />Pros;<br />Art is GREAT!<br />Monster Lore is GREAT<br />Orginization is PERFECT<br /><br />Cons;<br />Falls apart FAST.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every Sci-Fi fan should have this series<br />Very popular even after show was cancelled.<br />Good to see where some of the actors were before current roles.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game  I am addicted to it play it every day and the best part is that it is free I love my kindle
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Anyone who is a Lost addict has to have the complete series. The writing and acting made this one of the best series I've ever watched. Maybe, someday, it will all make sense to me....LOL
B007D2XSW0|5.0|For someone who just discovered her kindle fire had a camera app this edifying application is wonderfully easy to use. I will still use my regular camera for most pictures, but needed to post some sales pics online and this was a lifesaver!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Another great season! Someday I'm going to sit down and watch the entire series again. Maybe then I'll understand it all :)
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I wish I had started with this CD, it has all the songs I love and some I wanted but could'nt find on his other CDs.<br />If your a Michael Jackson fan this is a must have!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Amazing! This book was just as good as the hunger games. I am very excited to start the next book in the series and see what happened. I want the kids to get out free more than anything!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is an awesome app! My grandson generally has NO interest in puzzle type games but he has really taken to this one and enjoys playing it. He really loves popping the balloons when he completes a puzzle!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey's expectation-defying self-published short story, Wool, spawned several reader-demanded follow up novellas-all of which are collected in the Wool Omnibus edition. Having read non-stop into the wee hours of the morning in order to finish this book I went to bed happy that I had yet to post my Best of 2012 list. For not only will Wool be on that list, there is a good chance it may be my favorite read of the year.    I cannot say a lot about the story itself, to do so would spoil the plot twists and the surprising directions the story takes. Wool is best experienced sans spoilers. I can tell you that the Silo concept created by Hugh Howey is a fully-realized idea explored through the lives of a variety of engaging characters presented in a way that you find yourself suddenly realizing just how tangible a picture Howey paints in your imagination. I can tell you that you will develop some deep emotional connections to Holston, Juliette, Knox, Walker and a number of other characters whose interactions and motivations are as genuine as those we all experience in our day-to-day lives. I can also tell you that you will be reading a book written with such skill that you will wonder why it is that this book isn't at the top of everyone's list of books to read and recommend.    Wool is an easily accessible book not only for fans of science fiction but for those who tend to shy away from the genre. Readers of all kinds will relate to the characters that inhabit Howey's universe and those who sit down with a book longing to have an \\"experience\\" will find ample fuel for the imagination within its pages.    For more check out my longer, more personal review at:  [...]
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Could have spent more time on master chief or on a good line. A little to much filler but still an awesome start to what i hope will become a trilogy!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I am old, and I have way too many CDs. Yet I buy new ones weekly, and when I listen to them, I wonder why.  Even if they are really good, they'll never crack my play list, and after a while, they will be forgotten.<br /><br />Then, along comes Alabama Shakes, to remind me of why I buy new music: So I don't miss something like this.  On the first listen, I knew I'd be playing this disk over and over for the remainder of my days.<br /><br />Experienced listeners will note R&B hooks that date back to the beginning and before, but tempered by jazz, swampwater blues, Americana, and... is that The Strokes?  With all these recognizable influences, the songwriting still manages to be fresh.  How can people this young understand this much about American music?<br /><br />With a singer happily described by another reviewer as the love child of Otis Redding and Janis Joplin, Alabama Shakes is the most promising new band I have heard in a long time.<br /><br />PLAY IT LOUD!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game contains a lot of puzzles.  you will receive updates throughout where new puzzles will be updates to each stage.  The only issue I encountered was when I downloaded this onto my phone, it was difficult to have the full view.  I usually play this game on my kindle fire.  Other than that it is a worthy investment for the game.  Enjoy---
B008R5OJXE|2.0|This opera is challenging: it's a succession of solo arias, no duets except for Son nata, trios, or rousing choruses. It can engage on CD - Cesare has had several successful and famous stagings - through the sheer beauty of the music, and a conductor's skill and discipline. This Cesare, sadly, is lifeless, DOA. Priva son, one of the most beautiful of largos, here is perfunctory; Bernarda Fink in Rene Jacobs's recording makes it about something, and moving, as does Hellekant in Minkowski's recording. V'adoro, pupille: it's a seduction aria; here it's a grocery list. I love this opera; I own several recordings and DVDs. I had high hopes for this one, but in almost every instance, Jacobs is more ravishing, more engaged and urgent. Se pieta, for example, and Piangero: what beautiful, miraculous music! Here they are sung as if disembodied from the drama; expertly, certainly, and with more interesting ornamentation than Jacobs allows his singers, but disinterestedly.  Jacobs' is generally considered one of the finest recordings of a baroque opera, and this new one does nothing to challenge it. The recording is good, though without much presence.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is the standard sony dualshock controller. Nothing more to say. Great controller. Love it :) And I got it at a good price too. Nothing fancy about it, does its job really well.
0143037757|5.0|This is the first book I have read about European history post WWII that actually explained so much I never really understood about Eastern Europe, especially, and the Soviet dominance of the Balkans.  Know a heck of a lot more about Czechoslovakia, Serbia, Ukraine, Poland, Chechna, etc.  Excellent narrative voice as well.  I will miss Judt's incisive writing.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I like this movie, I then went and purchased the book. I like it so much that I  will be purchasing the series!
B000002J5L|5.0|As described, fast shipping and good price.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved this book.<br /><br />I thought I knew the premise of the story before downloading it, but by the end of the first few chapters I realized this was so much more then the brief first encounter of the main characters. It's a story of two young men, on opposites sides of the war, sharing the same experiences- fighting to keep sane and survive the horrors of WWII.<br /><br />You are introduced to Franz (the German pilot) first and then Charlie's story (the American pilot) is intertwined later on.  There is no way to read Franz's portion without being in awe of what he survived-multiple bail outs, crashes, and over 480 missions.  Being introduced to Franz first makes his run-in with Charlie's plane all the more remarkable - here was this battle-hardened pilot who showed unbelievable compassion, knowing if he were caught it would mean his own life.<br /><br />The authors do a fantastic job of seamlessly moving between the characters and you get so attached to them that I found myself hesitating when turning the pages because I wanted the ones I liked to live a bit longer. I finished it hours ago, but I know I'm going to reread my favorite chapters before bed tonight!
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I watched this movie 9 times in the theater, so to say that I liked the movie stands on that fact. While the movie wasn't popular with some, the sound track (what we are talking about here) told a story of it's own as the movie shifted rapidly from era to era, plot point to plot point (there were more plot points in this movie than average) supported the story well. It is now my favorite meditation music, particularly the piece called &#34;Death is only a door&#34; near the end that see's the plots wrap up. It was written around the execution of Sonmi-451 (story 5) and I can't listen to it without a tear forming.  As a sound track, it did an excellent job of telling you where you were in the movie and who the main character was on the screen, particularly Timothy Cavendish.<br /><br />That said, Doona Bae, stole the movie as Sonmi-451.  My greatest regret now is that the movie is out of theaters and I'm suffering Cloud Atlas withdrawal - at least until the 5rh of February when the DVD is released.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Yes. It's a lot of money for an advent calendar when you consider that you can get a calendar full of chocolate for $1.99. BUT! It's Lego and Star Wars so it's worth it (to us). My boys love, love, love this calendar. This is the second year we've gotten it. My kids (and my husband!) look forward to opening the doors every day and building the ship or the guy... It's just fun. I don't know what else to say. It's FUN!
B007N9FKCY|2.0|This game was super hard to control and very repetitive. I was bored after the first level and deleted the game after the third.
0545265355|5.0|Perfect way to get the whole trilogy in one shot.  I love these books and would recommend them to any casual reader.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It seemed like this movie had promise, but the jokes were few and far between and usually not funny.  The story did nothing to redeem the movie either -- it was very weak and I got the feeling that the narration and the whole father/son thing at the end was just thrown in to add to the run time of the movie.  It's rare for me to think a movie is not worth the rental fee but this one falls in that category.
0399157565|5.0|OK Cornwell does it again with this book in the &#34;Scarpetta&#34; series. A real page turner that I couln't put down until I finished it!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is buttoned-down doowhacka humor in the finest British tradition.  Let's call it Monty Python for the whole family.<br /><br />I watched the series when it was originally aired, and I must say that this remastered edition is more viewable than the original!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|One of the best romantic movies ever made.  Wonderful stars, fantastic story lines.  Love the way the characters are intertwined
8866130923|5.0|My daughter has used Moleskine for several years, and this one is the so nice- Excellent for writing everything down day to day. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is one of my favorite shows and it's great to have this DVD set to watch my favorite episodes again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i use this every morning and love it it gets me up and its not too loud to wake any one else
B00003CXCT|4.0|I bought this set a gift. Wasn’t able to break the bank buying it new. When opting to purchase used, I crossed my fingers at checkout. We it arrived the box was “well loved” and some of the case were cracked. The discs were fine. I replaced the cracked cases and gave the gift and received much delight.<br /><br />How does one review the Star Wars trilogy with anything less than five stars? The one star demerit was more for the condition in which the box set arrived. That’s not really George Lucas’ fault.
034580404X|5.0|One of the best purchases I have made. Very entertained by this trilogy read. would recommend for any one to purchase
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Overall the story was interesting but much of the movie is stretched out.  There is far too much time spent between the two main characters arguing where I found myself thinking I wish they would just do something.  Add that to the end chase scene which seems to go on for ever and is just too unbelievable.  The guy chasing them seems like a T-1000 terminator that can't get hurt and no matter how many times it seems that he would have lost them picks up their trail instantly like in any Tommy Lee Jones movie where he is tracking someone. Overall the movie seemed to have too much filler.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|If you have an Xbox 360 and some restless kids, you need to pick one of these up and plug it in. Step back and watch the kids go crazy... or... join in and get crazy with 'em! Game on!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I rated this 5/5 stars because its a wonderfully creepy and amusing moving. Johnny Depp was just an added bonus. :D
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Maybe it was the fact I read this on my new Kindle. Maybe it was the fact that finals are over and I can finally leisurely read. Maybe it was the fact that this was just a really good book, but I LOVED Beautiful Disaster. It was such a cute love story of early college students. There is not much I can say because I am still on a high from the book but it is a must read and I pick up. I usually don't re-read books unless they are REALLY good and this.<br /><br />Travis is not use to losing and Abby isn't use to taking risk... anymore. Abby is best friends with America who just so happens to date Travis's cousin. Travis is automatically attracted to Abby and so use to getting what he wants, he is a little shocked when Abby does not fall to his feet like every girl at the school. One day at the underground fighting stage where Travis earns money, he makes a bet with Abby, if he wins with out getting hit, she has to stay at his place for a month, if not he goes without sex for just as long.<br /><br />Within this month Travis and Abby go through a lot of things, some good some bad many funny. The end is kind of an abrupt halt but none the less the rest of the book is VERY good. It is not a series nor does the end leave you \\"hanging\\". The second book is not a continuation but to my understanding Travis's story. I cannot wait to see that one from his eyes.<br /><br /> It's a guy meets girl, guy is use to girls crawling at his feet but this girl doesn't she's different. Guy tries to swoon girl, girl is not having it. Finally girl falls for guy and they fall madly and hopelessly in love. Good read. I say pick it up!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney for me is and always will be The Queen of all female voices.She could sing other singers songs and make them sould better.BUT no one can sing a Whitney song and out do her.She the best we will ever know.great cd and you will love it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very cute book. I read a lot of romance books and some all kind of the same but I can honestly say I never read one similar to this. Book was also an easy read.
B000641D2Y|4.0|This is a classic movie.  Every 6 yr old and older will love it!  A must have for the Christmas season.
B004G600A4|5.0|My daughter!<br /><br />My daughter loved to watch &#34;Tangled&#34; on her own bedroom. She loved Tangled with long hair and purple dress.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Good:<br />Wide screen without losing upper side<br />Including Japanese caption even from U.S.<br />Special hard case<br />Special contents<br />Reasonable price
B005LAII08|4.0|3D videos are usually fun simply because they are 3D. Disney or Pixar can always be counted on for fun content as well.
B0062P3392|5.0|Don't ask me to explain the plot of this film.  However it was good to see Robert DeNiro team up with Jason Stathem and go up against Clive Owen.  Jason has some real good action scenes and they are right up there with the Transporter films.  As far as DeNiro is concerned, I have to wonder why he hasn't done more action movies.  His performance was just as convincing. He didn't phone in his performance.  He lent a lot of character to an ohterwise confusing film.
B009MF56GC|5.0|What an awesome action packed movie off of the original! Yea so the actors are getting older but what the heck we all age. Highly recommend this one after viewing the original.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Lots of mixed reviews. Some hated it, some loved it.<br /><br />I loved it. The plot was cool with a slight twist, the acting was very good & the visuals were striking.<br /><br />With so many loving it & so many hating it, my rec is to ignore all reviews as you wont know if you liked it or not until you watch it. I actually went in to this flick thinking it may end up to cheesy for my liking, but I am thrilled I did not listen to the negative reviews & watched it myself to form my own conclusion, & obviously I thoroughly enoyed this flick.<br /><br />So folks, go ahead & watch it & form your own conclusions.<br /><br />To the reviewers who said this was 'boring & slow paced' - Personally, I found the opposite to be true. VERY FAR from 'boring' & even further away from 'slow paced'..I thought this was a very fast paced flick that was anything but boring.<br /><br />To the reviewer who said this flick is only good if your an eddie murphay fan - EM, in my opinion has not had a good flick in ages. In fact, im struggling to think what his last excellent/good flick was.....1st let me say that EM was just fine in this flick.....he played his part very well, but if anything, he was about the only 'critical' part of this flick, but the flick was good enough to carry em, hence, im still giving it 5 stars, although I cant say this was a 'great performance' by EM...Again, imo, he was fine..not great, not bad, just a smallish & simple character & the movie carried him....I actually think EM fans would be disappointed if they watch this expecting to see his 1st great performance in a long time. But they will see a great flick that is fast paced, enjoyable & should enjoy EM's character, albeit, certainly not at the top of EM's list. Then again, considering the bulk of EM's movies since ages ago, were pitiful...pitiful movies & pitiful acting by EM, Tower Heist was quite good so it certainly doesnt rank as one of EM's worst, & is likely in the middle somewhere. If anything, with all his latest flicks bombing, although this wasn't his greatest performance, it should help get him a few more flicks so we can then see if EM's best days are behind him or if he can manage to resurrect what appeared to be a dead career.<br /><br />FUN & ENJOYABLE FLICK.....Watch & judge for yourself.<br /><br />Happy Holidays.ll his latest flicks bombing, although this wasn't his greatest performance, it should help get him a few more flicks so we can then see if EM's best days are behind him or if he can manage to resurrect what appeared to be a dead career.<br /><br />FUN & ENJOYABLE FLICK.....Watch & judge for yourself.<br /><br />Happy Holidays.
B00992CF6W|5.0|He says it's the best game ever.  The graphics are really good, & you can do things that other games won't allow.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Cute movie with an endearing message about the value of doing a job right &#34;no matter what&#34; and having courage to follow through with what is right.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|No suspense, dynamic action nor do I care. The first pages are the best. Oh and six more words are required of this review by Amazon. Sorry.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always loved playing Mahjong and with my Kindle I can take it with me and play it anytime. Always enjoy the challenge.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Breaking bad is one of my favorite shows. I think I must have a thing for good people turned bad.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|This movie is for anyone who likes plots that involve the themes of morality, choice, and personal responsibility. In this case: should one accept $1mm, but to do so, someone whom one doesn't know will die. Add a twist of sci-fi and it makes for a rather entertaining and thought-provoking thriller.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Aluminum arm, strong grip. This arm will keep your devices where you want them. Don't waste your time with the plastic versions.
B00005JLCI|5.0|If you like long movies, beautiful language and Shakespearean plays, this will do. What's more, the cast is exceptional (Kenneth Branagh, Kate Winslett, Bill Crystal, et al.).
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My wife picked this movie. I really expected to hate it as some sort of chick flick. However I ended up finding it engaging and funny. Probably helps if you like travel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|you need to read this trilogy! i loved these books and actually got sad when i was done with them!! GREAT READ!!!!!
1449415881|5.0|I've enjoyed the Dilbert day by day calendar for several years now....I HAVE to have one under my Christmas tree each year for the following year!
B009UVWBMA|3.0|I am going to start out this review by placing each song in their specific genres then I am going to review the album then give you the stand out songs on the album.<br /><br />Indie pop: State of Grace, Treacherous, All Too Well, The Last Time, Sad Beautiful Tragic, The Lucky One, Everything Has Changed, Come Back...Be Here<br />Country: I Almost Do, Stay Stay Stay, Holy Ground, Begin Again, The Moment I Knew, Girl At Home, Treacherous (Original Demo Recording), Red (Original Demo Recording), State of Grace (Acoustic Version)<br />Pop: Red, I Knew You Were Trouble., 22, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Starlight<br /><br />The album is a bit disappointing with some of the songs as it was definitely not what I was expecting, when Taylor described the reason she chose the title of the album because of all the colors and emotions in the album I was expecting a hardcore country/pop album but I now understand why she chose to use \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" as the lead single for the album as the lyrics are a hint as to what a majority of the album will consist of as she says  in the song, \\"With some indie record that's much cooler than mine\\". Definitely this is her first step into the indie pop world. I hope this album will do her well. Red's original demo recording was a bit of a shock as it made the song sound a lot more country then the final recording. That was a shock. 3 1/2 out of five stars.<br /><br />Stand out songs: Red, I Knew You Were Trouble., All Too Well, 22, I Almost Do, We Are Never Getting Back Together, Stay Stay Stay, Starlight, The Moment I Knew, Come Back... Be Here, Girl At Home, Treacherous (Original Demo Recording), Red (Original Demo Recording)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Although I don't think this is one of Grisham's best books, I did enjoy it and was anxious to see how it ended.<br />As in many books, the ending just seems to be too pat - in other words, everything is wrapped up in a few pages. I really don't care for that approach. With that said, the book certainly keeps your interest and the characters are extremely believable, as is the story.
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is a very educational movie and i am glad that i own it so that my kids can see it like i did when i was litte
0316779989|5.0|I got this for a gift and it was well received. You people should not require me to use a certain number of words, it just doesnt make sense. I only wanted to say it is good.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fawlty Towers is the very best comedy series ever produced for Television.<br />i recommend it highly and with great confidence.
0810989956|5.0|My grandson asked for this specifically, so I am giving it to him for Christmas. I paid about half of what it cost in the local stores, so I am thrilled.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love falling asleep to white noise, so I downloaded this when our fan broke (our usual source of white noise). I was pleasantly surprised that this app has so many choices, and you can layer them. I prefer rain - and there are like 8 different types of rain. Then I can add a layer of thunder! And, a layer of soft piano melodies! Awesome.<br />Even better, there's a timer so it's not playing all night. I plug in my phone at night so it doesn't really matter, but I imagine it would drain your battery very quickly without plugging it in.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love, everything about this application and the different versions I am able to pick from. I really love being able to look up specific verses.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A complex and intriguing tale. Very thoughtfully done. Great plots and well developed characters.  This fantasy novel has a lot of depth.  It is a very rich story.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am always checking the weather and making sure that we are dressed accordingly! I know I can always get the information quickly !!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I dont't really know what is wrong with the folks who determine &#34;the best actors.&#34;  John Wayne is probably the best western actor ever!  When you view a movie or DVD that he plays in, you also get a crew that are the best supporting actors and actresses....&#34;the John Wayne (and the directors) FAMILY.&#34;  It seems that hollywood never gave John Wayne his due.  Not only does he represents the best of all men in his movies but in his life as well.  Westerns (which they do not make anymore) will never be the same.  Hollywood, it is too late to pull your heads out of your ---, but you can sing his praise after his death......much too late!!!
B002BWP49C|5.0|This DVD arrived quickly and was packed very well, ensuring it arrived in great shape. Quite pleased with this purchase!
B005D7ECMM|5.0|HAD CAYGHT A PORTION OF THIS FILM &#34;on demand&#34; but finally decided I wanted to take the time to view the whole film -- gorgeous scenery -- too bad political unrest continues not only in the Middle East but elsewhere
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I was surprised about this movie I did not expect the action and it was a really good movie. I thought this would be more like a diseny movie, but it was great.
1451638450|4.0|I am a big fan of the author's Vorkosigan saga and characters so I was very happy to purchase this item. It isn't one of the darker entries in this series but that's okay because Ivan Vorpatril was never the cleverest banana in the Vor bunch. However, the Bujold world building magic is still in force and her skill at dialogue has not faded. I recommend this to fans of her work.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was amazing.  It was a thrill and always kept me guessing.  I was super shocked at the end.  I wish the dad was saved instead of um...recycled.  The book rendered feelings inside me that were only relieved with at the end of the book.  Wonderfully written and beautifully executed, The Red Pyramid will be a wonderful adventure for all showboating read it.
0060899220|5.0|Anthony Bourdain has turned the commonplace (that is cooking and restaurants) into an pirate like adventure. The book was in great shape and I am 100% satisfied.
B004EPZ084|2.0|As long as the focus is on the 3 horrible bosses, then this is actually pretty funny, especially Jennifer Aniston as the over sexed dentist, who sexually harasses her male assistant. Kevin Spacey is great, too, as the ogre boss, as is the third guy who plays the coked out son who inherits his saintly dad's business and proceeds to wreck it. However, the main plot, involving the usual three stooges who decide to kill their bosses, is quite lame and not even worth watching. It's a shame because they had a good premise here. If they had just sustained the title theme throughout, this could have been a winner. As it is, it's just another unfunny comedy with the usual three boobs running amok.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|If you have to question whether or not this movie will be Oscar worthy, just don't watch it. This is pure unadulterated female entertainment - yes, just for the ladies and gay men this time! There IS a plot. Yes, it's predictable, but who cares.<br /><br />I watched it with my best girls and gay male friends and I was entertained!!!  We all had a great time!  I smiled through a good percentage of the movie, and when it was over I felt great!  That's what I expected, and that's what I saw. :)<br /><br />Own it, ladies!
B008D19WBQ|4.0|i need to improve my level of English, this series is amazing for that. I dont see the whole serie I,m waching season 3 right now.<br />I'm very happy for that.

B000683VI4|5.0|this is a great love story and I like the actors and actresses a lot!  I would recommend this movie to the young at heart.
1451695195|3.0|I was looking forward to reading it but was disappointed in how much time he spent trying to prove he was having an authentic death experience, seemingly to skeptical colleagues. I understand there are different levels of brain dead but I wanted to read about his heavenly experience of which there was very little. And what there was, he seemed unable to describe aside from pretty much saying it was indescribable. I am sure words fail such an experience but if words are such failures why try in a book? I didn't need the book to believe anything but the numerous articles based on the book sufficed to describe his heavenly experience and I wish I had settled for that instead of buying it. Check it out at the library or borrow a friend's but save your money.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|just like everyone else has said it wont load past the first 10 or so. I do not have this problem on my other kindle fire. fix this please! and you cannot video chat via facebook  just skype. I misunderstood the wording in the description for the fire hd 8.9 not so great...
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This book was everything I expected from Marilyn Manson: the messy, creepy family, disturbing childhood, an unbridled need for attention.<br />However he is also very articulate and excels at manipulating his image to create controversy (just like other one-name \\"singers\\").<br />Something tells me that there's quite a bit of embellishment in all the stories about roadies and sundry mayhem. No matter what, I remain very interested in how uncomfortable he makes religious people. Bravo Marilyn -or Brian, or whoever the voices in your head tell you at the moment-!!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Our teenage girl loves this show. She was so happy to get this for her birthday. Fast shipment. Item just as described
B009XY5G80|5.0|There probaly isn't very much that hasn't been already said and written about this masterpiece of literature. I was very keen on chapter 5, where Ms. Wolf simply  rips Victorian morality to shreds. Superb read.<br /><br />Oh the Glawr!<br /><br />A note on the Kindle editions: I purchased this one for $.99 though I also saw another one with the same cover but for approximately $3.99.<br />There wasn't enough information for me to be able to tell if there was any difference however, there is so much critique and commentary written on \\"Orlando\\" that I don't see the need to pay for something I can simply Google rather than have it added onto to the book for 10 times what I paid for this book.
0062127241|4.0|My teen years were in the late 60s and early 70s so I listened to music like everyone else in my generation. However, I was never a Who fan. I preferred the raunchier sounds of the Stones, the hardness of Zeppelin, and the mind altering music of Pink Floyd. I listened to the big hits of the Who because they were played on every FM and AM station in America, but the only WHO album I ever purchased was Live at Leeds. That's probably why I found this book so interesting. I was not a fan and found Pete Townsend's life fascinating.<br /><br />I had no preconceptions of Pete Townsend but after reading the book had a greater appreciation for him as a person and a musician. The book could have been edited down a bit, but in general it kept a good pace.<br /><br />One and a half thumbs up.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|^^^THIS. Also the media arrived in an acceptable fashion and I was able to view the movie to my satisfaction. But I just wrote all that to say BUY THIS MOVIE ITS COOL. Peaceoutmayne.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is more than an account of a marriage that took a terrible turn on the couple's 5th anniversary. It is about the struggle for absolute power between two people. Each time you think you've guessed where the story is headed, the author takes you on a sharp turn which keeps you in suspense happily paging through this dark journey. A great read for those who love mysteries and deep character development.
B001RH6L6C|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel do fantastic jobs. I'm a sucker foa a happy ending.  I have watched this movie a dozen times!

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie is a favorite of my daughter's and when her VCR broke, of course she could no longer view her VHS copy of the movie.  She was so happy and surprised to receive a DVD copy!  Movie plays perfectly.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The Pixar animation has reached a new level. The HD version of the movie displayed a depth of animation that appeared to reach 3D at times. The soundtrack is a worthwhile addition to you music library. Obviously, I loved this movie.
B005KELW26|2.0|This one is the wrong size for the kindle fire HD.  I will have to get a larger one that fits.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Stallone, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenneger, Dolph Lundgren....Chuck Norris?? Are you kidding me?? How can you go wrong with an explosive cast like that!! Add Straham and you know things are going to move!! This was a great ride from start to finish.  If you're a kid of the 80s who grew up on Rambo, Rocky, or loved seeing Chuck Norris get his butt kicked by Bruce Lee, then this movie is for you!  There were a few references to older movies and famous one liner like Terminator's \\"I'll be back\\". They made fun of it, all in good humour, and it was great!  I really enjoyed this movie, it's not going to win the next academy awards for screen play, but it's fun, and packed with good action!  Enjoy!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|It would be probably be a 4.5/5 but i gave it 5 stars because i love it! The first Maiden's CD i got
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The movie didn't give the book justice. I understand that the wanted a good show but they hacked the book up and left out crucial parts.
B000002MP2|5.0|The title says it, Dookie it's their best with American Idiot and it's for sure the CD which lunched them all over the world!

B00296A4F4|5.0|Because my daughter never has time to watch it on TV, I bought this for her so she could watch it when she had time.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|First of all the blu ray is stunning, totally worth it. The characters are very deep and the villains always keep you on your toes. Only at the end does it all make sense to you. Join the 11.8 million viewers like me into a world we know from our bed time stories and see what they are like wiped of all past memories living in a land under the control of the evil queen posing as Regina Mills.
B008D37J6O|1.0|I want to stream content from my server to my Kindle on my home network. But it only lets me stream from my kindle to my kindle.  How useless is that?  Did someone forget what Client / Server was when they were writing this app?
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The movies are incredible the transfer to blu ray was superb. I only wish Lucas hadn't changed the movies they are minor changes but still it was a bad decision.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|The animation is beautiful, and I'm so glad to watch it on our Roku whenever we want! My son is mesmerized by this movie.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed reading this true life occurrence. It truly was inspiring, and has lifted me spiritually, as I am sure it has for many others. Every child and adult should read this book to understand the incredible Love that is in the Universe, and the understanding of what is on the other side. Truly this was one of those miracles in life that I was so happy the author shared with the world.
073937771X|5.0|Came in large print BUT...when I saw how small the print was in a normal paperback.  I was very happy for the large print.  Awesome book!
0425263916|5.0|Can't wait for next book next spring.  I have already preordered it for my Kindle.  If you loved Fifty Shades of Grey, then the Crossfire series is for you.
0307454541|5.0|Bought the whole trilogy online and all books were in great shape and came very quickly.  We have been sharing them with family and friends and they are enjoying them too.
B009FZFONO|4.0|If you love this show like I do. Then purchasing this season is a no brainer. Just remember season 3 is a split. So there will be another half to number 3. But if you are like me. Then you can't wait! Give in! Give in!
B009CPN2G8|5.0|This is a great family movie. The dogs in this film are trained very well. We were amazed by the dogs from beginning to the end of the movie. A big thumbs up for  the movie and to the dog trainer.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|I needed the Blu-ray disks only, but I bought this 5-disc combo for the best price. I found the digital copy unexpectedly useful; I could download it to my iTune and watch it on my iPhone. The process was very simple.<br /><br />There are so many fun extras on the second Blu-ray disk and I am happy with the purchase.

B0091REZMW|3.0|too pushy to install extra content and sync with social networks. just want to play a game and not do a million other things also don't like waiting for &quot;energy&quot; to replenish before I. can play again
1451627297|5.0|This was my first time picking up a Stephen King novel, and I chose to read this one because it came highly recommended by one of my other favorite authors.  When I first saw the book I was surprised by it's 850 or so pages, but excited to dive in because I knew that the story would take me places long after most novels would have ended.  Although it took me a little while to get into the story, after a couple chapters I couldn't put it down and was reading every chance I got.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and am now looking forward to Under the Dome.
B00505470O|5.0|get it, thats all i can say. its great. very chill. i love when i hear one of the songs on XM, I wind up putting the whole cd on.
8862931921|3.0|I was looking for a sketchbook that was capable of handling a variety of mediums,inks,pens,pencils and maybe even paint. I ordered this sketchbook in April and it was everything I wanted and more. A couple of days ago I finished the sketchbook and I was looking forward to ordering and repeating the process in a second sketchbook and I ordered the same sketchbook again but for some reason moleskine has changed the type of paper for the individual pages. They are thinner and smell of some paper treatment process. I am going to use this sketchbook but I feel that the quality of the product has greatly diminished. And I only say this because, I really loved the first sketchbook but what I've been sent now pales in comparison. I am only writing this review in hopes of the company going back to the previous formula to bring back what was a great sketchbook.
1416955070|5.0|okay i picked up this book 5 years ago and for some reason i could not get into it and i am so mad at myself got not picking up this book sooner i walked into this book with a open mind and willing to give it a shot and i was surprised at how much i liked it, i love how much clary changes so much through out the book i love the mortal instruments series i can't wait to start reading city of ashes i think its going to be really good. if you want to know more of what i throught of city of bones by canssandra clare vist my youtube channel channel here:[...]... please enjoy and subscribe :)
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I wanted to read her story to see how a young girl can go through this horror and come out on the other side and be able to mesh back into society.  I learned that it isn't easy and will take time.  I hope life treats her with love and kindness!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is just like the game at the fair! the coins regenerate at a decent rate. I haven't figured it all out yet but so far I love it
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Had to watch this movie for a psychology class, so was expecting something LAME.  Very emotional and VERY SAD.  This movie is very much a tragedy and very much a comedy.  It is so hard to decide which it is, so all I know is that it is very powerful and well done.
B000000TDH|5.0|Didn't realize this was on vinyl so when I came across it I had to have it classic no doubt great sound top marks :)

B008EZVNO0|3.0|On more than one song there is a very distorted sound.  I'm not a musician but it sounds like a reed in the saxophone is messed up.

B008DL466C|4.0|After reviewing this album several times now, i have to say i am fairly impressed with his new work. Yes he did say O.N.I.F.C was going to be comparable to Kush & Orange juice, but its way off. Simply put, this is the new Wiz. Every one keeps saying that he keeps rapping about the same stuff, thats what he chooses to rap about its Wiz Khalifa were talking about. Standout tracks include Let it Go ft Akon, The Plan ft Juicy J, imo, some of his best stuff since earlier 36, but some ppl might not view it that way. I like his sound and his beats are sweet to listen to. Smooth rolling beats is whats this album is about. Listen to the intro of Medicated. It reminds me of driving and putting my hand out the window and going up and down with my hand as the wind goes through it. Its good backround music at the very least. Ive always been a fan of all Wiz Khalifa's work. True die hard fans will appreciate it but probably not new comers to his style. Go back and listen to Flight School, Deal or No Deal, or even Burn After Rolling. All his work vibes with me, he has made it to the top of my newer favorite rappers. Hope this review helps!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Let's get something straight here.  This band isn't exactly re-inventing the wheel or anything like that, but let's face it - we, as consumers, are hungry.  We've been hungry for something different for a while now, and this \\"new\\" folk sound has taken off.  With that said, I personally believe the Lumineers are the most talented front-runners of the move.  Some Mumford & Sons fans will disagree with me on that, but I was disappointed in their last album.  It all sounded the same to me.<br /><br />Ok, back to the album.  It's simple.  The band doesn't use a whole lot of Dm7add9 type chords, its just the opposite where most musicians of average talent and a capo can handle the songs.  The beauty in their music lies within the band's songwriting/melody skills.  Honestly, when I first heard \\"Ho Hey\\", I was thinking to myself, \\"great, here we go again...another band that has a nice little jingle - aka one hit wonder, that won't be around tomorrow.\\"  But, after reading the lyrics and listening to the album, I was very much impressed with the raw approach of how they make their music so emotional and cinematic, with songwriting skills on par with that of Dylan or Vedder. After listening to the album all the way through at least 30 times, I feel like I can write a decent review of the tracks:<br /><br />1) Flowers in Your Hair - Great choice for the opener, though not my favorite.  Sets the mood quite well.<br />2) Classy Girls - Decent song, but feel its lacking instrumental depth.<br />3) Submarines - Yes, we're getting started here.  Love the depth, both instrumental and lyrical, here.  I've researched this song a little, and supposedly its about knowing something about someone (perhaps drug use or something and being worried), but no one believes a word.<br />4) Dead Sea - Good song, good timing of the minors.  Written about how the drummer's gf told him that he was her \\"Dead Sea\\" due to the salt content being so high, nothing can sink, so he will never let her down.<br/>5) Ho Hey - It's a good song and definitely worth noting, but I kinda get upset when I talk to people and this is the only song they know by them.<br />6) Slow it Down - Great song, supposedly about the band's instruments getting stolen when they were starting out, but it appears they applied the experience as a metaphor for maybe a relationship or something.<br />7) Stubborn Love - Excellent song, who hasn't been here?  Beautiful use of the entry of the strings.<br />8) Big Parade - Great song, love the visuals from the lyrics on this.  Still trying to figure out the song's meaning though.<br />9) Charlie Boy - Hands down, my favorite on the album.  About a soldier in the Vietnam War receiving a military burial.  The lyrics, again, create a visual that gives me chills.  The chorus, \\"Play the bugle, play the taps.  Make your mothers proud.  Raise your rifles, to the skies boys.  Fire that volley loud.\\"...is talking about a 21-gun salute.  This, combined with the chord progression, is perfectly matched.  Absolutely gorgeous.<br />10) Flapper Girl - Love the piano tune/melody.  Fun little swing beat matches the 1920's setting of the song.  Well done.<br />11) Morning Song - Again, who hasn't been here?  It's a little weak for a ballad, but does an excellent job of matching tempo, lyrics, and emotionality.<br /><br />I personally love this album.  It's very artsy, but not too abstract that the leh can't understand what's going on.  What I'm afraid to see, is that the band rushes the second album, or it becomes over-produced (and most here know what I mean).  If they rush the album, they could lose a lot of credibility.  Wes has the songwriting skill to make a dozen more albums, but its the ability to combine the songwriting, tempo, melody, progression, build-up, etc.. that make an album stand-out, and it's what this one does perfectly.
B000B589JI|2.0|The idea is to make sure the fluid does not leak when filled. Well upon filling the unit I noticed a distinctive smell lurking from my pocket.<br />Fluid had literarily soaked my pocket the Zippo canister was indeed defected I could not find a solution to stop the leak.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|This book blew me away! I've never read anything by Cassandra Clare before and now I'm excitedly looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the Mortal Instruments series. \\"City of Bones\\" pushes the limits of the imagination with the author's creativity and an exciting storyline. From the summary of the book, I wasn't expecting much, so I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised that this book had such a tremendous impact on me. It took me awhile to get into the story, but a few chapters in I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I've read the very last page. It had everything in it from supernatural creatures to magic, runes and spells. The action-filled plot was full of twists and surprises, and I really liked the characters. I'm still undecided as to whether I'm on team Simon or team Jace, because both of them are strong characters with redeeming qualities. What I know for sure is that I can't wait for the movie to be released. If you enjoy books with a dark plot, filled with suspense, drama and memorable characters, you absolutely have to read this book. It's worth the splurge!
1451638450|4.0|This is one of Bujold's Georgette Heyer romances (the light comedic ones, not the melodramas). It has some science fictional elements (biological/genetic division) mostly Macguffin-ish, some space opera (colonized planets, spaceships) that's mostly window dressing. At its heart, it's the story of an unambitious aristocrat, Ivan Vorpatril, and his marriage of convenience, which leads to true love, to Tej, refugee from a coup and daughter of one of those families whose eccentricities and machinations the hero has to contend with--in this case as they seek to obtain the financing needed to regain their position by undermining the fearsome Barrayaran ImpSec (pun intended). Though there are counterparts to this family in Heyer and other, chiefly English, writers, I was most reminded of the Lampreys from Ngaio Marsh's A Surfeit of Lampreys (U.S. title: The Death of a Peer). Various characters from the Vorkosigan universe put in cameo appearances. The first half of the book had me grinning a lot; the second half bogged down a little; the ending was satisfying. I read the e-book edition, bought directly from the publisher. Note to Georgette Heyer wannabes: This is how it's done. You don't need the Regency or Georgian background; not every hero has to be a Byronic duke. You do need the sense of humor.
B0015DROBO|1.0|This book came highly recommended by friends of mine. I got the Kindle version. I should have read the fine print that this was not text-to-speech ready. I can't return it, but I will not be \\"reading\\" this book. It's my fault, but what a waste of money.
1401307450|5.0|When I choose a new book at a bookstore (like most folks?) I proceed slowly and a bit methodilcally, browsing trhough several parts of a book to see if I want to buy it.  Particularly with biographies.  I was quite surprised browsing \\"Scar Tissue\\" before I bought it of how lengthy it was.  This auto-bio by Anthony Kiedis very in-depth, introspective and descriptive.  In auto-biographies by artists/musicians I expect more depth than a sports auto-bio which often focuses on the more physical aspects.  And Anthony Kiedis provides depth in \\"Scar Tissue.\\" The readers learn things he/she never knew, the reasons behind things, personalities and business angles.<br /><br />Within the first 30 pages or so, I was quite surprised at how open and honest Anthony Kiedis was.  He talks about a lot of things.  Things that most auto-biographies would not included.  Kudos to Kiedis.  I also learned a lot about Flea and the music business.<br /><br />From his early childhood, family life to his elementary, Jr. High, and high school years, Kiedis discusses his normal inner feelings during these times as well as his home-life.  His strong bonds with friends begin to bring the comraderie and details of the budding of RHCP.  Lots of uncertainty in the beginning of the band, which I suppose is common as bands form.  There are many factors that can bring a band down or cause it to dissolve or break up.  The drug use was constant as well as youthful escapades with the opposite sex.  The adventure of an open-minded youth in LA in the music scene.<br /><br />The writing style is like listening to someone talk about something - talk about anything - casually at the coffee table or a cup of coffee or a beer.  The writing is very well done and the vocabulary is higher level.<br /><br />These things make \\"Scar Tissue\\" an outstanding biography.<br /><br />Hopes, desires, wants, fears, ups and downs, in honest straightforward talk.<br /><br />Great auto-biography by Anthony Kiedis.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start by saying I didn't enjoy the movie, so I was hesitant to read the book. I obviously watched the movie before I read the book and found the movie so confusing I swore I wasn't going to read the book, but seeing as I purchased the book before I watched the movie, I begrudgingly started reading it. Guess what? I absolutely loved the book! I can't wait to read the second and third books in this magnificent series. One chapter into \\"The Hunger Games\\" and I was riveted. Every spare minute I could find was spent immerging myself into this masterpiece. Currently, I am team Peeta, but we'll see if I still feel the same after reading the other two books. I'm definitely going to watch the movie again since I now fully understand the story and the characters' background. I can't believe it took me so long to read this. I'm awed and impressed. Suzanne Collins, you have another fan!
1592332803|5.0|This is an excellent beginner's manual for anyone just starting out with a vegan diet. One of the biggest worries for new vegans with a sweet tooth is what desserts are possible when white sugar, milk and eggs are off limits. Look no farther--all your answers are here. In particular, there is an excellent section on substitutes for butter, milk and eggs.<br /><br />One of the most important parts of learning any new skill is figuring out how to fix mistakes. This cookbook helps with that by providing a \\"Troubleshooting\\" section which offers solutions for common problems in vegan cooking. There are also a series of Appendices with additional useful information.<br /><br />Of all the recipes I've tried so far, my favorites are the pancakes and cornbread.

If anything the slight changes in the original script added to it and made it even more adorable.

B0059XTU1S|4.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is loaded with so many spectacular scenes that I will want to see again.  The whole goblin battle that makes up the final third of the movie has so many individual awe-inspiring moments within it that the entertainment value of the movie is justified by that alone.  I saw The Hobbit:AUJ in IMAX 3D, and found this to be the best use of the 3D format I've seen since Avatar, though not quite at the same high level.  Both interior and exterior scenes really come alive.  Story-wise, it's been awhile since I read the book, but this movie doesn't seem to follow what I remember all that well -- not that it mattered too much to me, as I maintained interest throughout.  Only the early part of the movie felt too long, the section set in Bilbo's hobbit-hole (house), with Gandalf and the dwarves.  That definitely could have been cut in half and it only would have made TH:AUJ better. Finally, to those critics who are saying variations of \\"more of the same\\" in their reviews, maybe I'm too much of a LOTR nerd, but I won't ever complain about a new look into Peter Jackson's vision of Tolkein's world!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This has to be very close to the top of my list as extremely funny movies. One of the best of the bests. And Chevy Chase has so many facial expressions that remind me of my brother and his crazy humor,which makes this even more realistic to me. Thank you for a wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family to watch and laugh together with.

B0000AUHQT|5.0|I bought both movies of The Great Gatsby and Robert Redford, Mia Farrow was the best of the two movies. I also appreciate being able to have subtitles because I did not want to miss one word.  The other Great Gatsby said I would have to get it from my TV. I did not know how to do that but the other Gatsby was not as good and did not explain things that were occuring as well<br /><br />i intend to watch it again and again.....I found it delightful and thrilling
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|i find this game to be worth my time. just the right amount of challenge and great clues and a map for the where am i`s. And the graphics are great, not overdone, clean.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I listed to this on Audible during a 6 hour drive by myself. Having listened to it; I think I would prefer listening to the narrated story rather than reading it.<br /><br />This is told in a flashback to present and back fashion and told by several characters, very interesting and makes you keep wondering--- who killed Libby Day's family? What happened?  And why?  Why was Libby spared... did her brother do it, and for those that grew up in the 80s, the Devil Worship rumors totally make sense!!<br /><br />At times I felt bad for Libby, then others not so much when she decided she couldn't work, but rather lets take advantage of Lyle and the Kill Club... but the way the story is told, you're supposed to.. but then not!  Well written overall!!<br /><br />Whether you read it or listen to it, I highly recommend this story to anyone that reads mystery and suspense, because you have it all right there!<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much I just downloaded Gone Girl on Audible, makes those road trips and boring days just fly by while you clean house...

0753539470|5.0|In a world where the masses think they need to be successful before they can be happy, we have solid research at the highest level to prove people who are Happy have a much greater chance of being Successful. Another great book showing that how we think, the attitude about our circumstance and how we perform daily activities are a better measurement of success, I have a plaque at my cabin that says &#34;I have noticed the better attitude I have, the better day I have&#34;. When I focus on my gratitude's the happier person I am and the better servant leader I can be. That brings me closer to the success I desire. Thank you Shawn for validating this for me with solid science. You are terrific and this book should be read by all who are striving to be successful.

B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|This is an autobiographical story of poet Mark O'Brien who was stricken by polio and spent much of his life in an iron lung.  In 1988 at the age of 38 he decides he wants to lose his virginity.  A sure bet for an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes plays O'Brien.  Hawkes' already thin frame is reduced even more to where his muscle tone approaches that of a polio victim.  His acting is mostly confined to his vocal inflections and facial expressions.<br /><br />Before going much further, let's be clear about one thing.  This isn't a dower, conventional weepy film.  If anything it's uplifting.  O'Brien is a funny guy and some of the scenes between him and his understanding priest (William H. Macy) are some of the best in the film.  Once O'Brien gets the Church's go ahead, he hires a sex surrogate (excellent Helen Hunt) to guide him through his ultimate goal.  While there is nothing overly salacious in the scenes involving O'Brien and Cheryl (Hunt), they are pretty graphic.  Ms. Hunt in particular, leaves little to the imagination.<br /><br />Perhaps under-appreciated in the film is O'Brien's caretakers.  One, played by Moon Bloodgood, I found particularly interesting.  I would have liked to have seen her role a bit meatier.  Perhaps it is no surprise, that in spite of O'Brien's physical limitations, he's quite the hit with the ladies, especially those closest to him.  Director and writer Ben Lewin does a nice balancing act, given the sexual and religious overtones.  The movie is well photographed giving a strong sense of reality of Berkeley, California in the late 1980's.  Excellent film.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE:  The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Even for those used to seeing quality in Blu ray discs will appreciate the perfection of this issue. It is absolutely gorgeous in terms color, clarity and sharpness. I saw nothing in terms of image anomalies. This is a dialog centered film so the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds. The dialog is clear and audible throughout the film. Here is a list of extras:<br />*Deleted Scenes (HD, 3:34)<br />*Writer/Director Ben Lewin Finds Inspiration (HD, 4:01)<br />*John Hawkes Becomes Mark O'Brien (HD, 4:26)<br />*Helen Hunt as the Sex Surrogate (HD, 4:13)<br />*A Session with the Cast (HD, 3:50)<br />*The Women Who Loved Mark O'Brien (HD, 4:24)<br />*Theatrical Trailer (HD, 2:26)<br />*Sneak Peek (HD, 11:04)5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Probably the best of the trilogy.  It moves from start to finish.  I absolutely could not put it down.  It is a good idea to read this before seeing the movie.  It fills in some gaps even though the movie is reasonably true to the book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why people talk about this book??? For me was entire garbage. The writing is awful, the ideas are just poor. Is seemed like Pretty Woman, except she is virgin and there is some mommy porn...

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This move was very dull, and nearly half-way through the movie, I considered shutting it off because of the overt racism.  It is basically a live action episode of Family guy that resorted to asian jokes from the 1950s.  The acting was horrible and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Seriously, save the money and avoid this movie.

B007SSEBCU|4.0|Although I usually don't watch movies like this one, I found this movie very interesting with excellent acting. The movie is done as a recollection of the past and at times it's somewhat difficult to follow.  Meryl Streep's acting was excellent and it was hard to remember that you were watching an actress, not a documentary of Margaret Thatcher herself.<br />I will probably watch the movie again.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Is there an author of Historical Romance who can top Courtney Milan? I think not. She writes with the intelligence and wit that I like in my reading choices. The beauty of Ms Milan is that she never allows her intelligence and wit to overshadow her story or her characters. Rather, her characters snap and sparkle off the page with tremendously well crafted dialogue and action that make the story zoom to life.<br />I looked forward to the publishing date of The Duchess War. I looked forward to being absorbed by the story and the richness of world she writes for my enjoyment.  I was not disappointed.<br />I adore Robert and Minnie.  They are vibrant, true to their individual story, and very sexy people.<br />A must read for those who enjoy 19 Century England and who love a well written novel.

The songs aren't as consistently beautiful as the original, but there are a few gems among them.  Raoul is very different that the original character.  I don't like the vilification of the Giry family.  But over all, it was very amusing.

0140186409|4.0|Another book group choice that I openly groaned about at first.  I have only read one other of this authors books, \\"Of Mice and Men\\", and while I loved that book (and the film) I thought that this book would be a painful struggle to get through.<br /><br />I was right about it being a struggle to read and almost gave up at page 105.  However, I am glad that I kept on reading to the end.  It is a book that has many different facets to it and will make a thoroughly interesting discussion for a book group.<br /><br />The story is a hard one to read because it is just still too real in today's society, where there is enough for everyone but the rich would rather destroy it than distribute it to the needy.  Now I am not a Socialist by any description but this book certainly did make me think strong and hard about it.  I am looking forward to discussing this aspect of the book with my Russian friend who was brought up in the most extreme end of the socialist scale in Russia.<br /><br />The writing style was varied throughout the book.  Some parts of it were very descriptive and emotional and really drew me into the feelings of the characters while there were whole chapters that I thought were just too wordy and did not add significantly to the book as a whole.  I, initially, struggled with the vernacular of the migrants on the road but eventually got used to their way of speaking and, in fact, it made it feel more real to me and put me beside them in their lives.<br /><br />The ending was intense and somewhat shocking to me but it did give me back some hope in the goodness of humans that had been stripped from me by the rest of the book.<br /><br />4 out of 5 with one star deducted because it was a struggle and could not be described as an enjoyable read and would not be for everyone.  I would suggest starting with \\"Of Mice and Men\\" if you have not read any of this authors works before as I think this book would put you off reading any of his other books.  However, put it on your list of books to read before you die.<br /><br />Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person!  And that is my closing thought.on your list of books to read before you die.<br /><br />Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person!

B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, so it was very important to me that the blu-ray home version was suitable.  My expectations were met.  The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray, and the special features are great.  I particularly liked the deleted scenes, they were very illuminating.  I would like to have a director's cut at a later date that includes all the deleted scenes in their intended context.  In the meantime, you couldn't ask for a better home version that this.

I got sucked into the story because I'm a total sucker for cheesy chick lit.. but the smut was kinda dumb (isn't that the whole point of this book) and the writing was atrocious. The number of horrible grammatical errors and typos are embarrassing and completely unacceptable. I mean, did ANYone read this book before it went to print? I would be mortified if I published something so riddled with mistakes (really it was too many to count. Places where you could tell she started a sentence one way and changed it, but didn't change the tense of the pronoun. This is beyond amateur).<br /><br />And then there's geographical anomalies.. if you write a book about another country, you might want to make sure that the characters say things that would actually fit into their character. Isn't that like Writing 101? For instance, American's don't use the word \\"smart\\" in the same context. They just don't. And it makes the character seem illogical when they say it every 10 minutes (and god does she say it constantly). And a redneck fisherman.. probably not going to be interested in soccer. I don't care how you try to rationalize it. American's watch football (I realize every other country calls soccer football, but wouldn't it then just have been easier to say that he liked football?) Why even bother writing a book taking place in another country if you don't do your research.<br /><br />But the thing that infuriates me the most is that this total buffoon is raking in the cash on the idiocy of people that must not know any better (I have no other explanation for the popularity). I guess the highlight of this book is the realization that it obviously isn't very hard to write a novel. Maybe I can make a career in writing after all..

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator if you just need to do basic math. The big display is perfect for using while shopping. I've tried them all and this one is by far the best.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|It came fast and accurate as a birthday present for my 11 yr old daughter who is a huge taylor swift fan It was perfect
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I don't get the hype. I got sucked into the story because I'm a total sucker for cheesy chick lit.. but the smut was kinda dumb (isn't that the whole point of this book) and the writing was atrocious. The number of horrible grammatical errors and typos are embarrassing and completely unacceptable. I mean, did ANYone read this book before it went to print? I would be mortified if I published something so riddled with mistakes (really it was too many to count. Places where you could tell she started a sentence one way and changed it, but didn't change the tense of the pronoun. This is beyond amateur).<br /><br />And then there's geographical anomalies.. if you write a book about another country, you might want to make sure that the characters say things that would actually fit into their character. Isn't that like Writing 101? For instance, American's don't use the word \\"smart\\" in the same context. They just don't. And it makes the character seem illogical when they say it every 10 minutes (and god does she say it constantly). And a redneck fisherman.. probably not going to be interested in soccer. I don't care how you try to rationalize it. American's watch football (I realize every other country calls soccer football, but wouldn't it then just have been easier to say that he liked football?) Why even bother writing a book taking place in another country if you don't do your research.<br /><br />But the thing that infuriates me the most is that this total buffoon is raking in the cash on the idiocy of people that must not know any better (I have no other explanation for the popularity). I guess the highlight of this book is the realization that it obviously isn't very hard to write a novel. Maybe I can make a career in writing after all..
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I just bought this cd at Best Buy and I LOVE IT! EVery one of her cds get better and better. Her music is good and I jam to it weither Im driving, or working out. Its a great buy!!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|thank you I love this game. I like any game that keeps your mind sharp.many hours of fun the whole family gets involved. good family time.
0062011847|5.0|I dearly love Pratchett's discworld.  This installment in the Vimes cycle does not disappoint.  This book explores the injustices done to goblins on the disc.  Some highlights are new goblin characters, more young Sam, and as always, Lady Sybil is a treat.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book.  It had me hooked right from the beginning and it made you want to hang in there and root for the main character.  It was touching and very accurately portrayed the emotions of a young woman who comes from a background lacking love and full of neglect.  I think it also keenly showed how difficult motherhood can be and particularly so for a mother who comes from the main character's sort of background.  It was a very emotional read for me.  I don't know much about the author but she must know firsthand what it's like to grow up in a similar manner as the main character because I don't know otherwise how you could write a book like this from a point of such empathy and keen awareness of the character's experiences.  It's worth the money and time to read this book.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Very fun game over all.  Like that you can take your own pace at playing.  Would get more from this maker.
B0069P0DU2|5.0|This was a present and it is fantastic.  The cube are great and come out perfect.  No breaking like some other molds.  Makes the cocktail hour even more fun.
B004FK8RKG|4.0|I really like how these are attached with velcro, since it's easy to take them out of my helmet when I'm not using them. They don't get super loud, which is a bonus in my opinion - I want to be able to hear my music and traffic at the same time. I can still hear music with an open face helmet when going 30-50mph on my scooter.<br /><br />There's not much bass, so if you're looking for awesome sound quality, these aren't the headphones for you. But if you're looking for a nice way to listen to music in the background while you ride, these definitely deliver.
B001DQH8Z0|5.0|Sounds best when turned up very loud. Extra points awarded for ridiculous &#34;Dark wizard taking a bong hit&#34; cover.<br /><br />The songs are good, though. They're very long and you have to like doom metal or stoner rock at least a little bit to get through the whole things but it's definitely worth it.
0307474259|4.0|This book was very easy to understand and tells you exactly why we get fat and how to reverse it along with other conditions we face because of excess fat mainly.  I would recommend it to most people who are concerned about how to lose weight.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|this is a great action movie, the price was perfect, the shipment arrived safely as well, great job by everyone involved
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave was amazing. Great movie...kids enjoyed it..I would recommend purchasing the DVD. it was worth the wait and fun for the entire family
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I love it ! since I hate shocking/shiny watches, this one works for my taste. Recommended for those who find style within simplicity.
B00002N9ER|5.0|They are plastic BUT &#34;strong&#34; plastic it holds the light very tight no slop or falling out you have to pull to get it to release i will order more for my other trucks and tractor I am happy with them pretty well built for plastic.
0316227706|5.0|Such a great book for all ages - guaranteed to produce smiles!!! Can't decide who to give it to for the holiday.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Like many other reviewers I love H.O games &amp; have played dozens of them. I'm learning which &quot;demos &quot; to avoid, but I agree it should be way more clear. I also wish you could just buy some of these games from the start with the price up front instead of trying to figure out if you're playing a $2.99,$4.99, or $6.99 game &amp; should bother in the first place.<br /><br />Messages keep popping up constantly in these games requesting reviews, but I wish developers would actually read more of these reviews so they understand what people are looking for and willing to pay for.<br /><br />Ok,  so all that venting done, this game was very good overall and I would recommend it. It is a demo to start,  but there is a lot of game time. Just when I thought I was done,  it kept going and going. Both the story &amp; graphics were also great. There were some points where it was unresponsive on the Kindle Fire &amp; glitches where even pinching the screen it was hard to select objects.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This proves a point that Nolan at his not-so-best is still better than most of the other directors.<br /><br />Very entertaining movie. But Mr. Nolan we need you to put in more effort. Please!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Really enjoyed it very much. My kids liked it. Very good quality video and sound. Thank you! Pretty good! Excellent and good deal.
1907590331|5.0|this book is the best book that i have ever read in my life, and its very easy to read and understand. you will enjoy reading but the ending is kind of sad thou
0316226424|3.0|My friend's an avid fan of this Twilight Saga, she even bought the set of book just to read it (couldn't get enough!) She lent it to me a way back when I was bored to death. It was a fun read, I decided to not read the last book which is, this Breaking Dawn to make me wanna see the movie and be surprised. Alas! I just saw the movie and it was all but good!<br /><br />I analyze the story and how it made up to the point on filming it, I get it the romance concept, which is be in love forever (as they're vampires) is what every humans wants. It captivated mostly the teenagers and any young at heart.<br /><br />I liked Jacob and his character (werewolf), I was just annoyed to see they didn't look like werewolves like on the \\"Underworld\\" movie like the Lycans, but looked like a pet/dog.<br /><br />Bella's conceiving a baby right after being \\"succubied\\" if that's a term(just made that up) made me think, well, maybe it's a changeling? Somebody else's baby? I'm not sure if vampire can be a succubus? As far as I know, a vampire is really different from succubus. Now that got me confused in all the mythologies and stuffs..<br /><br />All in all, I can say it's a fun read ;)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Story is told from the dog's (Enzo is his name) perspective and moves quickly with remarkable insights about the family and circumstances that occur. I found this most enjoyable and similar in style to Nicholas Sparks type books but not at all sappy. You don't have to like race cars or be an animal person to enjoy this book.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Man if only I knew better and saw it earlier. The trailer is so terrible that it doesn't reflect at all what a great movie this is.<br /><br />Angelina did such a fantastic job, the acting was just flawless and the movie kept me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. For such mature and top of the notch acting she should have gotten an Oscar. She really should.<br /><br />The plot is well-written, full of twists, and the directing was fantastic.<br /><br />It is just a flawless movie. I can't believe I missed out on it for such a long time.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  I think it depicts the aspects of space very well.  Blue-ray makes it look 100 times better than DVD.  I would buy this for anyone who is into Sci-Fi.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So I'm officially obsessed.  If I could only climb inside this series and live amongst the characters, I could die happy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Title says it all...  I miss them already and can't wait til April to hear from Travis and Abby again!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|being a huge Stephen King fan for me this is a very cool game I just bought it today and am really enjoying thus far
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book, the third of the series, is like the others and required reading to follow a wonderful story by R. R. Martin. Once started, this work is almost impossible to put down. I am stating the next book immediately.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I had no idea that when my plane ride to NYC would be delayed due to weather, they offered us free movies.  Being a person who loves Christmas movies, I chose Arthur Christmas.  I had no idea what it was about.  I enjoyed this movie.  While it is not a classic movie, it is a family movie.  There is no violence and all clean language.  I was thoroughly entertained all thru the severe turbulence of the aircraft.  It was funny, sincere and all together a very nice Christmas movie.  I recommend it to people of all ages.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|This is a powerful and engrossing movie that will grab your attention from the first scene. It starts as your standard story: Ryan (the star), is a loner who has little to say and minds his own business. He is a movie stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals as a sideline. He falls for his beautiful neighbor who's husband is in jail. The best part of the movie is their interactions, which are very sensual even though they say very little to each other and are never physical. It is their looks and what they do not say that will drive you over the edge. This is the only movie I have seen where silence says more than words. The pace of this film is a beautiful thing to behold. The movie is loaded with tension which slowly builds to a violent climax. This is the best movie I have seen in a while. It is a phenomenally entertaining movie.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I love this show. You do have to be in the mood for crazy comedy to fully appreciate it though.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This movie was a huge let-down. The jokes are bad and the story is hard to follow and seemed like little thought was put into creating a compelling story. I was really looking forward to this movie because I thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments. This one had real potential because of it taking place in 1969. There were real possibilities of humor that was missed due to a lack of imagination on the part of the writers.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|was given this cd as a gift many years ago, enjoyed it so much i decided to buy it as a gift for a friend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|While not quite as good as the first, Catching Fire was definitely worth my time and did a fantastic job of continuing the story. I'm excited to see how it all wraps up in Mockingjay. If you enjoyed Hunger Games, start this book but have patience as it once again needs a little time to pick up momentum. Come the middle, the pages could turn fast enough to create a breeze ;)
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Besides what others have written here, I enjoyed turning on Coppola's comments when watching the movies for insights to some of the best movies ever made
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I'm a big fan of Maroon 5 and I really enjoyed this album. Songs are very catchy especially One More Night.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I love this CD so much. It was so worth buying. It came in almost perfect condition. There were like these holes nailed in the top left corner, but had no affect to anything else.
0446672653|5.0|absolutely enjoyed this book..very spiritual and made sense of a lot of things for me. would definetly recommend to someone with an open mind!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A great story and it brought back lots of memories when we spent 1yr in the south during the desegration of the colleges.  We had a black girl in our girl scout troup and were told not to try and go anywhere of the base with her...how sad...
B007L4HFDI|5.0|Toby Macguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe all do a great job in this action packed movie from 2002.  Toby is a fantastic actor, really plays Spiderman as a vulnerable yet strong, complicated super-hero.  Haven't seen the newest Spiderman released 2012, I think, but I don't need to!  Can't imagine it would compare to this one!
B008476HBM|5.0|A true classic for any Jane Austin fan. Kindle version was very nice to read through. As much as I love paperback go ahead and use the kindle version.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|It was not even open, it was perfect. My brother will love it. There weren't scratches. It came two days after me ordering it
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Found this a great help in my conversion to kindle... which is far more complicated than you'd think! But by following this guide, my kindle version of the novel, Running Against Time: How I ended up at the top of Mount Fuji, worked out perfectly.
B000007SPT|5.0|I came upon this album when I first listened to \\"Song to the Siren,\\" which has enthralled my whole being. I had never heard anything like it before and so brought this album, I really did. A number of the beautiful songs has become my favorites and I often listen to them whenever I get a chance:<br /><br />\\"Song To The Siren\\"<br />\\"Holocaust\\"<br />\\"Dreams Made Flesh\\"<br />\\"Waves Become Wings\\"
0446554995|4.0|I have to admit to being an Aloysius X. Pendergast fan before he was even a main character, back when Lincoln and Childs were moderately successful at writing Sci-fi thrillers, e.g., Relic, where Pendergast makes his first appearance.  But since then, nothing that the team has written as a solo or a pair has captured me like the Pendergast novels.  Such an incredibly rich backstory and L&C see fit to divulge only teeny bits at a time.  In fact, I recently read a piece in my local newspaper by Lee Childs about how to write fiction (it, too, was wonderful) where the main point was to keep the reader in suspense, literally, by simply planting questions in his mind and then not resolving them, until much, much later.  This is one of the best in the series.  Howevever, to get the most out of it, if you are not a long-time fan, then I suggest you first read (at least!!) the last two the series first: Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance.<br /><br />So here we have the conclusion (?) of a multi-arc piece involving Constance, Pendergast's \\"ward\\" or amanuensis, Helen, his long-lost wife,  Corrie, his young would-be protog&eacute;, and the ever present Nazis.  And the seeds of suspense (many of them) are planted and nurtured, and seem to be unrelated, with no answers possible, and red herrings abound, stinking up the joint in a wonderful fashion, right through to the end.<br /><br />The writing is as crisp and as fresh as in the long ago \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\", and all our favorites are here - Vinnie, Captain Hayward, Italian beauty Viola and more....  Sorry , but no more details.  There are as many twists and turns as a Great Adventures roller coaster, and I don't want to give away any of them.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, while the ending was a bit over the top (hence 4 rather than 5 stars), I devoured the novel in 18 hours and left completely satisfied.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />J.M. Tepper
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I started playing and could not stop it is fast paced and exciting. I Have invited more friends to play
B0091LS07E|5.0|Hi, I'm a Big fan so maybe I am a little biased.<br /><br />I've read a couple of reviews before I bought the CD and I was terrified though. Thank God I did not follow those.... Everybody is entitled to their opinion. I guess Alicia now realizes she will never please everybody and has said that on this record too with songs like Brand new me... She has her own voice and her own opinion and own take on stuff. I appreciate her for that and love this new her!<br /><br />Back to the CD:<br /><br />This CD you can feel the passion she has for music and her emotions when it comes down to writing the songs. I feel personally it's a very personal but yet fun album and I LOVE LOVE it. All the songs fit together nicely.<br /><br />Brand new me (Personal Favourite) So deep and emotional song speaking of finaly finding your own independence as a person and taking your place and not being afraid of standing up for yourself. Awesome!<br /><br />When it's all over it's growing on me man I'm telling you and with the adittion of lil Egypt at the end Such a cute song. If this isn't getting personal I don't know what is... This song is about recognizing the things that are important in life and those matters when it's all over.<br /><br />Listen to your heart, such a jam man I love this. This continues the declaration of Listen to yourself because nobody knows you better. look inside cause the answer is allready within.<br /><br />New day, a crazy beat song good for fun listen and you recognize the theme of the album right now. This is me a new path for me!<br /><br />Girl on Fire ( My new dressing up cleaning the house anthem) It's an empowering song, telling you that you are what you are and it's ok and Awesome being that way. You are perfectly fine being you and you are on Fire.<br /><br />Fire we make.... This song is sexy and soulfull waow and hot man<br /><br />Tears always win... This song got me crying man just described my heart when it was broken.<br /><br />Not even the king: It's I I aint't got you in a different way and more intimate. I love this song so much another crying my heart out song.<br /><br />That's when I knew. OMG I think I'm definately biased! Lol There's a part in there so soulfull can't stop listening.<br /><br />Limitedless, I can't stop dancing to this.<br /><br />One thing and 101 are also Awesome too.<br /><br />I think over the years a lot of people were telling her she doesn't do personal songs. If this album isn't personal than I don't know what is. It wasn't too R&B it was too pop, but when she do R&B than it's not too Pop enough. People are always going to say bad things.  Artist are allowed to have their own take on stuff and their own point of view. Yess we as fans expect that they give us what we want but Not Everybody can and will be pleased all the time. People need to evolve just like the music is evolving. She is and will always be an Awesome lady agreat singer-songwriter/pruducer/arranger.<br /><br />Just go buy the album and listen to the words and the music together pay attention on the meanings of the songs, it will get to you.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|It's a fun movie and a great addition to an endearing body of work. It's his lighter work which he's so well regarded for and which I imagine, as time goes by, we may see less and less of has he continues to seek out more dramatic material.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I heard about this movie from a friend, it was every bit plus more of what she said about it.  I loved it and have watched it with my granddaughter!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|If I could have figured out which four minutes of tape were occupied by the song \\"The Love is Gone\\" as a child, I would surely have attempted to slice them out of my VHS copy, doctor it back together, and pop it back in the VCR for an infinitely more enjoyable viewing experience. Would this have worked? Probably not. I have never been applauded for my excellent motor skills. Moreover, surgery is not really my forte (ask the countless Barbies that lost heads during attempted transplants). Would it have been worth the risk to try? You betcha.<br /><br />That somebody recognized my deepest desire and undertook this task for me is the most heartwarming Christmas gift (subcategory: Muppet themed) I could ever have hoped to receive. Disney, 364 days of the year we recognize the scheming, corporate \\"Man\\" most people want to stick it to (For Pete's sake, Man, you now control the Empire that controls galaxies far, far away! Does nothing escape your greedy grasp?), but on Christmas Eve you are the \\"Man\\" in the most tubular sense of the word, Man. Respect.
0385742886|2.0|The concept of this prequel (and overall series) is extremely appealing. It's nice to have a \\"Walking Dead for kids\\" type of series available.<br /><br />I mention that to point out that I realize this book is targeted towards younger readers. However, that does not excuse the terrible dialogue throughout the entire book. In one scene, the characters are held at gun point by a man and his girlfriend/wife/slave. This allegedly fearsome killer says things like easy-peesey and other completely non-threatening, stupid things. Who points a gun at someone and says easy-peesey? Yes, I realize there is not going to be swearing or vulgarity in these books. However, I have read enough literature for younger readers and watched enough TV and movies to have seen excellent dialogue that convincingly conveys menace and danger without the characters sounding like idiots.<br /><br />Furthermore, all of the characters speak with the same voice. How many people in real life say everything is \\"nice and [fill in the blank]\\"? Almost every character in this book uses that phrase. Almost everyone says \\"pretty little head\\" or \\"pretty little butt\\" or whatever. Who talks like that, especially characters that are trying to be tough or scary? Because of the bad dialogue, every character seems the same and none are unique. I noticed this in the previous trilogy, but it was extremely bad in this book. An author must be able to make each character sound different, to convey personality, emotions, background, varying experiences. In this book, they all sound like they have watched really, really bad late night movies.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game just like I love the movies. I get on it and hours later I'm still glue there's always something for you to do..... the game is just awesome!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Awesome book, except I don't like the end it's just kind of a weird ending.  Happy and yet not compeletly happy at the same time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great journey.  Lots of twists and turns.  You don't want to put it down!  You'll want to finish in one setting.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|Huge Coldplay fan! I've been to the last two shows Viva La Vida and Mylo Xyloto. This Blu-Ray and CD that comes with it is awesome. Gives you a chance to relive the Xylto show and the Xylo bands. The CD is great too, for those who didn't get the LeftRightLeftRightLeft live album from the Viva tour (which I recommend as well). I really love how they redid God Put a Smile Upon Your Face, just brilliant! Love Coldplay and would recommend to anybody!
B004PR71JC|5.0|My  5 kids (ranging in age from 6 months to 10 years) all love this music.  We turn it up and all of sing along.  Worth every penny :)
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|First I want to say that the people who don't like this, hugger off and go cry in ur pillow, because nobody should be treated that way. I that u should all rate it 5000 stars, because this is adorably fun for everyone, and I'm twelve!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book.  It's so frustrating how they can't figure things out and yet so good a the same time.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Case is a great easel and exposes the speakers very well. Makes watching movies a first class experience. I love it!
0345803485|2.0|I don't like the way it is written, the language, and the subject matter, but bought the book to find out why it is selling so well.
B009NCM248|4.0|Just got this CD but it sounds awesome.  Better than anything I've heard from them yet.  Corey Taylor sounds pissed off on some songs, which makes them even better if you ask me.  I don't consider this nu metal like Linkin Park;  it's regular in your face metal, with some slower stuff thrown in too, but not too much.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Solid in all respects from the animation to the audio. The story line is about a kid who is a math whiz who gets an email having a very long series of seemingly random letters and numbers in it, and without considering anything or seeing who sent it, breaks the code and sends the result back to its sender, with a typo thus getting his avatar and account jacked. This causes everyone to assume him to be the author of a hostile takeover of a virtual world... and telling the rest would spoil it.<br />I highly recommend purchasing this for your own collection.<br />Well worth the price.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I found the movie a little slow in some places, but overall entertaining and a great message about taking care of your environment.  My 8 year old loves it and would watch it over and over, if allowed.
0446554995|5.0|Have enjoyed all of this quirky FBI agents series along with most of the other books by these authors. Will look forward to the next book.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Game play:<br /><br />The app immediately starts in the story mode and the schools headmaster talks to you. This game is a find the hidden objects game and one of the things I have learned in playing these types of games is to turn up the brightness of your display to make the hidden objects easier to locate.<br /><br />In the first level you have to find all of the hidden documents. You can pan and zoom into the room to make it easier to see the items you are looking for. The question mark reminds you of the objective of the level you are in. If you make random taps you are penalized by losing precious seconds from your allotted search time. If you touch the light bulb on the top of the screen then you get a hint as to where an item might be.<br /><br />The next level you get to find hidden objects by only knowing their outline. Once you beat that level you are asked to share your winning a trophy win with your friends on Facebook or twitter. Tap the very small x in the upper RH corner of the award window and shut it down if you down not want to share on the social networks.<br /><br />You next get to search your sisters room where she stayed before she disappeared. Touch the map and go there. A spell is cast to remove the things in the room that were there before she arrived. This part of the game is to find the differences but one major difference is that you cannot zoom or pan on the screen as it is split into two shots of the room and you have to locate the items that do not match.<br /><br />You then get to find items in her room and when you complete you get another trophy. It asks you again to share winning the trophy with your friends on Facebook and twitter.<br /><br />Starting the third level you are asked to rate the game with a link to Amazon.<br /><br />Main screen:<br /><br />Options allows you to set the music volume, the sound effects volume, the countdown mode and display to full screen.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />I like this type of puzzle game where you have to find the hidden challenges. The graphics on this app are very clear and well done. The storyline so far has been good and I have enjoyed playing the game. I like the graphics a lot and I like how the pan and zoom works.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />Without pan and zoom in the find the differences sections the game is more difficult as some of the items are hard to see. This would be even more difficult on a small screen smart phone for example.<br /><br />The game asks you every two levels to post your trophies on Facebook or twitter. There is not any NO button so it continually asks you which I think it should have a NO button and stop asking you once you say no. Turn off your WIFI and set your parental controls if your children are going to use your device.<br /><br />This app has full access to your Internet and your device ID. This could be to register the game as a benign use but it can also be used for other items that are not so friendly. You have to make a choice if you like this game.<br /><br />Starting the third level you are asked to rate the game on Amazon with a link to the web.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I like this game and have fun playing it. I breezed through multiple levels and enjoyed them. The graphics were good and I think the game for me is one that I will finish. I don't think these types of games have much replay value if you have a good memory as you will just go through it the second time easily.<br /><br />I give this game a 5 star rating and I would get it while it is free. It is worthwhile to play and enjoy.<br /><br />Size: The app is 19 MB compressed and 26.72 MB uncompressed<br /><br />Permissions:<br />*Network communication - full Internet access<br />*Storage - modify/delete storage contents<br />*Hardware controls - change your audio settings<br />*Phone calls - read Kindle state and identity<br />*System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />*Network communication - view network statuss
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very funny adult movie.  I hadn't had so many laughs in a comedy in a long time this is a great movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Brilliant piece of software. Should have been included in the Kindle package, together with the charger. The weather one is good too.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is very helpful, I have it on all my devices.  It tells you what wireless signals are available around you, which ones are stronger than the others, and is overall a good tool!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am using this app on both an old Kindle Fire and a new Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;.  I find it easy to use and very informative.  I often keep track of the weather in 3 or 4 locations on it.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|haven't had it very long and already the top has little tears in it.  I am very careful and it never leaves my purse unless i am reading it.
B000P12LWY|5.0|As soon I watched the first season, I was hooked. It is packed full of drama, sex, lies, lust, treason, violence, action....everything needed for a well rounded show. In school we may have learned a little about Henry VIII, but I feel this rendition of his life as a leader is well put. He was a snake at best. So happy this series came out, but sad to see it end. Would love to see a series take off of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and bought all three episodes.  Read them all in a couple of weeks.  Great story lines.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I downloaded this app for my smartphone and linked it with my Amazon acct.  It works flawlessly!! I can now shop Amazon from my mobile phone!!
0061969664|3.0|&#34;Death of Kings&#34; by Bernard Cornwell<br /><br />The year is 899. The Saxons and Danes are locked in a centuries-old struggle for the British Isles. King Alfred the Great of Wessex is dying, the Danes are on the move, and in the middle of it all strides Saxon Lord Uhtred.<br /><br />The story opens with yet another attempt on Uhtred's life. Who, he wonders as he handily dispatches his attackers, wants him dead now? The Danes whom Uhtred has repeatedly defeated in battle? Another Saxon king who knows Uhtred has sworn allegiance to Alfred? Another unknown player in this deadly chess game?<br /><br />Complicating things is the pleasing presence of Aetheflaed, King Alfred's willful daughter and the wife of Lord Aethelred of Mercia. She is Uhtred's lover and the only person in Britain brave enough to disobey his orders, something in which she takes great delight in doing.<br /><br />Assisting Uhtred are Osferth, Alfred's bastard son and Finan, an Irish noble who dreams of accumulating enough funds from pillaging to lead an army to take back his ancestral home. Together these men hack and stab their way through one battle after another.<br />This is the sixth novel in Cornwell's series about Lord Uhtred. Readers may already be familiar with this prolific writer through his many popular novels, and subsequent television series featuring Napoleonic Wars rifleman Richard Sharpe.<br /><br />The story takes us through battles and marches, plots and betrayals, with Lord Uhtred relying on his sword, Serpent Breath, and his even sharper wits as he fights and connives to preserve the throne of what will one day become England.<br /><br />Reviewed by Andrew MacRae, author of &#34;Murder Misdirected&#34; for Suspense Magazine
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|It is a reasonable glimpse of the future political challenges and public opinion?  Are we ready to accept another industrial revolution.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Gee, I did not read that Mr. Obama went along on this mission.<br /><br />Also, when this book came out, there were comments from the Pentagon and/or CIA that the author was revealing classified information; that is not true from what I read in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book! Now I can't wait to read the rest! Going to get them now.
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy was amazing!! I was sad when it was over and can't wait to find another read similar to it!
B000IY03DM|5.0|Great for driving..Very fast shipping.... Great for traveling. IL Divo is a beautifully blended voices.Very relaxing. Great prices.<br />I ordered two different ones
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I haven't played this game a lot, but it seems to be almost as fun as Angry Birds. I wasn't quite sure what was supposed to be accomplished on a couple of the levels, so I had to repeat them. Maybe it's just because I'm more of a puzzle or mind game person so it takes me a bit to get the hang of this type of game playing. I think my kids would have fun with it.
0399160450|3.0|Love author and have read most of his other books. Ben waiting for this one to come out. Giving as a Christmas gift
B0028BAWU2|5.0|I love this series.. just recently got into it and I'm hooked!  This is a gift for a friend, but I may have to borrow it every now and then!
0345803485|5.0|This trilogy was amazing!! I was sad when it was over and can't wait to find another read similar to it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a spacial challenge. I have really enjoyed improving my skills with reasoning. Simple, yet challenging! I have to pay attention to time as I do tend to lose track when playing.
B006X415GK|5.0|This was my daughter's first Monster High doll, but I'm sure it won't be her last. After seeing many of her friends playing with them she decided it was time to get one of her own. She spent some of her birthday money to buy this one and seems to be happy with it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I wish I could give 10 or 20 stars to this album.  It is, by far, the most outstanding album Susan has done to date!  Phenomenal work, both in song selection and the artistry with which she delivers each song.
0307887960|4.0|After having tried most of the well-known diets, and lost and gained weight, I decided it was time for something radical.  And the Dukan Diet is exactly that.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you start out by eating only low-fat protein for several days, and then move into alternating days of all protein and protein/vegetables.  NO carbs.<br /><br />The pro: It's easy to follow because basically you are restricted to 100 foods and nothing else.  There is no counting calories or carbs, no controlling portions  You can either eat a food or you can't.<br /><br />The con: It's expensive, it's time consuming, and I don't believe it's sustainable in the long term.  If you have ten to 20 pounds to lose, not so bad.  But if you have more than that, you could easily have to be on this diet for two years.<br /><br />The verdict:  I had great success, but the amount of time it took me to prepare food was too much.  I have transitioned to a more \\"normal\\" low carb diet and I'm still losing, if not as fast.  I would go back on the Dukan again for a few weeks to jump start weight loss if I plateau.  The Dukan Diet is worth the try, and it does work!
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy was amazing!! I was sad when it was over and can't wait to find another read similar to it!
B002LVVCQM|3.0|Can not recommend the kindle version. The text is great, but the pics on the kindle version are terrible.  Buy the book, but not the kindle version.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Love our neighbor, Bob.  He's only gotten better over the years and love his leaning more toward country.  His homage to Detroit is great as are several of the other tunes on this CD.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|We made a day of it and watched Batman Begins, this and then headed to the theatre for Dark Knight Rises. Good times!
0684824906|5.0|I just finished reading Doris Kearns Goodwin's engrossing, sweeping, detailed, most excellent history of Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet during this nation's turbulent civil war. Goodwin masterfully manages to orchestrate a wealth of information including multiple biographies placed firmly in their time allowing the reader to become very well acquainted with Lincoln and the broad spectrum of views and opinions, machinations and workings of his inner administrative circle.<br /><br />The sheer amount of scholarship and time required to write this book must have been formidable -- this book was a labor of love. It is very well written and has given me a better understanding and appreciation of the lives and times and challenges of a most patient, vibrant, determined Lincoln and his oft-contentious inner circle.<br /><br />This is a real page-turner of a book -- a brisk 754 pages -- it never dragged and kept me fully engaged during the span of time it took to read. I am in awe of Goodwin's accomplishment and thank her for bringing Abraham Lincoln and his team of rivals to life. Most highly recommended!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This just was not a good movie. The story was incredibly slow and even the fight scenes that did pop up from time to time were lacking in excitement. The movie was well shot and the special effects were quite nice, but those weren't enough to make this movie decent. I would not recommend watching this movie even if it were free on TV.
1582701709|1.0|I should have known how bad this book was going to be, as it proclaims to tell of secret, that is not a secret at all.
B00133MKVK|5.0|I've been a fan for years.  But Ms. Bassey just earned new fans with this release.  Pink's &#34;Get the Party Started&#34; is just the beginning.  Loud and bold.  And she winks at the listener, knowing the irony while she lives it.  She can still sell &#34;Big Spender&#34; like a starlett trying to make the rent.<br /><br />And the lounge-y &#34;Where is the Love&#34; makes me smile every time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am new to Downton Abbey and am now frantically trying to view the entire season 2 before season 3 starts in January! I wish I started watching this sooner.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very well-written book about a subject that is fascinating. It's amazing how the most effective snipers seem to be the most humble individuals. I greatly enjoyed this book and found it an easy read.
0470932139|3.0|I'm a beginner and the content is easy to understand. I don't care whether the technicalities are right or wrong at this stage, I'm just trying to learn and reading lots of books.  The photos are helpful.<br /><br />The reason why I'm giving this 3 stars is because the author's constant use of \\"...\\" is really, really annoying.  On almost... every page... you see...  dot dot dot.  Leave that kind of stuff for email, not in a book!  Not sure how or why this made it past the editor but it's poor form regardless.  I would definitely read another book by the author if I could be assured there... is no overuse... of the ... ... .
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed will not load more then the first page of updates. What a waste. I still have to use my phone for facebook.
0553386697|5.0|Dan Siegel's work is always brilliant. This book is very accessible and makes his theories and teachings very easily understood.
B009NBSEXM|5.0|As I watched each episode couldn't wait for the next episode. Will be waiting impatiently for each one. Love the characters..
1439152802|5.0|I nearly stopped reading \\"The Secret Keeper\\" after reading a negative review here that claimed 50% of the book was unnecessary. I'm glad I kept reading! Everything in the book IS necessary to the plot, the ambiance, and the development of character. A person's childhood is so important to how he or she turns out. The twist at the end was great -- I never saw it coming. All of Kate Morton's books are terrific. For an author this talented, the reader should assume that she has a reason for including the detail.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|good product I would like a better case is otherwise well I agree it took a while to get otherwise the product quality is very good movie I recommend
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I LOVE THIS COMPILATION OF SONGS! WITH THE TITLE BEING THE BEST OF WHITNEY HOUSTON, I SEE THIS AS BEING ALL ABOUT WHITNEY WITH NO COLLABORATIONS. (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO NEWER SONGS) HAVING THE SONGS WITH JUST WHITNEY'S FLAWLESS VOICE ON THEM IS JUST AMAZING.<br /><br />WHITNEY HAD SEVERAL HITS WITH ARTISTS SUCH AS JERMAINE JACKSON, KELLY PRICE, FAITH EVANS, MARIAH CAREY, CECE WINANS, BEBE WINANS, DEBORAH COX, AND SEVERAL OTHERS. ALL WERE WONDERFUL SONGS, BUT I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT WHITNEY DIDN'T DEPEND ON OTHER ARTISTS TO MAKE HER CAREER. ALL OF HER BIGGEST HITS WERE HER SOLO SONGS.<br /><br />I WOULD SUGGEST THIS CD FOR EVERYONE!! PURE BLISS!!!
B004E2XAFW|4.0|Lest you think that most concept albums go the way of KISS's &#34;The Elder,&#34; Within Temptation proves that an album that coincides with a story can work...at least musically. Now the concept behind the album and graphic novel (sold separately) will raise a few eyebrows here and there, but the music is top-notch. Sharon Den Adel's voice is as heavenly as it has ever been and the music is fantastic. There are a few places where the lyrics seem a bit forced, but it really doesn't detract too much from the quality of the songs. I'd be hesitant to say &#34;The Unforgiving&#34; is my favorite Within Temptation album, but it definitely belongs among their best.
030716327X|5.0|Got it for my son for Christmas. Love that it comes with the bunny as well. So cute! Can't wait to read it to him.
0525953728|5.0|Great read!  Riveting! Read this book in a little over 2 days!  I can't recommend it highly enough! Now I have to go see Zero Dark Thirty!
B004NOCCEG|5.0|this movie was exceptionally good if your are a business major this will let you know about the melt down of our economic system.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I have not used the camera yet. But will give it a good work out during the holidays.  Looks like it is easy to use.
B000OCXF0Q|3.0|I've been an Avril fan since 2002, but while this album has some fun songs, it's just not on par with her previous albums. &#34;Let Go&#34; was pretty good and established her as a young artist, but showed that she had potential as an artist. &#34;Under My Skin&#34; was a more serious effort and is her best album to date, in my humble opinion. This particular album, I'm afraid, was a step backward. It's more sugary-sweet pop and less of the thoughtful rock displayed with her earlier efforts. Some artists grow with their fanbase, but this album seems to indicate that Avril wanted to hold on to the same age range. That doesn't diminish her talent or her potential as an artist or performer, but I'll say that for me, it was somewhat of a disappointment. Fortunately her most recent album to date, &#34;Goodbye Lullaby&#34; is a step in a slightly more serious direction.
0920668372|5.0|Got this for my son for Christmas. He is 6 mo old. Can't wait to start reading it to him.
B0015DROBO|4.0|On the third book now.  I find myself having to read it quickly so I can keep track of the many characters with fairly similar last names.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Tom hardy was like bane without the mask. Shy lebuff, all i see is him in his Disney days. Or i expected is model T to transform in to a laser wielding robot. Guy peirce gave a weak and disappointing performance. If you are watching Discoveries Moonshiners this is sorta interesting.<br /><br />It was a good movie overall, I recommend ya rent it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The movie was a huge let down. Thought it was going to better. Not worth the $5 I paid to rent it...
B002FOQY2M|4.0|Fun's debut &#34;Aim and Ignite&#34; marks Nate Ruess' first major venture away from The Format, which in full disclosure, I personally prefer over Fun. That having been said, &#34;Aim and Ignite&#34; is a great album. It's almost in the same vein as The Format's &#34;Dog Problems&#34;: indie rock that's well, for lack of a better word...fun. Some of the lyrics express some of Nate's frustration from being a member of his old band: &#34;I'm through with causing a scene&#34; (likely a reference to The Format's hit song &#34;The First Single (Cause a Scene)&#34;. But generally, the music upbeat and enjoyable. Having listened to both of Fun's albums, I'd have to choose this one as the superior of the two. &#34;Some Nights&#34; is a decent album, but the two singles from it are the only ones I enjoy listening to. &#34;Aim and Ignite&#34; is much more well-rounded and easier to listen to as a whole.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. Great time killer. Strangely addictive, but in a good way. Quickly became my favorite new app. For free, can't beat it!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use this constantly for reports and school work.  It gives me the option to work on stuff wherever I am or share things with others for group work easily.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have read many books on Lincoln but this is the first that gave me the insight into his relationships with his cabinet.  It makes you realize even more how great a president he really was.  The author, Doris Kearns Goodwin, received the Pulitzer Prize for this wonderful book.  I would recommend this book to anyone and have!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Read this last Grisham almost in one go, work and sleep came 2nd :)<br />Interesting until the end! Although this one is slightly different, we are not looking into the dealings of a lawyer in a law firm, I loved it. Well done yet again!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Movie arrived in a timely  fashion and exactly, completely, totally, as described. This new reviewing system is idiotic. I don't like having to write a whole paragraph.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Bad, bad, bad movie. Acting is horrible. Jokes are old and repetitive. Sly, Dolph and Jet are extremely hard to understand. Sly looks like he may have had a stroke in this movie.CGI is unrealistic on blu-ray. Plot is incoherent. Jason Statham and the young kid are the only good things about this horrible movie
B005LAIIQC|5.0|good movie, well directed, thankfully fre of shakycam. Renner is every bit as good as Damon and Weisz is way better than the other girls.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|my children are getting this for christmas, but we have seen it at the theater and it was great! thanks!
034580404X|5.0|These are great books for young and old alike to explore their sexuality and wake up their inner desires and needs.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This is a very good movie.  The acting is good, even with a large number of previously unknowns.  Justin Timberlake is also excellent, as usual.
1451695195|5.0|This gives an understandable reasoning of what Heaven must be like. Whom ever reads this statement and is wondering  if heaven really exists, this must be read by the doubter.
B009KHCT94|1.0|This movie is about Space Nazis.  Ergo, going into the movie I already knew that part of the deal was that I would need to ignore history, science, logic or even a modicum of believability.<br /><br />But, C'mon . . . Space Nazis!<br /><br />I went in expecting a B-Movie experience - but it failed there.  It looks like a B-Movie, but its not enjoyable like one.  Have you ever seen your drunk brother-in-law decide to make a pie?  He takes the same ingredients that Grandma uses to make her pie, but does it the way he thinks it should be done and creates this inedible mess.<br /><br />That's what this movie is like.<br /><br />It's not that this movie is bad (it is, but that's not the point), it's not enjoyable.  Many groups would be insulted by this movie, Christians, Republicans, Military, Diplomats.  But where shows like South Park or the Daily Show do it with cleverness, this movie offends casually and clumsily.  You won't leave this movie feeling better for having a laugh or being entertained.  It's just not that kind of movie.<br /><br />I bought this movie because I was sure I would enjoy the premise.  I wished I'd rented instead, or read the reviews first.  I've never written a review before, but I had to write one on this because I felt cheated.<br /><br />How could you screw up a movie about Space Nazis?  You make something like this.
B006QPVGKG|4.0|It was a long movie and a bit predictable but in all I liked it and there were some scary parts.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This movie is a great revival of the franchise.  I hope they continue.  This movie is funny for kids and adults.  The only downside is all the current pop culture references will lose their zing over time.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My daughter loves 1D so I could not resist for a Christmas gift! She will love it and wear it out playing it Im sure!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|liked that the same actors played same roles as the other two movies.  it is was entertaining which a lot of movies lack now a days.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|cool but needs more things to be worth buying bescause all it adds is no ads and music for your alarm clock.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This case holds my Kindle Fire very securely and holds it up quite well so I can watch videos without holding the device.  It doesn't slip at all when you angle it as shown in the pictures.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My daughter loves 1D so I could not resist for a Christmas gift! She will love it and wear it out playing it Im sure!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|What is the point of this app if you only see the first few status updates? I really hope there's an update to fix this issue because I certainly would like to be able to check my facebook on my kindle and avoid having to either using my phone or having to sign into facebook via the web browser.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|my first time with angry birds. so much fun. i want to play more.  very addictive and i love it.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Another cute Dr Seuss movie.  My son loves watching this and I know it will be a frequently watched movie for a while.  Danny DeVito is great!
B009OCR1X4|5.0|The score is really amazing. All of the music really fits together as a whole piece, I've listened to it non stop
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun and unassuming app!  It was recommended to me and as soon as I tried it, I was hooked.  My 4 yr old is able to play it!
0307593525|5.0|I bought these books to introduce new recipes in my kitchen. The first one I tried was the Apple Tart and I was amazed by the level of detail and the descriptions! Julia Child writes every step in an almost scientific fashion, even adding the position in the oven to avoid burning or drying! Her recipes are easy to follow and fool proof. I am very excited and my family looks forward to trying something new every weekend!
0545128285|5.0|This book is a great companion to read alongside the Harry Potter books as these tales are referenced in the books.  Just another exciting books for kids and adults alike!
B004XNGKBS|1.0|This used to be a great app and now it won't open. Tried uninstalling, rebooting, nothing works. Please fix ASAP!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm sure this DVD is effective. There's 3 different levels. I've only used the first level so far. The only reason why I don't like it is because it kicks my butt, lol! So if that's what you're looking for, this is for you! I'm still going to use it to get the results. I just prefer other workout DVD's over this one.
B009329Y30|4.0|Very good and cute love movie.  Everyone woman would love to find her true love this way.  Must see this movie.
6305428042|5.0|With so many holiday movies out there, Halloween is pretty much overlooked.  This is a great Disney movie that belongs in everyone's collection!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I like this cd it is just what i was expecting came to me on time with no problems, price was good I would buy from this seller again thanks so much
B000OW77UU|5.0|There are many lessons to be learned from this movie! Go after what you want no matter what. Perserverance, love. dedication, and many more important things to guide us in this crazy world.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is very touching. Friend told me that it was good and he was right. I had to buy it. Great movie!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Another phenomenal movie staring Leonardo DiCaprio.  It really makes you think and is fun to watch over and over, which I can't say about many movies.  Great acting all around!

B009HV2JT8|3.0|The movie was okay, I would not watch again.  It has some facts about Abraham Lincoln but the rest was just ,  ehhh.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Had to buy this movie along with all the other ones.  The end to Twlight is near and I just wanted to be able to watch them when I wanted.  Great Movie
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Although I liked the premise of the story and it made sense, the whole thing didn't come together for me somehow. I found the message a little heavy-handed and smacking of social engineering - like one of those Victorian stories manipulating children to be good. As for the grandkids, Miss 11 loved it; Mr 8 had nightmares (really, and for two nights afterwards) and Miss 3 was bored and wandered off. As she is a movie junkie, this surprised me. So not one size fits all!
B005LAIHSG|3.0|the movie wasnt as good as i thought it be.  its ok but not worth watching again.  add it to my movies
B009KHDT0C|3.0|The movie was not really up to Johnny Depp par.  It was ok, but weird story line.  I would not want to see again.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Big Bang is one of my favorite shows, and I love having all four of the first seasons to watch whenever I want.
030758836X|5.0|Was a great read.  Enjoyed all the twists and turns.  I rarely save books but this is a keeper.  I'll read it again.  Looking forward to her next book.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I purchased this charger a few weeks back after my Magic Mouse batteries died unexpectedly (went from 30% to 5% overnight). Rather than buy batteries for the rest of forever or constantly swapping out rechargeables, I decided to get this. It is very convenient. I just drop the mouse on the dock every night before I leave and it is fully topped up every morning. Takes up very little desk real estate and is low profile. To avoid unplugging USB cables when I take my laptop home at night, I have the USB charging cable plugged into one of those USB cell phone charging bricks, works great.<br /><br />Some downsides:<br />- The paint on the bottom of the battery pack seems to be wearing off. I've owned it for less than a month. It's on the bottom so I don't care much, but I'm not particularly rough on it, its just on a plain wood desk.<br />- The reported charge level of the mouse never goes above 80%, but that's because the type of rechargeable batteries in it use a different voltage than normal batteries, so the OS does the math wrong. Would be nice to be able to adjust that in OSX. Again not an issue, because I only use it for 8-10 hours in a stretch before back in the charger it goes.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Unorthodox Jukebox is so well put together. The title says it all, its a unique style from a unique artist. Just as good if not better than his freshmen album. I give it two thumbs all the way up! Download it now!
B0053O89WY|5.0|The fifth season is hilarious and I really like to watch them in order. I cannot wait to get the next season when it comes out on DVD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son loves the movie watches it every day.  We are now collecting all the cars cars.  The DVD was in great shape.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|While I understand why some people don't like the soundtrack, I think this is becoming - if it's not already - one of my favorite Bond soundtracks. Initially I had some of the same complaints that people had about the music - it's repetitive, doesn't sound like James Bond, doesn't have a musical identity. After numerous listens, I don't feel as if this is necessarily the case. It certainly ranks with Goldeneye as arguably the largest stylistic departure of all the Bond soundtracks. Many of the tracks contain unique interpretations of the James Bond theme (or at least portions of it) that can be easy to miss, in addition to other small motifs. It's a very different soundtrack - especially compared to Barry's work on the Bond series - and it's music that you really need to listen to if you want to understand what's going on and get something out of it. And once you get what's going on, the soundtrack is immensely listenable. The tracks aren't in strict film order, but the order they're in makes for a great listening experience.
B000BISBDY|5.0|The CD contains a large slice of his lifes work. If you like Cash, you will enjoy this!  I did.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|What a classic movie and story -- all told to us by a dead man. It's dark, it's funny, it's disturbing. It's not only a story of faded Hollywood stardom but also a reflection on life itself. Depending on your viewing mood, a variety of meanings emerge from this multi-layered movie.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Good for a beginner and the daily reader.  One of the best, right up there with NKJV. and NASV<br />Wonderful to understand in an simple format.
0307949435|5.0|Some new information but mostly a down sizing of his previous book. I prefer Good Calories, Bad Calories because it is much more complete and harder to ignore things that you don't want to agree with.
B00005AFVR|5.0|If you love the music coming from decades of Bruce and his band, there is no way you will not love this CD. A lot of recordings live,but that doesnt diminish the gut feeling in words and music that has become his trademark. He's the pop-rock-soul version of Johnny Cash -songs that say something.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Proof that the boys, after over 30 years out there, haven't decided to just mail it in...Congrats on the induction to the HOF.  Well Deserved!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The story started a little slow and it took a few tries to get going.  But once I got into it, man oh man, I couldn't put it down.  It sucked me in so deeply, so quietly, I was oblivious to anything else around me.  It was that good.  Highly recommend it.  Well done!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, it's another Vince Flynn masterpiece that's hard to put down.  Now I have to wait for the next one!
1455502758|5.0|Five stars for this stellar book by a stellar man. Amazon did not go wrong in naming it one of the best books of 2012. His biting, dry wit and his deep insight made the read worthwhile, even if I was reading of bad things happening to him. Oh well, the Lord works in wondrous ways...oops.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|One of Spielbergs best movies finally in HD in Blu ray. The picture quality is very good and the sound (DTS HD) dominated by John Williams brilliant score is also flawless. I can recommend this edition without hesitation. The Blu ray book also looks gereat and has some interesting facts and movie stills in it.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter along with another one as it was at the top of her \\"Santa List\\". I received them yesterday and I am so excited to see her face light up Christmas morning. Thank you for the price of $8.99! I can't tell you how much that meant to me to be able to buy another one and the drawing/stencil kit as well. Being on a fixed income is tough especially during Christmas But you made this Grandma feel like a million bucks being able to afford to buy my granddaughter the toy she wanted and then some. Thank You and Merry Christmas!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I picked up and read the first book of the 50 shades trilogy on a whim and I finished it in 2 days, buying this set was great for me because I wanted them all for myself.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Great drama with every episode ending with the viewer on the edge of their seat.  Great acting also.  Can hardly wait for the second season to become available.
0316228532|1.0|First, I would like to state that I never read any of J.K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" books. I felt since she was so famous and this book keeps it place on the best seller list, I would give it a try. Now I found out that it make the \\"Good Reads\\" Best Fiction of 2012. I dislike the book and gave it only 1 star.<br /><br />I will not go into the story-line, many other reviews have already done this so I will just rate the book on its elements (0 to 5 being highest):<br /><br />Protagonist Development: 1<br />Antagonist Development: 1<br />Minor Character Development: 1<br />Storyline:1<br />Setting: 1<br />Theme: 2<br />Writing Style: 2<br />Overall Rating: 1
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Not too difficult. Would be nice to make the scenes larger for hidden objects. Agood game for someone who wants a moderately hard game.
0823023494|5.0|I just finished lightly reading the first book (will read next Animation Mentor) and I am ready to dive in to the assignments. It's an awesome book! So educational and so insightful... Some of the things the author talks about in there, just CLICK. It definitely fills a gap in the animation genre books. What makes it so special and good is that the author doesn't hold back secrets or tricks... he just shares it all willingly and making it easy to understand. I would definitely recommend this book time and time again to those out there who wish to hone their skills in Character Design. It is also wonderful because it includes and assignment that you can work on to actually put to the test what you have learned. I promise you won't regret buying this book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|michael connelly has done it once again.  i kept the kindle burning into the night to find out how harry bosch solved his latest case.  the black box doesn't disappoint.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Wayyy to many ads literally every 10 seconds an ad pops I'm completely serious. . . . . . . . .
B000ID37SQ|1.0|This is one of those films that you hear about, know a little about, and if you haven't watched, figure you are missing out. I didn't even finish watching. Love Al Pacino, like Michelle P, too, but this was B-movie acting/plot. Wretched accents.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|To be honest, I began this book quite reluctantly as an extra-credit opportunity for my English Studies course. The first 20 pages or so had to be trudged through. But once through this beginning bit, the reader will find themselves delving into a seafaring world of adventure, piracy, and suspense. Progressively this book improves on itself the longer you read. For those interested in well written, enchanting books, this is one for you. All those who enjoy a minor literary challenge, requiring you to take a step back from time to time to reread a passage due to swashbuckling dialect and jargon, will find great fun in this novel. All in all, this book is deserving of the five stars I've rewarded it with. Highly recommend for younger, ambitious readers.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|these harry potter films are treasured by both my 7 and 9 year old grandchildren.  they have read the books and are thrilled to see the beloved stories on screen.  they have watched them over and over.
0399230033|3.0|I know this is viewed as a classic, but I just find it okay.  I got it for my 1 yr old which is probably too early for this book, so maybe she'll grow into it.  Not many words, so it relies on understanding the sequence of the pictures which my daughter can't quite do yet.  She likes hearing words and the story along with the pictures.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Great game but i really think it is too expensive. $3.00 for 3 levels seems like a little much. Also, for another $2.00 you can get one more level(Path of the Jedi). Unless you can manage to geg 3 star in every single level the you must pay for Path of the Jedi. Like i said very fun game but too expensive for the gameplay
B0055SWM08|5.0|So far this puzzle isn't too hard and is strangely addicting.  I should be doing more productive stuff but I'm playing quell.  Go figure.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|this is an engaging grisham tale that takes many surprising turns.  a fine read that kept me reading.  i enjoyed it.
0385535147|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Grisham at his best! You felt like you knew where he was going, then surprise, a little shift in direction.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Great movie, good quality for a stream. But more than a red box bluray and no options like subtitles. hoping they continue the franchise with Robin . Seemed a little rushed like there could have been a fourth movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is our family's favorite Christmas movie. No one has as much trouble with the holidays as Clark W Griswold Jr! He certainly makes you appreciate what little hassle you have to go through at Christmas time. Great film to see little Johnny Galeki shine!
B003L77G6K|5.0|I Love The Big Bang Theory and will continue watching it until it goes off air, which will not happen anytime soon! Season 4 is great. I always laugh so hard! Unlike some people, I loved the addition of Amy Farrah Fowler. She and Sheldon are made for each other and their 'relationship' brings a whole new element to the show.<br />The product itself comes with two discs and an insert that has a brief description of each episode, which I appreciated. The only improvement I would suggest would be to add more Bonus Features, such as what is coming up in the next season.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who likes The Big Bang Theory!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wholly Smolly! I am so hooked. I watched all seasons/episodes in one weekend and now I feel like something is missing in my life. I need my Walking Dead Now!
B001CC7PP8|3.0|It was a great movie however one of the discs was loose in transport and was scratched more than  expected
B002SRQ214|5.0|Bought these 3 years ago when I built my first PC.<br />Even though I upgraded other components such as GPU, PSW, and Motherboard, I kept this CPU because there wasn't really any reason to upgrade this piece of wonder.<br /><br />With the help of a dedicated CPU cooler, I've been Overclocking this at 4.2ghz without problems.<br />You could spend more money for fancy 6 core that sounds great on paper for twice as much as these (currently listed for around $80), or be smart, buy these with the CPU cooler (probably about $20) and be amazed at what \\"old\\" tech can still do.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very good dictionary. Love using the thesaurus also. It is a good one. Good to have when reading big books,
B005H0IW6W|5.0|It was everything I wanted it to be and more. Very good arrangement of the selected songs. I reccommend it to everyone.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it is a great game but u should be able to play as long as u want like block story lite
B008UWEFU6|5.0|My Daughter in law asked for this set for Christmas , she'll love it...a very nice sealed set...was cheaper than the book store
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Its good. But when got new phone, did not save my progress. Why pay if it does not do that. That's why 4 stars and almost gave 2.
B0099TJ4YQ|3.0|Was a little disappointed in this CD. Did not enjoy the arrangement of the selected songs but for the price I won't complain too much.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Upon initial viewing, I found this film equal parts entertaining and gratuitous (and quite over the top); despite the expert, near-camp direction of Ridley Scott and the honorable performance of Julianne Moore in a daring reimagining of Jodie Foster's triumphant role, its net effect was to somewhat sour my memory of Silence of the Lambs.  However, I was not particularly resentful of its existence until I bought the DVD.<br /><br />I'm a great fan of DVD documentaries and featurettes; I've always appreciated being given insights into the genesis and construction of films, even those detailing the production of movies I didn't particularly enjoy.  Unfortunately, after watching the \\"Making of Hannibal\\" piece on this DVD, I developed a true hatred of \\"Hannibal\\", and by association the entire Lecter franchise.<br /><br />The reason?  One Martha De Laurentiis (nee Schumacher), the widow of the late Dino De Laurentiis and producer of the Hannibal series from this film onward.  She is the salient narrator of this ghastly \\"making of\\" documentary, and watching her is like being powdered with fleas for 45 minutes.<br /><br />Mrs. De Laurentiis (and I use this salutation over Ms., as her marriage appears to be the most auspicious item on her CV), was previously a producer of relentless D-grade schlock films based on bargain-basement Stephen King adaptations (Maximum Overdrive, Cats Eye, Firestarter) before meeting and marrying Dino De Laurentiis, a Hollywood legend responsible for producing an even longer list of exploitation films and sequels.  The pasha's riches Mrs. De Laurentiis subsequently inherited from this unholy union (to a man nearly 40 years her senior) apparently included his vast fortune, a nepotistic position as president of his production company, and a very painful faux Italian accent.<br /><br />For the length of this documentary, this woman, who save her Donatella hairdo looks as if she plopped off the Mayflower, gushes one \\"che bellisimo\\" after another abouthow \\"delicious\\" it is to see Anthony Hopkins reprising his role as Hannibal the Cannibal, all  the while trilling her R's to the accompaniment of operatic choral music and spaghetti, linguini, blah blah blah.  As an Italian myself, after 10 minutes of cheesy That's Amore and inserts of sacred Florencian statues I had the urge to rush out for a nose-job and a new birth certificate.  The original film skittered enough on the precipice of artifice, but Mrs. De Laurentiis ladles so much garlicky pretentiousness and ostentation on the production that one is left more bloated and gassy than after a meal at Olive Garden.<br /><br />It is now impossible for me to watch this film (and its successors) without flashbacks to this looney hack's glee over the vast wealth she has amassed exploiting and embellishing the virtues of the original Silence of the Lambs.  I had to retrieve my jaw off the floor after listening to her glibly toss off Jodie Foster's sage decision to forgo reprising her role as Clarice Starling as \\"disappointing, but totally solvable\\", as if swapping actors known for beloved performances was as facile as choosing Buitoni over De Cecco.  She carries herself as if she had invented the primitive zoetrope, as opposed to have simply married someone old enough to have actually done it.<br /><br />This shameless PR piece is layered with a soaring, exultant score of endless arias and cellists reaching below their knees on their fretboards, apparently to imbue it with class (ala the tenors who serenade you at Macaroni Grill). And with the panoramic vistas of Florence, and handheld shots of the posh premiere (including a gorgeous spread of antipasti and Christopher Walken looking like a mafioso), one is led to believe that Hannibal is actually some De Sica masterpiece, rather than the gory, expensive splatter film it is.  How did I overlook the absurdity of Ray Liotta being fed his frontal lobes whilst Gourmet Valse Tartare was blasting on the soundtrack?<br /><br />Mangia, indeed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun to pass the time, yet challenging at the same time:) amazing:)  most people I know have it and we all love it:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I started reading the book to support my 12 yo who is reading it for school. Thankfully I doubt that  preteens will get the full force of how brutally sadistic some of the things in the book are. I found myself wavering between shock, fascination and concern for the fact this is marketed to young adults. If your children are reading the book, read it as well so that you can discuss together
B007UW9VWO|1.0|Sounds silly but I purchased this DVD from Amazon but can't play because of stupid region lock. So if you don't reside in US don't bother.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I was nervous about buying this, because $10 is a lot for an app.  Most of my photo editing is once a year for the holiday card.  I'm not a Photoshop pro, although we own a version from 1999.<br /><br />The online documentation seems pretty sparse too.  However, the included tutorials are great for working with layers, fixing images and pictures.  The tutorials show step by step what features to select and how to get the desired editing done.<br /><br />I am using the Adobe creative cloud to get pictures to the tablet, and it's working well.  The other alternative is to get the files there via another app (drop box, box, sky drive, Google drive, etc) or to put them on the tablet sd card.<br /><br />Overall, I have no regrets with this purchase.  I almost wonder how adobe makes money on this, as the software is worth more than $10 when compared to pc software, in my opinion.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I do like the app for getting temperature and weather warnings. However, we were getting 40-50 mph winds and the app kept saying 0mph.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Another great Hidden Object games from Nevosoft, they never let me down, i highly recommend anyone out there who likes hidden object games not to skip this. My friend recommended  me about this game, he was so excited telling me about this game, so finally i came to check it out and wow!! i have to say its really great., i have played a lot of similar games like this one but this really stands out , very nice game with great story line. Enjoyed from beginning till the very end. Five stars from me!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|A wonderfully crafted trilogy. I could not put these books down. I can not wait to read the series again!
B004IOVGW0|4.0|Great film.  Interesting to see peoples' morals of the time.  I'm surprised the police weren't called at the picnic!  Well acted for its era.  Definitely a classic, which is well worth a watch.
1451688091|5.0|like historical novels-------gave me a new view on the country's long struggle with slavery--------was a very naive NH boy & spent 3 yrs in military in georgia, louisiana, and no. carolina in the 50's-----------was a mind blowing experience that some of that culture still existed
B007HACDLK|5.0|I emjoyed this book a great deal because I identify with the lead character, but am unable to kick some ***.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|If you have the DVDs don't buy this, it looks exactly the same as the DVDs, it doesn't como with any extras or anything that make it worth, not even the box is special.
0792163710|5.0|Best Western ever made by far. Has something for everyone, from the love story to the action. Supurbly acted on all levels, even the bit parts. Like many movies of that era it allows people to think for themselves and come up with your own conclusions.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Didn't disappoint. I own all previous seasons and watch the discs repeatedly. Can't wait for season 8 to become available.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I first rented this movie from the library, but liked it so much that I wanted to have it in our family's collection of DVDs. The price was great through Amazon. It is well done and a good family movie that has no swearing, nudity, etc. I have always loved the Beatrix Potter books so it was nice to watch the movie about her life.
030759565X|5.0|In my spare time, I love to cook.  I hadn't heard of the Smitten Kitchen or Deb Perelman's blog prior to seeing her latest cookbook.  It's hard to believe, but true!  I'm so glad I purchased this cookbook.  The recipes, so far, are just delicious with easy to understand recipe instructions and beautiful photographs.  You will not be disappointed!
B0041TM5OU|4.0|The vinyl i purchased is actually a gift for my future son in law. he loves &#34;old school&#34; as he says. his collection includes alot of Dylan and Cash. He likes jazz, so i thought this a great gift. we will see.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game!! Just me against the board!!! You really ought to download it for a fun time anywhere. Thanks.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|I have just completed watching the Season 2 set and quite simply the season has never looked better.<br /><br />Now I am aware that there have been a lot of negative comments on some of the special effect restorations in season 2. Many Star Trek fan sites have commented on these issues, however, I can confidently say that overall these issues represent less than 5% of the entire season.<br /><br />Season 2 was given to a separate company than Season 1. Season 1 was completed by CBS Digital and they did an amazing job. Season 2 was completed by HTV Illuminate and there are definitely some special features that were poorly restored. For example, in the Schizoid Man a couple of planet shots look like they have been upscaled from DVD. Additionally, there are some shots where the Enterprises passes through the side of the screen and part of the Enterprise disappears! It is quite shocking that they missed it but you can clearly see it at the end of that episode. Most of the special effect mistakes seem contained to several episodes.<br /><br />Overall, the special effects have been wonderfully restored. I ran my TNG DVDs side by side on some episodes and the difference is remarkable in many cases.  Its unfortunate that some of the special effects were restored poorly, which puts a bit of a stain on the entire season, however, like I said I strongly believe this is less than 5% of the season.<br /><br />The live action shots look so much better than my season 2 DVDs the comparison isn't even close. Clealy, this is how this show was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The audio tracks have also been completely redone and it sounds so much stronger and powerful, especially in the low end. I listened to the season on a 5.1 setup and it felt much more immersive and strong.<br /><br />In summary, I think this Season 2 BluRay set is a must own for any Star Trek TNG Fan. It is quite simply an amazing restoration. These is definitely some moments where you might groan a bit at the special effect but seriously for the most part they look much better. The audio restoration is also top notch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Not much more to say about this CD and her songs, love them all.  Great list of songs on this CD.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|whats not to like about this album? I listen when i am in the mood for alittle amy,adele..youknow the genre. The cd arrived quickly. plays great and is good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good old-fashioned solitaire!! Lots of fun in those moments waiting in Doctor's offices, in lines, just any down moment. Don't you just love a challenge like this?
B009O2XY12|1.0|I will not pay money to play a game. it lures you in and then it asks for money. Ridiculous!
B008LA7RM0|5.0|In 1966, Brian Wilson managed to blow away everything The Beatles ever did with Pet Sounds.<br /><br />Pet Sounds was recorded while Mike, Carl, Dennis and Al were touring in Japan (May have been China). Brian Wilson, by now a full time marijuana user, opted out of the tour in order to record in the studio. This yielded the album we all love today, Pet Sounds. The album drifts away from their beach themed radio hits and focuses on deeper themes. Brian Wilson and a bunch of session musicians, thus the other members barely had anything to do with this album, given some harmonies and lead vocals.<br /><br />Pet Sounds remains my most favorite album ever made and I believe it's better than Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, Rubber Soul and every other Beatles album (let the Beatles fans start complaining LOL). I've always considered The Beach Boys extremely superior to The Beatles and this album proves that point.<br /><br />Hits on this album include &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice&#34; and &#34;God Only Knows&#34;, but please listen to the album as a whole!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This movie was hard to find.  Glad we purchased it.  It is an all time classic movie that all kids should see.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down. Really well written with characters that come to life. I was sad when it was over!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This series is a must have.  I have the complete collection.  I watch them all the time.  Ordering through Amazon was fast and easy.  The product itself was excellent.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I was never a fan of Rod Stewart until he starting singing those golden oldies. There is just something about the way he delivers all of those old songs that you remember from your growing-up years that stands out from all of the rest. This Christmas album is another example of those golden oldies......in this case.....Christmas classics.....delivered in that distinctive voice that invites you to just stop and listen and of course sing along. Thanks Rod for another great album.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I received as described.  Item was delivered quickly.  My son has watched this over and over on DVR so we can't wait to give it to him for Christmas.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|I was excited to see this app, Kakuro is one of my favorite games. I've like cross sums since I was in high school. This is one of the few apps I have payed for. This app works well, the controls are easy to understand and it runs smoothly. Now for the negatives and why I only gave it three stars. It doesn't go landscape. So no matter what you do you can never see the whole puzzle at one time. Even at the smallest grid size, it increases the size of the squares so that you can't ever see all of it. It will get slightly smaller, but never enough to see the whole puzzle. So while playing, you're always slightly irritated as you have to move the game board over again to see what numbers you've used. It never lets you forget you're playing on a machine and makes you wish for the paper version the whole time. There are a few tweeks that it could use also, it would be nice if it would let you pencil in more than one number,while you think. Over all I do like this game, but it does need some work.<br /><br />k
B008LP8QE8|2.0|1) it is not working on my android 2.2 phone samsung galaxy SL gt-19003. message is displayed by kindle reader is that this book is incompatible. this phone already runs my other kindle book braunwald heart disease very nicely.<br /><br />2) i could open the book on my windows computer. i realized that the kindle edition of this book is nowhere near expectations. it is not possible to adjust font size, words per line, lines and columns per page etc. which are vital for reading on a mobile device. otherwise it is not more than a pdf file of a book.
0316044938|5.0|Starting out with the rape and murder of a fourteen year-old girl is a shocking way to start a novel.  Sebold, through the narration of the murdered girl, Susie Salmon, tells her story with suspense, tragedy, excitement, and humor.  Sebold takes us to unexpected places that are compelling and wondrous.  The story is unpredictable as Susie moves through those lives affected by her murder.  It sounds more sad and tragic than it is.  The novel proves that through such tragedy our lives are shaped both positively and negatively.  Questions linger while reading:  Does her killer get caught?  How does the boy who loved her before her death love after her death?  Can her parents get through the loss of a child?  The answers do not disappoint.  This is a well-written piece that is easy to follow and hard to let go.  An amazing novel!  Highly recommended!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I haven't played a game like this in ages but the concept is interesting. Basically you have to be able to apply physics so you can get Jelly to land where you want him to so you can get to the next level. Sounds easy? It's only easy if you have a good understanding of how to maneuver the lines he bounces off to get him to the end. All in all it makes a person think &amp; plan how to get Jelly to the next level without falling into the water.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|This one left me flat. The beginning was the most boring and it really didnt get much better. The action is slow to come and comes to late.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Pretty cool little display box. A little expensive but worth it if you plan on keeping it as a collectable. Great movie.
1401233791|5.0|My son is a great comic book fan -- I ordered this for his collection and it arrived in perfect condition and a fast delivery
0547564651|5.0|This is a great book for educators and parents! There are too many children/teenagers that lack grit, tenacity, and character nowadays!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to read the author's other book!
030759565X|4.0|I really have not had the time to really use it and give it a fair try.  Might give it to my daughter for Christmas.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|christopher nolan really dropped the ball on this one, watching the movie i realize that Christopher Nolan doesnt have another batman in him. He should have just stopped with the dark knight. Banes present was not felt i totally forgot about him while watching TDKR. Its very sad when you have everything in front of you and still manage to foul up the batman legend. He should have stuck with the Momento-like genre. Its like he was out of ideas and he just put a bunch of drama together with filler and three scences of action. Christian bales batman wanna be was very disappointing as well. I would just watch the dark knight movie and skip the other two.  I was more afraid of the joker then Bane and it shouldnt be that way.And dont even get me started on Anne hathaways Catwoman.  Maybe Christopher Nolan should have put more of his heart into the movie instead of just trying to fill his pockets. Please watch Batman and Batman returns to see what a real Batman and Catwoman should look like. Micheal Keaton is and still we be the Batman and heath ledger will be the joker sorry Jack.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|While this was a readable book with a good plot line, i found myself distracted by the question of why someone like robie would begin behaving  so completely out of character. The ending was an unexpected surprise.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|i bought this after watching it on machinima before halo 4 came out and expected it to be included with the limited edition of halo 4 but to my dissappointment it wasnt so i bought the dvd so i wasnt stuck having to watch forward unto dawn on halo waypoint or youtube so yay it is great if you havent watched yet
0399157565|5.0|The Bone Bed is another gripping Scarpetta novel. Being a Patricia Cornwell fan this was one book I purchased on my kindle. The Bone Bed is another masterful novel, there were a couple slow parts in the novel; however, the novel in a whole was compelling and made me want more of the Scarpetta legacy.<br />Cornwell's novels come to life has you read them and this one is no exception. In each chapter, it keeps you guessing, when you think you figured it out, there's a twist.<br /> There was a nice surprise with Lucy in the novel and bringing someone back into her life, without revealing it until the last few chapters. All the characters, Marino, Benton, Scarpetta are amazing in the novel.<br />Cornwell has an amazing gift of being able to write and tell the story in a believable way, to pull the reader in from the beginning, keeping them there right to the very end and wanting more.<br />The Bone Bed is a great read and worth the purchase, on the Kindle or the \\"traditional\\" hardcover book. I highly recommend it and to give has a gift, for the \\"Scarpetta\\" fans in your life.

B0084U0IEG|3.0|Sweet Tooth A Novel:<br />Not up to the standard of Atonement strange literary devices used what was the point? Bought it because I enjoed Atonement.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I had no idea this was the prequel to Alien. It was very interesting and the special effects were pretty good. I wish they did more with the giant people.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I, after reading every Terry Pratchett book, find myself thinking \\"this is his best one yet!\\", which leads me to believe that every Book he writes is his best one yet. Very well done.

B009E3EY4M|5.0|ok, I'm one of Zep's biggest fans, and pieced downloaded O2 videos from u-tube and assembled into a complete concert DVD.  It was a labor of love - sometimes finding a better vid to replace something ragged.  I've watched it on my home theater several times, but naturally the video quality on an 8' HD system was severely lacking...fast forward 5 years later...  Finally Jimmy convinced Robert to release the pro-shot footage.  And what an awesome show it was - one for the history books.  These older rockers were able bring back the excitement and rekindled fond memories of seeing them at the sold out Pontiac Silverdome back in '77.  They are all in excellent form.  Robert can still belt it out and hit many of the high notes, though the songs were reworked to better align with his voice.  Jason starts off nervously but soon melds nicely with the band and starts to have some fun, though I have to admit I miss the deep thump of Bonzo's foot pedal.  Jason has about 80% of the drumming chemistry his dad possessed, which was truly larger than life in the drumming world.  Jimmy plays around - and occasionally leads the band into unknown territory - but being the &#34;best garage band in the world&#34;, he knows how to bring them back.  What can one say about John Paul Jones...except he is technically PERFECT.  Nobody does it better.  Is this a great concert video - yes, if you like constant cuts to the various members - mainly waist up.  The viewer definitely misses the constant panorama of the large screen presentation going on behind them.  Several montages are completely missing, and that was an integral part of the show.  Favorite song:  Hard to pick, but For Your Life stands out - never before played live.  Do I recommend this?  Without doubt - it is highly likely that there will never be another show by this band.  It is history - and a must have for all 70's rock fans.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I think the storyline is interesting, but it's not written well. Too much is explained explicitly and that takes away from the magic. Overall it's a good book to kill time. Definitely a fast read.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I LOVE THE WALKING DEAD!  But it gets really sad at some parts.  There are some things I would have changed such as the gore.  Not saying it should not be there but there is to much.  That's just what I think though. 4/5 stars!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Faltaba la precuela de esta gran serie y cumple  con creces, lindo arte de caja, buenas ambientaciones y escenarios, very good.
B000002J3W|5.0|This is Skid Row ! In my opinion there are only two Skid Row albums , Slave to The Grind, and this one Subhuman Race. This release was hard loud and heavy and not many at the time wanted to go this fast and hard, because they couldnt come up with anything this good.<br /><br />  Forget that mid day energy drink, get rollin on this baby. The boys can be proud of this one ! The prices here make it a no brainer, if you dont have it , get it.
B002RRWWQ4|4.0|Not the best in the series but overall it wasn't too bad. You really have to love the storyline to appreciate this movie.
B000000WHC|4.0|Took a chance on this one. What a great chance it was. The only thing I can actual say negative about it, is that there is no written playlist. Tracks 4&9 were great. I really enjoyed this buy.  I hope the others of Gary's are as equally done  Check out track11, WOW!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book is a great read by a wonderful author in Tampa. It is well researched and moves very fast to the end.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy the pioneer angle, they give you a way to buy in game money and I like the graphics. Only con is their insistence on Facebook. Those of us without have to be patient.
B0087240Z4|4.0|I have been looking for new &#34;old&#34; music for so long. This is really on point. The band has lost nothing and the production is excellent. I highly recommend this. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't like one of the songs.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Really impressed about video features and quality. It seems to be a very good adventure.till now I used to play adventure only on my Pc. From now on on my tablet, too.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I got this for a grandson who'd like to be a detective. I thought<br />it would be the perfect introduction to some iconic literary sleuths<br />and their equally iconic comedic rendition.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|great film... really no complaints.  can't wait to give it to my brothers - they are the ultimate fans of MJ.
0307716546|4.0|I'm always skeptical of books written from the point of view of a dead character.  The narrator here isn't fully dead, but she's still running around like a ghost and listening into conversations so it's about the same.  It's an interesting technique which allows for omniscient narration and works reasonably well here but it does get tiresome at points.  And sorting out who went into the the school when, on what floor, etc got a bit tricky and tiresome also, but for the most part I enjoyed this book and was interested enough to want to know who set the fire and why.  I don't think it's as wonderful as some reviewers, but it's a decently readable book.
B001P5VT5O|5.0|I paid a little over $20.00 for this remarkable 5 album set.  Having not devoted a great deal of attention to the Allman Brothers beyond their stellar 70s output, I ordered this set on the basis of a handful of positive reviews.  Suffice it to say that the 5 albums contained in this set--representing the bulk of the band's output in the 90s--is absolutely top-shelf: southern blues at their very best.  I recommend this set without any hesitation; if anything, it is even better than the expectation created by that handful of positive reviews!  Grab a set while you have the opportunity!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love it. it totally rocks. you have to battle all these evil creatures. the game is very easy to learn
159420411X|2.0|Nate Silver's book starts well but becomes quite boring after chapter one, a pity! The baseball case is badly structured and sends the reader to sleep...

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Book seems incomplete.  20 pages of citations.  Seems like some new information, but the author doesn't provide enough information to draw a conclusion.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|The Bad:<br />* It's LONG. It's over 2 hours and feels like it. The first time I tried watching it, I couldn't sit through it. I got up and started doing other things and kept looking over at it thinking, \\"Is this thing still going?\\"<br />* It's more than one story. There are a few times the story could have ended, but it's covers her story, a bit of his story, and the kid's story, so it keeps going until all three are wrapped up.<br />* The romance isn't very believable. I can't see these two falling for each other in any sort of real way.<br /><br />The Good:<br />* the cinematography is insanely good<br />* Hugh Jackman. He's scruffy, half naked, and doing manly horse things. Yum.<br />* The kid, Nullah, is cute and used with wonderful effectiveness.<br />* The lost generation story. As an American, I know nothing about aboriginal culture. Yes, it's one sided, but it's interesting.<br />* The grandfather. He says and does so little, but it's hauntingly powerful and lovingly beautiful.<br /><br />I have watched this from start to finish twice. It's doable if you focus on the parts that you like and are patient with the rest.
0446554995|2.0|I am a  huge fan of Preston & Child  and have been anxiously awaiting their latest book, Two Graves, to be published.  What a disappointment!!!  The first 40 pages are exact copies of their prior books.  I suppose the purpose of  this was to give  those readers who  have not read their prior books background for this book but for those of us who have been faithfully reading their books over the years, I found it not only irritating but distracting as well.  I skimmed through these pages but it did detract from my enjoyment of starting the book.  After I finally got into the book, it was certainly not up to their prior standards.  The book is plodding and wanders all over the places.  In the past, I have found their writing to be sharp and suspensful.  This one is a real yawn.  In fact, I kept dozing off as I was reading it which has certainly not been the case in the past.  I would not recommend this and would urge Preston & Child fans to pass on this one.  Don't waste your time or your money.
B004I654WQ|5.0|My 2 year old wants to watch this DVD every day!  It's a cute story that I enjoy watching too...maybe not every day though.  Lol
B009SCRERI|4.0|Grandaughters, ages 7 and 6, loved it.  The storyline about sisters helping each other out hit home for them as well.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|\\"Winter of the World\\" was a compelling naration of the horror of the Nazi regime during World War II.  I enjoyed it very much.  I especially enjoyed picking up on the characters from \\"Fall of Giants\\" and following them and their children through World War II.  I must say, however, that I thought \\"Fall of Giants\\" was a better effort on Ken Follet's part.  I am looking forward to the third part of this trilogy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Masterpiece Theater productions are exactly that: theatrical masterpieces. This is one of the best. I just want them to keep making more.

B002RSOTSM|5.0|Hitchcock at his best. Builds the suspense and it never gets old. I've watched this movie many times over the years and it's still a great movie.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Air combat in bite sized missions. This is a perfect game for me. Real world aircraft in correct markings with accurate weapons. I love it! I hope Third Wire expands upon this successful game with some air to ground/sea missions.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I think it's because it's an App for my Kindle. That's OK, I don't use it as much as others, but for what it is, I have had no problems.

B009MF56GC|5.0|Once again Mr Church (played by Bruce Willis) has his &#34;frienemy&#34; Barny Ross pay him back for stealing 5 million dollars.  To find, retrieve 5 tons of weapons grade plutonium and then a little bit of payback against Vilian the Villan (Played by Van Damm)<br />'<br />Very little actual swearing in this one- as one of the conditions to Mr Chuck Norris's role in this film as &#34;Booker&#34; he insisted that the swearing be cleaned up.  Kudo's for Mr Norris.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Just when you thought Men In Black could not get any better, it just did. Smith and Jones brought back that amazing connection and mutual respect give us an MIB 3 that was soooo worth the wait. Great movie!!

B009IJJ712|5.0|Love the fact that they called this show Elementary when he's a complete genius. And great chemistry between the two main characters. This show is definitely on my DVR. And look forward to watching it after Person of Interest every Thursday night!
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Very well done- its great to be able to watch 3 or 4 episodes in an order.  The video quality is high and acceptable.  Rick Bergman is a jerk for not listening to fans and he killed the series by making it very dark and film nior.<br />'<br />For being such a jerk, I'm sure you've noticed that Mr. Bergman is nowhere near the reboot series.  Just pointing that out.

B000RZIGVS|3.0|Should have been released in Blu Ray rather than low rez television.  Rather disappointing actually.  But its better than nothing
B004TLM284|3.0|Britney Spears' first album into the decade of 2010 showcased a revamped, updated electro-pop sound that catapulted her back into the spotlight; 3 top 5 singles came as a result from it including the #1 smash hit 'Hold It Against Me' and the #3 single 'Till The World Ends', which was accompanied by a massively popular music video. However its commercial success was no surprise even before its release in 2011, given the fact that the album was produced by a hoard of untouchable hit-makers, most notoriously Max Martin, Dr. Luke & Shellback.<br /><br />The reality of the album's musical content is however less prestigious; while saturating the music with dubstep breaks, techno synths, pervasive melodine, eq filters and massive compression makes for an undeniably trendy output, one can't help but wonder how is it that Britney Spears' style and persona fit into this at all. The lyrical content smooths the transition, since Britney has always been undeniably sexual, but her passionless singing is hardly convincing at all, for which she comes off as rather washed up instead of punchy and seductive; not to mention the fact that any life out of her vocals is sucked out by the melodine.<br /><br />The 4 or 5 songs that were composed and produced by the aforementioned producers are undoubtedly the most enjoyable ones, where the melodies of a nice Max Martin composition are decent regardless of Spears' commitment to them. The one exception I could point out would be the book-ending 'Criminal', which its thematic about a girl blindly in love with an outlaw, which unknowingly sucks her into the negativity of his lifestyle, is a theme in which there is a tangible connection to Britney's own previous love life, where the faint tone of her delivery is convincing to the helpless, gritty exposition of the subject matter. Other than that, the album is as hype and glossy as her hitmaker producers like it to be, where her own charisma is absent, and her as an artist comes second.

0385535147|4.0|Haven't read Grisham in a few years. Lately Ive been unable to find much of anything absorbing to read so I was pleasantly surprised to whip through this book at Mach Speed. I liked the story, the characters and the locale; my home in old Virginny. Look, it isnt War and Peace but its a good story well crafted and I recommend it.
0736083863|5.0|I feel very thankful to Amazon.com for &#34;suggesting&#34; this book to me.  When placing an order one day, I saw it advertised on the screen.  I was able to &#34;view&#34; some of the pages.  This is detailed anatomy of important muscles used in Pilates exercises to align the body and stabilize the core.  With this book as my guide, I am able to work at a more advanced level doing the same exercises that I was doing, because I am aware of the muscles, joints, and bones necessary to get the maxiumum workout.  When I have my current exercises mastered at this more advanced level, the book will guide me what to do next.  I won't ever outgrow this book--it is that good.
B007B6VOG0|1.0|After hearing we are young I wanted to die and never exist again. (I was giving this album as a gift and in the garbage it went in) i heard the entire album once.Then you people like it and play the whack garbage song everywhere. Now they have an album. Kill me now, I can only guess that the rest of the album has garbage music too, and please don't tell me that the girl jan saves the song she whack too and has like half a line.i wanted to diss her hair style but amazon will delete my review, just think of something nasty. Fun is whack.

0312117337|5.0|This deck was first introduced to me by another tarot reader.  The level of universal truth that these cards contain as well as the magnificent insight of Osho in the guidebook have been an invaluable tool for me over the two years that I've used these cards. I don't use these cards for everyday readings. Rather, I use them whenever I feel like I'm lost on path and can't get out of my own way.  The guidance I get is both gentle and direct.  I have found no deck that says it better than this one.

B0050R0YB8|5.0|this set is very good, got it from amazon for a good deal. I have a lot of fun to built this set. it is huge, you need to think about the free space before building the set. This is a must have LEGO Star War UCS set.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Saw the movie, which was confusing at times, but I really, really liked the movie a lot.  I bought the book to better understand the fine details of the movie and was not disappointed.  It is a complex book and theme, but thoroughly enjoyed the writing and the movement through time. If you want a good read - buy it; but, it is not an easy &#34;beach&#34; read.
1416972250|5.0|Really awesome series, definitely check it out. it keeps you wanting to know whats going to happen next, hard to put down.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am watching the vampire Diaries with an autistic patient of mine. He loves them. He is 23-year-old and loves the pretty girls and is learning a lot about the social behaviors of people. He is obsessed about vampires and these DVDs have really helped him to concentrate.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game was FAOTD today so I downloaded it despite the criticism about lacking zoom capability.<br />This is simply not true - it does zoom! However, zooming or moving the zoomed image produces a false tap where you touch it first - which is not a problem at least without the timer.<br /><br />Great story, many chapters, doable tasks and rechargeable tips.<br />I like particularly that you can turn off the timer - this is a game, not a race.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Promoted to me by a friend and I read it. It bounces around in time so watch the chapters. I have heard that a movie is already in the works, not sure if it is true.<br /><br />The characters do draw you in and you do get caught up in the different connections. I enjoyed the book and would recommend reading it.

0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen has described the events as best as he could, of the events as they transpired. Training clicked in as events started to go haywire, as they are wont to do. The insertion and exit could have been a disaster but weren't. I found the book very readable and unputdownable-- a real page turner!! I was trained in the same business but I was fascinated by the fact that nothing really had changed-technology yes!-but the human factor was still there as it must be. I recommend this book to everyone.

B00003CXBH|5.0|\\"The Mission\\" is indeed one of the most heartfelt movies I ever seen so far. It captures the heart of humanity at its best in the midst of oppression and chaos. As a college student taking a course on Latin America literature, one of the topics that was constantly discussed during the course was the treatment of the indigenous people and the human rights violations that were committed by the Spanish colonialism. Director Roland Joffé did a splendid job by illustrating the historical event through his movie.<br /><br />One of the things that I found interesting in the movie is the relationship of the character \\"Rodrigo Mendoza,\\" played by Robert De Niro, to Bortelome de Las Casas. Las Casas, like Mendoza, also participated in the Spanish colonialism in Latin America and was a witness to the bloodiest massacre that was carried out against the indigenous people. Upon witnessing such horror, Las Casas was transformed and converted to Christianity, later becoming a priest who advocated on behalf of the indigenous people. Similarly, the experience of a terrible incident led to the transformation of Mendoza, and he showed true love for his follow indigenous population and later advocated for them even at the cost of his life. Even though all the characters had different names, they all represented in some way or other the historical figure that changed the indigenous civilization forever.<br /><br />However, in the midst of chaos, as history always shows, rises a humble voice of reason that condemns the act of violence and oppression against our follow brothers and sisters. Surely, \\"The Mission\\" is one of those voices that not only tells the story of a people that once were a great civilization, but also the tale of a great people who gave their lives to save someone else people because they simply believed in the power of human and solidarity.<br />[[ASIN:B001QB5S3G The Mission]]
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is awesome. I was a little wary of World War Z given the zombie rage that is currently going on. After a couple friends insisted that I read it, I gave in.<br /><br />After reading, you'll look at the zombie threat in a whole new way. This book isn't about gore and horror. Instead, you'll learn of the mistakes mankind made in the fictional war against the walking dead (World War Z) from the perspective of a UN inspector following cessation of hostilities.<br /><br />Not your average zombie story, this book is a fun read and well worth your time!
B008GANNIC|5.0|The Best P.O.D. project in years. I loved it, yes it is straight forward and in your face, but if your buying a P.O.D. album what else would you want. so amazing and 5 stars and more
030759565X|5.0|As a dedicated reader of her blog, I have tested several of her recipes and was really looking forward to the cookbook. After my first read through I look forward to trying most of the recipes in the book, actually tempted to pull a 'Julie and Julia' style recipe testing on this one. I have already tried out 3/4 of the previews from the book she put on the site and loved them, and some of the recipes in the book have appeared in some form on the blog before so I know I'll enjoy cooking from this cookbook as much as I do from her blog. While some readers have a quibble with the format of the cookbook I actually find it refreshing that she stuck to the same personal, candid style of her blog.
B00A4GXJD0|1.0|I have every album Kid Rock has made but this album SUCKS.  I don't know how to overstate this - worst album ever.  I can't find 10 seconds of anything good.  It is so bad I don't even want to listen to his old stuff.  I wish I could erase the songs from my mind as easy as I did my iTunes account.  don't waste your money - listen to two cats fighting would be better.
0811879542|5.0|I am in need of a new copy of this book as ours has been loved to death and is falling apart.<br /><br />Such a simple concept, but my kids LOVE this book. I will often spy them looking through it together and shaking it when the narrative calls for it or happily pressing the dots. It's just so nice to have a book that encourages some simple imagination, suspension of belief (I don't think my kids think the dots are truly moving) and happy interaction.<br /><br />Buy this book!

B008KW43TE|5.0|Prince's \\"purple rain\\" pours over \\"channel orange\\"... for a modern r&b continuation...but on first listen through samples<br />on the net, my first impression was based on a full tilt falsetto voice festival when I'm more inclined to voices like Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart. Realising that the cd is being high on many different end of the year charts, I bought a cd copy...What a difference, a perfect blend of smooth and hard where the bass and other instruments complement well the different high tones of the voices for a non \\"shrilling\\" experience. Believe your ears not the stories surrounding Frank Ocean.<br /><br />I had the same problem with Miguel's Kaleidoscope dream and with Meat+Bone by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion...my ears prefer the sound of the cd...the samples on the net just don't give the same edge...while listening with the same speakers to all the material.<br /><br />So just keep Frank Ocean on the top of the list with Tame Impala, Alabama Shakes and Grimes for the best 2012 record with a special place for  The Seer by the Swans and Djando Django...<br /><br />Wow! 2012 has been a vintage year for music.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|The late-night jazz sounds combined with this artist's incredible and unique voice is the best music I've heard in a long. long. long time.

B0052RDHTM|1.0|Pillars of the Earth is one of my all-time favorite books.<br />Unfortunately this book is nowhere near that caliber. Follett is hung up on describing boring scenes, but makes the few and far between interesting passages underwritten. The ending is not an ending. It's as if the writer met his page quota, then stopped writing. Unfortunately a subject that has the potential to be an amazing story, is amazingly uninteresting.
030759565X|5.0|Love how the cookbook is arrange with stories and pictures.<br />tried a few recipes that were excellent. Great addition to my go to cookbooks.
B001JRB16U|5.0|The packaging on this DVD was really nice. I am giving this to my niece who is 11. She is going to love it.
B001NESPHC|5.0|The only CD's as good as this one are her other CD's. Nothing and no one compares. I am anxiously waiting for her next release.
B0017HEX76|1.0|I should've read the reviews. It turns out this item was made in Korea. It apparently has an English version, however, the English is dubbed. At first I thought it had an English version included on the DVD, which seemed okay. But then I decided to read a bunch of the reviews and found at least one person who said the English version had subtitles. Just not what I was after and not something to give a child. Which was the plan. I think it needs to be clearly stated (near the top of the product page) that this is Korean with English version with subtitles. The upside of this experience is that Amazon is giving me a refund, and as always, has super customer service including supplying me with postage for the shipment back to them.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I heard this group only once on YouTube, and knew I wanted to hear more. The combination of their voices  and the rich quality made my heart soar. But I am glad I heard them before I bought the CD, as the title of the CD was not a 'turn-on' for me. But then again, you must realize I am elderly...and don't feel up to any 'Wicked Games'. However, I do love to hear them sing. And, I love telling others about this group. Also, the songs done in English meant the most to me, but hey....they are Italian, I know. Well, just talking about them makes me want to go and hear it again, so--thanks for making them available to me, whoever you are.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I got this for a gift and the person loved it. The set is in a nice quality metal container.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Fan of the show?  This is all the music from the first four seasons.  Katey Segal sings a few and her voice is awesome.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This was money well spent.  I would have thought that the added weight would be a hindrance.  It's actually more of a help.  The heavier weight forces you to be more steady.  Another huge bonus of this grim is the vertical shutter button so you don't have to bow your right arm around for portrait shots.<br /><br />This grip is a must.  Do not buy the Zeikos models...they feel and are cheap plastic and are not durable.  this one is very durable with a rubber grip as well.  If you can't afford this one...save up until you can.  you will thank yourself later.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone looking for a wicked fairy tail. It is what every ordinary woman of the world wants. To have a wealthy man fall in love with her and sweep her off her feet. Plus you get all kinds of neat ideas to do with you partner along the way.

B0071AKB38|1.0|Got this for my techie husband who complains that his iPad isn't loud enough when watching movies on it.  He was very excited to receive this and charged it right away to use, and it paired fine via Bluetooth with the iPad, but he could not get any sound out of it.  He adjusted the volume and the mute switches, still no luck.  He then hard-wired it to the iPad by plugging it directly into the unit using included cord, tried both heads on the plug, still could not get a peep out of the unit, not even static.  The iPad was also silent when the speaker was connected so the iPad had correctly sensed the speaker and had transferred sound over.  Hoping this is a fluke...unless the speaker just doesn't work with the iPad 3.  Had to return the speaker.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This entire series is a must read. The female character is one that is easy to love and easy to visualize yourself in her shoes. Who doesn't want a little excitement in their life? This book is full of surprises.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I chose this book based on seeing a clip about it on Good Morning America. I was hoping to read more about the experience in Heaven and less explanation of each scientific or medical happening. Although, I do see the reasoning behind it. This should greatly help those who work in the medical field find hope and belief in God and Heaven.

B0031RS4UM|5.0|I can't believe that I have only recently discovered Lee Child books.  I am now a firm fan and will be buying the whole series budget permitting.  For anyone who likes a well written thriller, Lee Child is for you.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|It's funny because before watching this movie, I was watching another one which was literally putting me to sleep. Not expecting much from this movie either, I started it up, paused and went to brush my teeth thinking I would end the night and fall to sleep 15 minutes in.<br /><br />Almost 2 hours later, I'm wide awake and excited and completely impressed. I've not watched a movie of this caliber for a very long time. I think movies like these should get nominated for many awards over movies like Avatar even though they're not connected. The amazing and highly believable acting, the compelling plot, the suspense the kept me fully alert, the action scenes that kept me glued to the screen with wide eyes, and not to mention the numerous breathtaking scenery shots found in this movie (very artistic and emotionally stimulating).<br /><br />I'm shaking my head as to why I've not been alerted to such a great movie before.<br /><br />AMAZING, highly recommended. Just wow!<br />This goes right up there to my top movie choices. I actually want to watch it again!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not far in the book yet but so far it is great! Can't wait to find out what will happen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is very well written and filled with suspense.  The main characters are well developed and interesting.<br />The plot is very imaginative--beyond belief, actually.  But, I did tire of the foul language which I thought very<br />unnecessary to the plot. The &#34;f-bomb&#34; is dropped liberally; I don't enjoyi reading that word over and over again.<br />Otherwise, our book club will enjoy reviewing this book as it's plot is very well done and surprises lurk throughout.
1250027624|5.0|We love the book.  It makes a great gift for Downton Abbey fans. The book arrived on time, it was in excellent condition.<br /> I would most definitely recommend this book to friends & family.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Fantastic collector's addition to the end of the Nolan Batman Trilogy. The statuette it comes with is a fantastic addition to any Batman collection. If you don't get this, you're only a medium grade Batman fan, at best.

0345803507|5.0|Once you start reading Book One, your hooked.  Its hard to describe, but you get submered into the story.  You're deep into it, as if your actually Ana.  I say just buy all 3 of the books.  You have to read to believe it.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|Was a bit apprehensive going into this season without Andy Whitfield and yes he plays Spartacus a bit different but it works and also this season introduced us to secondary characters from season one and new ones who flowed extremely well with new Sparty and made for an epic season. Saddened by the fact next season is the last but it will be one amazing ending much like this one.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This was a high quality film like the other one. However no one with ever make a better one then the 1st.
B006XBSC8C|5.0|Prefer this cleaner version of the album.  Numerous good songs! I don't usually buy whole albums, but this one was worth it.
B004YM6JK0|4.0|These Winchester boys are constantly sacrificing themselves for one another and not having a real life but that's the card that was dealt to them when they became hunter and this time isn't any different. The plot this season was simple as opposed to previous ones but it was still fun if only things came together a little better it could have been a really good season but here's hoping this season is better.<br /><br />Would recommend
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was a high quality film like the other one. However no one with ever make a better one then the 1st.
1932100660|5.0|The studies were well done and the writing it is extremely readable and understandable.

Its not gonna be studio quality sound, but Its 100 times better than the built in mic on my camera that picks up all of the noises when I touch the camera.
B0098460O4|5.0|A great CD...great Christmas gift.  They have such wonderful voices and the price is reasonable too!  Glad I bought it.

0316056863|5.0|I remember watching Tina Fey on Weekend Update when I was younger, and following her career as she moved from SNL to 30 Rock to film. 30 Rock has long been my favorite TV show, and Fey's smart humor shows just as much on 30 Rock as it does in Bossypants. She is quick-witted, dry without being obnoxious, and somehow plays her sarcasm just right so that you know exactly when she's joking and when she's not.<br /><br />Even if this wasn't written by Tina Fey I would have loved this book, because that's how strong her voice is. I've always found her funny, but I was surprised to see how great her writing is. It's authentic, honest, conversational but polished, and she strikes a great balance throughout between \\"here's what I've learned, \\"but that's just my crappy opinion.\\"<br /><br />I'd recommend this read for anybody - not just women, not just SNL or 30 Rock fans, not just people who like comedy. It's an easy read (took me two days), and makes me want to call up my friends and gush to them about how good it was.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Ok the name of the game made me headscratch a little,  but it didn't affect the game play at all.  Bean Quest is a polished game that's great for mindless time killing.  The object of the game is to jump around to collect gems and stomp out the bad guys.  The jump par (Stat that you get at the end of each level) keeps me playing to improve as do the collection items.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Love this movie.  Great artistry.  The actors are wonderful.  The characters are endearing.  One to watch over and over again.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|The game was fun until I reached level 75. Kindle does not get the same updates as other platforms. That makes the game repetitive and kind of boring. Way too many pop ups! anywhere from 4 to 7.

B008FOB124|4.0|New tunes without being in a genre. Sounds very similar to their other albums, but I'm enjoying it a lot.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|How often is it that you can purchase an album and like every song on it?  Not enough these days.  Caro can sing, the lyrics are good, and the music is just awesome!  Kind of jazzy, slightly poppy, a little retro...wonderful combination.  And none of the songs sounds the same...lots of diversity and will probably get play from me for a few years.
030759565X|4.0|So far, everything we have made from this cookbook has been great, and we have lots more recipes tagged to try. We love that there's a photograph of every recipe and the stories that go along with them are lovely to read.<br /><br />This was a cookbook I thought about, put on the back burner, and then bought when I saw so many of the other food bloggers I read praise it. I don't have a blog, but now I can say that I highly recommend it, too.
0321885112|5.0|I picked this up after following Mike's work for some time. This book brought me back to the basics of drawing and visual note taking. Drawing during meetings now becomes more meaningful. This was just the thing I needed to start drawing again. His examples are great and it's nice to see others work too.<br /><br />Overall a great book. The video is really nice too. Read the book on my ipad, then watched the video. I have the hardcopy now and will read that again to see if I missed anything.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone.
0321885112|5.0|Quick take: great book -- well organized, clear instructions, and, of course, good illustrations. Highly recommended.<br /><br />I didn't know much about sketchnoting before buying this book. I'd gleaned a bit about it from author Mike Rohde's tweets, and from those by another contributor, Veronica Erb, and I was curious to learn more. Along came this book, and I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />It's a fun read -- Mike Rohde's enthusiasm really shines through. It's also surprisingly well organized, at least compared to what I expected from a book about doodling. Mike does a nice job of explaining the value of sketchnoting, i.e., why it's a useful technique, and then walks you through different kinds of sketchnote patterns and the how-tos.<br /><br />The book also contains a lot of examples from other sketchnoters; these give you an idea of other peoples' styles, and offer their take on tools and techniques. It might be mildly intimidating to see so many great-looking examples, and wondering, \\"Will I ever get this good at it, and if not, is it worth trying?\\" Fortunately, Mike mentions early and often that a) if you can draw *really* simple shapes, then you can sketchnote, and b) it's more about structure than art. I found that reassuring.<br /><br />I bought the book+video version, and I'm glad I did. The book is fine by itself, i.e., if you just bought the book, I think you'd be ok. But the videos let you see Mike sketchnoting in realtime, and I found that complemented the book very well.<br /><br />Suggestions for the next edition:<br /><br />- Recommended equipment: Mike mentions which pen and notebook he uses, and many of the other contributors do so too, but these are scattered throughout the book. Might be worth pulling this together onto a single page, to help us newbies. Do I go with a Moleskine, or one of the spiral-bound notebooks?...<br /><br />- Other applications/contexts: Mike mentions sketchnoting while attending conferences (IA Summit, anyone?);it would be helpful to mention other applications if relevant.<br /><br />In conclusion: if you've ever attended a conference and have taken notes, you ought to buy this book. As for me, I've ordered my sketchnoting pens, and am eager to put Mike's book into practice.

1439152802|5.0|During a family celebration teenage Laurel is taking a break hiding out from the rest of her family. From her spot hidden in the tree-house. she sees a strange man appear and watches as her mother stabs and kills him. The true nature of this encounter remains a family secret known only to her and her parents. In the present day as her mother Dorthy lies dying a picture trigger her to discover the mystery behind this man her mother killed. Alternating between Laurel's hunt for the truth and 1940-41 in London the story starts falling together. This was a great story that kept me reading to figure out what was going on. I really liked the characters Laurel and Jimmy and Vivian. I could not stand the character of Dorthy in 1941 and was surprised by and pleased with the ending. Having only read The Forgotten Garden previously by Morton I will be seeking out her other couple of novels in the near future.
B004OZZ624|2.0|As many reviewers have noted this film is filled with implausible events but the one that ruins the suspense is when the detective finds a piece of Crowe's Prius  tailight plastic which leads him IMMEDIATELY to Crowe, which leads him immediately to Crowe's breakout location, which leads him immediately to a garbage can full of Crowe's notes and maps for the scheme. Dude should buy a lottery ticket he's so lucky.<br /><br />The rest of the weak points can be smoothed over by a suspension of disbelief but to go from a jagged piece of plastic to IDing it as a piece of plastic from a Prius that is registered to Crowe's wife as the FIRST GUESS just ruins the whole thing. From that point on every step the detective takes is directly in line with Crowe's plan. He even runs around crowded downtown Pittsburgh and just happens to see Crowe and his wife in the split second they are visible in a subway tunnel.<br /><br />You will agree with everyone else that her conviction would have been impossible in the first place. Really, it's a weak story held up by implausibilities and a waste of your time.

B005LAIHR2|4.0|Whoa!  You've never seen Tom Cruise like this!<br /><br />The movie is totally worth it just to see Cruise's performance on stage.<br /><br />Talk about raw energy! Talk about moves! Talk about a fantastic voice! The film came alive during his performances.  And he was sexy, and had more rock in him than anyone you've seen at the Grammy's.<br /><br />Russell Brand and Alex Baldwin were great and helped ground the film. It's the first time I've seen Baldwin in something I've liked. Paul Beamonti (misspelled) is always good no matter what part he plays.  Too bad the romance between Julianne Hough and her boyfriend (name unknown because the font the film used for the credits was almost unreadable) brought the film down. It was way too long, cheesy, and boring, but the film is well worth seeing Cruise perform.  He deserves an Oscar.

B0072OFM28|5.0|I watched the 10-episode season of Spartacus: Vengeance. What an amazing story. I won't give too many spoilers, but in many ways, this is the best season of Spartacus yet.<br /><br />If you're new to the series, you can start with Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. That's the prequel they filmed when series star Andy Whitfield got sick.<br /><br />Andy had filmed the original series, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which got everything off to an impressive start. Co-stars John Hannah and Lucy Lawless were brilliant, the entire cast was top-notch, and the story-line was epic. Blood and Sand ends in a rebellion that claims the lives of Hannah's and Lawless' characters, and the story was set to boil over into the next season.<br /><br />Then Whitfield came down with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He took time off to fight his disease. In a stroke of genius, the show's creators decided to show what happened at the gladiator school BEFORE Spartacus arrived. We were introduced to MORE amazing actors and characters, and Hannah and Lawless got to explore depths of their treacherous yet devoted characters that are some of the best roles written for anybody - ever. Gods of the Arena is really the story of Hannah and Lawless' characters, and their incredible scheming.<br /><br />Sadly, Whitfield lost his battle with lymphoma. So when it came time to cast the next season, Spartacus: Vengeance, the show's producers picked Liam McIntyre, who looks a lot like Andy. Stunt-casting like that usually fails, and Liam plays a more warm, less cold-blooded Spartacus. This will rub some viewers as wrong, but if you accept that personal growth is a big part of the story, it actually works.<br /><br />Spartacus: Vengeance takes place after the events of Spartacus: Blood and Sand so is called \\"season 2\\" in a move that will confuse many viewers. The producers sweetened the plot by bringing back Lucy Lawless' character, Lucretia. Though she seemed dead at the end of \\"Blood and Sand,\\" they found a way to bring her back, totally mad after the events that saw her house, marriage and life ruined.<br /><br />Spartacus: Vengeance tells the story of the early stage of the Spartacan rebellion, or Third Servile War. And there is enough intrigue, back-stabbing, and plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you liked Lucretica's scheming, just wait till you see what Ilithyia, played by Viva Bianca, gets up to. The ending is both horrific and satisfying, and makes this the role of Lucy Lawless' career. Xena, Shmeena!<br /><br />Vengeance is a season in which most characters ask themselves: \\"What's next?\\"  For Spartacus, it's \\"What's next after I pull off a slave rebellion?\\" His answer is a quest to find love with Mira (maybe) and definitely vengeance on Glaber, the Roman senator who first hired him as a mercenary then sold Spartacus and his wife into slavery.<br /><br />for loyal Crixus, what's next is to find redemption saving Naevia -- their illicit love ended with her being sent off to the mines.  Crixus is obsessed with freeing her.<br /><br />For Doctore/Oenomaus, what's next is how to find honor after he's lost it all. We learn Oenomaus' backstory. You thought maybe you learned his history in the prequel, Gods of the Arena.  There's a lot more to the man.<br /><br />For Gannicus, the freed gladiator, what's next is finding something to live for.  His character has been adrift since Gods of the Arena. Can Spartacus inspire Gannicus with new purpose?<br /><br />You probably know that Spartacus is based on a real person, though very little is known about him. Gannicus, Crixus and Oenomaus were all real gladiator/rebels as well. One change is that in real life, Oenomaus was a Gaul; they make him a Nubian for the series so they could use Peter Mensah, a martial arts master who is also a masterful actor.<br /><br />And I have to mention actor Nick Tarabay, who plays scheming gladiator and all-around scumbag Ashur. He's not a historical figure, but seems modeled after the character Aaron from Titus Andronicus; the character who boasted:<br /><br />\\"I have done a thousand dreadful things<br />As willingly as one would kill a fly,<br />And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<br />But that I cannot do ten thousand more\\"<br /><br />Speaking of Shakespeare, the language of TV's Spartacus will seem Shakepearean at times. To get that effect, the writers translated Roman texts -- words and phrases -- literally and incorporated them into the scripts. The language really helps transport you to another time.<br /><br />If you liked Rome, if you liked the Sopranos, consider TV's Spartacus. The show is not for kids or even teens, or anyone with a weak stomach. But it is awesome.racter Aaron from Titus Andronicus; the character who boasted:<br /><br />\\"I have done a thousand dreadful things<br />As willingly as one would kill a fly,<br />And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<br />But that I cannot do ten thousand more\\"<br /><br />Speaking of Shakespeare, the language of TV's Spartacus will seem Shakepearean at times.

B001BKG9SK|5.0|If you are a David Gilmour, Pink Floyd fan or not I would recommend this package. David's voice and playing keep maturing and this is the pinnacle so far for him. Most of the songs on this are from the album &#34;On An Island&#34;. He has penned some beautiful and memorable tunes here. His fluid, ringing guitar riffs pour out like honey, sweet and smooth. The tight playing of this ensemble of talented musicians, accompianied by a string section sounds more like a huge symphony. at the same time it is a prime example of progressive rock worthy of David and Pink Floyd.<br /><br /> I find the DVD much better than the average concert as they spent more time showing the performers playing and singing than usual and has no &#34;commentary&#34;. I particularly enjoy watching David play as I think he is perhaps the finest all around guitar player performing today. His use of various instruments, including his first use of the saxaphone in a live venue shows a performer who has worked constantly to improve himself. He seems to be the sort of performer to never rest on his laurels. The obvious enjoyment that all of the performers show in the performance also make it particularly enjoyable for me to watch and listen to. This is also the last recorded live performance of Richard Wright that I am aware of. R.I.P. The setting of the historic Gdansk shipyard makes this very memorable to me.<br /><br />This 2-CD, 2-DVD set is a great value and has included the entire &#34;On An Island&#34; CD content on the second DVD. The Pink Floyd tracks are very good and include a couple of my all time favorites, &#34;High Hopes&#34; and &#34;Echoes&#34;. Th video quality of the DVD's is excellent. I hope David will release at least one more CD before he retires and that it will be as beautiful and inspiring to me as &#34;On An Island&#34;. If you like this I would recommend the Pink Floyd CD/DVD set P.U.L.S.E., another live concert from their 1994 tour to promote Division Bell.
B003XF1OJK|3.0|This is a good read if you are fan of the games.  IT helps to have played the games as this will fill in a lot of character detail and depth.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I played and completed this game very quickly, not because the game was short but because I did not want to stop playing! The puzzles are fun and unique, the story interesting and the graphics definitely a bonus! I would recommend this game to anyone!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I am having trouble getting started on the fire.  it wont let me move please help I keep starting over
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read Catching Fire in 2 days. This is the best book yet! I can't wait to start the next one!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is awesome. The HD 4000 integrated video processor hooks up with my ATI video card via Virtu MVP software included on my motherboard. This allows for Hyper v-sync, and performance optimization.
B007N8RULO|2.0|I do not like this game. I would much rather play the Angry Birds Game.<br />Not much action on this.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This came right on schedule.  The same day it was released it was on my doorstep.  I could not have been any easier!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly's &#34;The Black Box&#34; was excellent and a fast read.<br />Loved the book and the last few chapters were very intense!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|~pending~ on is it good or not so this was like my first or 2nd app and I don't now if I like or not like like me I just think about the game befor purchases it and I look a the reviews so ~pending~
B008ALAHA4|5.0|One concern I had when getting this was whether it would pop off the end of the cable too easily. So far, I haven't had that problem. It disconnects easily (but not too easily) from the Mac, and seems to hold a little more firmly to the cable so you never end up with it still connected to the computer when unplugging.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Please don't judge but I am not a poetry reader. I don't dislike poetry I just don't read any for pleasure beyond Maya Angelou but she is a given. Colleen Hoover's book was so good I really found myself as interested in the Slam Poetry concept and poems as the actual story. It is one of those times when you wish you had an audio version the book to hear the poems as Hoover intended.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This album ranks in my view just behind albums Aja, Goucho and Two Against Nature. LIke those I'll be listening to it, basically addicted to it for years.  If you love Donald Fagen, this album is an example of the reasons why. As always with DJ and SD it  gets better and better the more you listen to it--he even has a few new tricks (instruments, and arranging) up his sleeve this time.
B00008AY3L|5.0|I really enjoy this album. The music is both beautiful and makes one want to dance. What's not to love about Ben Harper?
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|My copy of THE STORY OF FILM arrived yesterday and I dove into it immediately.<br /><br />I have watched the first 3 episodes and so far am really glad I sprang for this set, and I can imagine re-watching it often. Already I am caught up in Cousins' approach, and he continually offers insights I've not encountered elsewhere.<br /><br />I agree somewhat with the previous reviewer; Cousins perhaps was not the best choice to narrate his own project. To my American ears, his Ulster accent makes each? sentence? sounds as if? it is a question? It is becoming disconcerting. I have been watching Kevin Brownlow's & David Gill's HOLLYWOOD (Thames TV) series, and James Mason's narration is so wonderful in that, but HOLLYWOOD is a less personal approach than THE STORY OF FILM is, I think, intended to be.<br /><br />The price is reasonable for this immense documentary, considering the number of film clips involved*. (*Christian Marclay's masterpiece THE CLOCK is comprises a virtually uncountable number of film clips, and I don't expect to see a home video release of that art object in MY lifetime.)
B001CTDH76|5.0|I love having a recorded version of my favorite television series. I love watching through the episodes in sequence. When you are watching it in sequence, instead of random reruns, it is much easier to follow and enjoy. You notice things this way you may have never noticed before. I did not realize just how many hours of episodes I got with this package and it is well designed. it takes up little room in my dvd cabinet.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My infant loved this from 3 weeks (we hung it over his bassinet via ceiling plant hook until it could hook onto the crib) on until it just quit rotating.  Our infant just loved watching it until they fell asleep.  When it quit we had an issue and I was really regretting buying it on Amazon (not aware of typical return replacement policies) because I thought it would be a nightmare to try and exchange for one that worked.  Instead it took me 30 seconds to go on our Amazon account and explain the defect after having the item 5+ months, then 3-4 days later a replacement arrives and the ups van takes the defect model back.  The whole exchange took less than 10 minutes (including taking down and boxing up the broken model), I didn't have to drive to a store and waste gas exchanging it and the replacement came so fast our infant didn’t have to go one restless night without their mobile.  I was so impressed with the service I bought a piano on Amazon afterwards.  Brick and Mortar stores beware this is just easier and reviews help.  Thanks for the great service!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|OK- I know that I am WAAAAY BEHIND THE CURVE ON ANGRY BIRDS.  I downloaded it for my young grandson, and found that it is hilarious, cute, and also FREE!  I am not really a &#34;gamer&#34; (I am old!) so it took me a few trials to get everything right.  But this is such a cute and clever game.  I love it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|He could sit and play this game for hours.  It's also good to get him thinking about what would work in building the cart.  Great job, Rovio!!  I'm impressed!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My kids love Star Wars and Angry Birds. Why not put them together. They play it ll the time. This app is awesome for them.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I really liked this book but I feel it is targeted to a younger audience. Late teens to mid twenties. Interesting read.
0525953728|5.0|Not the greatest I have ever read but it was a good book. One of those books for a trip, or to pass the time. The book is no &#34;Lone survivor,&#34; but still a good read.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|Wish it had been longer.I have read all his books and this doesn't dissapoint except in length. Keep writing Michael.!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The bourne identity series is awesome. I thought this was the best film of the series. got it for my husband for xmas
1439181780|5.0|Positive book, good message, good solid positive advice. Good reading for anyone looking to attrack positive energy into your life.
141659521X|4.0|another well written book by Vince Flynn. The story could have used more action and hands on by Mitch Rapp
B004NELBPC|5.0|It gives me the ability to cruise a lot of news at highway speed......I like the diversity of topics, etc.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Such a well written book that keeps the suspense even after you read the last page!  This book was recommended to me by a friend and I have already read it twice.
0321811984|5.0|I thought this was the most influential book in all of my studies of how to give a successful presentation. We have all learned the basics in high school, like setting up a good intro and conclusion, but teachers don't emphasize the design of the slides as well. This book does an immaculate job at making the reader feel at ease with the presentation process, and just reading the book was a true pleasure. Definitely, this book was written in a very simple, but harmonic, way that makes it very effective at proving its point; presentations should be harmonic, simplistic, yet effective.
1400067820|5.0|Rarely is a book so serious and so fun.  Taleb in a mischievous intellectual; a spiritual descendant of Nietzsche.  Antifragile is the kind of book that makes you question what you've been doing.  It tempts you to live both more \\"dangerously\\" in the short run, but more \\"securely\\" in the long run.  For those having nightmares of Black Swans, Antifragile provides relief.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very good sci-fi western!  Loved the show.  It's nice that it includes a few shows that didn't air.  I recommend it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|999 has a very, VERY deep plot. It will be tough to follow until near the end when all loose ends start tying up. It's intricate, and it tells the story masterfully. If you love games for their plot, then you will not be able to put 999 down.
B004AKCME8|1.0|I had to return this since it arrived broken and damaged. Way it would have worked out...but oh we'll. lets see what happens..
B0049DRH28|4.0|This is one of the first in a series of Anime adventures from the pioneer of the industry. It is a great kick in the pants wonderland with awesome interactions and story line so kick back and enjoy this first!!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It arrived quickly. I'm hoping the person I got it for will love it come Christmas Day...looks like a good movie.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|These headphones were not what I was looking for. If you're an average Joe like me and just like hearing the music you like with good clarity and distortion free these might not be for you. I read the reviews and decided I would give these a try because the ones I wanted (Dr. Dre) were too expensive. When you order studio grade headphones your equipment (ipod, or mp3 player) will not drive these headphones the way you might expect. These cans are very good for discerning sounds but are not good for the normal lister who just wants good sound with some bass. Careful what you order, studio headphones are for engineers not users.
B009H442DG|2.0|I thought I would adore this, it is the first collaboration since Grease. This CD and the video kind of ruined this duo for me. Scientologists can't do Christmas carols.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|This movie keeps you on your toes thru the whole thing. Very enjoyable and keeps you sharp and aware constantly.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a really good book.  I can't hardly wait to start the next one.  It is a little like the Shades of Grey, but with a really good story line from the first.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Not only a good movie but relates some fascinating historical fact as well as fiction. I recommend this movie highly.
B0099114WO|5.0|My mom saw this movie and just loved it. It was a great purchase for her birthday. One that she will enjoy for a long time. GREAT price and shipping was quick.
0452295548|5.0|This book tells the story of a scientist's stroke and how she recovered from it.<br />It also gives helpful tips for someone who is care-giving for a stroke patient. I learned a lot from this book.
0385535147|1.0|I don't often write negative reviews but I had to for this book. There is not one likeable character in it. I hung with it thinking it would turnaround but it just didn't. It's long, not plausible and the main character has no redeeming qualities.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Absolutely amazing! These guys will not disappoint.  I have never been disappointed by anything these guys have put out, and this one is definitely no exception.  I'd recommend them to anyone.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It performs well, and being able to access the cloud across multiple devices is really nice. It needs to have the option of storing purchased content on an SD card rather than on the device's internal memory. Aside from that, it performs very well and worth downloading.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|There is no difference between this edition and the US edition, advertised as origional UK version is misleading. I was hoping to see some difference since we own the US limited edition set...there is none, so if your thinking this Uk edition is different in some way...its not.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Funny!  Lots of funny lines. Stupid humor throughout.  LOTS of cameo appearances. The entire premise is so silly.  Laughed til I cried and then laughed some more til my stomach hurt!
B001706I5I|5.0|This is the only newer movie that could have surpassed the original? Great job !!! My whole family enjoys this movie every year.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun for everyone and I love it so much it's so addicting and cool. It's your own virtual world and Ice Age is my favorite cartoon series so it's the best of both worlds!!!:-)
B008VBYN80|3.0|The play is okay but you would have to be on constantly to get any where.  Just not that good.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I usually don't buy CD's as there are only a few songs I know or like.  However, after seeing this movie, there wasn't a song on there that I didn't know or like from the &#34;old days&#34;<br /><br />There are some very unexpected great voices on here.  Tom Cruise for example.  He could go out on tour with a rock group tomorrow!  Even if you didn't see the movie this sound track rocks.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I didn't know what to think when I picked this up for my book club. It is is not my typical style: it is one of my absolute favorites!
1451696191|5.0|Really good coming of age story. The ending was the best. Finished the book in 4 days. Just couldn't put it down .
B002RPLXWK|1.0|I watched this for John Ritter, and while he did not disappoint I possibly won't watch it again unless I were making fun of it!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|graphics look great ans sound is good.decent game recommend it_:-) its free do give it a go.im using it on the nexus 7 tablet.
B007TR1R22|2.0|i was interested in this movie mostly because rachel weisz is in it ... unfortunately it is something to avoid. there are several serious flaws, starting with the use of the barber violin concerto as a strident, repetitive soundtrack, a script of long pauses and stilted declarations that does not give the male lead enough weight or the secondary characters enough breadth (the mother in law and husband are tedious caricatures), and a truly soggy and lugubrious atmosphere over everything except those jolly tavern singalongs.<br /><br />yes, weisz is very fine as a 20th century madame bovary (dreary postwar london substitutes for dreary provincial france), but madame's shifts between the poise she shows her aggrieved husband and the weepy pleading she unleashes on her brittle lover merely seem bipolar if not darn loopy. complex emotions are presented with facile symbolism -- madame's spiritual decline appears as a shouting match in a museum, and her spiritual triumph occurs when she turns on a gas heater for the heat. \\"what is the nature of love?\\" is the theme here, and the answer seems to be \\"a bad business for everybody involved.\\" the somber visual style and clever editing, which support a complex layering of episodes across time, are skillful and intriguing ... but the layering lacks a psychological logic, and the cleverness does not repay the melodramatic bathos.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is about the best game for any tablet or mobile device. you can do creative and survival modes. and now you can make a alternate nether.
0761158464|4.0|This book has 12 scenes that animate as the pages are turned. There are battle scenes, of course, with light sabre combat, and there are several of the well-known characters moving across the scene.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|This is a lovely adaptation of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel and an absolute delight for those of us who eagerly devour European period films. It was once available on iTunes for rent or purchase; I never checked whether it was available on Amazon Instant. For the moment, it is only available in hard DVD or blu-ray copies. It is not available on Netflix. This is a frustrating move by the distribution company. I love the movie enough to pay for it but have no way to download it at this time. If production and distribution companies want to be fairly compensated for the work they put out, they would make the films available online for anyone who wanted to buy them rather than forcing fans to search for a pirated version in order to be able to watch via the Internet.  Nobody wants to wait two weeks anymore for a DVD to arrive in the mail!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Sit back and get ready to be overwhelmed. Although not completely true to Conan Doyle, Holmes as a super hero<br />is brilliantly pulled off by Downy!
B003QNXPUK|4.0|I was happy to get the shield because I drop my phone frequently. It has both front and back coverage. It also comes with side covers but I recommend skipping use of those. Great price!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Fast paced, interesting and new approach to the &#34; Holmes-Watson&#34; chemistry.<br />In my opinion,Season 2 is good, Season 1 is better .
B0085W09ME|3.0|Hello all this was not as prescribed So I shall keep looking for something I can use on my Kindle Fire. Trying to fine deals as quick as possible. For future travels. Love seeing how each airlines travel routes
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Very nice compilation.  It has a great mix of christmas as well as non-christmas music.  The Joni Mitchell song steals the best song slot for me.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Great music by Kid Rock as always.Never fails to entertain.He's a great entertainer.Loved every song on the CD.He's a great singer.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|We got this for our daughter.  It's her second favorite, just behind Cinderella.  It also includes and extended version which has an extra song.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Lives the entire CD! This group rocks !!! A must hear for anyone! Brittini sounds so much like Janis Joplin.  Well worth it!
0439023521|3.0|This book will not make you think or change your views on anything.  It will not deepen your understanding of the human condition.  However, that's not what the author set out to do, so it's ok.  Good action, very quick read, I like this one the best out of the trilogy.  Haven't seen the movie, so no comparison.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great follow up to the whole Angry Birds Genre.  Very much love the game and game play.  Well worth the download.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|You would never think that this movie was originally based off of a comic. It's more accessable with good characarter devevlopment, no big specaill effects like spiderman or something like that, but passable. Overall a good movie, wheather your a fan of the X-men comic books or not.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app still is very buggy and doesn't have all the features as if you were on FB on a regular computer.  It is a shame.  If they ever get this to work just like a desktop or laptop, the KINDLE FIre HD would be the only computer I would use.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This is an amazing app! I love all of the features it has. However when I try to save my completed pictures they never save. Samsung note 2.
B004F4HWPS|5.0|If your a fan of Bob or just a audiophile the sound of the records is amazing! Also the packaging and extras are presented in such a beautiful package!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I learned so  so much. Thank you for educating us and helping our world. I enjoyed the studies and scientific information you provided.
B008ELUEQC|2.0|I found it very disappointing...most of the songs were by other singers and overshadowed Rod Stewarts voice...I would not recommend it to anyone.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|In the Seventies \\"Saturday Night Live\\" hypothesized what if Eleanor Roosevelt could fly. This five minute sketch was everything \\"Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't-smart, funny, and brief.  The film's concept of our greatest President being a slayer of vampires par excellence is palatable for maybe a half hour.  After that you're longing for a repeat of \\"The Life and Times of Desmond Pfeiffer\\".  Where to begin.  The story is tacky.  The acting is wooden.  The effects are pedestrian.  The gore is a bore.  I also found it offensive, even in a fantasy, the suggestion that Lincoln's mother Nancy and his son Willie were killed by vampires.  I was also repulsed by the conceit that the Civil War was really a battle between the vampires and the mortals.  Regardless, I can't imagine how this debacle was greenlighted other than the involvement of Tim Burton.  Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" will be discussed for generations to come.  This flick will always be the punchline to a bad joke.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The best free app I have ever seen... game wise that is.  There is not a more adicting free game out there
B007SGM084|4.0|Everyone whispered about the sexual content in these books but it was integral to the plot. It was the surface which you had to dig into to uncover the deeply buried secrets that make Christian Grey who he is. I would have preferred it a bit less explicit but I still thoroughly enjoyed all three books.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This bulb far exceeded my expectations.  Even though it is only rated as a 50 watt equivalent, it appears to be closer to a 75 watt equivalent.  Instant on, only warm to the touch after hours of operation and a great warm color as well.
B006YC74E8|4.0|Just to let you guys know the kindle fir us has a camera now. I recently updated my kindle, and when you you go to photos in the top right corner is a little camera. If you press it, it will take photos. No need to pay for a camera app.
0316044695|4.0|Details into what it means to be a Navy Seal was awesome .  The loss of great Americans in the Hindu Kush mountain region of Afghanistan is luckily documented in this respectful way so Americans can and will always remember these heroic actions of our military who sacrifice everything.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This is much better than The Dark Night or the Dark Night Rises. Bales role in Batman Begins was outstanding. It really shows the dark side of Batman and makes it believable. The next two were more corny and seemed to focus more on the effects and not the story.
141694737X|5.0|Flap books are a big favorite around here and the different animals are a big hit.  My three year old is just developing a sense of humor, so he is vastly amused by the final page.  I love a book that elicits a belly laugh.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Enough for several CPUs.  Easy to use.  Great thermal conductivity.  This is the gold standard in thermal compounds for CPU heatsinks.
0811879542|5.0|And honestly the cause and effect of the dots is a great little teaching tool snuck in under lots of fun. I was reading it with a 6 month old and a three year old for the fifth time.  They both enjoy taking the actions the books requested.  For example one page tells them to press the yellow dot and the next page has three dots appear.  The pages are nicely coated so I anticipate this being passed down for years and years.  This beats video games and I can be in on the fun.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Great to see John Rebus and supporting cast back in action.  Enjoyed the story but thought there might have been a bit more made of the interaction between Rebus and Malcom Fox, maybe next time !
B004LQI0HE|4.0|Carey Mulligan has delivered the most lyrical performance that I have seen on the screen for some time.  She has the difficult job of interpreting the role of a woman judged by society to be sub-normal by means of her birth.  Yet she bears her life with dignity and a sense of the very humanity denied her by the ones who created her.  I did not find this movie to be bleak.  Rather I feel it gives a view of grace under an great evil that is never explicitly portrayed.  I would recommend a viewing most highly.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|pinch and zoom works fine on my kindle fire. very good game if u like hidden object and puzzle games. would pay but glad it free.......free the bees
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp's acting...he is incredibly gifted...<br />I was reluctant to order this movie because I wasn't that impressed when I saw it at the theatre, but I'm glad I ordered it.<br />It's actually a great new twist on all the vampire movies and the story line is excellent, as well as the quality of the graphics and overall acting...I laugh everytime I watch and that's why I wanted it in my library.
B005RAO0GS|3.0|This album left something to desire, but there were a few really great tracks like &#34;Shake it Out&#34; and &#34;Seven Devils&#34;.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I think any tablet needs protection and for the Kindle, this case is perfect.  It's light-weight.  The price is right. It's easy to place the Kindle so it stands on its own, either horizontally or vertically.  The Kindle pops in and out easily, though I rarely have mine out of it.  I bought my daughter a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas and will insist she get a Marware Vibe case for her Kindle.  The only reason I didn't go ahead and get her one is because I wasn't sure which of the great colors she would like.
1400032717|5.0|Arrived in timely fashion and was in excellent shape - was recommended to me to read and I enjoyed it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I downloaded The lost city when it was free, and I loved it. (It wasn't too short, but I wouldn't of been dissapointed if it had been longer.) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor, and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city, I bought it for $0.99. I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.<br />So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)<br /> If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!
B009E3EY38|5.0|It gets no better than this.  Worth every dime.  I gave my sound system a work out with this BD.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you played The Secret of Grisly Manor and liked it, you will love The Lost City! It is longer than Grisly Manor, and it has a hint guide in case you can't figure out a puzzle. It is a good length, but I loved it so much I was sad to see it end. Can't wait to see if there will be more games like this. Loved it!!
B001NEK2GE|2.0|First off, yes there is a learning curve, but anyone can get around that eventually.  What I can't get around is the fact that this thing doesn't lie flat on the desk.  The plastics on the base are warped enough that it rocks back and forth while I'm using it.<br /><br />Also, I found that the key-stroke on this requires more force and has a longer throw than my MS Sidewinder keyboard.  So the G13 actually reduced my performance.<br /><br />I would also like to see 1 more row of keys across the top.  With Far Cry 3, I found myself running out of keys to define - or at least keep them in groupings that make sense.<br /><br />Being able to actually label the keys (I would pay $120 for this thing if each key was a customizable LCD).  The current LCD screen doesn't do much for me either.  I found myself not wanting to ever look down to see whatever the LCD screen says.  So get rid of that, and make the keys customizable.  Yeah, I know its a big stretch.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I was introduced to Lindsey Stirling via youtube and after listening there was no question i needed this CD.  It a constant in my truck for the daily drive to work.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is not all about kinky sex!! It is about how two people evolve into loving adults who respect each other's strengths and weaknesses.  So be prepared to read deeper into the words.
B000LXH0AY|3.0|i bought this for a friend and have no idea what it's about. i think it's like a musical, sort of like &#34;stomp&#34;, which i haven't seen either.<br /><br />hope this review helps

0307592731|5.0|Following her mother's death, the break up of her marriage, and some clear indications that her life was falling apart, Cheryl Strayed made the decision at the age of twenty six to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone in an effort to find herself again.  While outdoorsy, Cheryl lacked any previous experience backpacking and quickly found out that the trail would challenge her more than she ever thought possible.  She also finds out that the trail will bring rewards both mentally and physically that would far outweigh the hardships.<br /><br />I wish I could give ten stars to this book.  It is a brave memoir, as Cheryl holds nothing back, including shameful experiences with drugs, heartbreaking final moments with her mother, and feelings of inadequacy compared to the more prepared and experienced hikers she encounters.  It is truthful in that sometimes she feels like giving up, or wondering what the whole point of the experience is at her low moments.  She also experiences magical moments that she wouldn't have with a large group such as coming across a beautiful red fox on the trail or feeling simultaneously vulnerable and secure alone in her tent at night.  The glimpses she shares of her life pre Pacific Crest Trail are carefully chosen, and I feel like every story she shared had some meaning to the path of her life and the woman she became.  Highly recommended for women, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone who needs some inspiration in their own life.
B0067TQQI8|2.0|Charges the 2100mah capacity battery in the LG Nexus 4 at most twice before dieing.  I fully charged the Anker and charged the Nexus 4 useing the 2amp charge port. Phone was left on but unused while charging.  Charge 1 was from 29% to 100%.  Charge 2 was about the same and charge 3 was from 35% to 45% at which point the Anker died.  The approximate 3400mah I got out of it is less than 50% of the sticker capacity of 8400mah.  This very poor performance is either mislabeling of capacity, use of cheap lipo cells, or a defective unit(not likely).  This is going back to Amazon.<br /><br />I am increasing rating from one to two stars because the company has contacted me by responding to this review on Amazon.com, emailing me twice and calling me twice to see what can be done to correct the problem.  I returned the item.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I love the movie, but I bet some of the lincoln fans were pissed!! lol. I loved te charaterion of the Prez and family it was good to see that some of Abe was told with feeling.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|A wonderful heartfelt movie for everyone.  Saw this on the big screen but still great on your television.  Buy it now!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I bought this movie because I like the first two and was somewhat disappointed by this one. I think they could have put more sass for Will Smith it just made it seem like he was tired of the movie before it got good. It answered alot of questions about  the way the charater K is the way he is. I love any movie that has Tommy Lee Jones in it!!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|this game made my kindle sooooooo laggy and then killed my screen.I deleted it about a month ago and I still have lag from it!!!!!!!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|great movie at a great price hope to deal with again. woulg recommend this movie to everyone. great price too
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is can't miss television, the acting is great, just when you think it can't get anymore desperate for the main characters, this show throws something totally unexpected at you. AND Where is Carl?
B0093URN4E|5.0|converge never disapoints great album. I have been a fan since petitioning the empty sky, unlike most bands, converge just keep getting more and more brutal and amazing with every release...crushing feedback and amazing artwork I will always be excited for a new converge album these guys did, still and will always rule the hardcore world!
030759565X|4.0|I've tried just a few recipes, but plan to try many more.  Everything looks delicious in the great pictures, and Deb is truly enamored with cooking and creating special recipes.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I was expecting a much better movie.  Plot was weak and felt disconnected.  Characters could have been developed further.  Rent before you buy.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|This movie is the closest movie to real Marine Corp boot camp that I have ever seen for that era, and as for Gunny they could not have found a better actor for the part.His cadence was true to the Corp
B008NW67E0|4.0|I like their songs, and the lead singer's voice, but after a short while, all the songs sound the same...sweet, slow start, and a thumping drumming ending..bought two albums at once, which only reinforced the feeling that I was on a merry go round that got boring by the end of the ride.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|very fun game!  my daughter loves my little ponies.  she calls herself the mayor of ponyville.  I wish it didn't have as many rocks.
0375507256|5.0|Incredible. Intricate. Amazing (over-used word these days). Cloud Atlas will make you think. It is an intellectual novel -- a rare and beautiful thing these days. Novels for thinking, for small, quiet rooms and big comfortable chairs where the reader becomes immersed in the unfolding imagery and detail Mitchell spoons out in every word, every sentence. Take your reading of this novel at a slow and steady pace but prepare to be overwhelmed. I had to put this book down every few pages so that I could think about what was just read -- literary and profound -- rare gifts in the publishing world today.<br /><br />Haven't seen the movie. Might not want to but probably will watch it when it comes out on DVD because -- I want the images to be my own, I know what the characters and scenes look like and it might hurt my brain to watch how someone else imagines Mitchell's work to be viewed. I'm not seeing Tom Hanks as a character but ... let me finish Cloud Atlas (I'm 75% done) and then re-evaluate the movie idea.
B001CD3PLU|5.0|This movie is fantastic...comedy, suspense, cheering for the under dog, and thrilling ending...it has it all and it is good clean family entertainment.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Years and years after \\"Striptease\\", \\"Basic Instinct\\" and countless other strippers movies dedicated to men, us women FINALLY have A TASTEFUL STRIPPERS movie. Cause we're worth it!<br /><br />This became a classic for me as soon as I saw it. No, I wasn't looking for an intricate plot, etc. Just good old male dancing. And I got it! If the whole movie was just these hot guys dancing, I would still be happy.<br /><br />Get this ladies! Eye Candy and great fun for sure!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This deal seemed too good to be true, so I read a bunch of the reviews to make sure it wasn't a sham. It's not a sham! It's all eight of the movies, they're all in widescreen, they all play perfectly and there were no scenes missing, contrary to many of the negative reviews here. If you're looking for super fancy special features and stuff, you'll have to get the super fancy official HP stuff that costs hundreds of dollars. This collection is exactly what it says it is: all eight of the awesome flicks! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick read. Way better than the movie (& I liked the movie). Couldn't put it down. On to book two.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|This movie is a wonderful kid's show!  It is really cute.  The minions are adorable!  This one definitely gets played on a regular basis!  Well worth the money!  Recommended for anyone with little kids.
B007V65R54|3.0|Author apologizes at the beginning that the book is too long and he's right, the book is too long.  He's a good writer with many excellent points that he makes easily - then drags out.  I'm having trouble finishing the whole book because it's just too slow. The title alone gives you 50% of the message.
0545265355|5.0|Great buy. The price was the best I seen around..awesome books..had great service. Really liked the books. I had been shopping around for the set and this was he best price I found.
0385737955|5.0|I ordered it because I was looking for something to read. It was amazing and action packed. I loved that I got it at a cheap price also.
B0064W65SO|5.0|This is truly a work of art and creativity. I was hooked and it left me wanting more yet, still satisfied. Part of Batman Begins is based off of this. So if you love Christopher Nolan 's Batman then you will love this. This focuses more on Gotham.
B009369Z8A|4.0|Great Movie Showing The Times Of The Illegal Activity Of  Alcohol Making And Distribution Methods That Where Available Back Then.
B009POHHRG|5.0|So I was reading this book and it was great. Mind you I am in my week of finals and instead of studying for my tests, I found myself deep in this work of art. Once again Alan delivers. Please pick this book up. It's one of the best period.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is fun and awesome with scratch but I cant just go home I have to turn it off don't down load
B004U52VPS|4.0|This is a cute game to play. It can be difficult to set up some of the diagrams because the pieces are really lightweight. Definitely play on a hard, flat surface.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I Think no one should get this if u hate being bored in your life, It's Kinda ok in 2days
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game I had even found herobrian on the world sead herobrian though I cant kill him and I found him in a cave
0316069434|4.0|Having read the entire series, I'm dedicated to Harry's career so will follow him as long as he works!  This is another engrossing mystery in the open-unsolved unit which Harry diligently follows right to the rather tense ending.  What always amazes me the attention to detail and the logical procedure to the next step in the case.  Connelly does an excellent job in keeping things in place as they should be.  Another nice read.
0761163808|2.0|The photographs are terribly blurred.  I know the concept is to show the animals in movement, which is a great idea.  However, they are (possibly not the photo of the gorilla) extremely difficult to see because they are so indistinct.  A child would have a hard time discerning the individual animals.  I am going to return the book.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Would not let me change the location to where I live. Default was LA and I live in Dallas! I have a free weather app that works better!
B00382S9TQ|4.0|I was disappointed that this season was so short.  They could've at least added onto the season after Sarah Jessica Parker had her baby.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I love how this movie brings back the politically incorrect humor (ethnic jokes, enhanced interrogation tactics) and the theme of our technology being from aliens that made the original movie so great. I also like how the moon landing is portrayed as a purely human achievement, especially with all the conspiracy theories out there. The last 2 movies dealt with cases from K's past. Maybe the next movie can explore a case from J's past, during the 5 years when K was out and L was in.
0395389496|5.0|Christmas is definitely a wonderful holiday in our lives. We decorate our homes with colorful lights, bushy wreaths, and set up our beautiful Christmas trees. Snow covers our yard in a large soft blanket. But to me, it's a time that we spend with the ones we love and to be thankful of what we have. It's also a great time to read one of the most unforgettable stories about the holiday season, as well as believing in what we love.<br /><br />The story occurs on Christmas Eve when a boy who wonders about the existence of Santa Claus is woken up. He goes outside his house and sees a large majestic train called The Polar Express in front of him and goes in for the ride of a lifetime. The boy and other children on the train enjoy their trip with piping hot chocolate, delicious candies and singing carols to keep them warm. The train takes them all over mountains, through a forest, and finally to their destination: The North Pole. The children come to the center of the place and see someone very special right before their eyes.<br /><br />Allsburg has brought us something more than a masterpiece: a true Christmas classic. Everything in this book is practically flawless and irresistible. The story is true to it's word and it helps show that nobody is too old to believe in Santa Claus. All the art is just dazzling and beautiful as a Christmas tree. Reading the book as a child, it has been so unforgettable and deserves to be read over and over during the holiday season. No matter how old you are, \\"The Polar Express\\" will warm your heart with a story to help you believe (A).
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Enjoying season five as much as the previous four. This series is a good representation of the late 50's and 60's Madison Avenue as represented on TV.
B0053O89WY|5.0|i bought this movie for my mom for the holidays its her favoriate show so i know she will like it
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has everything you could want: great story; interesting characters; mystery; wonder; romance; action; scenery; heroism; humor, settings, and so much more!  This is movie magic!<br />You will see how all the elements people love in great movies like the Star Wars films, originated with Burroughs and books like his Mars series.<br />This is such a well made movie. The actors are perfect in their roles. Special effects are phenomenal! just everything works here, and I recommend it!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good read, continuation of Eva and Gideon! Easy read, good story plot! Some steamy sex scenes. All around great book. If you liked fifty shade of grey you will love  the story line of  Eva and  Gideon
B00AN0K5KW|1.0|Don't do it!  I was not paying attention and thought that this was the 1st episode and what I got was 7 minutes of \\"what I loved the most about this set was...\\". This is not worth 2 bucks. You'd be better off buying a cup of coffee for your coworker or something like that.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is not your average band. Anyone who listens to tool quickly goes to lateralus saying it is their best album. Lateralus is an increible album but aenima has so much more meaning to it and aenima is also the album where they started to explore their sonic template. This album also has many themes to it as well that make it an incredibly well thought out album. Songs such as eulogy and pushit are songs that show tool's more aggresive side but then you have songs like stinkfist that ate about compasion and third eye, a song about drug abuse. This album really made tool shine, to say the least it is an absolutly amazing album that i would recomend to anyone
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book of the series is my favorite! Would definitely recommend this book it's a very easy book to read.
B0023SDQB2|2.0|I really expected to enjoy this but I found it heavy going. Of course the subject is tough but I usually enjoy historical novels, particularly when you discover more about the consequences of major events on people. I found the book difficult to keep up with and I didn't gain any attachment to the characters. Whilst I did gain some knowledge on psychology, I was disappointed by the apparent conclusion of the book, but maybe I missed something.  This, of course may say more about me than the book.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|While I very much enjoyed the world and characters in this book, the telling doesn't seem as balanced as Sanderson's other work. Despite this, I am eagerly awaiting the second book in the series.
