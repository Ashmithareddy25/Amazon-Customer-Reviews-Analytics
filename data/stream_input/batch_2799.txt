B003O86FMW|5.0|It's soo hard to put it down. SOOOOOO HARD!!! From reading other reviews I didn't expect much. However, it was very good from beginning to end. Surprise twist at the end of the games... if you want to call it an end. CAN'T WAIT TO READ MOCKINGJAY
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Found this book on the internet.  If ordered from the sponsor sight it was very expensive.  When you see these types of offers from TV or Internet offers, go to Amazon.  Chances are you can find the same item at a better price and fewer attachments.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This is the best hard rock album I have listened to in a long time.  End-to-end, track-to-track, it just keeps up the quality.  There is only one slow song in the bunch, Gone Cold, which personally is my least favorite track.  But the true Clutch fans seem to love it...  I haven't listened to anything from Clutch since the 90's, and I am glad that Neil Fallon went on That Metal Show and discussed this album.  I wouldn't have picked it up (or probably even heard of it) otherwise.<br /><br />The Face is my favorite track, but Earth Rocker, Crucial Velocity, Mr. Freedom, Book, Saddle & Go, and Cyborg Bette are all just as good.  The bass line in Oh, Isabella sounds like something Steve Harris wrote, and the song itself would fit in with an Iron Maiden album.<br /><br />Overall, for a hard rock album, you can't go wrong here.  Listen to the samples of Earth Rocker and The Face, and if you like those, you'll like everything in between.  It's the best $10 I've spent on music lately, thank you Clutch!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I just got done listening to this great album for the 4th time and it gets better after every listen.  I have been a Jason Newsted fan since his beginning in Metallica in 1986 and I'm very happy that he is back to what he does best, play thundering heavy metal music. I can't wait to see them live. If you love heavy metal, then get this album right away. this album has everything you want in a metal album. I will say it again, thank you Newsted you have been away for too long, we are all glad you are back to crush our skulls with your metal.
0374214913|5.0|Absolutely delightful from start to finish, this novel not only captures the wonderful serendipity of brilliant young minds unfettered by the fogies among us but also the sweet open-mindedness of their elderly mentors. Each is affectionately mocked along the way. I found it great fun. (I highly recommend the audiobook; a sensational narrator adds a whole new dimension to the story.)
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was looking forward to this film, but it was nothing special.  Read the review by Richard Roeper at [...]  I agree with his review almost sntirely.
0307271080|5.0|I've read a number of books about the black experience in America; two I'd recommend are [[ASIN:0679763880 The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration]] and  [[ASIN:1400052181 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]. But neither of these, or anything else I've read, come close to this novel by Adichie. First of all it's about Nigeria, a huge country I'd guess most Americans don't know much about--I certainly didn't. It's the story of Ifemalu, a Nigerian woman who comes to the US as a student and by a stroke of luck--having a rich, white boyfriend--she gets working papers and can stay legally. Part of the story is about her relationship with Obinze, a Nigerian man she's known her whole life, and how a long separation born of geography, distance, and different life paths conspire to destroy their relationship. But the far more interesting story is about Ifemalu's blog, which she begins to write almost idly but which takes off in a big way. A great deal of the book is devoted to her blogs on the experiences of a Non-American black in an America that's supposedly post-racist. It's the most hard hitting writing I've read in a long time. Some of it is funny--her commentary on the distinctions based on skin shades that exist among blacks and whites, and on Obama--\\"Why Dark-Skinned . . .Black Women Love Barack Obama. . .[because he knows] that dark black women totally rock.\\" On the other hand, no white person can read \\"What Academics Mean by White Privilege\\" without squirming. Ifemalu is a black woman who discovers race only when she comes to America. A fascinating read.

1442359919|5.0|I listened to Joyland as an unabridged audio. I love carny tales and this one was a fantastic blend of carny life, murder mystery and coming of age tale all wrapped up with the quirky dialogue and turn of phrase that only Stephen King can deliver.<br /><br />Set back in the 1970's, Devin is a college student who accepts summer work at a struggling independent amusement park called Joyland. Joyland's goal is to spread happiness and joy to children big and small with their doggie mascot, carny games/rides and junk food. This is a park I would LOVE if it really existed because the owner keeps it going out of love not profit. Anyway, during Devin's summer long run, he makes friends, meets some colorful characters, struggles to solve a decade old murder, perhaps sees a ghost and even saves a life or two all while nursing a broken heart.  I am saying no more about the plot.<br /><br />I loved this book. It's full of life, love, interesting characters and has so much heart. Devin reminded me of Koontz's Odd Thomas character in so many ways. He's sensitive and kind and just a very special character that I won't soon forget. I'll remember him not for his extraordinary acts (and there are a few) but for his sensitive and sweet nature. He's just a lovely person, a real sweetheart of a character, and one that you don't run across often enough in fiction. Be warned though this book will make you cry. But don't let that put you off. Please don't let that put you off. It's a five star read and a book I didn't want to see come to an end. It's only a little scary and I really think all of you should read it or listen to the audiobook which is narrated beautifully by Michael Kelly. He imbues Devin with wide eyed optimism, heartbroken emotion and pure joy with just a slight change in his tone. His voice is youthful and fits the character to perfection. He does well with the supporting characters too. He was fantastic and brought the book, the sights and the events to life. For once in my reading life, I couldn't ask for anything more!my reading life, I couldn't ask for anything more!
1781162646|5.0|This ins not your regular Stephen King horror novel. This is great story about life at an old-style amusement park. Definitely worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get it  if you love the movies you Will love the game go a had and get it you know you won't too
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has a few options. It plays closer to what you might play with real cards. A great deal at twice the price!

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I positively love Hosseini's books -- but not this one.  It kept changing time, place, character, and ended up in a far different era than it began.  Maybe it was the amount of characters he tried to handle in the book.  By the end, I was starting to get connections, but every time he made a shift, it was difficult to follow.  I'll probably try to reread it, thinking it was just me, but not for a good, long time.
B004X75RK4|5.0|If you're interested pure fun entertainment, this film fit's the bill.  I'm a big fan of both Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock, so I may be biased, but I thought this movie was great.  It's just pure fun. Definitely not for someone seeking enlightenment, or a social consciousness, thought provoking experience.<br />The scenery is beautiful, as well are both the main characters.  The story was cute and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
1853261580|5.0|I read this book for the first time right after I graduated college, and it was exactly what I needed then. I read it again whenever I need to be filled up with life.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|the acting could have been better but overall not bad not that good.. 7 more words required..3 more words required
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|The first act in this movie - the training sequence - is just fabulous.  Rest is just good.  Seen it several times and still worth watching
B002OMZTSU|5.0|This was a great read.  Craig Ferguson takes the reader on an insightful and well thought out journey through his life.  I think this book offers up his experiences in a way that allows the reader to, both, identify with him and get a new perspective on things they may not have experienced personally.  Very glad I took the time to read this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun and addicting. I love it. And the best part is u can make money. I have a lot of people in my game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is such a fun and great for anyone of all ages. i enjoy this game as does both my kids
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very simple to use, works great as a back up at home or even better when traveling.  I would remommend this.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|although the story line is a bit different that the book I did enjoy the movie.  I would watch it again.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Like how you can dim the screens brightness level with the slide of the finger. Love the neat theme options also.
B000256TD0|4.0|Thanks, it came in as it was expected. My son is very happy about it and started to play right the way.
0812984412|5.0|This is a great literary achievement. I won't repeat the structure of the book or the plots, since those have been covered well by other reviewers. Rather, I want to emphasize the enormous scope of the novel. This is a book that explores the entirety of human nature: people's virtues, their vices, their hopes and dreams, and their fears. Many fine novels do the same, but very few with the audacity to span hundreds of years of past and future history. Moreover, Mitchell's ability to speak with an entirely different voice for each character is truly amazing. You may or may not agree with his musings about the future of the human race, but if you appreciate fine writing, you will enjoy the voyage that the author takes you on. This is one of the very few books I've read in recent years in which I was sorry to reach the end. I look forward to re-reading it at some future date. (P.S. I haven't seen the movie, but reading the reviews and noting the casting, I advise potential readers NOT to see the film before tackling the book. Apart from my opinion regarding miscasting of many key characters, this book cannot possibly be portrayed adequately in a single film, even one that runs nearly 3 hours. No less than a substantial mini-series would be needed to attempt to do justice to the book.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I get sucked into every episode, its so awesome! I cannot wait for season 4 this up coming January :)
B0026HKO2E|5.0|The matrix? how could you ever go wrong here? the best series hands down ever created in my opinion. period.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Frankly is a quite boring movie. Story was something already seen. There is this twist in the middle but...nothing special really.
B003P9VZ0W|2.0|The Product Details listed &#34;Includes 40 wall decals with 47 peel-and-stick gems&#34;.<br />Our package came with 37 Decals (even said it on the outside of the package) and 42 Gems.<br /><br />I wouldn't be so picky about this pack of decals, if I hadn't already purchased and compared them to the Tinkerbell Decals (at a store other than Amazon). We were very happy with those decals and expected the same quality.<br /><br />We encountered the following problems with the Princess Decals:<br /><br />1. Many of the decals were not completely cut. We had to use scissors more often than we should have to release the product from the sheet. Because of this, several decals were then torn.<br /><br />2. The thickness of the decals was not consistent. The walls we placed them on were blue. A good example of this problem is the princess' faces. Their faces are shades of flesh color AND blue. Even some of the dresses fluctuate between blue then the actual color of the dress.<br /><br />3.Lastly...when we opened the decals there was an overwhelming cheap shower curtain smell that has now permeated the room.<br />Hopefully this will not last.<br /><br />I would not purchase these again. I have learned that I cannot return them as the problems we faced caused the item to be in non returnable condition. I will leave them for a bit, then replace them with a product of better quality.
B005OK721G|3.0|This movie was okay. I was looking for more action and story line was a bit slow. Will not recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great app! I downloaded it for my daughter and she loves it. even better that it is free!
B005HT400A|5.0|One of the best movies made, if not the best. The special features on this blu-ray are great to look at, too!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|If you love to play UNO, this game app is the one to get. I gave it 4 stars because I don't like that the games aren't unlimited. You have to earn tokens :/. Fun to play otherwise. I would recommend it.

B009AHWLHE|5.0|Even if you don't know the characters that well, the action scenes are fun to watch. I highly suggest this especially over the Live action ones which are average at best.

1590171993|5.0|STONER is an outstanding novel.  It is a wonderful &#34;read,&#34; but not slick or in vogue.  It is straightforward and honest.  It tells the truth about a real human being and about academe.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game, easy to personalize and fun to play. The ads are a little annoying but the game was free, so I expected them. I would still highly recommend the game to anyone that needs a fun waste of time.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book was refreshing because it did not mention the standard number & letter hair typing system. Hair type was identified by words instead. the individuals who shared their story in the book consisted of people from many backgrounds. Being able to watch short videos on the enhanced Ebook made it easy to bookmark sections applicable to my needs.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A very nice and addictive game. Very beautiful illustrations. Once you start playing you won't be able to stop. A must have.
B000002LFZ|5.0|can listen to this for hours, great collection and I have, great cd for driving all day.will buy another 1 when I wear this one out.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Best book I have ever read. It has a perfect story and it also brings the story to life. Can't wait for a movie to be made out of this book.
B007LEC7CC|4.0|This was a pretty good cd.  Some of the songs better then others.  I kind of wish she would just do something she wants to other then it seems she is trying to play catch up with the kids of today and most of them are so not worth catching up to.
0786838655|5.0|Great twist on Mythical stories!  I can't wait till I read the next volume and see the next movie too.  The Lightning Thief movie was great too!
0375758992|5.0|In this vivid memoir, Alexandra Fuller describes the joys and perils of growing up in southern Africa, moving in her first 25 years from Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) to Malawi and finally Zambia. Her parents are the main protagonists of the book, especially her mother, whose journey into manic depression is documented with the greatest sensitivity. Worth reading for the glimpse it gives into the White Man's Burden mindset of colonialists, as well as the humanity of ordinary black Africans and the vicious kleptocracies that sprang up after the whites turned over power, repressing people both black and white, who struggle to survive and thrive in of the most physically challlenging enviroments on the planet. A work of beauty.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is exactly what I ordered and it works well.  I needed a longer charging cable for my Kindle that was USB at both ends..
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|This was a pretty creative story, in my opinion. A little different from the other movies in this genre and this one kept me wondering what was going on all the until the end.<br />Very well done.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. You can literally create almost ANYTHING on your mind!.... but.... you have to pay 99&cent; to play the game. I think that's fine when you first get it but you have to do it a SECOND time? Personally, I think they just want your money, but don't forget! At least it's fun.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The horrific child cruelty was overdone.  The author could've gotten the point across without the unrelenting retelling of the protagonist's time in the orphanage.  The discovery of his sister was a bit of a weak plot point.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|If you loved the Myst games, The Room will be a satisfying diversion.  The puzzles are challenging, but you'll find they get repetitive after a while.  Would like to see a deeper story in future games, and more variety in both the puzzles and the surrounding world.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game that gets more intricate as you advance along the journey. Some of the wins are very hard because of being timed. The tricks are learned along the way. Some seem unsolvable but as you learn how to use the extra helps, you have to use certain ones repeatedly and work very fast just matching tiles to get the helps to break the ice. Have fun!!!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I am a Jesse Stone series lover, and since I now have all of the series, I watch them all.
0770437400|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's an alternate future novel told through interviews of survivors of the zombie war.  I loved that it has such a global perspective it includes stories from Europe, Africa, Central America, Asia, and space.  I also really like the subjects explored.  It goes over military battles, politics, religion, familial relationships, and the effects of everyone's psyche.  The main problem with the book, as other reviewers have noted, is that all of the characters speak with the same tone even though they have different ages, cultures, races, mental conditions, and moral outlooks.  This is the biggest problem with the novel but I still recommend the book to anyone who likes alternate history and non-fiction.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this for my son for christmas and loves the movie. My two nieces loves this movie also too.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|This book defies classification. It doesn't fit into any particular genre, but has bits from any number of them; mythology plays a strong role, and there are supernatural, sci-fi, and historical  elements. It is definitely one of the stranger stories I have read, but being strange works well here. I've heard others rave about the writing of Neil Gaiman so I decided to check him out, and I wasn't disappointed. Whatever genres you may be a fan of, they have probably been represented here, so really, there's something for everyone. Good investment.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I bought this movie for my son christmas gift and he loves it. He watches this movie when his friends come over and he breaks this movie out and have fun with his friends..
1936850028|5.0|Having read Walter Rhein's fantasy novel The Bone Sword, I was more than willing to give his non-fiction book a go. I have to admit that I know very little about cross-country skiing, but Beyond Birkie Fever gave me a wonderful insight into what these athletes have to go through to prepare for such an exacting race. I enjoyed the way the author took me right back to his earliest experiences with skiing, as this set the tone very nicely for what clearly became an obsession. His easy, witty prose and highly amusing anecdotes had me laughing and gasping in turns as I learned what tolls the `Birkie' takes on the novice (and even the professional!) skier. I am full of admiration for Walter Rhein and indeed anyone who has the determination and dedication to achieve the levels of fitness necessary to be competitive in events such as the Birkie. It is testament to Rhein's talent as a writer that a non-skier like myself was able to experience something of the `Fever' that the Birkie instils in those who come back year after year, trying to improve their times and move into the `elite wave'.<br /><br />Both skiers and non-skiers alike will gain something from this fascinating book, which I can highly recommend.

1616614609|5.0|I loved playing Netrunner when it was first released in the '90s and this edition re-captured my love of the game perfectly.<br /><br />It fleshed out the corporations and runners nicely with factions that had some small variants in playstyle (focusing on different elements of the game). It also made for much clearer and simpler rules (without dumbing it down), enough so that my gamer-light wife was able to pick it up and enjoy it on her first try.

As they give one of the beat performances in this high action thriller that will lead you on one of the most intense underwater adventures of the decade you will be holding your breath and gasping as they race to stay alive and try to get the money to get new equipment for their non stop underwater treasure hunt that will make a great movie for your collection

B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Fate and fame are tricky, fickle, and often ironic--but rarely does a story so perfectly illustrate it as well as this one. For nearly 30 years, a man lives a humble working man's life, having made his peace with the fame that eluded him, only to then discover that he is famous--in fact, adored--in another corner of the world. The film is an eloquent labor of love, and the reward is the sense of justice--that the good are rewarded--one feels when viewing Searching for Sugar Man. It is a film that deserves the Best Documentary Oscar it was awarded, and everyone should see it, without reservations.

B0054SMID0|5.0|What I thought would end one way ended another!  Matthew McConaughey was perfect for this part.  He made you dislike him as a sleazy lawyer and then began to show what made him tick and how wrong some first impressions can be.<br /><br />You'll love the ending!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Loved this movie!  I meant to watch it on the big screen and never got around to it, I wish I had as this movie was so visually amazing!  This movie kept me wondering what was going to happen next and threw me off on how it would end.  Even though I've streamed this movie, Im defintely going to own it as a bluray!  Best Sci-fi in 2013 next to Pacific Rim.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|Incredible. The videography is so beautiful, I almost think I could contentedly watch this show on mute. But the flawless acting and soundtrack are not to be outdone.<br /><br />This is certainly not a light-hearted mystery show. And some of us may need a tissue box at the ready (I did). I have been a huge Mentalist follower, but I believe Broadchurch will take its place when I am up for heavier material.
0937381888|5.0|I bought this for my fiance who wants to start home brewing.  He was totally sucked in from the beginning.  He said it will be a good resource for his new hobby and that he will be able to refer back to it during the whole process.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, it's a fun & unique movie! Good moderate action, solid story line, with sweet computer graphics making the film the whole family will love! Only one scene with questionable visuals, but nothing any worse you'll see on regular TV these days! It kinda reminded me of Classic Star Trek with great intelligent story & characters to add if you are a fan of the film genre
030758836X|2.0|I'm giving this book two stars because the story line and how it was written was actually entertaining.  However, the ending was as if someone else had written it.  I am still pissed off at the ending.  I have never been \\"pissed\\" at an ending...disappointed, yes.  I wanted to throw the book in the garage, but unfortnately it was on my kindle.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your valuable time.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, it's a fun & unique film! Moderate action, great computer graphics, very solid story line, hard to guess or see the ending!

B003ZMF26W|5.0|Replaced a 5 year old Logitech gaming palmer with this. I haven't used many newer gaming mice, but I fell in love with this one immediately. Its fast and crazy responsive. Large slide pads on the bottom lead to believe they won't wear out. 3  thumb buttons that fit very intelligently, making it easy to press each one without hitting the others while requiring only muscle flexes. Scroll wheel is thick and slides nice, but its a scroll wheel whatever. There are huge adjustment options on the fly, allowing for 4 profiles with a button click, and two buttons to control dpi sensitivity. These buttons are well placed, out of the way, but accessible. The software allows major customization for profiles and sensitivity. Rapid fire works for most games if correctly configured. The thumb buttons are the only ones designed specifically to be used for your purposes, but rapid fire and symmetrical button can be reconfigured if you want. GREAT MOUSE!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for sitting in school when you're watching a movie or something and is also good for seminaryhaha
B0097JYVAU|5.0|Get this book whether your are interested in this subject or not cause it has a broader message - believe it or not
0786838655|5.0|This book was awesome! When I was younger, I loved Percy and the gang instantly, and this series was one of the first I was really interested in. It's fast-paced with plenty of battle scenes and quick-thinking/problem solving, and its a good pick for a younger kid or a reluctant reader: I was both when I picked up this book, and now I'm neither and I still love it. Older teens may have trouble connecting with the characters at first, since they do start out pretty young. But they grow over time, and its definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />Also, I've never found the Harry Potter resemblance to be as strong as most people say: any book I read, I could link a thousand things to other books or even movies if I tried hard enough. Bits of Harry Potter do take after mythology, and you have to remember: its not like the Ancient Greeks are still cranking out those authentic myths every day. There are only so many to go by, so subtle similarities are inevitable, but its not like Percy and Harry are twins.<br /><br />And others say The Lightning Thief is too simple, or too silly: the age range IS for younger kids. As I'm now one of those awkward older PJATO fandom-goes, I can spot the randomness of somethings, like monster attacks that aren't necessary to the plot, but still fun to read. You definitely need to be well versed in suspension of disbelief if you are an older reader.<br /><br />All in all, this book and its many companions are most definitely worth the read. If you buy the first one, go ahead and buy the second one: you won't want to wait a second for the story to continue.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Perfect movie for everyone to watch on Friday night. Get the kids exposed to good music, get mom and dad remembering a different time and grandma and grandpa will find this hilarious.
B009IAGU3O|5.0|Amy Adams is adorable.  Meryl Streep turns in a performance worthy of - Meryl Streep - and the story is masterfully woven between the two worlds.  I laughed.  I cried.  I burped.
0765365278|5.0|This guy is the real deal.  I loved this book and I am excited about his planned series.  I have high hopes that even though he plans 10 books that he is doing this so that he can tell the story he wants to, not just plod along with fancy titles and artwork.  The story had a lot of original concepts to make it interesting and I just kept turning the pages.  I just kept reading to find out what would happen next.  That is what good authors do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Every one, run, run, run! Subway Surfers is about how fast you go, how far you get, and how much fun you can have! Very few weeks play in a different city! Kids never stop playing!!
B0045INOCO|5.0|I would highly suggest a reading of Joseph Konrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" as well as some of the critical analysis of said work and then watching this. I saw it years ago before I ever read the aforementioned work and it made little sense. After a literature class where \\"heart of Darkness\\" was discussed this movie makes so much more sense. The \\"villain\\" even has the same last name and much of the storyline lines up.<br /><br />This movie is essentially about the evil in all of us, which is one thing among many Konrad was trying to illustrate.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I put off reading this book thinking it was just too popular to be worth the time. Figured  the accolades and publicity was an over-hyped marketing ploy. Boy was I wrong. I read this in a day, unable and unwilling to put it down for any reasonable activity, like showering or walking the dogs. An amazing story with people you wish you knew and could spend time with tomorrow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my family's favorite shows on TV today.  It has great writing and wonderful acting.  Each of the three season has been filled with the drama of a 1900's upper class english family and their staff.  Jullian Fellows is a great visionary and we can't wait to see what he has in store in season 4.
B004UID2LC|4.0|ive heard about other people having trouble with this app and having ads pop up at random times. not with me. I do like it a lot
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Amazing that we are still talking about it<br />We started warning the world 20 years ago<br />and ten years ago the presidents of some leading countries of the Western world were still questioning its veracity??<br />Shame on our civilization!<br />We need more productions like this<br />Why have we not had &#34;Home..Revisited??&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is fun to play,  and hard to put down. great way to pass time by. totally worth free.  thanks
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The revelation of the historical Jesus of Nazareth as opposed the Christological version, as he calls it, is not new,<br />However Aslan has made it very readable and flowing, at least in the first half of the book<br />The end of the book becomes a scholar's paradise, as opposed to a layman's pleasure<br />But a very good book, informative and amazingly well balanced<br />I wonder how many eyebrows are raised at some of its sections though
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I enjoy all the Star Trek shows and movies, yes, I'm a Trekkee.  This movie is action packed and is full of humor.  FUN!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is easily among my top-10 authors.  I have rarely read prose that was so evocative.  I felt like I was physically present in Kabul and the various villages that were depicted in his story. Frankly, I enjoyed this book Every Bit, as Much if NOT More, than the Kite Runner. The twists and turns were flawless as he spun his tale of rich vs. poor set against a backdrop of the horrible political turmoil and corrupt governments that the citizens of Afghanistan have endured through the years...NMK
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a good read.  I really liked all the characters who all had their own weakness and strengths which were very real and possible in today's world. The story just blended everybody together so nice.  And might I add what a story it was...
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Never heard of this group, until I had watched them on TV.  This group rocks and had to have this CD. Love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This thrilling book was a awesome. It had adventure in it.  . My favorite part was the battles part!the worst part is there is no bad parts in this amazing book
B005BOHYW2|4.0|An interesting read but at times I felt that the main character was a bit to self pitying but worth a read.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Nice set!  Glad I waited instead of buying them individually.  Indy fans will love this set!  Harrison Ford at his best!
B0091WNK8M|3.0|Entertained 7 year olds and their parents, who remembered it from their childhood. Special effects were not bad for the time.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This app keeps you busy and really works its a great workout and fun to do! There is nothing wrong with this app and I definitely recommend it. Try it for free before you get!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of the better shows on air. If you enjoy White Collar, Bones, Castle, Burn Notice, and most any good procedural, you'll get hooked on Suits.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator app! There is one thing that I wish it did on my tablet...it will not screen rotate. Other than that.....excellent!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Everyone needs dreams. This story reminds me, through the eye's of children how to dream again and hope. It also reminds me that life can be short an how precious it is to enjoy every minute with loved ones.  The children show how important friends are no matter where you come from we are all entitled to be loved.  I would like to read this story to my grandchildren. This book is a wonderful gift.

B0051XI9FO|5.0|This is a great toy. I loved it. It was just what I and my kids expected! They play hours with the whole collection.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game it keep me entertain when I have free time. I like to play in my tab. Not only me like this game my nice is addictive too.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Constantly asks you to upgrade... then stopped working all together! Alarms wouldnt go off , even though they were set with full volume. Worthless... would have deleted a long time ago if there wasnt such slim pickings for alarm clocks on here. Amazon should have included alarm clocks with the fire hd.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|they game looks awesome and my soon was very excited to play it however items kept freezing during loading and wouldn't load past they loading screen with the  loading bar. tried uninstalling itseveral times and reinstalling  and it did they same thing every time. very disappointed and frustrated. looks like it would be a lot of fun.wish it would load .
B009RH973I|5.0|I wanted something lightweight for my wife's new Kindle Fire HD. This folio did the trick. It is lightweight, and doesn't add a lot of thickness to the very slim Kindle HD.  Not the ultimate in protection but does a great job for a little money.  Would definitely buy again.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Gives the child lots of opportunity to develop their creative side to dress up the dolls.  The variety of make up and dress is pretty good.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Love love love this. I read it on holiday and was taken to another time and place. Take it for what it is.... Easy, engrossing and vivid.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just downloaded solitaire.  had some trouble with the download, but once i got the application, i like it very much.
B002VISNLC|5.0|A timeless classic that I enjoyed 30 years on when reading it to my children. It's dark and witty and still refreshingly un-saccharine.
1451626657|5.0|I remember reading it yrs.ago--still just as funny today! Glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone now
B0064W65UM|1.0|When I bought it i thought it was a book. It's a comic and I feel really retarded for not knowing it was a comic. It's probably one of the best comics. Just my opinion.
1423141997|5.0|The book is extraordinary, the book and series gets better every time you read it. It is extraordinary how you Williams to read it again after you are done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was rather hesitant to pick up this series; however, I finally caved to see what all the fuss was about. After finishing this book, I must admit that I'm kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Yes, somethings within the book are a bit rushed but considering the content and premise, it fits perfectly. Yes, there's an ever present issue regarding love; however, it causes you to become incredibly attached to certain characters. The aforementioned issues are by far outweighed by how fantastic the book is. I feel as though this is a book that just about anyone could enjoy. Read it, you'll dig it.
140006922X|5.0|As a Christian (Presbyterian), I found it hard to put this book down.  Aslan is a great writer, who makes the information he presents very accessible to anyone of any background.  Aslan presents a great historical context to the Jesus of History.  I am inclined to believe that many of the negative reviews on Amazon about this book were posted by people who never read this book, or are so Islamophobic that they believe that nothing good could come from a Muslim.  Fundamentalists will also have problems with this book.  However, if you believe that the Bible is a book which was written primarily to communicate spiritual truths, and to connect us to that which we call \\"God,\\" and you are open to thinking about things differently and in new ways, this is a GREAT READ.  Spoiler alert for all those who think Aslan is trying to bash Christianity and Jesus the Christ.  The last sentence in the book before the acknowledgments and the notes:  \\"....the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth--Jesus the man--is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ.  He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Jesus--Christians and non-Christians.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love all of the inner workings of Downton Abbey. I love Mr. Bates and Anna. I feel like I should have been born during this time period. The show really gives you a feel about how both sides live.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I was leery about purchasing this book. Some of the reviews were unkind, stating that Piper Kerman never missed an opportunity to remind us that she was a Smith grad and middle class, unlike some of her fellow prisoners. I found these references not boastful, but necessary in the context of the story and her experience. I was touched by her accounts of her fellow prisoners and her sympathy for those who were not as fortunate to have such a privileged life to return to. Most of all, she includes a list of several resources at the end for those trying to transition to a productive life. If she were just writing this for profit or attention she would not have bothered.<br /><br />It was engaging, touching, at times funny and at others poignant. I loved this book.
B00867GKIK|5.0|this movie for the whole family, hope you see it.  It is a great movie to watch with or without kids.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|It really is a great story.  It's beautiful, compelling and good to the end.  Sure there are some silly flaws, but suspend your critical mind for a while and enjoy some good old fashioned sci-fi.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|It is what it is. No sappy ballads, just striaght forward rock-n-roll. Yeah, they remind of AC/DC, a bit, but who cares. There's no need to break it down and over think it. Music was made to enjoy, and this band makes it point. Just enjoy ot for what it is.
0525478817|5.0|And read this. You are seriously missing out. The way John Green writes grief makes Nicholas Sparks look like Stephenie Meyer.  It's heartbreaking and funny and is one of those stories that will stick with you and make it hard to start another book after you finish this one.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|It is what it is. No sappy ballads, just striaght forward rock-n-roll. Yeah, they remind of AC/DC, a bit, but who cares. There's no need to break it down and over think it. Music was made to enjoy, and this band makes it point. Just enjoy ot for what it is.
0142418471|1.0|Honestly, I would give this book zero stars if I could.<br /><br />I couldn't get past the fourth chapter. The language was absolutely disgusting and vulgar; I don't see how it could have gotten so many good reviews. I didn't see much of a plot, the dialogue was unrealistic, and I wasn't a huge fan of homosexuality being shoved down my throat. I had come into this book with the good reviews ringing in my ears; now I am leaving it with a sour taste in my mouth.
0802473156|5.0|This book was very interesting. A great read I highly recommend it.The price was very reasonable as well. Five stars
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|They require you to write a review too.  This is annoying.  Why couldn't they be happy with just a rating?  Rather than forcing people to come up with a banal essay about something which they most likely don't care.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this app! It is so fun and it is better than temple run one by far!!!!! It is absolutely amazing, everyone should get it. It is similar to subway surfers but one thing I like better about this is that you can get save me gems so after you die you can use them and keep playing. There are so many different people and lots of power ups. Also, when you collect coins it fills up a golden bar and when it is dull you can double tap and have a power up.  You can even upgrade so the coins are worth double and more. There are so many things. Don't listen to the bad reviews!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter loved this book and after seeing the movie I had to read this.<br />It was so well written well thought out. The idea the district's being our different geographical states one could easily into that and compare to our present governments treatment of certain states and populations.<br />Of course we fall big time for these characters!highly recommended!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job.  RECCOMEND this film for any James Lee Burke fan.  Wish Jones had done more of these.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Picked up this book after having it appear in my email and a seeing it on a couple different lists in the same week.<br /><br />Interesting read about how to keep creative and avoid the periods of time where creativity seems to be non-existent. Some of the tips are tried and true while others are new and worth a try.<br /><br />I would suggest this book to high school and college students looking at a major in an artistic career or someone in the job field that's in a rut.
B004IPPINW|5.0|I loved the movie, saw it when it came out (2012)<br />I loved the book, read it this summer (2013).<br />The stories have little to do with one another. Same protagonist, similar plot points, but the arc of the two stories<br />could not be more different. Yet, this is not a disappointment. The author tells his story, the directory told hers, and I have no complaints. Whatever order you choose, enjoy both versions of this title. This book delivers a powerful message. The movie<br />adds a level of emotion that enhances the thoughtful story found in the text. I could not look away from the movie screen, could not put this book down. A unique literary/cinematic achievement.
B000Z7S5FU|3.0|To be fair, this album (2006) came before the recordings for the movie Once (2007).  What was nearly perfection in the movie Once, is not so well-polished in The Swell Season album.  Needless instruments muddy the waters, as do an overage of dual vocals from our two given artists on this album.  That's not to say that the songs aren't still amazing, or that this isn't an album worth having if you like this duo, but this is by far the lesser of all their releases that came afterward, whith the notable Once Soundtrack still residing as the most likely contender for the top spot. This just feels like an album put out on a whim, one that they recorded quickly without a good producer, or maybe none at all.  It is missing the focus of the albums that came afterward (which to date there are 3 including Hansard's newest solo outing.)  If you are going to purchase this album anyway, just don't expect the wonderful melancholic vibe you've come to recall when you think of this band/duo.  That way you will hopefully be able to accept it as a precursor to the sound that made them what they are now.  Enjoy.
B004GJNFHG|4.0|Thanks to daring directors like Steve McQueen (love the name) we see great, fearless actors like Michael Fassbender at work.<br />A poignant political drama anyone can appreciate.
B00D6GT5S8|4.0|Sigur Ros' new album is a worthy successor to last year's Valtari.  Where Valtari was for the most part consonant and quietly distressed, Kveikur is dissonant and at times fairly agressive.  The album starts off with Brennisteinn a pulsing near-industrial sound foregoing the often-associated keyboards and pianos that have littered nearly all of this band's past entries.  It's a welcome, albeit jarring, introduction to what is to be expected from this new album.  Gone are the melodic piano accompaniments of Kjartan Sveinsson who parted from the band before the start of this new album, but that's not to say that the piano is completely absent, nor are the string accompaniments that sometimes break the thudding drive of some of the more aggressive offerings.  This is Sigur Ros' first real walk into new territory.  As much diversity as they have had before throughout their past six albums, this feels like the first album that they have truly stepped beyond what is expected of them, and perhaps even what they'd come to expect from themselves.  To sum up, I was not disappointed, but it did take some getting used to, and it meandered a little in the last couple of tracks.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this app..I wish you could obtain things &amp; build your reef faster than what it allows. however, it is a cute &amp; COLORFUL APP.
B00005UW9T|5.0|She was so excited we got it. She has been looking and looking for it. I am so happy I found it and was able to get it for her.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Nice game if you like theses types. Like it because I don't have to farm. A nice new twist to and old type of game
B00000K3D4|5.0|I had bought it before but my kids took it to the baby sitter;s house to watch and her kids scratched it. I had a heck of a time finding it again. So glad I was able to replace it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Own every season up to date purchased this last year, now waiting for Season 5 to be release on 8/27/13 only two weeks away!
B00005JL1C|5.0|My daughter and niece had never seen it. I also had my son watch it. I think 80's movies are so much better than movies today.  They just don't have the same messages.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app but much easier to use on my iPad. It uses a lot of memory and is a battery hog.
B00AG473GE|5.0|It was just as promised. WE LOVE IT. I love sharing the 80's with my daughter. The movies were so awesome.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Looks good, works good.<br />What more could you ask?<br />Nice features and easy set up.<br />Good value for the price.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|If you are a fan of Bob Marley then you have to watch this movie. This movie taught me so much about Bob Marley but I wont share, you'll have to watch the movie and find out :)
B0060D2WYI|5.0|I watched this movie as a kid and I love it more noe that I did. I would like it on DVD as well but until the next movie buy.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I had real doubts about it. I read it and then I read it again, it is in my permanent keeper collection. It is also on every Kindle device I own. When the movie was released I again had doubts but not anymore, it was great. It remained very close to the book and that rarely happens. LOVE it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A parent's dilemma even when faced with facts that are impossible to ignore. Fast and enjoyable read.  Lots of twists and turns.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is really good book. About a little girl who found what she was looking for also opening the eyes of other people as well. This book might catch your attention and I would recommend this book to  anyone. Hope you enjoy it like I did!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You can play with friends or by yourself. I really recommend this game if you have watched and liked despicable me.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I will be honest I bought it to have song #1, overall CD is good. I would buy mp3 format also
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|This game is lots of fun to play, but I'm so disappointed because every time there's an update, it erases all my previous games and I have to start all over at level one. I'm tired of getting close to the end, only to have it all gone. I'm uninstalling!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its cute; fun; adventures and thrilling all in one great for adults kids and teens! love it everyone in the world should play this game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun levels. great for all ages. highly recommend to families. all games are family friendly.  my 5 year loves it
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|For a rental it's okay. Typical TC role as he  introverted and haunted. Morgan is totally wasted in this film. Story line is not too predictable and is somewhat interesting.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I gave a 3 rating because the graphics could have so much better. That said the game is good makes you really think how to get out and you're really trapped fun.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I was happy with the previous version. This one focuses on eye candy instead of function. Features are hidden and it takes a while to figure things out. The interactive map wants location services enabled. Probably looking for another data point for marketing purposes. I still can't find the old almanac type screen. Extremely disappointed. I've started looking for a new app.
0802473156|5.0|I read this book years ago and it was well worth it. My daughter has found her fiancee, so I sent them each a copy so they can read and learn about each other and themselves. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The ads are too frequent and many of them are of such a nature that I do not want to see them nor do I want my grandchildrento see them.  I have not decided if thegame has enough inherent value to justify purchasing the ad free version. I also resent having to purchase those extra potent weapons.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|For anyone who has played the computer game of the same name, this is the same, but it is very suitable for playing on a tablet. The actions can be accomplished simply by tapping or dragging on a touch screen. The buttons are easy to use. The game will save your level, so you don't have to work through the easy ones to get to where you were. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a relatively easy and quick puzzle game!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great game of you're looking to kill time.  and with that being said make sure you keep track of the time!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The only problem is not having enough time to watch them all. Sucks you in quickly. Now I have to get on to season 2
B007NVJ7NU|1.0|This movie basically consists of a bunch of disjointed scenes with flickering lights in every scene and intermittent blackness accompanied by strange music in the background.  There is no storyline, no point, really pretty much a meaningless two-hour disturbing visual display, probably only interesting for people who are high on acid.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This games keeps both my husband (60) and our grandson (9) occupied for long stretches in the car, waiting rooms or planes. Well worth the 1.99 I think it cost!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I am so happy with this DVD.  Excellent production. This is a quality performance suitable for the entire family.  An enriching experience.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Excellent movie that I was unaware of until browsing Amazon for something to watch, read the synopsis, rented and watched..... superb!!!! Sci Fi is a genre that has been lacking lately; this and Prometheus tie for the 2 most thought-provoking and well done movies I have seen the past few years. Both make you think and ask questions, worth a buy, or rental at the least.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Thought the original interface was easier to navigate and gave better info. This is still pretty good in a pinch. I use a different app more frequently.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game it's so much fun. Can't stop playing it I do wish I can more corns so I can keep playing.
0307744434|5.0|The main character of this book is 'The Night Circus.'  All other characters and settings revolve around the circus, minor characters revolving around a major character.<br /><br />It is very obvious that the author is very visual, a multimedia artist.  This book is a fairytale, a dream which takes readers away from reality.  Ms Morgenstern has a wonderful imagination.<br /><br />The book is set back in time during the very late eighteen hundreds and the very early nineteen hundreds, long before the event of high tech very much in so evidence during our time and place. A different world.  The circus comes to an area without fanfare.  It is just there, no flamboyant colors, just many black and white tents where different acts are performed.  Some tents are large, others small.  Touches of red are worn by the circus's many devotees some of who follow the circus around the world.<br /><br />The book cover is beautiful, the descriptions of the clothes worn back in earlier times is lovely, old clothes were beautiful, lady like as were the characters.  Dancers float across the floor, the color of their gowns changing again and again, beautiful people, beautifully dressed.<br /><br />As the book begins it tells of the circus being in your area.  The excitement of its coming, the word of mouth way of letting people know the night circus has arrived.  Strangely it is a night circus.  There are no daytime shows.<br /><br />Two young people, Celia and Marco are to be pawns in a war, pawns in a chess match.  One must win, but which one.  Celia's father, a gifted magician dies, but his ghastly image comes to advise and admonish his daughter.  Marco's patron, a man without a shadow, wants Marco to win.  Who will it be?<br /><br />Readers meet the red haired twins, Poppet and Widget who were born and raised to be part of the circus.  The two have an act with orange kittens.  There is the clockmaker who built the beautiful clock with its intricate parts, a marvel, the clockmaker'sbest and most prized.  He becomes a devotee and follows the circus around the world.<br /><br />There is Bailey who since very young is fascinated by the circus when it came to the meadows in his home in Massachusets.  As he grows up he does not know what to do with his life.  Will he be a farmer like is father or go on to college.  Encouraged by Poppet he runs off to be part of the 'Night Circus.'<br /><br />There are more interesting characters to meet .  So pick up the book and enter a fairytale, a dreamland, a world filled with magic and escape.<br /><br />I have been reading magical reality books, a different type of writing, some are good, others not so much.
B007HXL1V0|5.0|While reading this book I became happier and had much hope with my children. I want to recommend to every mother and father I know.<br />Now it's time for me to skill up myself and feel the happy sibling atmosphere.<br />Thank you, Adel and Elaine.
B002ZG980U|5.0|good movie, tantalizes the imagination and sets your mind to work. Highly recommended to anyone interested in Sci-Fy Mystery Thriller.
B0095P33IW|2.0|Set in WW2 Europe: the Grandkids were more interested in the lack of technology than anything else and they ended up bored and leaving the room; it was written like a mediocre comic book so I couldn't stay interested either. At least Grandpa got a good nap that afternoon.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I loved reading this ... it was our book club pic for this month.  We all wondered why it has not been made into a movie yet.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|This series, beginning with the Assassin's Apprentice was recommended to me by my niece.  She told me that she was unable to put the book down and I found I had the same issue!  I would have to force myself to stop at a chapter at night so I could get enough sleep to be able to function the next day.  I took any opportunity I could to catch a few pages and as soon as I finished the first book (see above) I went to Amazon and purchased the entire series.  I am now reading the second series and still enjoying the writing, and the world and characters Robin Hobb has created, very much.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|While I love sappy love stories, when my head isn't in the books I'm very much a realist. This novel was the perfect balance of real life all the while giving the reader a sense of hope for the characteristics to get their lives back together. I plan to read it again.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice app that shows all the info in a compact space. A  very appealing background that matches the weather your having.
B00A4W3AJC|5.0|Give &#34;Holy Motors&#34; a chance. It's rewarding from start to finish but will turn off some with its arty tone and episodic structure, but these are also part of the film's strengths - which is not always the case with French art films! This is a wholly singular film with sequences unlike anything you've ever seen. By the time you reach the film's bizarre and hilarious final moments, you'll be happy you had this experience. One of the great art films of the last decade.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love this app however I HATE the updated version.  Too many ads.  I would pay .99 if there was one without all the ads.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|whole family loves it.  just mute music for kids cause crash has bone crunching sound.  even my 3yo likes this
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4! Need to see how they deal with the latest tragedy.  Stiff upper lip, I guess.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|&#34;Angry Birds Seasons&#34; is highly addictive. If you're trying to get a lot done -- this game will not help you. The only problem is it freezes once in a while and you need to exit the game and take a breather because it won't thaw! Even so I LOVE IT!!!
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Kind of cute, and sort of adorable. Has really cool robots and I SO TOTALLY OWN IT. Cant you tell I'm a girl lol.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game I love to play! I am 16,but I love Littlest Pet Shop and this game! I also like it that it is free! ;))))))
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not the best movie of all time but it was actually quite fun and worth a watch. Maybe I'll even buy it.
0062255657|5.0|An unnamed, forty something man returns to the small Sussex town he grew up in for a funeral. With an hour to kill, he finds himself back on the lane he lived on when he was seven. It seems that the Hempstocks still live on the farm at the end of the lane; this was once the home of his first friend, eleven year old Lettie Hempstock. He only knew her for a few days, however, before she had her going away party and left for Australia to live with her father. But as he sits by the duck pond, he suddenly remembers: that's not what happened. Not at all. And he remembers a lot more, too.<br /><br />The narrator's family (also unnamed; they could be any family) has fallen on hard times. Right after our hero's seventh birthday party- to which no one shows up- they take in a boarder to help pay the mortgage. An opal hunter- whose first act is to accidentally run over the boy's new kitten, he displaces the boy from his room, forcing him to share space with his little sister. This boy is a resourceful loner; he explores the land and reads a lot. But he's not a miniature adult; he's afraid of the dark and knows that asking adults anything is pretty useless. The opal hunter isn't there long, though; one night he takes the family car, drives down the lane to the Hempstock farm, and kills himself with carbon monoxide. This is when the boy meets Lettie; her mother, Ginnie Hempstock, and her grandmother, Old Mrs. Hempstock - a perfect maiden-mother-crone group.<br /><br />It's obvious right away that they possess magic; the boy takes this in stride. He loves mythology and fantasy, after all. Then they find that the opal hunter's death has turned something bad loose into our world, and it's up to the boy and the Hempstocks to fix things.<br /><br />I love Gaiman's work, but have never found it scary. This book had me scared for the people and unable to put it down- I read it in two stretches, only taking out time to sleep. Obviously, the narrator survived, but what about the others? This - thing- seems to have the power to destroy the world; certainly it is destroying the boy's family and the other townspeople. What price will be paid to be rid of it?<br /><br />In this book- which reminded me of Ray Bradbury's work that featured kids- ordinary things become magical. A puncture wound in the foot becomes a hiding place and a passage. Fabric becomes alive. An ocean- not just any ocean, but the ocean from which all energy, matter and magic arises- fits in a duck pond or even smaller space. This is the way kids see the world at some point: a place where magic, wonder and terror is not just possible but an everyday occurrence. A father's abuse is brought on by magic; food is extra delicious when prepared by magical women who just happen to show concern and affection for a mostly ignored boy.<br /><br />The tale is full of wonder, and terror, and courage, and sadness. For most people, as they grow up, the magic falls victim to life. But it's good to remember, at least once in a while, that it exists. This book proves that.This - thing- seems to have the power to destroy the world; certainly it is destroying the boy's family and the other townspeople.

B00BWJ91XK|5.0|I hated how it ended only because that meant I have to wait. I LOVE IT. And I am dying to see the next one.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|if its your first time into the metal gear series get this. Awesome games for a great price!! you cannot go wrong!! great cinematics, great storyline, great controls, great characters!
B005XN31LY|4.0|Love this series, and I will continue to watch. I got my aunt and mother and brother and sister addicted. IT was quite simple to do thought.
0064471837|5.0|I first read this book (and the rest of the series) as a teenager, and came back to it every year or so, but for some reason, stopped for a few years. I was a little hesitant to re-read it, fearing it wouldn't hold up. I was so glad to be proven wrong.<br /><br />The story tells about the title-character's quest to find her father and save the kingdom from a dark evil. Unfortunately for Sabriel, she knows precious little about the kingdom, having been schooled \\"across the wall\\" in a country with very little magic. Furthermore, the kingdom seems to have already have fallen, and Sabriel's quest may be in vain. Her traveling companions offer little hope, either. One is a saracastic cat that may even prefer her failure, the other a guard who lost his last battle, and spent 100 years in Death because of it.<br /><br />It may seem like the story relies on a few cliches, but the unique magic system, female lead, amazing characters, and wonderful prose make it something quite more.<br /><br />A prequel to the existing three books is due out next year, and a sequel is rumored to come soon after that, so now is a great time to get in the series. If you're tired of \\"sequels and series\\", Sabriel can easily stand alone, while the next two books about the Old Kingdom, Lirael and Abhorsen stand together. Reading them all is an option, but one you'll probably want to take.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|But it doesn't, I actually liked it and will watch the rest of the 007's from now on because of it.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This CD has several songs I know and like.  Plus, the songs I don't know are now favorites too.<br />I just love a CD that you want to play from beginning to end!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Very different but very good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books kept me interested throughout. I was constantly on edge and wanting to read more. The intricate details woven into the story are incredible. I am still deciding my thoughts on the ending. However, the simple fact that this story has me thinking gets my approval by a tenfold.
B00DU74U74|4.0|It was better than I thought it would be, and I actually liked it. But it was still pretty slow like the book and there was so much more they could have done.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard there is.  Been using this for about 2yrs now on all my android phone.  Whenever I get a new phone this app is always the first one I install.
B00470TOV0|5.0|A movie that has and will continue to survive the test of time. I love the war movies that are based on some truth, and I understand that pulling in things that weren't true make it a movie more love to watch. If that makes sense.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Glad that there are 2 more to left to read in the series. It is also a true trilogy not just<br />a long book cut into 3 parts!  Enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot believe I was so caught up in this program. I watched all 3 seasons and wanted more when it was over. I was reluctant to watch at first, then could not put it down. I have absolutely nothing in common with anyone in the stories, except possibly the Scottish help, but I became involved in the wonderful stories. Great story lines. I hope there will be more. Carl
0307950654|5.0|The author is superb in her plots and in the psychological depicting of the characters. And the more we read the more we get caught in her delicious, fascinating net, like Alice falling into the hole after  Rabbit in Wonderland.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 seasons, and hope there is a 4th at least. My MacBook tells me I must add more words, there.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved everything about this film from the musical score to the campy blood spatter, although I did have to avert my eyes at times. Leo DiCaprio was a standout in this as I expected more of a cameo type role. He was deliciously depraved in that very inbred southern way. Jamie Fox was amazing as was his mentor Christoph Waltz. Their dialogue was fascinating; they were a perfect fit. I appreciate the way slavery was depicted in its entirety as the inhumane practice it was and continues to be in many countries. I never felt that it was made light of but was used to tell the story of two people who just wanted to be together and one dear man who could not wrap his mind around the concept of people owning other people and the way in which these people were treated. Quentin Tarantino may be a genius in his ability to tell a story and his ability to keep me on the edge of my seat because I have miraculously become a part of the tableau. At least this time anyway.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Another captivating Lawyer program. I practiced law for over 25 years have never run across an all Harvard defense team, it is possible. Great stories. I cannot find season 3. If we are in it, I will be sure to watch it too. Carl
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This past Friday (8-9-13) I went to the Moonshine tour stop in KC and I was AMAZED!!! I have always liked Bruno but not to buy any albums and I only went to the concert to hear &#34;When I was your man&#34; live.. I left wanting to hear every song this man has ever sung :) I had to buy both albums because now I'm in love.. He can sing his a$$ off and I was overly impressed. His band is awsome as well and hella funny!! Most artist come to KC and only give us half a show and half sing but not Bruno I felt like I was in NY or Vegas ..I mean if you have the chance to see him and his band live DONT MISS IT!! He can never step foot in KC again without me having a front row seat!!! I am still pumped and its been 3 days that should tell u something..Never been to a concert with an encore let alone 2 of them!!!! Yes Bruno you got me I'm a fan fa life **muah**
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Get it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!  Great graphics.  Definitely worth the price.  Fun hidden objects scenes and challenging puzzles. One of the best h/o games that I've played.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love him his music is awsome!!! If you dont have this you dont like real music and real raw sound #period
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|I've tried almost all video players and they all seem to have some issue.  This one works great - it streams mkv video from my twonky device flawlessly.  Just have to change the settings in audio to get the sync right. easy to do.  I recommend this one.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|and if you listen to the lyrics, not just the music you should understand why Bruce is my generation's Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow I love this game it is so real. The reason why is because it has many true techniques like feeding grooming riding and everything like that. Even train for competitions I love this game.&lt;3
B001LF4IA6|5.0|you'll soon get the sense that I'm a huge Springsteen fan. The lyrics are evocative, the music kickass, that's it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a great guide for beginners who need to publish to Kindle for the first time. It's clearly set out, and gives you all the information you need to get your book to the point of being available to purchase.<br /><br />What would make it a 5 star review, is if it included a bit more information about marketing and how to promote your Kindle book, but there is nothing I disliked about the content in general.
0060775858|2.0|I thought it was a regular sized hard cover book, not a miniature one.  that is all i have to say;.
B00008BRB5|5.0|I haven't listened to this in a while and once I downloaded it I started remembering all the songs and then I remembered how much I actually liked it.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I was frustrated that all the couples never really got to know each other, they just happen chance saw each other briefly. Storyline was poor in that regards. Annoyed that the hospitals showed \\"SCREAMING\\" mothers in labor, and a nursery full of swaddled, calm babies. What? where is the baby friendly initiative? And I can't even remember all the couples (it was much too confusing, and all over the place), but the second generation Cooper couple, had an emergency caesarean!? she was ready to push. get the momma on all fours, change her position. sorry, but this seems a little more of a cheesy, melodramatic scare tactic, not funny movie at all. Why are all the doctors yelling at the mothers to 'pUSH\\" or \\"Bear down!\\", we know instinctively how to do it, don't yell at a laboring woman. (HAHA) Meanwhile, I cried!!! I was thinking, do not ever show this to a pregnant mother, or any one who plans on having a baby. Ridiculous. I am glad that this was a \\"Free\\" movie with my prime membership. Sad, sad... I only watched the whole thing, daring to dream it would get better, but no. I was touched by the adoption, and  sincere tears at that,cried, but that was it. Definitely not a comedy.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The innocent is one of Baldacci's best. Engaging characters, twists and turns on every page. A must read for fans of the genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is awesome I have this on my I pod and my kindle<br />! I a. so good at it to
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a fun app if you like quizes and fun games this is a good game for you  it is also very addicting
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|The extra disk is probably more for Superman fanatics.  It has a rough draft of many of his themes on one track that is 30 minutes long.  If you're just wanting the music from the movie, I would just get the regular CD as the extra may not be worth it for you, but if you're like me and like to hear the composer's process and how he came up with his final draft, this would be a good buy!
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie is from the point of view of lives of Women.  All classy women from different levels of society how they love and live; a sisterhood and sometimes how we truly do not support each other when it comes to differences. Great movie to enjoy!
1401937519|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! It really gives you a very different perspective to what we know as &#34;death&#34; and it certainly invites you to live life, really live life.<br /><br />Highly recommended it!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I admire the writing; it's nothing short of brilliant. What I did not like at all is any of the characters. They are all seriously flawed, and I do not believe that reflects real-life people. I wish I hadn't bothered to finish it. It left me sad and bummed. And, I'm afraid, it's put me off Rowling.
B0018RFLN0|1.0|Surely there are others out there who look for at least a hint of believability in a script.  This and the second MI are GARBAGE.  Completely implausible and unrealistic plot and cliche characters that can't be followed.  Ghost Protocol and MI3 were good though.  You'd be better off watching the original TV series, or maybe even reading a book, than watching this heap of crap.
1400052181|5.0|This is one of the most amazing medical stories that I have ever read. If I were you, I'd buy two copies... one to keep and one to lend out. When you are done with the book, you are going to want to talk about it with another reader. Why it isn't a movie is beyond me... some stories need to be told anyway that they can be told... and this is one of them. Hope that Skloot is working on the screen play.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you enjoyed the previous two books by Hosseini you will most likely also enjoy this story.  He manages again to bring together stories of Afghan families and individuals that at first do not seem to be related but as the story evolves you find the ways their lives inter twine and affect one another.  Hosseini's writing is both lyrical and down to earth.
B004SIP6C2|5.0|Fast Delivery, Great Movie for a collection or Gift for a special occasion.  May require parents discretion if watching with children.
B00821OX98|5.0|Already addicted to this show. Binge watching like a champ with my girlfriend. Already on to season 2 and we can't stop watching. A must-watch if you love sci-fi!
B00122MWBK|5.0|bought it after their concert, remember listening to them growing up, brought back memories. fabulous performers. would like to see them again!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This was a great read...Reza Aslan is a good writer and this book was an enjoyable reading experience.  I learned a few things I wasn't aware of.  That is always a good thing...learning something new.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my boyfriend got this originally. played it on his phone and love it! my sweet pea loves it too. We have a score war going on now!
B004D20JP2|4.0|My kids (3 and 5) didn't know what to think of this movie at first, but once it got going they loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is never boring. only down side is that it sometimes takes forever to load. but still enjoy it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This story kept me coming back day after day despite the 852 pages!!!! I really enjoyed and look forward to reading the sequels.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I love this movie, very surprised that they had it on dvd. I'm glad though because now i added it to my collection
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Did everything I wanted it to do. It is cheaply made though, so I don't see it standing the test of time, but I guess once your tapes are converted it is a pointless thing to own haha.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|This product works pretty well. I originally purchased this along with a Bluetooth reciever to plug into my car stereo. After my car was broken into, it was stolen, and I purchased another one.<br /><br />A lot of times, it would take a while to connect to my stereo, but I honestly just think that was partially the receiver's fault. The only thing that would really make this better is if it somehow let my iPod know that it was bluetooth, and somehow unlock &#34;bluetooth settings.&#34; But I realize that's more of an Apple problem.<br /><br />Oh, also it drains battery life. But it can usually last a couple of hours.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|A side of Batman I have never seen can't wait to see were this series is going. I couldn't put this one down keep me on the edge of my seat. Full of interesting twists.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The movie had lots of action and some really good special effects but the dialogue was lacking, predictable, and even some what hokey.
B008M721MS|5.0|The colors and the sharpness of the image are very good. The size of the characters of the keyboard are of the size I need because I have big finger tips.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This was a nice, well made movie but it was very predictable particularly since it was a remake of the original Footloose
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I just loveeeeee this app!!! It's fun and really makes me think. I would recommend this app to all of my friends. (That's if they haven't already discovered it).
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|I got this for my boys (7 and 9 years old). They saw it twice in the theaters  when it first came out. They enjoyed seeing it at home but maybe liked it more than they did. Very funny parts in the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great app for all ages.It keeps you busy so it never gets boring and the graphics are pretty good to.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anthony Ryan writes of pain, love, betrayal, loyalty, honor and sadness. Blood Song was a wonderful read immediately linking your heart to Vaelin as he grows from a boy to a trained killer for his Faith and his king. I cannot wait for the next book in the series!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Trying to get my wife to read it.  I think this book is very well written .  I am looking forward to trying all nine experiments.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I could watch this over and over again. It holds my interest and I hate when the hour is up.
B0044JVM00|5.0|I like this album and have for 30 years<br />View tips and guidelines   20 more words required<br />Enjoy it
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|The Tempest is a classic that I found very interesting, absorbing and amusing in some instances and it was much more enjoyable to watch than when I studied the Play in my English Literature class in High School.  Helen Mirren's role could not have been better cast as was the supporting actors who did a superb job re-enacting the very substance, wit and humor that underscore the success of Shakespeare's Plays.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Its AWESOME it'd freaking amazing I love it is perfect I'm not even kidding its amazing and u can make funny ones also
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is so awesome. I'd been playing it for 3 months now and I can't get off of it.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I'm SO glad I bought this book. It's a quick read (probably less than an hour) but that's great because a) I tend to be ADHD and lose interest quickly and b) Austin does a fantastic job of cutting to the chase and not wasting time with needless fluff. His writing style is relaxed and Steal Like An Artist is packed with plenty of info, insight and inspiration. So put this review in your Praise File, Austin, I loved the book! Great job!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Satarical spy spoof that is somewhat entertaining. Had some funny moments but very slow at first. We wanted to see it so we could understand RED 2 now in theaters. We will probably go see that, too. Cast was great but story could have been better.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Great flick. Good to see a young female kicking tail. I liked that it included an international journey as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best series ever. Looking so forward to Season 4. I have been glued to the television since Series 1. Love...
B00634GHJA|5.0|I had problems with my Kindle and finally had a Nikki from Amazon help me.  She is wonderful.  She helped get a bunch of things off of my Kindle Fire and then helped me set up the cloud on my computer so I could transfer photos to my book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|very fun no violonce at all you can make friends and help restore light to poney ville fun for all ages
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I haven't given up yet. I have it on my kindle and that could be the problem, but I wholeheartely agree on reading our bible, so I will continue to try and figure this out. I am sure it is just me.
B001GZOT32|4.0|Although Parsons will never quite get to the pinnacle again of what was &#34;Eye in the Sky&#34;, Eve comes close.  Very few producers/songwriters can generate the full sound that he can.  I have always been a fan of Alan Parsons' instrumentals and Eve certainly delivers.  For anyone wanting to get acquainted with the genius which is &#34;the Alan Parsons Project&#34;, Eve is a great beginning.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|There is a quietness that slowly draws you in to a story you know will not end well, even if you never read the book.  The display of extreme wealth is evident but not over the top.  The music and costumes were perfect to the Roaring Twenties.  You see the shallowness of Daisy even in her interactions with her little girl.  You are drawn in to Gatsy's hopeless belief that he will finally win Daisy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another wonderfully well written and gripping story about  life in Afghanistan. The lives affected by the culture history and wars of the paradise decades. A must read.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|All I can say about Gotye is that this is a truly unique band, album and overall sound. STIUTK is their big hit, but there are other equally amazing songs on this cd, one's that will truly entrench your enjoyment and loyalty to this group. Each song has so many aspects to it, from many instruments and sounds being used to deep lyrics. None of this is typical MTV pop music; in fact, I find it hard to put it into a genre, it's that different. Just highly textured, layered songs that flow from one to the other and make you want to buy their first album (if you haven't already). You've got to love Aussie bands- they have their finger on quality music that is one of a kind (and I'm American). I'd recommend giving this whole album a listen, you won't be disappointed.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Excellent kit, though the instructions are a bit less thorough than some.  The variations really make it pop, and who doesn't want their very own Mr. Fusion?
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Of course the movies themselves are great, but the extras included w/ this set are fantastic. It was great to get an inside view of how these classic movies were created. And for $20(on sale)?? Can't go wrong!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This book bought many a smile to my face. It is filled with respect, adventure and humor.  I delighted in every page and loved every character.  Thank you Yann Martel.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I saw an episode of this show about a year ago on TV and could not find it again.  I found it on Amazon and have been watching it with my daughter.  We love the show!  Can't wait to watch the rest of season 2 and then season 3!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King in a more scifi mode. It is exciting and full of twists and a real page turner (figuratively with the Kindle).
0440237688|1.0|This book was horrible. It contained a bunch of ideas that were presented almost as though the author took it upon herself to put something new into the book every chapter, a stream of consciousness, without any way to link the ideas or to indicate that they are important in any way. The whole premise of transferring ideas was ill defined, as were the colors, and the book had rules that apparently no one could fathom, (experiences can go from this one to that one but not back, except when they get released). There is not even a bit of logic, to suggest that there was any thought put into this book. The narrative is invented as it goes along and little thought was put into creating a comprehensive story. I cringe that this book is being taught to our youth. If I had to read this garbage in school, I would likely have gotten a bad grade simply because the book cannot be tolerated as a story, and I would have said as much.
140006922X|5.0|if you have ever wondered about the time in which Jesus lived and have questions about the story of Jesus then this book will help you understand what life was during the time when Jesus was alive.<br /><br />Very interesting for me is the story about how the Jews wanted Jesus dead...but by the hands of the Roman Empire.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Nice app. Its easy to make some music. Lots of features. My 6 month old loves it, the lights and sound are very stimulating.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've always loved this novel -- what's been called a comedy of manners.  Austen brilliantly observes the thoughts and actions of the characters with irony and humor while weaving romance throughout.  But I used to think of it as superficial because she kept a proper decorum in her stories.  As I get older, I've come to appreciate aspects of her writing that I hadn't noticed before.  For example, the manners that I found stuffy and tedious, now seem to me to be the social grease of getting along with others, illustrated well in her stories.  I can learn something from her.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper tells her story with wit and self deprecation.  Some of her descriptions were right on target, &#34; it was like Lord of the Flies on estrogen. I sure as hell wasn't going to be Piggy.&#34;  Her descriptions of her fellow prisoners are on the side of compassion without becoming a caricature of the generous anthropologist.  I believe that reviewers who found this trait to be self serving are missing two main facts.  The first fact is that she had ten years to prepare herself for prison with research and with efforts to prepare her own reactions.  The second fact is that the author used her observation to enable herself to remain in this very terrifying of worlds.<br /><br />In any case, she uses this time, and by extension her memoirs, to make some informed judgments that are of value when considering the policies of incarceration.  It is worth keeping in mind that we will see little of the desperation of career criminals.  She is in a minimum security setting with women who are guilty of a proscribed circle of crimes.  However, she still makes the point that any system which gives every single part of power to one groups is bound to be humiliating, by definition, to the underclass.  No her observations are not particularly new nor do they propose more than general answers.  But I still find the book has a message of value, especially to the &#34;nice people&#34; who never dream of such a fate.  To add value, the prose is drily funny and written with a cultural eye.  I recommend it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This film certainly opened my eyes to what goes on in the American food industry! I was already eating grass-fed, organic meat and local produce, and this film solidified my resolve to continue doing so. I wish more people understood what they are eating when they choose the Standard American Diet (S.A.D.).
B006M4F67A|4.0|I'm hooked and love it.  I can't put it down.  It doesn't get any better than this.everyone should at least try it. It's very relaxing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little device is by far one of the coolest things I have ever purchased, and it works wonderfully. For anyone who utilizes the Google ecosystem, this is a must have. I currently subscribe to both Netflix and Google Music All Access, and this thing is worth it for those two services alone. The ability to painlessly control playback of my entire music library from my pocket is a dream. I've been waiting a very long time to be able to do this, and Google has nailed it. Netflix works great also. I no longer need to haul my PS3 from room to room when I want to watch something. Of course this isn't an issue for anyone with a Netflix capable device in each room already, but it solved my problem. And anything else stored locally on my computer can be streamed directly to the device through Chrome. I have it all! The Chromecast is already a home run, and it will only continue to get better as more developers hop on board. A must buy.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|Loving Cars, we went into this movie with high expectations.  As typical, the humor was more adult-oriented, but the biggest problem was so was the story line.  It was way over a child's head.  After 20 minutes in the movie, my child asked when we could leave.  Very disappointing.
B008GODP04|5.0|I read this book because my reading group will discuss it later this month. I was not enthusiastic about the choice because I'd never heard of Anita Brookner, but changed my mind after the first page. This is a small, sweet little story told with power and force. Brookner is the consummate artist and I enjoyed every aspect of the story. I can't really compare her work to other authors. She is in a class by herself. I've ordered other Brookner's for the future, and am now her biggest fan!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I will recommend this book to everyone! I laughed for all of it!!! Please take the time to laugh with Ellen!

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is so easy to use and I got it for the free app of the day on Christmas this past year! Although it's expensive, it's worth the money!!!
1449437524|5.0|For the dog lover in your life, this book is laugh-out-loud funny.  The author clearly understands what it's like to own a dog.  Makes a great coffee table book.

B00B1EEKM8|5.0|A classic that looks great on Blu-ray.  Cannot go wrong with this one, should be part of everyone's Blu-ray library.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|If Mathew is truly dead then I cant give up that last star. That relationship is what kept bringing me back and reeling me in. I can't even imagine wanting to watch season 4 without him.
0812982622|5.0|No wonder it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction! There is a truly amazing and original mind behind the creation of this story-Adam Johnson. Because the plot line and especially the insight into North Korea is so compelling, I decided to read it again as I pretty much engulfed and devoured it during the first read. By re-reading it I have picked up so much more and recommend it to all.
0770437400|4.0|The segmented stories of the book make it interesting and its a good quick read that explores the desperation and hope that an apocalypse would.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I bought it for my wife as a gift, she LOVES this musical. I like it too. She would say that the movie stars don't do as good a job as the stage performers, but I think they do just fine. One thing I don't think she, or other people of that opinion, might be considering, is that movie stars don't need to have the power for belting out their songs like a stage performer does.<br /><br />If you're at all compelled to see this musical, I recommend this version. Great performances all around. If I had one criticism, it's that the director was too obsessed with the close up shots. I believe I've seen enough of Anne Hathaway's running nose for my life time :).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great entertainment while running around and busy with Kids. Is fun and easy for my kids to play with.<br />The movie is awesome!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I really love Stargate. If you are a fan of scifi at all, you need to watch this show. I am very pleased with my purchase.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great storyline, great actors, great period and certainly a great family both upstairs and down.  If you haven't started watching this show you are really missing out.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|So good. I loved every bit of . It. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Amazing! Brought me to tears. This is the best Nicholas Sparks book that I have read. Just a perfect read for anybody in need of a good romance book. I want to read it again!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game it remind me of the carnivals we use to go to at the parks. Being a kid back then was easy.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|great item. The dvd was fantastic. Sellar was prompt in delivery.<br />The info and music was un-surpassed. Great chance to hear her voice<br />in a jazz style
B003B02O7I|5.0|The use of humor was most appreciated.... LOL!!!  John Grisham continues to not disappoint... readers will again, be pleased and overly satisfied.<br /><br />Don
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I had to keep watching the entier season without stopping. And was hungry for more. The humor, drama, and suspense will reach grab you right from the begining and never let go.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I suppose if you just didn't want to spend a couple dollars more and buy a Roku this is sort of OK.<br />Well, kinda sorta.<br />It doesn't do much on it's own. If you're not streaming from a browser then YouTube/Netflix is it.<br />What's also annoying is that instead of the tiny little plug-in you think it is most people will find they'll need all the extensions and cables coming out of both sides. It makes both Apple TV and Roku boxes look elegant.<br />That combined with harder then should be router connection and your phone's the remote makes this yet another piece of Google hardware that's just not ready for prime-time.<br />Most anything else looks and works better.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you have seen seasons 1 & 2 you might think they can't possibly come up with more. You'd be wrong. As ever Dexter surprises and engages you with every episode. Check it out. You won't regret it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has great ups and downs and I would recommend my friends to see this show from beginning to resent shows.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I first heard the songs of Sixto Gonzalez a few months ago when I found a movie called &#34;In search of Sugar man&#34;. I instantly liked the style of the music. Although the music was produced in the 1970's, it still fits in with today's music trends. The music and voice should appeal to those who enjoy relaxing with music with good lyrics and a great voice and style. Very similar to Bob Dylon and from the same era. This music would be of interest to people from mid 30's and older.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Excellent overall digital sound recorder. Voices sound very clear. And great versatility to record voice, plus instrumental sound. Highly recommended when recording sound for video on the field.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have enjoyed this series and can't wait for more. Thanks for stoking my fire for reading again. This book was devoured in 72 hours!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I like the game its fun to play, although its kinda hard to keep it going straight. It has good graphics. I recommended this game to family.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Although the writing isn't as good, it is certainly more comical.<br />Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton are a kick in the pants with their English bickering.<br />I would recommend it just for the entertainment, and forget about the lack of accuracy of tolerance and emotion when it comes to taboo subjects.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I like the game. Don't even mind that you have to use tokens and wait for the scratch offs. But I can't play with my friends which is incredibly annoying. The invites don't work and its frustrating. Other than that is okay, but the invites are frustrating enough to give it only one star.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|While a great story of Holocaust pain and survival, the abuse of language thwarts the message. Using the Lord's name in vain and other curse words make this tale no more remarkable than without. Death tells the story of Leisel , Papa, Max, and Rudy with stark realism, Nazi hatred and tortured souls. However, for me, the language was so offensive and unnecessary that it ruined the story. Instead of being an \\"I can't put it down\\", it became an\\"I need to finish so I will know the end.\\" Creative but coarse.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow the best game on the suckey app and game stores.  But there are about 100 copies  but  NEVER buy anything  but Minecraft Pocket Edition:-)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Preface: I have high speed internet and a business grade router Cisco Linksys E300. My TV is located 10ft from the router. I was very excited to start using the device.<br /><br />1. The set-up worked fine and it connected to my internet. (I was very excited to start pushing netflix via my tablet and phone)<br />2. THE PROBLEM: I sync my devices (motorola Xoom 4.1.2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2.3) and try 'Cast' netflix onto my TV....It  stalls in a loading state. 5 min later it gives an error message on the screen and aborts trying to \\"Cast\\" the netflix show on my TV.<br /><br />I really wanted to give it 5 stars because the idea is awesome, but it is not working for me.<br /><br />I messaged Google and they have yet to respond.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Being a die-hard book lover, it was difficult for me to even consider reading books in electronic form.  I still prefer books; however, there are times when books in electronic format are convenient.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book made me change the way I perceived the characters all the time. It was full of twists and turns and after feeling empathy for each of the characters at some point, by the end I wasn't sure I liked either of them!<br />Cleverly crafted.
0780756908|5.0|No matter which edition, the Fountainhead continues to be one of the best books ever written.  It is not only my favorite, but my son's favorite, as well.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a cute game, little difficult for my 6 year old grandson to get the hang of at first but now seems ok with it.  It did take forever to download and get ready to play.  Seems ok now.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I had recorded this on my dvr and changed companies so I lost the movie. I loved it so much so was glad to find it on amazon so I can watch it anytime I want.
0736092269|5.0|Love this book! Easy to read, pictures help to show which muscles that one is working, and easy to understand instructions for exercises to work that muscle group.
B000002IJL|5.0|arrived on time was in great shape and I love having all the old music to listen to. Love it as I am a large Stephen King fan.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|takes 20 minutes to load on my kindle fire but only takes seconds on my ipod trying to delete and reinstall
B00009NQQO|5.0|My granddaughter loves bath toys and this is one she loves.  Her and my grandson love playing with this everytime they take a bath.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is beautifully rendered, meticulously researched, strong, brave, and ambitious--not only that, authentic, multileveled and brilliant. I would compare the work, in both sensibility and craft, to a Kundera or Marquez--it is that rich, that skilled, and that moving.  Thanks for this, Khaled Hosseini!
B000002BSV|5.0|Not one song that I don't like. It's all about the youth, melody, brit-pop and classic of all songs. They were almost all sung at live concerts. I hope to see them soon at Oct. this year.
1781162646|5.0|I finished reading Stephen King's _JOYLAND_ several weeks ago and cannot stop thinking about this novel,  thinking about  how much I enjoyed _JOYLAND_ and how much I hunger for more stories like this one, where strong relationships between the characters are the driving force of the story.  As a reader, I believe the best and most successful stories are those that reveal the strengths of our humanity, as well as the destructiveness of inhumanity, through relationship dynamics, their conflicts and resolutions: in _JOYLAND_ we have these enticing relationship components wrapped inside the conceit of a murder mystery. The year is 1973, the place is Heaven's Bay in North Carolina, and Devlin Jones is our young protagonist who hires on as a Happy Helper at a seaside carnival called Joyland during his summer break from college. WORK CLOSE TO HEAVEN! the classified ad in the regional rag _Carolina Living_  had barked.  Devlin, who is trying to recover from being dumped by his first love, answers the ad, hoping the job might distract him from his broken heart.  What Dev learns instead is that a broken heart can never be distracted nor forgotten, but stitched back together again with the sturdy sinew of dedicated friendships and noble endeavors.<br /><br />This the second time in a year that a novel has made me cry at the end. The other novel was King's _11/22/63_.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I can get the album the first time. It's worth expecting. No more tricks at guitar, more profound lyrics and warmth from the country melody.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like it but when do u get coins to play again I have been waiting 18 hrs to play again
1476712042|4.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down and I finished it in a couple hours of intense reading. I loved the book but it definitely had it's flaws. First off the fights were blown out of proportion (what's new? It's romance!) and they acted unrealistic after the fights happened. Second of all the end was completely cheesy and the epilogue annoyed me and when I finished the book I felt empty somehow like the ending didn't fill the part of the book that was missing. It annoyed me how 'Pigeon' asked Travis to marriage and how he already had a ring picked out but awhile ago was still about to hook up with Megan. Some things annoyed me but overall the book was amazing and was one of the few books I've liked so much that I read through it in one sitting. The romance was unrealistic but it sparked my heart and adds to the pain realizing I will never have a relationship like this! LOL! Good book Jamie McGuire. Overall, I loved it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Good app for kids to play its also improve kids confidence level<br />I recommend this. Please download for your kids to play its easily available in amazone web site
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Love being able to use facebook on the kindle and not just the pc. This app works fine on the kindle fire
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It is a run and jump game, with a few extra specials to intrigue your mind. Reminds me of Tetris or Dr.Mario... Brings you back in the day. Enjoy y'all
0425266060|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and anxiously awaited Entwined with You but what a let down, almost to the point of boredom. For a Sylvia Day novel, that is something because she writes pretty darn amazing books in every single series that she authors (and I have read them all).  I don't know what happened with this one; I suspect her publishers want her to drag it out for a longer series and if that is the case and this is the latest style of writing, then it is a mistake.  Look at what happened with Charlaine Harris and the Sookie Stackhouse series...by the time she got to book 9 it felt like she jumped the shark and the final books were not up to the standard of the first group.<br /><br />I'll be waiting to see what others say about the next Eva/Gideon book before I preorder it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is very cool and it has many different items you can buy and it has multiplayer mode and it is filled with action and excitement. This is the ultimate game.
B000W94FE6|4.0|The book is very well written and has a good message, but is so ponderous.  It also has way too many stories. I'd like some illustrations, more data, and about 1/3 cut out. But worth the read.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Relaying to play. Doesn't get you all crazy. Just what people need to calm themselves down. Perfect after a day on the job.
1451695195|5.0|The doctor's book is somewhat disorganized but a sincere reader can overcome that.  along<br /><br />It does not live up to its title but I read somewhere that the author wasn't happy with it either.<br /><br />If you give the book your total skepticism, you'll probably  be rewarded. As I went along, I felt myself warming to it, but all the medical jargon seemed confusing rather than convincing.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|App was free. I wouldn't have it unless it was free.  Why pay money for a battery app. all phones come with one.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This has become my new favorite show. Edge of your seat suspense every episode. The mind blowing twists and turns will keep you guessing. The actors play their parts so well that's what makes it so fun!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Right time Right price. It was about time I stopped watching the DVDs and upgraded to the Bluray.  Love it~
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  This is 40 is so what happens after you hit the big 4 0 !!!  Made me laugh.
B005HED11Y|5.0|All the basics of the characters and plot are unchanged, but scenes of the Enterprise, planets, etc. have been subtly upgraded. For example, where the original showed a three foot model of a building in the distance, now you see various vehicles moving, lights on, and people moving inside the windows, making it appear more real without distracting from the original, quirky classic<br />Star Trek look. The color throughout is vivid, unlike the gray sunglasses look of TNG. I feel the subtle upgrades made the series much more &#34;watchable&#34; for new generations, and the footage with the classic characters has been kept untouched except for the restored color balances.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I just couldn't put down the other two books, but I am having trouble with this one.  Maybe its just life in general interfering with actually being able to enjoy it.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This chimney works great with the Weber Smokey Joe Grill. Just fill this to the top and that should be just enough charcoal to cover the bottom of the Smokey Joe. You can then lay some more charcoal on top .<br /><br />I've been using it the whole summer now and it seems pretty sturdy and has held up so far. It's really simple to use - you turn it over and crumple up some newspaper or paper in a ring around the bottom. Then you turn it over and load it up with charcoal. You light the paper in as many places as you can and then just wait for it to light the charcoal. In about 10-15 mins when the top coals start to ash you can flip it over and you are good to grill!<br /><br />It's much better than using lighter fluid and waiting for it to soak in and then burn off so you can eat. You don't even have to worry about having lighter fluid taste in your food. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that regularly grills with charcoal, it's so simple and useful. And for around $15 you can't beat the price - you will more than make up for the cost of lighter fluid using this.
0812416503|1.0|Font is tiny, tiny, tiny...don't waste your time ordering this.  I wish I would have ordered e-book.  Really disappointed; the book was needed for one of my children's school assignments during the summer.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Item arrived quickly, it was packed securely, everything fit the description. Great songs from a great band. I am happy with my purchase
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Five stars. Love the game. Subway surfers for the Kindle HD is a excellent game for all ages. I definitely recommended this game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent I love the main actor (Alex Kendrick)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book makes you think and run for your copy of the Bible to check out the footnotes. It's an easy read and very thoughtful.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent I love the story and the humility and strength of the young girl.
B00BW6SOIQ|3.0|One of those movies you watch and cannot decide what is about and why was made at all.  If you have time to burn, go for it.  Otherwise stay away!  Three stars for the cast, the movie starless.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|hours of enjoyment entertainment delightful and just plain fun me and my family just love to change each other in this game.
B0073XV2W2|1.0|Using lots of Sci Fi flim flam to carry a weak plot.<br />If the next one is this bad, Mr Suarez is out of the race.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Hard to begin, but once I started I didn't want to stop. Very interesting material, combined with fantastic storytelling and a unique writing style created a fantastic novel, a true modern classic.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I really like the King and Maxwell series,  I have not read the in order, but they're still good. The relationship between the two main characters keeps it moving.  The mystery is established early and keeps you guessing until the end.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I decided to read this book based on the numerous rave reviews this book had been getting and the overall rating across the book shelves this book had. But I am left wondering why is it liked so much?<br /><br />Let me be clear first to say that the book has an interesting plot, good setup and engrossing pages in between. But overall, I felt let down. It left me wanting more. One key reason for that is the characters are just not allowed to grow to connect. So whatever the pages read, feels contrived. Even the twists, only a few, are forced, are deus ex machina. They are convenient for the writer. Didn't go well with me as a reader. And it is unnecessarily hurried at places, without much background or reason.<br /><br />It is not a bad novel, but I just feel it is an opportunity lost. This could have been so much better with a bit more focus on building the characters and trapping their emotions. Controlling the urge to drag the plot on violent action every time wouldn't have hurt.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a gift.  We both love the Eagles and this did not disappoint.  Lots of great history, interviews and live concerts shots.  There was a lot of history included that even we were not aware of......fun!<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000V6Q7F0|5.0|There are some pieces of music that change your life. Not in a hugely significant way, but in a subtle more enduring sort of way. There is something about a great melody that enters into your being/soul and somehow becomes a part of you. The Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no.2 is full of great moments and is therefore a piece that absolutely everyone needs to know, if not already.<br /><br />Rachmaninov composed four piano concertos, of which no.2 is the most popular. In the past few years no.3 has also gained in popularity. Both are worth knowing, but no.2 is definitely the place to start.<br /><br />It is no surprise that the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no.2 has been recorded many times, including by Rachmaninov himself. Each interpretation/recording brings something new, therefore choosing a definitive recording is difficult and futile.<br /><br />My favourite recording is this remastering of an oldie, recorded in 1959 by Sviatoslav Richter and the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the little known conductor, Stanislaw Wislocki.<br /><br />The exquisite main theme, of the first movement, which starts after about 0:35 played by the violins and violas, is about as gut wrenching and moving as it gets. The second movement also contains a wonderfully memorable melody beautifully played, first by the flute and later the clarinet. The speed of the final movement is thrilling and the precision and clarity of the piano playing is breathtaking. Music this good deserves to be known, loved and shared.
075669812X|5.0|Bought this for my son and he loves it.  I couldn't find this anywhere are it was one of those must haves for Christmas.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The first time I used it love it.  It is great.  I plan to add Calculator Plus to my phone.
B008MU8ZOI|2.0|I didn't like this movie. It was predictable and I didn't like the ending of this movie. The monster carries off Darry at the end to a factory after chasing him across the state.  Dumping bodies down a chute.  The two kids explore his chamber of horrors and trouble soon follows.<br /><br />One of the worst horror movies that I have seen. Skip this movie.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|Amazing book I love the maze runner and hope to see a movie of this fantastic action packed book .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game fast paced and fun! Scenes are always new and different instead of the same thing over and over!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Fun platforming game.  Good controls, and it's just challenging enough to have fun without being frustrating.  And i always love games with no permissions needed.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|I have watched this movie several times and still find it a great movie and find things that I didn't see in the pervious viewing, I highly recommend this movie for the adventure and sifi persons to watch
B009JNXK88|5.0|Fun game, good music, good controls, and lack of permissions make this a win, and good for 5 stars in my book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing, the acting, the actors the scenery...all perfection.  I positively cannot wait for season 4!!!  Can't come soon enough!!!
B0026O475M|5.0|One of my favorites. This film is a classic. One to watch again and again. I liked it as much today as when I first saw it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Packaging is streamlined and sharp.  The movies and extras are wonderful and the price was fantastic!  It was just perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If u have seen  the two movies u will think it is awesome like I do  so get the game trust me
B008OOYALE|5.0|I loved this game it is so much fun but i dont like how you have to wait sometimes over 20 hrs. They really need to work on that
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just love this series. This house is fabulous and the story line is always a hook for the next week. Never disappointed except that I can't wait for the next one.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line and acting. I do not know how much of this is based on fact. Very uplifting and a movie to watch more than once. I would recommend it very much .
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This photo editor has some basic options that allow you to make changes to the photo. It is good for my kindle applications.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it didn't respawn you to die and I feel that it could be less greedy with all of the expensive stuff to purchase
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Having lived in the tropics this app allowed me quick access to the most up to date info when hurricane was a threat.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|A friend recommended Downton Abbey and I was hooked after viewing the first program of the first season only sorry we have to wait until early 2014 to begin Season Four.  There is so little worth viewing on TV today this was a refreshing change of pace and held my attention from beginning to end.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Suits is a light and entertaining show that is easy to watch.  The writing and story lines and characters are good.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Nothing special.  Pretty dumb plotline towards the end.  So many issues being tackled at the same time and they are not even relevant.  Cool visuals, though.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Antifragile contains some profound food for tought and insightful findings. The term Antifragile will surely spread and will be used widely in many fields. It may be beneficial to read the book where the term was coined.<br /><br />The organization of the book is quite nice. Taleb presents his case in the first pages, then spends the rest of the book presenting all kinds of supporting evidence and anecdotes. The book is a mix of philosophical pondering, fact-based research and (sometimes autobiographical) narrative.<br /><br />On one hand, Taleb presents essential toughts in a very entertaining manner. On the other, he seems like a modernism-hating grumpy old man ranting about his pet peeves. (Both his thinking and his love for the past have increased a lot compared to the Black Swan.)
B0029O08WA|4.0|I first bought the &#34;Twilight&#34; original soundtrack.  Then I bought the score, which I listened to a lot more.  Until &#34;New Moon&#34; I didn't find myself needing another movie soundtrack.  But there are a couple of pieces on this CD that just play themselves in my head...had to have it...or go around humming &#34; There's a possibility....there's a possibility....&#34; and driving myself nuts.  I like to listen to both this and the Twilight CD's in the car...good travel music, especially on a dark and rainy day...
B003VDY7XE|4.0|Audrey's new friends and acquaintances in Haven throw her a surprise birthday party - but it becomes a nightmare when a predatory shape-shifter joins their midst.<br /><br />We purchased this episode because we missed recording this one on our DVR and needed it so we could watch the complete season.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent and we had no trouble streaming it on our Rouku.
B005LJKEXS|3.0|I bought this cable for tethering images from my Digital camera to my Mac.  Upon first several attempts, the connection was fine until I clicked the shutter, then the connection would be lost.  I signed up to return the product and decided to give it another try before packing it up.  This time doesn't seem to be a problem.  I hope it doesn't give me any more issues, as I need this for photo shoots.  I have done 2 different tests, and all seems fine now.  packaging was nice, the product seems new.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use &amp; easy to read! It's a must for folks needing a big screen display. Really don't have any negatives about it.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Very well written and insightful, but I felt sad and depressed throughout the whole story.  I did not find it uplifting in any way.  2 lifes were ruined because of one terrible person!  I like to read for  entertainment this just made me sad to think that our world is full of monsters and that we have to keep ourselves and our loved ones from falling into their clutches.  That being said, the book does pull you in and it doesn't let go until the end.  Just as it should.
0062238868|5.0|Very well written and fast paced.  I read it in three days and it was as if the author was telling me his story in person.  Written in real world, sometimes gritty language, it chronicles Kyle's experiences in Iraq and tells matter-of-factly how he served his country well by removing those enemies who would have killed many more American soldiers had he not terminated them first with precise shooting.  Kyle also realistically states how most of his shots were at shorter ranges than most people who don't have any sniper experience believe from watching movies.  Most military sniper kills are taken from less than 100 yards to about 800 yards to center mass, not the 1000+ yard head shots in movies or adventure novels.  Police sniper shots are precise hits to the head and almost never exceed 100 yards, often much closer.  American Sniper is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Buy this book and help out Chris Kyle's widow and two children.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I love Gregory Porter. He has the smoothest voice and the music goes so well. It is a great traveling CD
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Another excellent season of Nikita, equal if not better than the first season.  Good balance of story and action, with interesting plot twists which keeps the viewer guessing what comes next.  This is a polished series and it could be seen that the writers and actors really put their efforts into making it the best they can.  I look forward to season three and hope many more will follow.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this on my kindle and I love it. Works very well on my kindle even though it's for my android...I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
1476733953|5.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle because I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction and it had great reviews.  I was not disappointed, the story is original, the dialogue is believable and the characters are complex.  This is the first review I have ever written; I was so impressed with this story and the author.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great episodes but am disappointed that Amazon hasn't put season 4 on its instant streaming list.  I won't pay over $40 to see this season.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Hey, this guy has golden pipes...He's one of the only performers out there doing this type of material...He's the heir to Sinatra...
1475972350|5.0|This book catches you right away as husband and wife are tied up in bed together, then the husband loses his wife and two children to this executor of people who waste \\"HIS TIME\\".  It makes you want to crawl into the pages and just wrap a noose around the killers neck.  It's a very graphic book but one that is well worth reading if you can tolerate torture scenes.  The suspense is awesome too, Todd did an AWESOME job on his book and I look forward to reading more works from him.
159463176X|5.0|Great reading about family and loyality during the 30 years of wars in Afghanistan, and the selling of a little girl to give her a better life.
B009A7E7SK|4.0|It is very easy to follow.  I was a little confused on the set up.  You have to &#34;edit&#34; all the exercises first or they don't download into your Kindle.  I will use it again, that is for sure.
0891419195|5.0|Very well written and enjoyed reading this book!  It was very clear and gave me details I needed for my history class I was taking.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow starter but wait till you're about half way through! I couldn't put it down!! Definitely recommend this book for a good mystery.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Have probably read this 25 times over the years, but I love it just as much as I did the first time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Terrible book!I hope I don't even give it another thought.... What kind of mind thinks like this? Gillian needs a bright light in his life!
0060935464|5.0|One of my all-time favorite books, I just realized I hadn't read it for many years but I couldn't find my copy.  So, I bought a new one.  It was delivered more quickly than I expected.  I was very pleased.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Thought this film was amazing! Lots of action, comedy, and a great story line all together. All the characters were amazing and their story as well.
B003RV43X4|3.0|Special effects were good, I saw this movie for free so I cant really complain, of all the corn ball versions of this movie that were made over the years, this was one of the better ones
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really adventurous game.  The only thing is s when you battle vector it is hard to pass the vector battle.  Above all the game is super fun!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great every time I need it. Can track things right from my phone too. Like Ebay on my phone.
B006S053K8|5.0|The movie was somewhat predictable but a great &#34;feel good&#34; movie. It was funny and emotional and entertaining. It was a very well-made flick.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Couldn't do my job without this calculator and the Platinum offers even more options for my borrowers.  Would recommend to any loan officer.
B000002KXV|5.0|This is as close to a perfect recording as humanly possible and the music is sublime.  It is a thing of beauty that is heartshatteringly perfect from lyrics to arrangement to the musicianship itself - it takes the listener to another world. Spectacular is not a strong enough word to describe the Nightfly.  And on top that this is one of the first pure digital recordings that was and still is so technically amazing that stereo sales people used it to demo speakers.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is really fun. You will like it if you loved playing uno when you was a kid. Great
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The great white shark is SOOOOOOOO MUCH money cuz I saw it was 750 gems!!!!! Please make it cheaper cuz that is ridiculous but other than that it is a great fame
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I am a Gossip Girl fanatic. I faithfully watched every episode and loved every moment of it (well almost every moment.)I admit the show had lost its spark somewhere in the midst of Season 4 when for some reason the writers decided to take away college and career prospects for these VERY young, wealthy and ambitious people and turn them into a cycle of never ending backstabbing & bed hopping cycle without any real purpose or character development. It became impossible to root for anyone or any couple at that point.<br /><br />With that said, Season 6 had its questionable and downright hilarious moments such as never ending Chuck Bass family drama and Serena & Dan attempts to salvage the disaster that was their friendship and romantic relationship. But of course, it had its winning moments such as anything involving its main stars Chuck and Blair, zingers by Georgina and return of the one and only Uncle Jack.<br /><br />Season 6 is laughable in parts, but its conclusion and five year flash forward was for lack of the better word, satisfying. I was genuinely happy to see a TV show conclude with lose ends tied up and conflict resolved because Gossip Girl was never meant to teach life lessons, provide moral scale or attempt to actually relate to average people. Everything about Gossip Girl always functioned on hyper reality for entertainment and fashion envy purpose.<br /><br />The ending could have been much worse when you look at the last few seasons that descended into pure disaster. Season 6 somewhat cleaned up the mess and it concluded this crazy show I was obsessed with for years. My Monday nights will not be the same anymore.
B0088OINTU|5.0|Every positive thing you have ever heard about this movie is true.  This was the first time I saw it.  I expected it to be a disappointment... I was only disappointed that the movie was over.. in spite of the length.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic book!  Can't wait for the fourth one to release... Could not out this series down .. Read them all in a weeks time.
161655164X|5.0|For everyone considering to buy this wonderfuly crafted artbook, do it, it is quite huge, over 170 Incredible full-color artwork pages long and there is a lot of cool backstory information about the characters and story of the game. It is featuring concept art, character designs, and astonishing settings and landscapes, The Art of The Last of Us provides a unique look at richly detailed and compelling game set in a postpandemic world where humans have become an endangered species, one of the best games in the history. For a fan of  The Last Of Us, the best game of this console generation, it is a necessity. I also bought the The Last of Us Limited Edition Strategy Guide, but it hasn't been delivered yet.<br />It was well worth the 30  including shipping to Slovakia<br />Thank you Naughty Dog for this amazing game and Dark Horse for this exquisite artbook and also a big thanks also goes to Amazon for their excellent, quick and reliable service.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were engrossing, well written, and captivating.  The description of life in Afghanistan is full and one can imagine the daily activities.  And the Mountains Echoed, however, failed to fully develop the characters or the culture.
1619696231|5.0|Had to keep finding places to drive so we could keep listening. Another great suspense novel by a fantastic author.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app is useful and easy to navigate.  I would recommend this app.  Sometime it is slow, but once you are in it, it mores quickly.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Works great just takes some getting used to having to reset it after not using it for a while and it looks good while im flying.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Love it, Vince Gill is an awesome singer. I love that he keeps to the traditional country music. This is one of his best cd's.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|No matter how many times I have seen this movie, it still offers great entertainment and many laughs. All the characters play their roles to highest level making this a completely funny and enjoyable film
0783225903|5.0|I received this item very quickly and it was as described. this was a gift from a wish list and my step dad seemed very happy.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of Thrones is probably one of the Top 10 shows of all time. It's up there with &#34;The Wire&#34;, and &#34;Mad Men&#34; in terms of well-written storylines. I won't go deeply into it, just be sure to pay attention. Lots of information but not overwhelming. Not appropriate for children. Very graphic violence, nudity, and language. But Amazingly written and produced show. it's like watching a cinematic-quality movie every week when it's on.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|The trailers wee the best part of the movie.<br />The plot was confusing; the special effects were over the top.<br />Not one of Tom's shining moments.
B00117AXUS|4.0|A couple songs pop out, they are influenced by neutral milk and it shows, but in a good way. Overall I've caught myself playing it on repeat, in the background.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is awosome!!!!!!! I'm not gonna pay 7 freakin' bucks 4 minecraft. I think its wayyy 2 much money.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I was skeptical about this movie, but I'm glad I bought it. It is a very good version of the original story. It came in good time and in great condition.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book is so good. I watched the movie first it was good too but I always like the book more. The same was true in this case. The ending may shock you. It did me. This is a sad book. Be prepared to cry.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I've always enjoyed this show and now I can watch it with out the commercials. The behind the scene stuff is great too. Glad I bought this.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was worried about some of the reviews on this book saying it was not writtene well. Im glad that I decided to purchase anyway. What jayce went through is tragic. I am glad that Jaycees told her story in her words how she wanted to. It was raw and at the end it was empowering. I want to thank Jaycees for sharing her story.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I usually can't afford to buy seasons of shows but the deal that I got on this I couldn't pass up. I'm glad to have this awesome show.
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|This app is awesome! It would get 5 stars, however, it always needs to update, and my phone says update failed... I have rin it on android 4.0.4 and cyanogenmod 10.1 Runs great and blocks most ads. For free, it is definetely worth checking out.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I would like to understand the whole subscription list thing. I haven't touched it, and my phone works fine, but I am curious.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|This show is fantastic! I'm glad I bought it. It is nice to be able to watch it over and over again with no commercials!
B003ZMF26W|1.0|Thought this was a quality product. I have owned it for 5 months & the right click just gave out. It  has laid flat & no more elevation. It was barely even used meaning not enough game play to have this feature malfunction. Had it lasted a yr I would've expected this to happen with heavy gaming but to have this less the 5 months then brake is poor quality in my book. Hope this helps. oh & just found out Amazon will not replace no refund bcuz  they have a 30 day time window. Beware of any electronic that is not know even  if you read good reviews bcuz we read the reviews on this & took a chance & we lost & are out of a refund or a replacement.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|This is a really great movie! Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are amazing in the roles they play. You really get a sense of who the real people are. It came in good condition and in good time. I'm glad to own this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great app especially for<br /> someone with a love of horses<br />I like this app because of the  detail it looks like real horses
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I'm happy I could find this online. I really enjoy this show and now I can watch it whenever I want to.
B0000028VT|5.0|I love Mariah Carey, I am a huge fan of hers since she first came out. I love that I got this album from 20 years ago for such a great deal! Thank you Amazon.com!
B00795P4EG|5.0|No real problems  with  this  app  crashing  for me.  Works great and does the job nicely.  The one problem is.  That it works awesome  on landscapes and similar  photos.  Not so much on busy background  type photos. But that is too be expected.  Even in photoshop you need to do a little  extra with busy images to delete  unwanted  objects on these types  of  photos.  And the animation  of when it is fixing  a photo . is kind of  cool.  It's  like now you see it.  Now you don't.  Has saved a few stressed  out moments  when a light pole  or otherwise is in the way of that perfect shot.  I love this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game, so much fun, so funny.<br />Great game for my son and i to play together to get a laugh out of the minions
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I love the game it was really fun I really liked it I beat the game and I'll do it again
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Super fun! Awesome game! It is a super cute game. It goes from popping zits to putting on lipstick to choosing the right dress!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have 2 of these right now at my house, one in the hallway and the other in one of the rooms. These things with the 8 LEDs are super bright and motion detection works great. It automatically comes on when we're at the bottom of the stairs (nearly 20 feet) or when we're leaving the bedroom. Pretty convenient especially if you don't want to fumble around in the dark to get to the light switch or just need some light to get around.<br /><br />The only downsides (and not really such a big deal) are that you can't set a timer like the other HIPE lights (although the other ones only have 6 LEDs instead of 8 like this one) and the motion sensors detects a bit too well - meaning any slight movement it sees will trigger that super bright light which can be daunting at times. Other than that, we love it here so far and shall be getting another one soon to brighten the hallway up even more.<br /><br />Also keep in mind, these are definitely way too bright to use for night lights and not quite as bright to be use as room lamp substitutes.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Florence and the machine are awesome, I love her style so much, and the deep lyrics, CD insert was highly interesting also.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I'm 63  one night I was on YouTube and bumped into the funhouse concert. All I can say is it blew me away I loved every song. I have seen many concerts x hippy here. I had to have it on DVD so I ordered it and when it came I watched it . It keeps you interested for sure, great writing and great music. She uses her personal life as a song writing incentive and she really does a great job of it. In all forms of music rock, country ,pop certain people stand out. I always admired talent no matter what type of music it may be.  This gal has along career ahead of her . Just hope she never gives up on her beliefs , she knows what she is doing. I find myself huming her songs all the time. She does an amazing job covering other  artists songs . She says she is paying her respects when she covers a song and I believe she means it. The sets are great the dancing is great musicians are top notch thoroughly entertaining peice of work. Get it you won't regret it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Love it! The romance behind the facade of passion is mind blowing. Hope she completely finishes writing 'meet fifty shades'.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this is a great family movie! Even our teenagers enjoy watching it.  Our 2 year old can't get enough of those minions!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I found it to be the best out of the three movies that were made based on the book.  The actors were great!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|What a brilliant &#34;how to&#34;, so to speak.  I find it's not just for artists but for humanity.  All those in their ruts, this is a guide to climb out and be active.  Steal from cultural thought bc it's free.  And it's a fast and funny read :)
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This is a no-brainer. It delivers exactly what you'd expect. Explosions, lots of action, etc. If you're looking for intellectual flick or something with more substance then look elsewhere.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you like Susan Boyle, and her wonderful voice, then you will certainly enjoy this CD.  I like her renditions of the songs.
B001F4UHGC|4.0|This is an old classic from the 70's. The chase seen is considered one of the best done, particularly for that time.  Good movie if you enjoy action films.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|You must play it.I don't even know what to say about this game. Best game ever and ever. It a good game
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love using Pinterest.  It allows me to share my interests as well as others interests.  I recommend it to anyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the whole book in two days, It left me wanting more and more! I can hardly wait for the next book!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|sturdy box, nice overall design, great/massive extras. all discs in perfect condition, no doubt, if this is on some special offer - get it.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|NEVER get this movie, you will hate it if you love Phantom of the Opera -  definately a thumbs down.
B00846REIS|4.0|This reminds me tons of the Fifty Shades trilogy except for a few key differences between Eva and Anastasia. I love that Eva at least stands up for herself more than Ana. And I love that Eva has her own set of crazy to deal with.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved it. Yht cast was great and worked well. Can not wait for RED 2!!!! Watched it several times. Wow!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Things are rarely black or white in this show: the nuance in the story telling (and the occasional bits of clear-cut messages) make it something you can't just put on in the background and fully appreciate.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD truly is the very best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons!  I LOVE every song!  We keep the CD in the car and sing on long trips this summer!  So much fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME I HAVE IT TO XBOX AND PC AND THERE COMING OUT WITH REDSTONE UPDATE I CAN'T WAIT!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Even though they left out a lot of the book and added people who were not in the book it is a very exciting and well done movie. Jennifer Lawrence is the perfect person to play \\"Catnip\\"
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love Pinterest. Just wish some of the pages were true and accurate, and not misleading (like to a spam page) Otherwise, I've learned so much.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|A good addition to the sigma novels.  A few additions to carry along series, although I hoped for a bit more.  Good mix of science and myths.  A few prologue cliffhangings to wonder about a few of the characters.  But I like how the series uses a variety of characters to highlight each story. Still when not involved throwing in characters names seems to fall flat. I guess it may help some readers with 'where is so and so' I'd just leave out mentions
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great way to relax. If you aren't careful it will become addicting.Been playing for over 2 years. Had the appfor almost a year. No problems.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I must be honest - when I first saw this book my thoughts were \\"Is this book anything for me?\\". I must say it was. Unfortunately I wasn't all that thrilled about the ending, I like to know how things end - this just leaves you hanging on. So I will have to wait and see if I will bother to read Hollow City, the second book. The reason is that I feel the theme of the book might just be milked for what ever its worth - and a second one might not be that good!<br /><br />Also if read on a kindle, the pictures will not be as good. Would recommend buying the book and not the kindle version.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Not too hard to make money. Tutorial is easy to understand. The only thing I wish it had would be some kind of in game guide for mixing dragons. But I suppose that would take away the mystery.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Once you get over the unpronounceable names and characters an outstanding piece of writing with unforgettable characters.A top drawer read.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I had to read a book off a list from school an  I am very glad I chose this one.<br /><br />It can put you to tears and it really makes you think about life and it's qualities.
B00351YF52|3.0|I found this one very hard to get into not up to the usual gripping standards I have come to enjoy  from John Grisham.
B001R10BEG|3.0|Big on blu-ray looks nice, but this is definitely a bare bones package, with no special features and a marginal update to the old DVD transfer.  This movie isn't serious classic, but still, I imagine there are some interesting things that could have been included, and even a commentary from Hanks would be interesting since this was one of his first big films.  Overall it's good, but don't pay too much for it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|my sister bought it and I played it it was do awesome its hard though I'm going to type random words! hsjj bshhz shjz hdgdu hbdhjxh (

B005HJWWW8|2.0|the important thing to understand about the fiio e06 is that it amplifies exactly the same amount (about 30%) and the fiio e05.  all it adds are a few bells and whistles, like a choice of 3 equalizers and a bass boost.  30% amp is not enough to hear your mp3 player over traffic noise.  do not buy.<br /><br />buy the fiio e11 instead.  it's $60, but it doubles sound volume.  that *is* enough to hear above traffic noise.  much better buy.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Terminator 2: Judgement Day since its initial release on VHS back in 1991. It was the most revolutionary movie I had ever seen at the time, and it (coupled with \\"Jurassic Park\\" which would be released 2 years later) would go on to change film industry as we knew it. The movie itself is a classic of the Sci-Fi/Action genre, and I would argue is BETTER than it's predecessor, the original \\"The Terminator\\" (1984). It stands teh test of time and is just as relevant, mesmerizing, and engaging today as it was over 20 years ago.<br /><br />I have owned several releases of this film spanning many different formats of media, but I have to say that this newest release, the Skynet Edition, is by far and away one of the nicest looking Blu Ray transfers I have ever seen. The picture is sharp and the colors are rich. It looks like a movie that was released a year ago. Simnply put, the picture is immaculate, and really holds it own on 1080P HD.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Purchased this item as a gift.  Received it quickly.  The receiver was very happy and enjoyed the full season of shows.  I would buy from this vendor again.  Thanks
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|The measuring stick for all horror/suspense. Is there a greater honor for a filmmaker than to have your work be regarded in such a way, even 50 years later? What Alfred Hitchcock accomplished with \\"Psycho\\" was to create his masterwork. No movie of his before or since achieved such greatness, and in his own time no less. He had reached the pinnacle of the mountain as a filmmaker and was in a class all his own in the genre. He had done what he set out to do which was to scare the wits out of his audience. To scare them so badly that they shudder to leave the theater for fear of what may be waiting for them in the dark outside. He achieved this in spades.<br /><br />\\"Psycho\\" is widely regarded as the finest example of pure horror and suspense to be found in classic cinema; eliciting a veritable tour de force of senses and emotions. It is also labeled as the first \\"slasher movie\\", although that honor may be more fitting to be pinned to John Carpenters \\"Halloween\\" (1978), there is a fair bit of similarity between Hitch's film and Carpenter's and one can see alot of the influences that \\"Psycho\\" had on Carpenter, most of which come out in his film (including hiring Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of \\"Psycho\\" actress Janet Leigh, to star).<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Blu Ray is a marvel to behold. The picture is stunning, and I do mean STUNNING. In fact, it has never looked better in my opinion. Even though it is black and white, there are many different color tones visible throughout the film, and with a minimum of grain, reminds me of how the newer film \\"The Artist\\" looks. The plethora of special features makes it a disc really worth buying and adding to your film archive.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Recived before time given.  Purchased as a gift.  Enjoyed this movie a lot.  The reciever was very pleased and enjoyed it too.  Recommend this to anyone.  Would purchase from this vendor again.  Thanks

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great Show. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Suspensful; action packed. Never a dull moment. Check it out.
B00DUCXFUC|4.0|Ok, this clearly isn't as \\"Ultimate\\" of an edition fans were hoping for. Could it have been better? Yes. But from what I'm seeing, we're still getting the blu ray's (which were already fine), all the previous bonus material, some merchandise, and a few HOURS worth of new bonus features. And although we still don't know how well made the packaging is, I think the artwork looks great.<br /><br />If you've already bought these films on blu ray, I'd say wait for this to be on sale. There definitely isn't enough here to make it worth rebuying movies for eighty dollars. But, if you're someone who does NOT own these movies on blu ray (or doesn't have the previous bonus features) then this set looks worth it. Don't listen to the reviewers who say it's the same thing with a few toys. There is a decent amount of new bonus material here, just not as much as some fans were hoping for (or an upgrade of the blu ray quality). As it is, this set looks perfectly fine, just may not be worth to you what it's priced at (especially if you already own the trilogy on blu ray).
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a pretty cool game ! It is different than most shooting bubble or jewel ones. There are a lot of different stuff you can use .... like fire balls, plus you get a chance to buy 10 extra eggs if ya need them !! 8^)

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read.  The fact it was written by a medical doctor is even more impressive.  I marveled at his seven (7) day journey and the memories he brought back after coming out of the coma.  Great book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and keeps you on your toes! I finished it 2 days ago and still keep thinking about it. The book is definitely a good summer read full of mystery and smacks you in the face with it's twists.
B00CO8TBR4|4.0|This CPU is awesome - it was on sale with an instant rebate and I got a surpise Steam Product Key for a new Game (Grid 2).<br /><br />Overall - very fast, no need to buy the more expensive K for overclocking due to its performance.  The Haswell editions now control their on voltage on the CPU - essentially taking over yet more Northbridge controls.<br /><br />This CPU is the best bang of the buck in my opinion.  I only give it 4 stars because the stock coolers have a tendency to pop off and you really need to spend another $10-$20 on a back-plate screw in cooler.  Its a waste of aluminum for Intel to keep sending those junky coolers with each CPU.
0440237688|1.0|This book was not very good in my opinion because it was just not intersesting.  Also the characters were very boring

B00D9CDTUY|2.0|Thought it was original uncut version ...however it is a completely different version altogether and it was glitchy....had to fast forward in parts to get it to work.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I think this novel is sad and beautiful at the same time. It is hard to see reality for yourself, but much easier when seen through someone else's eyes. I think it is really original the way that Clay sees why Hannah killed herself through the tapes.<br />A great and original read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm totally hooked on this game.  Just by looking at it, it appears to be extremely easy, which it pretty much is at first, HOWEVER, once you get going it progressively gets harder.  Love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Before you start this book make sure you have nothing else to do. Once you open the first page, it is absolutely impossible to put down. I read it in 1 day! Amazing!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|When is the next one coming out?!<br /><br />All the other reviews say it all.  The only thing I can add is that normally I hate leaving the music on during a game but this music was so good it really added to the atmosphere and never bugged me.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This novel was really well written, but I failed to engage with the characters. It is original but it had something missing for me.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|definitely need to have read the book before this to make sense of parts of it, however i enjoyed the book very much! twists and turns that kept me reading.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is by far the best novel I have read in a long time. Mia's story will throw you off your feet. A must this summer!

B001ANSS5K|5.0|This is by far by my favorite novel from John Green. The plot is totally original and I'd totally recommend this novel to anyone.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|The Lorazepam is an awesome movie for children and adults. The music rocks and I think the message is timely. Dr. Seuss would be proud!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I don't know why I read this book. I never liked zombies but since I friend recommended it, I decided to give it a try. I would've happily stop reading it half way through, but I managed to get to the end. Not my type of book.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|The acting and writing are excellent.  I find it very realistic and disturbing.  I haven't watched the entire series of<br />season one.  I have watch four shows and do not want to finish the season.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|After absolutely loving the film, I decided to give the novel a try. I know you are not supposed to do this, it is always better to read the book before watching the movie. However, I still enjoyed the book. It brought me back to my adolescence!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers - BLU-RAY EDITION - is simply fantastic!  The gift box that the set is in is very nice, also.  The quality of the video display is exceptional - makes it really enjoyable to watch this awesome series.  It came packaged appropriately, too (no giant box full of padding.  Just what was needed to get it to me safely, but not overburdened AND NO DANGED PEANUTS!).  Great series put together wonderfully in this nice gift box.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The reviews of this novel are almost consistently 5 stars. I hadn't been able to find a book that threw me off my feet in a while, and I had all my hope in \\"The Fault in our Stars\\".<br />Hazel Grace and August Waters were cute, and their relationship and the way the dealt with their illnesses was admirable. However, I lacked to see why this book was different from any other books about kids dying of cancer.<br />The writing style was great, but there was something missing for me. I wanted to love this book. But I didn't.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun game love it! I'm not able to ride my horse but on the weekends and its just amazing
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Definitely, the best book in the series of all of them. The ending stood up to standards. Great built up to book for. I wish there were more of them.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|I'm a new listener of Vampire Weekend and was only recently introduced to them through their performance on SNL. I enjoyed their performance and songs and based on those was hoping for more faster-paced original songs like Diane Young on the new album. The album, while fine, does not have a slew of other songs with the upbeat tempo that song has. So while the music is overall good it features slower, more meandering songs and Diane Young is more of an oddity than a typical song on the album.

B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Many years ago, the dwarves of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, were driven from their home by Smaug, last of the great dragons. Thorin Oakenshield, the grandson of the last King of Erebor, has vowed to reclaim his home and called upon the dwarven clans of Middle-earth to aid him. Rebuffed, he instead plans a daring raid of a few chosen dwarves to slay Smaug whilst he sleeps. To aid them, Gandalf the Grey has promised to recruit a skilled burglar: Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire. Their journey will take them through forests and caverns, all the while being tracked by an old enemy of Thorin's...<br /><br />An Unexpected Journey is the first movie in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit. That's Tolkien's short novel which, by word-count, is just under a fifth of the length of The Lord of the Rings. There's been enormous controversy about director Peter Jackson's decision to split The Hobbit into three three-hour films, with a fear that there simply isn't enough story to warrant it and this will result in padding. That is the threat that constantly hangs over the film and to be fair, it mostly avoids it by making a major change: Jackson has decided to show in full Gandalf and the White Council's side-story to confront and destroy the 'Necromancer' of Dol Guldur (a storyline that takes place off-page in the novel). Whilst also controversial amongst fans, it does give Jackson a rich vein of story to mine to add to proceedings, but how successful this will be remains to be seen (this subplot is only really started in the film).<br /><br />The movie opens with the older Bilbo (still played by Ian Holm) writing an account of his adventure for Frodo and narrating the destruction of the human town of Dale and the neighbouring dwarven mountain-city of Erebor by Smaug. We then have the traditional opening from the novel, with thirteen dwarves and the wizard Gandalf turning up on Bilbo Baggins's doorstep to recruit him for an adventure. By the time the young Bilbo (Martin Freeman) agrees to join the quest, a rather surprising forty minutes has passed. This sequence risks interminability, but Jackson takes advantage of the time to introduce the thirteen dwarves and give them some character traits missing from the source material. James Nesbitt's Bifur in the somewhat cynical joker of the pack, whilst Fili and Kili are the over-eager young guns out to impress their older peers. Dwalin is the bruiser and Balin the wise old - and somewhat pedantic - sage of the group (Ken Stott is excellent in the role). Bombur is fat and little more than that. The real impact is made at this stage by Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. Armitage is charismatic and has steely resolve and presence in his role, and is the standout performance of the movie (and, dare I say it, impresses more than even Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn in the original trilogy).<br /><br />As well as showing the Necromancer stuff on-screen, Jackson has made some other changes to the story to increase the dramatic weight of events. Thorin now has his own nemesis, a mighty orcish warrior whose arm he cut off in battle. This warrior, long-thought dead, has returned and is now chasing down Thorin and his band (a bit like Lurtz in the movie version of Fellowship of the Ring, but a lot smarter and more continuously present). It's another change that I think some won't like, but as a dramatic device it worked fairly well at introducing some tension to the film. However, what was really distracting is that this orc has the exact same skin tone and texture as the Engineers in Prometheus and is likewise gigantic. His story arc is left unfinished at the end of the film, so we can assume he will return in the sequel (rather cleverly, as it provides a potentially better way of explaining a subplot in that film than Tolkien was able to do in the book).<br /><br />Elsewhere the film feels a lack of cohesion: the Necromancer plot has little to do immediately with Thorin's quest,so every time we cut away to Radagast the Brown (a great performance by the ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy) trying to resuscitate hedgehogs (!) or Gandalf discussing backplot with Saruman and Galadriel for what feel like nineteen hours, the movie flags. In fact, the dwarves get so bored of Rivendell (missed opportunity: someone saying, \\"On second thoughts, let's not go to Rivendell. 'Tis a silly place,\\") they just up and randomly leave. Once the dwarves are back on the road together and causing mayhem, the film perks up and more fun is had, even if sometimes accompanied by some unconvincing CGI.<br /><br />The scenes in the goblin caves in the Misty Mountains are entertaining, but also daft. Barrie Humphries as the Goblin King works rather better than most were likely expecting (and there's a humourous nod to Gandalf's \\"You shall not pass!\\" moment from the original trilogy), but the extended battle-and-escape sequence is too slapstick to really present much tension. This contrasts to the successful scene where Bilbo meets Gollum (Andy Serkis, on fire as always) and acquires the Ring, which is brilliantly acted by both parties and features some nice tonal variations from comedy to menace and back again.<br /><br />Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (***½) can be called a qualified success. It has some big problems that Jackson has not been able to overcome: the storyline is too slight to sustain three hours and even with the addition of extra storylines and characters, there are some scenes which feel like wheel-spinning for the sake of it (most notably at Rivendell). There is also a near-omnipresent use of CGI in almost every scene of the movie. The original trilogy worked best when the camera was allowed to film natural landscapes or when miniatures were used to depict locations and give them a sense of reality and weight. Here, CGI is much more freely employed, often with less regard for hiding the fact it is CGI. In particular, there is a dearth of trulyawesome shots of the countryside of New Zealand in all its glory compared to the original trilogy: here, even many of the landscape shots have been bathed in CGI until they glow with lens-flare. Even in 2D and at 24fps, the film has a 'faker' sheen across it than the original films, which sometimes distracts.<br /><br />Fortunately, Peter Jackson has learned from the mistakes of George Lucas and has remembered to include plenty of character moments to keep things more real. Armitage is awesome, as previously mentioned, but it's Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo which anchors the movie. His character arc (and Thorin's, which develops in tandem) is well-handled and Freeman nails this icon in a way he didn't manage with Arthur Dent (in the disappointing Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie). These character and thematic moments are less-successfully handled than in the original trilogy, but still give the film some dramatic weight and tension that keeps things interesting.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you are looking for a thought-provoking, addictive, puzzle solving game you should try the Quell series. Planning ahead is the only way to get ahead and, to top it off, the background music is pleasing.

B009NXV2RK|4.0|I finished this a bout 2 weeks ago, and it was a good solid read, I will buy more of his books in the future.
B007MDB71O|5.0|For some reason, critics miss the point. This is a beautifully done, very imaginative movie. The actors and actresses, especially the main two or three characters, did an excellent job. It is a movie that we will watch many times, as the little details change one's perspective from each viewing. Thanks for a job well done. May we see more of this type of movie!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This was a masterfully produced, skillfully acted, wonderfully thought out production of a Charles Dickens story.  Mr. Dickens' stories are not always easy to follow, and the time frame of his stories can add to the confusion.  Yet every bit of this production carried you further and further into the story, not just along with it, until finally you felt a part of everything that was happening. I was fascinated by every bit of Little Dorritt, could not stop watching it the first time through, and ended up watching the entire thing all in one sitting. I have watched it many times since, and I find I learn something new each time, whether about the story, the characters, or even about Charles Dickens. I would highly recommend this set to anyone, whether a fan of Dickens or not. It is a lovely film.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is now officially my absolute favorite book of all time!! I wish that he would make a book two of this because i love einstien so much!!! This is a must read book.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Too much time was spent on his family as filler. Would like to have seen more about the inner journey. Still a good read.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|This is a classic, still cracks me up, still moves me and takes me back to when I first saw it. &#34;this is our time!&#34; Love it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Well, let me by saying if you like science fiction, you will like this movie, plus it has a surprise ending and many tiwsts and turns that make the film alone interesting.  But I digress, this movie not only has its twist and turns but the tech part is really cool, and there is alot of tech in this film.  The acting is typical Tom Cruise, no complaints here, but being a fan does make a difference, needless to say if you like scifi, then I would recommend that you see this movie, it will not dissapoint.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|But also very, very funny. the minions are a trip! THe girls are adorable and unique. Gru grows on u, then u realize he was always a good guy. Bad guys is just for show,lol.
B000FBJF6Y|2.0|The descriptions of life in Botswana are interesting, but the way it is written is too predictable and repititous.  The author describes the main characters vehicle always in exactly the same way, and it takes away from the story.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game is soooo boring....that's all I can say about this game I thought it looked fun and cute but I was glad it wasn't a higher priced app.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I'm a big Dave Grohl fan and had pretty high expectations for this movie based on what I've heard from others.  I was not disappointed.  It was interesting to hear the story behind the sound board at Sound City and it was nice to see what Dave has done with it today.  I think this is a great movie for music lovers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for anyone. The minions are everyone's favourite. Anyone who enjoys watching the Despicable Me movies will like this game
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Every tack on this album is amazing. Definitely, good rap that finds middle ground from with the typical genres. Buying the CD came with a free rip so a win, win..
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Keeping in mind that BN is currently my favorite band, I naturally very much like this album. Like almost all BN albums, there are songs that stand out, and several that are probably best forgotten. The one thing, though, that really stands out to me is the pair of songs &#34;Somewhere over the Sea (The Moon Is Shining)&#34; and &#34;The Moon Is Shining (Somewhere over the Sea).&#34; The first is a fairly quiet, haunting melody, and the second, with essentially the same lyrics, is a more rocking song, in the general style of BN. My favorites, for whatever it's worth, are the two I just mentioned, &#34;Troika,&#34; &#34;Lady in Black,&#34; and the title song, &#34;Dancer and the Moon.&#34; Generally, I would expect any BN fan to find this album to be quite adequate, although perhaps not exceptional.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I enjoyed the book but was disappointed at the ending a little too far fetched - a little like an american tv show

006178480X|5.0|The Eye of God was a riveting read with high stakes for Sigma Force and the World.<br /><br />With great finesse that has become characteristically Rollins, The Eye ofGod, like all of the Sigma Force novels, captivates by Intertwining plots of science and history in a thriller of a ride.<br /><br />This ride takes us on an adventure to the outskirts of Mongolia, the streets of Macau and harsh lands of the Aral Desert in search for the tomb of Genghis Khan.<br /><br />Throw in the usual Sigma suspects and  two new characters Jada and Duncan, and you have a great team gearing up to save the world.<br /><br />Rollins scored brownie points with me for exploring more depth with his main Sigma Force characters. New found relationships, loss of close friends, and finally some much needed passion make this an emotional ride for Sigma and all of us along for the ride. Gray and Siechan have really developed well and I for one loved the twist or Tails at the end.<br /><br />I for one can't wait for the next Rollins and Sigma Force Novel. A year is a long time to wait for more Sigma science packed thrills; Rollins style!
B008476HBM|5.0|it gets better with age....<br />i remember i read it on my language the very first time back in 2005 after i saw the film adaption and hooked by it.<br />then i read the original version on english. what i felt is how perfectly the author used humour,romance and irony at the same time. the book is absolutely competitive among those authors who are married(such a pitty that Jane Austin didn't get married).<br />every time i read the book, i get a whole new level of understanding the book.<br />from the misunderstanding between the couples to become life partners to each other, they got through a lot, and this is what made the novel so fitting and understandable even in our time.<br />all those characters in the novel can be found in our real life, this is why  i love the book as well.<br />this book is one of my favourite book of all time, and one classic romantic stories that all women who loves to read a love story on a cosy sunday with a cup of tea or coffee.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|The general idea of this app is fantastic, and I want to love it, but it is a battery killer. I noticed that ever since I installed it my battery life has gone down dramatically. I went ahead and purchased a battery monitor and it showed it using 31% of my battery just running in the background. Of course there is no way of keeping it from running constantly without a force stop, so it is either suck it up or be out of the money and purchase a different app. I think I will hunt for a different app.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I started playing DragonVale because all of my friends had it and said it was the best game ever. I have to say, I expected more, but in all I think that this is a really good game. I don't like how pretty much every dragon costs gems though. I wouldn't have a problem with that if you did not have to buy gems. But I like how you can breed some of those dragons. I just have a suggestion, quit making things so pricey. But, all in all, this is a really fun game!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I decided to check out the show to see why my 12 year old niece insisted on getting Dr. Who paraphenelia for her birthday.  Turns out its fantastic! literally.  And that's why I love it.  Its both highly predictable and suprising.  It tugs on that part of my heart that has always wanted to be a fearless adventurer, who runs towards danger and thrives off of solving problems under pressure.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|I like this app. I enjoy the messages also the message usually are extremely on point with who are. For a free app it's great
B002DS3982|4.0|This was a great movie but the sound issue made it difficult to appreciate the movie.  The quality was more than poor.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B005I4JG80|5.0|There are some good points about the differences between French and American parenting and the differing results in the children.  I've personally used some of the &#34;methods&#34; the French use such as &#34;the pause&#34;.  A good read.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It will make you think, but not so much you get frustrated and bail on it.  Simple put its pretty enjoyable!
B0063IH60K|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Good job on this app. I really like it it is a good mind game. To keep my right mind.
B0086700CM|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B008LV8TSU|1.0|Not what I expected--thought I was getting a graphic novel, so am quite disappointed.  Maybe I'll come back to it later.
B005HSL626|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Have read this book more times than I can remember.  The story is improbable to say the least, and the narration stumbles on occasion but I am in love with The poetry of Emily's language.
B00A757EFW|1.0|My daughter downloaded this onto her Kindle Fire and uninstalled it soon after as it wasn't what she thought it would be.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Not like Angry Birds, but a very fun game. Definitely fun if you like puzzle-type games. Especially worth it since it's free!
0385349947|3.0|The book is geared towards female readers that are new to industry.  I looked for the &#34;wow, I didn't know that&#34; factor in the book, but it wasn't there.  Women in industry need to be more assertive is not a new message.  Work, life balance is not a new message.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|some of the songs skip due to some scratches on the cd. Overall good condition for a used Compact Disc
B00AF6B22E|3.0|This is one of those movies like 'Titanic' that sets a story against a backdrop and the studio ends up marketing the backdrop and not the story.<br /><br />While it is an excellent film about dependence and eventual recovery and redemption, it is NOT about a plane crash like the 30-second promo spots would have you think.<br /><br />It's the slyly deceptive marketing that made my rating three stars instead of the four stars I otherwise would've awarded the film. I also didn't care for the gratuitious sex scene that contributed nothing to the story. If you watch the movie and fast-forward past this scene you'll see it loses nothing in terms of continuity or character development.<br /><br />Other than that it's a good way to pass an evening AFTER you put the kids to bed!!!!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Like the game,but don't have Facebook, so it's a pain playing and then having to wait to play again if you fail a level.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|What about xbox items like pumpkin and  redstone dust and for pro flat land and village maker to would make it even sweeter
B003CE5CK4|3.0|Entertaining but I recall little of the movie just a couple of weeks later. Humorous in part, but also boring in part.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Intrigue, puzzles, hunts, and a demon on the loose - this game turns upside down all your expectations of tablet games.  I generally find hidden object games boring, but I played this game straight through to the end, stopping only to feed my own little minions.<br />The puzzles are complements to the storyline, not the way around.  Each scene has three or four puzzles in it, but the challenges are different, so you never end up looking for the same items more than once. In fact, this game encourages poking around the screen randomly, because you might open a secret door or uncover a hidden gem.<br />The challenges are engaging, but not impossible.  As you progress into the end, don't forget that you can zoom into scenes, because precision is needed for a few levels.<br />Well planned, well executed, and well designed game.  Recommended for anyone who likes a bit more think to their leisure.
B003SXHZF4|4.0|This movie is an awesome family movie. Though it gives the false presence that this movie is based on the novel by Jules Vernes, which it is not.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|Woman is an album offering fans of Quadron, Jessie Ware, and other equaly soulful productions something to take a gander at. Richly produced, and velvety smooth, Woman is one of this year's most sensual albums. From the opener, aptly titled \\"Open\\", to the wooing and ethereal close \\"Woman,\\" this album does not disappoint. Although many of the songs are similar in structure and sound, users will most definitely notice and appreciate minor nuances of pop, chillwave, and perhaps even rnb. Slathered in seduction, the lead singer's voice is the most standout and surprising element to this album indefinitely. Woman is as smooth as the woman's neck on the cover, and sensuous and saucy as that gracious curve.
B004LROMWU|5.0|If you like science fiction then you will love this series.  The price was great so I picked up both seasons to watch again and again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a must read.  I love historical fiction and this is one of the best epic, historical fiction novels I have come across.  The only negative is that I wish the novel would have continued.  There are so many riveting characters brilliantly intertwined by the author.  I could not put this book down.  I liked this better than &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I liked the original and think that this is a fun series to watch.  It has a good mix of drama, excitement and comedy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My friend recommended me to read it and honestly I was not sure whether to read it. I'm glade I did. It was an awesome story, sad but good.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Why would this not get 5 stars. Love Peter Jackson and the entire LOTR. Can't wait for more. Bring on the hobbitt 2 and 3
078322947X|4.0|I saw this film when it was released, and it has never lost its grip on me. A very dark drama, not for the weak of spirit. The DVD is limited to text special features, there is some interesting behind-the-scenes info there.  Worth it to me.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this product to use for work. I carry it in and out of the office every day. Its great for the laptop and any folders are files you need to carry with you. I travel (day trips) for work. Its great becasue I can fit a change of cloths for the one night I am gone in the bag alone with all my work essentials.
B001P1FZDK|5.0|I've listened to earlier Animal Collective Albums (Sung Tongs) and had trouble getting into it. I started listening to Strawberry Jam, and enjoyed it quite a bit more. I started listening to Merriweather Post Pavilion last week, and I fell in love with it. When people say that this is the most accessible album, I'd agree. There's plenty of upbeat, danceable melodies with catchy hooks and lyrics to keep one entertained after a number of listens. I've seriously listened to this album at work maybe 3 times a day for 3 or 4 days of the last week. My doctor says I might OD on this stuff, but whatever its my life.
B001RTSPVY|3.0|Its fun and whitty and good acting. But if you are expecting suspense like 24 it won't give it to you.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|It was a piece of garbage - not worth the money I paid $12.99 to amazon.com. Basically a stupid shoot-em-up frenzy of boringness, nothing new and I wish I could get my money back. At this point, the producers are trying to cash in on this movies past success and we are taken to the cleaners once again.  Thank You
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I like to play this game but no matter how many times I try to login to Facebook I can't. Therefore I have to start over every time I want to play. With no points you can't buy gifts or power ups so glad this is a free game or I'd be demanding my money back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't get enough of this game!! The fluffy unicorn banana game is the best part!! Fun for hours and hours!
B007HO392S|4.0|I bought it for the song ' I will see you again' . I was happy to find I liked several of the songs on the CD.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|It was a pleasant surprise--we didn't know what to expect as the movie started but it was very good and we liked the ending!
0062086529|5.0|The book is high quality and an easy read for parents.  We found that, unlike many others, it kept our 1 year old's attention through the whole book.  Normally it's a battle to keep him from closing the book or wandering off - not with this one!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|My opinion is that this app is wonderful and very easy to use. Also this helps me do a lot of things that I need to do.
B001F4UHEO|5.0|Seth cohen is one of the greatest tv characters of all time! Love love love this show. What else is there to say??
B005IQZB14|5.0|Really loved it.  Felt like I was living the Pacific Crest Trail with the author and was truly inspired by what she accomplished.
0345472322|3.0|It wasn't anything new.i think it's a good book for teachers who work with kids to broaden their view of students abilities!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Read all three- they are enthralling and fast reading. I always loved Archer from the days of Kane and Abel
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Have seen the play in London and twice in the states.  I love the music and the story.  I couldn't get it from the library (wait was to long) and will  plan to rent it gain.  The movie added so much background to the story.  It might my expectations and then some, but then I'm partial to this type of story.
B005HJU7HA|1.0|I have not had time to read this book so I just gave it 1 star until I have more time.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Another intense season of Dexter, but one of the best. I am looking forward to the series finale next year!
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Just finished the book. Still on settled on whether it was a worth while read. Great for fem hikers willing to explore someone else's life experience. The journey is not the trip though. Main character is the trip and her mind's journey is what you're getting.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Can't enjoy game even though I have and build up points they want  more money for chips or whatever and you have to wait 20 minutes to scratch or pay to play I am 64yrs might play  more or enjoy the game if not for the drama I wouldn't  recommend it to my friends or even my grand children.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game is ok kinds hard but that's hood if u like games that are challenging. it just gets hiring after a while.
B00BESM14U|3.0|ok, for one the kids are too perfect looking for high school. Especially the lead characters,<br />Not a zit to be found. The antagonist Charlie is slightly awkward and stifling in his movements<br />and speech. But the actor is actually 20 something not 14. A huge stretch in my book.<br />His voice should just be changing not a college sophomore. I know Chbosky likely began this<br />book from his \\"journal\\" he likely kept in high school. Dialogue very 1985. Soundtrack off in places.<br />Bust a move didnt come out till 1989. after these kids are long off to college. But I am far from<br />the target audience because I lived through the eighties, not born after them. So give it a shot<br />when its free on Netflix or the like'-)
B005HSL626|4.0|its ok I mean it is good time waster but it gets boring after a while no offense. But if your intrested get it it is worth nothing so feel free!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Add me -BJ2GJ i love love love this game please please please add me!!! I love how they made every thing more neat and organized
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game! I just wish it had music during the actual game. Otherwise, I highly recommend it for any time you want to feel like a kid again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game! Very cute, although highly addictive. Has a lot of very cute costumes. The only thing i don't like is that it's difficult to get Gru coins without having to pay money.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Because it's very interesting.<br />I loved everything about this book.<br />I would recommend to everyone because it's educational and very informative, so I recommend it to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its way to hard to earn tokens and the extra minions cost way too many tokens. it would cost tons of real money to buy tokens to get the extra minions
B0053JJLLC|3.0|Micro does a good job describing nature at an 1/2 inch level... Cruel world. The start is great (michael?) but halfway It lost speed for me and i had problems finishing it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season four.<br />I saw a,post on Facebook today with Daisy using an electric hand mixer. How times are changing in the kitchen.
B005HEGW56|4.0|Bottom Line: The first two seasons are as good as any of the Star Trek franchise. The third season is very poor, but the fourth season rebounds with the exception of the final episode. Many will be disturbed by the way that this series introduces new topics into the Star Trek timeline. However, if you can get past that issue; the first two seasons are as thought provoking as any of the Star Trek TV shows. The third season, which may have been written as an artistic response to the traumatic events of 11 Sep 2001, seem downright un-Trek-like in their content. The fourth season is pretty solid, but never reaches the quality of the first two seasons.<br /><br />Plot issues:<br /> It is exceedingly hard to do a \\"prequel\\" for a franchise like Star Trek. The \\"lore\\" and \\"background\\" of the Star Trek universe is so well established that slight deviations, the first encounter with the Klingons, the Temporal Cold War, and the discovery of the Borg almost seem like emotional betrayals to even the casual fan. However, it is what it is and I would recommend that the viewer just accept the stories at face value.<br /><br /> Third season: The whole Xendi as terrorism storyline seemed contrived and overdone. I think if Enterprise had only allowed a handful of episodes to address the 9/11 attacks vice a whole season, then it would have been much more entertaining. On a side note, I have always mocked Rodenberry's idealized take on humanity in the Star Trek universe. It was pretty sobering to see how bad the franchise could be without that as, at least, a goal that all humans strived for. Seeing the Star Trek universe give into the fear and hate that briefly consumed America after 9/11 was a bit disturbing and not in an artistically satisfying way.<br /><br />The thing I like best about Enterprise is the character development. All of the characters seem like real people with real flaws that influence their actions for both good and bad.<br /><br />CAPT Archer: He is the son of one ofthe men who perfected the Warp Drive. As such, he is somewhat of a golden child, handpicked to be the first Star Ship captain and promoted past his peers, most notably a girlfriend - his promotion destroys or at least delays the relationship until she also becomes a Star Ship captain - and his good friend, Trip, the ship's engineer. As another reviewer has pointed out, he is basically a good person but struggles with some real character issues. He is forced by circumstances to act in ways he finds morally repugnant but simultaneously realizes that he must put aside his resentment of Vulcans to succeed in his current role.<br /><br />T'Pol: She is the token Vulcan. Along with the ship's doctor, she is intended to reflect the eventual multi-species nature of Star Fleet.  After she became infected and later addicted to a neurological toxin, her emotional indulgences had a plausible storyline.  I found the storylines dealing with the correct interpretation of Vulcan philosophy to be very interesting and among some of the better episodes in the series. At some point, T'Pol permanently leaves the Vulcan High Command and becomes a permanent Star Fleet Officer.<br /><br />CDR Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker: Trip, to this reviewer, fills the role of rambunctious swashbuckler that CAPT Kirk had in the original Star Trek. Without the expectations of command, he is free to indulge in both the worst and best aspects of his personality. In many ways, Trip is a tragic character. He loses his family when Earth is attacked. His relationship with T'Pol doesn't really amount to anything. CAPT Archer's friendship grows more formal and distant as time goes by. His devotion to the Enterprise is really the only thing this smart, friendly, and generous man has going for him.<br /><br />Malcolm Reed: Something just isn't right about this guy. He strikes me as the sort of person who joined Star Fleet looking for something, not realizing that the thing he was looking for was to fill the emotional void that he, perhaps, doesn't even realize is destroying his life. A smart, competent, and competitive individual,  Malcolm focuses on his work. His inability to form close and meaningful relationships is very poignant. In one episode, the Enterprise crew meets a future version of Enterprise. Malcolm realizes that he dies alone without a wife and a child.<br /><br />Dr. Phlox: He is the ship's doctor. An alien on earth to participate in a Vulcan multi-species physician exchange program, he is recruited to be the ship's doctor by CAPT Archer since he, unlike any Star Fleet doctor, has at least seen a Klingon, albeit a deceased one. This expertise is essential for the Enterprise's first mission. His disposition, friendly nature, and genuine interest in the crew make the stories that focus on him highly enjoyable.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Perhaps I expected too much of this book - I couldn't wait to read it. But it left me feeling disappointed. I think the bottom line is that the content didn't ring true for me - although the story itself is amazing and a great read
B00A85EMVK|1.0|The video quality of the 3D version is so poor I stopped watching it after the first 10 minutes and changed to the regular blu-ray version I had bought a few years ago.  As others have mentioned, the 3D version has a really grainy look to it and the red and orange highlights are so over-saturated that they look ridiculous.  If they couldn't do a decent job of the conversion, they shouldn't have bothered.  Amazon's no return policy on opened movies is pretty much the same as any store, but I do feel I wasted my money!  Shame on you, Paramount, for such a schlocky release.
B00BPA2PEI|2.0|I would not recommend this remaster as the best looking out there.  If you have previous versions, stick with those.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is a must-have game if you have seen either of the despicable me movies. In the game you are one of the minions and you can dress up. You also defeat villains like vector and menna, an all new villain. This is my favorite game.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I really like this show. It is funny, dramatic, and a fairly believable possible future for humankind. I would have given it 5 stars if the melee choreography wasn't so laughably poor.
0399255370|2.0|i preordered this because i thought the idea was very clever. the illustrations are amazing, but the words are mean spirited. i hate to take children's books too literally as they are meant in good fun, but it was so whiny, we never even read it to our child. we donated it immediately.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Enjoy the challenge of figuring out where to go next. Good game. Keeps me busy for hours. I like it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I don't own this, but have read the specifications on it.  I thought about buying this, but until I can use it with my Amazon Prime movie streaming (and all of my music I have stored with Amazon) I wouldn't consider buying this (reason for 1 star).  In fact, I'm hoping Jeff Bezos and crew release something similar (and supports a larger range of services) in the near future.  Interesting concept, but I feel they should have supported more services right out of the gate.  I'm sure they will support more services down the road, but until then, I'm waiting to see what happens.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|A great gadget to have on the road or when bored. I use the Android version which works well with my phone. The app uses A LOT of battery life. Easy to install, use and enjoy.
B00BESM14U|2.0|I was excited for this movie because usually IMDB (Internet Movie Database) does a pretty good job of giving a somewhat accurate reflection of a movie's quality. My boyfriend and I were sorely disappointed. The only interesting/sad/realistic part of this movie was the portion where the girl leaving triggers a breakdown. The other hour and a half of this was very poor little rich kid, with a predictable plot and sub-par acting. Emma Watson fails at the emotionally injured not-a-slut-anymore; the main character has one face he uses to fully express his \\"wallflower\\"-ness; the gay character is trapped in some sad plot about covering for his macho in-the-closet boyfriend and forcing a kiss upon Charlie in his sadness. Just blah all around.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|While the music of Pink Floyd is always engaging, the authentic visual experience of their live performances are even more stunning.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of my favs! Lots of unexpected twists and cliffhangers - cant wait for next season! So glad this part of Amazon Prime!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I've seen the Jane Eyre movies numerous times. This is the first time I heard the book.  Loved it!  I definitely recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the puzzles it really made me think I got stumped a few times but was able to solve the puzzles in the end
B009U9S6FI|5.0|anyone interested in life's big meanings, and in ways to go forward with your own life, will love this. enjoy!
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Kind of a mix of War of the Worlds, Alien Mind and Stand By Me.  Not deep but highly entertaining.
B002K99P7S|5.0|Of all the comic book to movie series that have been released, X-Men is by far my favorite.  While I do enjoy all of the movies, I am preferential to the main story line (the human vs. mutant war) over the ancillary story lines (wolverine and first class).
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|Disclosure: I have not read The Hobbit, so I do not know how accurate Peter Jackson is to the source material. That said, The Hobbit movie is an utterly predictable rehashing of LOTR's most notable moments, as if Peter Jackson had simply run out of ideas and re-filmed his favorite LOTR moments: Over-long chase scenes with things crashing? Check. Gandalf showing up in the nick of time? Check (3x). The One Ring haphazardly falling onto people's fingers? Check. The good guys escaping on giant birds? Check. At least we get a dragon this time that we, um, never really get to see. While the story is needlessly long - we wait 40 minutes just for Bilbo's decision to go on an adventure - there are other points that weigh this movie down. The first is the inexplicably terrible CGI; Jackson uses it for just about everything here and it looks fake 90% of the time. It appears as though for some reason, Jackson only saw fit to make sure Gollum was done correctly (which it was, amazingly so). Similarly, the wardrobe and make-up looks fake especially where the dwarves and Gandalf's hat are concerned. Then there's the matter of the dwarf leader who was so uncharismatic his name is not worth remembering. This element truly does the movie no good since he's a major character, but wait, isn't this movie about Bilbo? In fact, Bilbo (and to a lesser extent the dwarf leader) is about the only one who undergoes any character development and it's not much far too late into the movie. The Hobbit indicates for Jackson a director that is either trying too hard or not hard enough and it's tough to tell the difference. The result is that this film is more like Gandalf's 14 than a LOTR's pre-history. I think I will skip the next installment.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Of all the comic book to movie series that have been released, X-Men is by far my favorite.  While I do enjoy all of the movies, I am preferential to the main story line (the human vs. mutant war) over the ancillary story lines (wolverine and first class).  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed or sympathized with the comic book characters.  James McAvoy was superb in this film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I haven't always been a big fan of zombie flicks, but this show has me hooked! I love the story line and the characters are believable and well-developed. Can't wait for the next season!

B00CEMH31Q|1.0|I was looking for something like they used to do.  guitar runs are at a beginner level.....vocals are weak...kept expecting something like they used to do.
B00BWI3RTA|5.0|There has not been a single Dido album that I've disliked.  I must say that I do like this album much better than the previous album.  This, to me, is what I expect when I think of listening to a Dido album.  The lyrics are somewhat lilting and retrospective, and the background soothing yet modern.
0770437400|2.0|I read the book after seeing the movie, which I thought was fantastic. The movie, however, has almost nothing in common with the book. The zombies aren't even the same, in the book, they're the stereotypical slow-moving, moaning zombies.<br /><br />Some people like the way the book is written, in a series of short stories documented as interviews. I thought it was boring and I didn't like how almost all of the stories were left unfinished. By that, I mean that with the already limited character development because of the nature of the book, you don't get any resolution for the characters that you do like.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is the first time I've ever caught myself opting for the cinematic over the book.  However, after my experience with Wheel of Time, I am reluctant to invest myself in another fantasy series before the vision is completed and the ending is written.  Therefore I decided to give the show a shot, and I am pleased.  The characters are well developed and multi-faceted.  The plot moves along nicely.  And the script didn't move too far into the corny and implausible (think True Blood season five).  I look forward to watching additional seasons of GOT.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|It's okay.  Glad I saw3 it on Prime - would have been upset if I would have spent the money to see it in the theater.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It really does do what it says worth pushing the button for cleans up externally quick seams to really work.
B004FV1ESW|5.0|Being from the Boston area, I really enjoyed this movie.  I do not like the directors cut as much as I like the original theatrical version.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|Pi was extremely intense concerning a math genius's obsession and eventual madness with finding \\"the number.\\" An odd array of characters and situations along with the main character's darkness and odd behavior makes this a movie to be sure to miss.

1451626096|4.0|I really liked this book.  It shows the struggles that take place between the cousins when they try to unite for England.  You have grief for a way of life that was lost (the Yorks), the struggle to be the type of King England needs when you don't have the training (the Tudors), the stress of building a marriage and family while trying to stay true to your parents, siblings and extended family, and the need to keep another \\"pretender\\" from taking your crown.  Some key pieces from previous books that are vital to the story are woven in nicely.  The foreshadowing to real life events and other Philippa Gregory books on the Tudors is well done.<br /><br />Does this book wrap up the Cousins' War in a nice bow - no, but I did not expect that it would.  It ends with some closure for what I think was the heart of this story - \\"the pretenders\\" and how they were dealt with.  It shows how that impacts Elizabeth and Henry and what needs to happen for them to continue to reign.  Yes, the last 10 years of Henry the VII's reign are not in this book, but if you have read other Philippa Gregory books or about this time in history, you already know where this story is going....Arthur, Catherine of Aragon and Henry the VIII
B0028IDXDS|3.0|We love the soothie pacifiers.  I was in search of a Wubbanub as soon as I realized my second child would actually take a pacifier.  I liked it for the cuteness, but was also looking for a way to keep the pacifier from popping out across the room.  I didn't realize that the pacifier doesn't actually detach from the stuffed animal.  Yes, you can handwash it, but I was hoping to be able to remove it for better sterilization purposes.  It's cute, but we tend to use the solitary pacifiers more often.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't read books. I don't like to read at all. But I couldn't put this book down. I had to keep reading and find out what happens next.
B00821PCJS|4.0|good story line, very good character development, good special effects - both seasons worth the watch.  looking forward to season three!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read several accounts of NDEs, but this is the first by a scientist, and what is more a neuro-surgeon, so it is really special and very moving.<br />Clearly and simply written this book should bring reassurance to all, and especially to anybody trying to come to terms with bereavement.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I had initially given a 1-star review for this product, since the first one I received did not work. The seller contacted me shortly after this review was made and offered to send a replacement one free of charge. The new one I received works flawlessly and I can now safely give this a 5 star review. It works as advertised, it has a solid feel to it, and it charges my iPhone 5 without any problems. I have not attempted to charge two devices simultaneously yet.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|It's definitely not what I expected. Quite surprised but I really loved this movie!  I don't want to give more details because some people may not have watched it yet. It's worth adding to your movie collection.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|We were happy to enjoy this classic in the same way as we did in 1977.  I am happy to own this because it is not available in itunes.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The extended edition of this movie offers so many new scenes.  It truly gives important information about certain characters in the movie. The omitted scenes detract from the original plot
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Tom Cruise does a great job in this film. I thought the story and the acting were very good. The special effects were not over the top, but complimented the overall story. I watched it twice this weekend.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I've watched this movie several times. Bruce Willis is fantastic, as usual. He totally fits his character in this one. Love the story line even though I'm not an action movie fan.
1608871827|5.0|I am a huge fan of this genre and needless to say when I heard of Pacific Rim's existence months ago I did all I could to agther as much spoiler material as possible. Not disappointed with what was online, I was informed of the existence of this book, whose release 2 weeks before the opening of the film, prompted me to get one last peek into the design and world Guillermo Del Toro was preparing for us.<br /><br />This is a superb &#34;making of&#34; book, perfect for any sci-fi fan who loves to get the isnide scoop on designs, artwork, set photos, actors comments and storylines for this epic film. It's beautifully put together, harback, with rich glossy paper, fabulous illustrations and informative writing. It gives the reader the background story behind the attacks, who the Kaiju are, where they're from, our repsonse and just how narrowly we escape extinction.<br /><br />All in all this I cannot remember enjoying a &#34;making of&#34; book as much as this one. Hopefully you will too.
B009D8RJR2|5.0|This one was by far the BEST!!! It had EVERYTHING Mickeys Smart/Sarcastic witty comments, a great pulse-pounding Believable story-line, a great Plot, It was the best in the series!!!! I think Hands Down, The others  were terrific with-out a doubt but this one just had it all!<br />I kept this review short and sweet not wanting to go into to much and spoil it for others. IT IS A MUST READ<br /><br />**December the 5th (&#34;The Gods Of Guilt&#34;) 5th book comes out cannot wait!
B001NA6096|3.0|I may have been to old for it, and I did the travel and meet people as you go thing. Some of Ethan Hawke's lines were typical and not that interesting.
0446556750|5.0|This was a book that hit hard, I have a friend who was working as a consultant on a case in Detroit. It's about the disaperence of a  2 yr. old little girl Biancia Jones, her father is accused of being involed in it. It's a very sad, scary, and unthinkable thing. I honestly thing it's every parents nightmare there child Kidnaped,not knowing if they are coming back..<br /><br />This book was a great follow up to the Mickey Haller/Harry Bosch series. But it was a hard thing to hear after so much going on in real life here im own backyard! I love that all of these books have a real-life, this could be real, believable story plot, I just am being a baby because I think children should NEVER BE HARMED,...<br /><br />I read alot of review and some thought Connley left out Haller's wit, but I thought he was great, him, Bosch, Maggie (Mcfrierce) McPherson were all great, like able characters and I can't wait to start the next book!!!!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This 3 disc CD really brings back old memories of a true talent who is still rockin' ! So glad I found it  on Amazon...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to listen to the bible as I go about my errands! Sometimes life is too busy, but the bible is important.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|Rutherfurd is in a class of his own. I recently read Sarum and loved it.  Just started London and find it equally as fascinating and compelling.  He truly brings the history of England alive.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love using the pulse to count my daily steps and sleep patterns. The heart monitor doesn't have any use for me. I have started to get some details about my sleep patterns and it helps me understand more about why I am so tired in the mornings somedays. I hope over time that withings will just give me sleeping recommendations. This is a great product and I love using it.
B005F3XVA8|2.0|Lame script.  Boring to us would be more for little kids. Watched once will sell then watch it again. unlike all our other movies, over and over again.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The characters started out to be interesting but the development of the story marginalized the real impact of domestic violence on our society- and while this problem exists for both male and female partners , the issue for women is greater due to the occurence against women.  The story romanticized a very serious contemporary issue.  could have been written with this social imperative in mind with the same effect... though the issue of abuse was intrinsic to the development of the characters in this story, the outcome was predictable and sadly not the outcome for many who endure such abuse. I did like the title-  try again!!
B005BCE7II|5.0|Awesome 3D !  all three ways to play: 3D. 2D and DVD  are fantastic.  No damage nor scratches.. Definately 3D makes TV watching the BEST , TV will never be the same.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|It is the movie based on my favorite television show of all time. What more can be said for it?
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I don't see how to play this game.. I don't understand what to do. I click on objects and they enlarge but then I don't see what's the next step. I put the puzzle of the horse together, then what? I'm sure I am making it harder than it is<br />Can some one help me please
1846148030|5.0|I have just finished the first part of the book, looking at how controlling fire changed the path of human evolution! How fire/bbq, started the process of digestion a little earlier...releasing more calories and nutrients for our growing brains! How gathering around the hearth for a meal spurred our social development... I'll get back to you all when I finish this book! This is the 3rd of Mr Pollan's I am reading. The first two rocked/shook/changed my world! Read this book! And, read more of Mr Pollan's books!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Excelent blu ray!, if you love this HBO series Game Of thrones, you should have this Bluray. Very good purchase!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very compelling story with attention to detail. It was almost relatable. Can't wait to read the rest of the collection.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The cast was excellent and performed up to expectations.  The premise and plot were predictable, but satisfying nonetheless.  If I were to compare it to another ensemble movie in its genre, it would be &#34;The most Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34;.
1408842432|2.0|While I think this book is awesome, I was sorely disappointed upon arrival to receive what appeared to be an advance readers copy, for which I was charged the price of a new book, not to mention that it was advertised as such. the front and back had areas cut from the cover and masked with a flat black tape. Additionally, there was no Copyright/Library of Congress Catalog page. The contents of the book were exceptional, but I'll never order from a vendor who merely uses Amazon's good name to rip people off.
B0086213XW|2.0|I chose the movie because of the actors.  They were good, but the premise of the movie, its slow pace, and lack of resolution put me off
B00007BHOE|5.0|Hands down a great tour, show, and band. You wont regret getting this dvd to add to your slipknot collection.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Amazing production just as were the first two seasons.  I laugh and cry all the way through.  Can't wait for season four!
0802798225|5.0|After I got over the initial ugly crying I was doing at the end of reading this book, I had to just smile.<br /><br />What a powerfully written, and strong piece of young adult fiction. Yes, it was another story about the love of a good woman saves the bad boy.<br /><br />But was Alex really a bad boy?<br /><br />At the heart of it he was only doing what he felt was going to be saving his family from being killed. Deep down he wanted a real future with real possibilities. Every inch of this story was laced in good writing, strong story-line, and great character development and evolution. The characters weren't stuck in some desperate pattern of self loathing--nope they worked to be better people. I think that is missing a lot in the young adult reading genre. People latch onto the whole, \\"Teenagers are just know it all whiners.\\"<br /><br />Are they?<br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />However, not all are like that, and if something great enough happens to them, and if people take notice to potential they become better people.<br /><br />I was moved by the love story, I was sucked in to what was going to happen. I think I have casted this as a movie in my head. I am so hoping that this might become a movie. It is so great.<br /><br />Do happy endings happen in real life?<br /><br />Do the bad guys sometimes win?<br /><br />Yes and yes.<br /><br />However, there was tragedy wrapped up with the happy ending this book had. Not everyone survived the violence this book was trying to get across--but it also opened eyes, and created new doors to make the place where this book took place, possibly change.<br /><br />*I own a paperback copy of this book I purchased from the Friends of the Library book store.*
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Loved the scenery, adored the cast, and thought it was a good story and message to young people.  I would recommend to anyone.  I had read the book and enjoyed.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out. I don't typically like these types but it was great!
B003B30JHM|5.0|my husbnd collects everything woodstock. has this in other formats, but still loved it when i gave it to him as a present
1609611543|3.0|This diet would be absolutely impossible to follow and live a normal life.  Lots of information packed into a lot of planning and doing to make this work.
B004132I20|5.0|This is the best Sherlock adaptation of all time. Cumberbatch and Freeman are perfect for these roles. Special effects are top notch. This is just a great show and Blue Ray makes it better.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I couldn't believe that some of my younger grandchildren had never seen &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; so i decided to get it and now it is one of their favorites, too!  it came in mint condition and in a very timely manner!
B00DURILJ2|4.0|this movie reminded me of the movie \\"stand by me\\". It was entertaining and touching. it held my interest all the way to the end, which I can't say for a lot of movies.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent! Suspenseful, entertaining, interesting characters, and, David Tennant using his real accent -- fantastic! Can't wait for the next episode.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|This CD is no doubt Demi Lovato's best work yet. It completely brings to light her past, present emotions and struggles within her life.<br /><br />I'm sure we've all heard \\"Heart Attack\\" on the radio. The refreshing acoustic guitar and amazing vocals make this a one-of-a-kind single.<br />\\"Made in the USA\\" has recently aired on the radio, and is a wonderful way to describe how her love will never break, because it was made with good stuff. Wonderful beat.<br />\\"Without the Love\\" is a happy song with great lyrics. It's full of heart and and Demi's pleasant voice makes this a pleasant listen.<br />\\"Neon Lights\\" is my least favorite on the album, but most definitely for people who highly appreciate dance music.<br />One of my favorites on the album, \\"Two Pieces\\" should be a single on the radio. Great vocals, great words, basically a ten out of ten song.<br />\\"Nightingale\\" is my favorite. With the words and her ever-soaring voice, be prepared to have chills.<br />\\"In Case\\" is a soft song with a piano soloist in the background. Beautiful words, beautiful voice.<br />\\"Really Don't Care\\" features Cher Lloyd's lively rap. Demi's spunk really shows in this song. A great one to dance to. Almost can never sit still.<br />\\"Fire Starter\\" is another good one for people who like dance music. Another great songs that really makes me move.<br />\\"Something That We're Not\\" is one of my favorites as well. It is a very funny song that kind of reflects Demi's old rock music that she had on \\"Don't Forget\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\". Great vocals, as always.<br />\\"Never Been Hurt\\" is great for dancing. The drums, instrumentation, and of course, Demi's amazing voice make this a top-notch song.<br />\\"Shouldn't Come Back\\" is a soft autobiographical song. Just when you think Demi couldn't go any higher, she tops that.<br />And lastly, \\"Warrior\\" is the song that you will need tissues for. Along with the beautiful piano, this is a heartfelt song that shows all of Demi's feelings. Completely emotional and full of heart.<br /><br />And so, to this CD I give a ten out of ten rating. Buyers will not be disappointed and all the Lovatics out there will get an album like no other. Definitely her best work yet.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything to keep me up and going with a crew that works according to the weather. Thanks for making my life easier
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I sing along with this CD daily!  The movie was just fun and so is the soundtrack; I even bought the second cd!
B00723NWJE|5.0|ok. it really wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be, but still glad that I got it.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|for some reason the youtube was not loading directly on my kindle so was searching for an alternative means... this app hangs pretty often; the search itself is not very useful and overall didn't like it
B007MAETA8|5.0|ok. it really wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be, but still glad that I got it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing! You get to change layers, switch scenes, and change characters! This is a super fun game and I think you should try it! In the beginning, you get to see a video of, Minion of the Year, and then you get be in battles and you get to run to get the trophy for Minion of the Year! Trust me, you should definitely should get this app. GET IT NOW! :)
B006OAB3ME|5.0|ok. it really wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be, but still glad that I got it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST GAME EVER FOR MY KINDLE FIRE HD. I LOVE THIS GAME AND SO DOES MY LITTLE SISTER. I LOVE IT!!!!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the struggle to choose when love is involved* I can't wait to see how this ends!!!
1400069807|5.0|Anyone who cares at all for their own wellbeing or that of their family should read this book. We all have the right to know what these food and beverage giants are putting into the products that we can then choose to buy or stay well away from. Get it. Read it. Live a healthier and happier life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game it is the best. The only thing  I want to know is what the coming soon name is.
B00CW665VI|4.0|It was a nice change of  pace, to read a romance from the man's point of view.  The author must have gained insight from a male lover.  The book was a 5 stars until near the end, when it got a little too silly.  Though, the story did get back on track.
0553386794|5.0|I have just started reading &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;. So far, it has my attention. I am reading this as a book club assignment.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This edition has no Online multiplayer. The one thing except challenge that  is interesting and they took it away.I&acute;m really disappointed.....
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded and have really enjoyed. Do not like all the advertisements that keep popping up but have enjoyed the game.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its very useful over all specially<br /><br />To get to<br />Know a very good people all over t globe<br />And family
B005NFJAT4|5.0|And Jeff Daniels lives in the next town.  He was superb in this movie.  I am going to bed, thank you very much. I had no idea you were going to review this stuff.  Don't you people ever sleep.  Good nite
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|It wasn t the best movie ive ever seen but enough twists and personality to keep you watching...som many movies are released that I can se why they don't make big box office cash....but well worth taking a look at and this is one of them !
B001VNB54A|5.0|I was able to DVR the original HBO production and then copy them on a number of  VHS Tapes.  I now have a very large Samson HD LED TV set and am sure the sound and picture will be greatly improved on these  Blue Rays DVD's.  The Pacific Theater was so different from Europe.  I had a hugh crush on Sledge and bought every book he wrote.  He died on almost the same date as my husband.  I lived through those years and know how it affected many of the women during those war years.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app and used it every day.  Then came the dreaded update. Now it sucks. Not intuitive at all anymore.  I can't find the forecasts. I can't even figure out what day it's reporting on. Lots of big pictures though for people who can't read.  Wish I had the option to roll back the update.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kitchen House was by far the best novel I have read in a really long time.I would recommend it for book club reading.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|This movie was better than I expected nice story part adventure/mystery part romance.  Filmed in Southport NC so has a nice remote small town by the sea feel. Definitely recommend.
068485743X|4.0|The author, a former editor and agent, approaches the subject of fiction writing from a somewhat different perspective than the other two dozen or so books I've read on the subject. He states that while the \\"art\\" of fiction writing cannot be taught (we're not all Stephen King or Tom Clancy) the \\"craft\\" can. He proceeds to give explanations of the chief reasons manuscripts are rejected by publishers and how to avoid or cure these mistakes. He also provides some sobering stories and statistics on just how capricious the publishing industry can be in rejecting manuscripts. In essence, it is a primer on what to avoid in your writing and how to do so. Very readable, loaded with practical suggestions and well worth the price.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Great read, looking forward to many more of his novels.  \\"Fragile Things\\" is next on the growing book list to delve into.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This was a great series through season 4.  Season 5 is still better than most other stuff out there too.  Acting is top notch for the most part...maybe Jax overdoes it just a bit sometimes.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|I gave this movie as a gift so I don't feel like I can give a valid review at this time.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|super good movie. if you have a brother, tell him to watch it too. 6 more words required required required
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is great - appropriate for any age group, funny, and we'll watch this one over and over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best it could be and I think it's an amazing app. if you like games like: temple run and angry gran,then it's the perfect app for you! If you would like an improvement for this game then download: despicable me 1 minion run! It's the best running game out of all of them! Really cool. Subway surf is recommended by me for all ages!!!!
B000002HO3|5.0|Great CD. The music is so nice and mellow. He has such a soulfu voice. I love his version of Angel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is very different from anything I would have expected it to be. It's a book that once you start you just can't put down!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The most perfectly producted TV series ever produced. The casting director, writers and producers have the key to success embedded in their bones. No other show will ever produce &#34;the want for more&#34; or &#34;can't get enough&#34; feelings that the audience feels. It is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Usually the plot suffers when you have such things as &#34;zombies&#34; in the picture but the plot is awesome. Everyone at one point in their life feels the emotion of survival....this show just makes it real enough to consider, how would you act. There are no words to describe the greatness of this show.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|watch is a little smaller then I espected but still it's beautiful and still Seiko :)<br />Good brand<br />Nice watch!<br /><br />Thanks!
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie was ok could have been better, I found myself screaming that's not how it was in the book a lot
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Feel asleep watching this twice.  Interesting story.  Played out poorly with no pacing.  TC is no Tom Hanks.  He can't carry a movie with limited Dialogue.  He's not the problem, but can't save this film.
B007HO392S|5.0|I'm not the world's biggest country as I'm still getting my feet wet with it, but this album is one of the best I've heard to date (in country and just about every other genre). I purchased the album based on hearing a little tiny bit of the song \\"See You Again\\" on the radio and was very, very impressed with not only that song, but just about every other one. I really like the whole album a lot.<br /><br />My original feelings for the song were along the lines of \\"I like one song and at the price it doesn't matter if I like the rest or not.\\" I am truly happy I went in with that frame of mind. If you're on the fence about the album after hearing maybe one or two songs, play all the samples a few times each and just listen. I didn't even have to do that to discover that the whole album was well worth the price. The total was under ten dollars with Prime shipping from Amazon.com, and best of all, it included the digital download for free. There's simply no beating Amazon. Ever.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that you kind of have to let it sink in. Try the samples at least twice: once for the beats and again for the lyrics. I'm certainly glad I bought this album because she's a great singer and I really love supporting original, talented artists.<br /><br />Update: I forgot to mention that the album is the perfect balance of pop and country. It has the easy-listening qualities of country that relax and just enough upbeat songs to make it great for things like working out or just a kick-back-kind-of-day playlist.
B00A27X972|4.0|It's weird.  I haven't finished reading it.  Maybe I'll have time to finish it this week.  I don't have any more words.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Excellent compilation of tracks that borrow the Pet Shop Boys old sound and meld it with a new and current sound.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It was a good show. Just too typical and predictable and a photo copy of the previous 4 movies, decent though.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Thanks.... I love it. It is very well made and the color is great. I really love it!!! All I can say is perfect!!!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|A bit disappointing.  I have read and watched most OZ  adventures and this barely kept me awake.  It seemed questionable as who was representative of which character.  I like different but this was just dumb.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Have a 13 & 16 year old teenagers who cannot get enough of it.<br />We are watching it all over again ourselves and enjoying all over again.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I will say that this book requires a fair amount of attention to detail and an ability to &#34;connect the dots&#34;, but Michael Lewis has an amazing talent in communicating very complicated and complex concepts in an understandable manner. As one whose financial circumstances suffered during 2008-2009 (and fortunately has somewhat recovered), I found the sequencing of events mind-boggling and the concept of a &#34;house of card&#34; immediately jumped into my head. Without trying to be cryptic, I unequivocally recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest or curiosity surrounding the financial downturn of 2008...more importantly, this book is an admonition to us all-&#34;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is&#34;.<br />Enjoy your reading
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wish there were more books after this one!!!!!!! Loved all of the fifty shades trilogy. I would recommend this book to ANY woman or MAN!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the convenience of streaming straight to the xbox. Love this show and love being able to watch before the DVD comes out
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a ok game to play but then you have to pay real money to play other levels. It is a fun game if you like to find the differences. I would not recomend for young children because the graphics are scary.
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|What a fun build!<br />Excellent for kids and adults!<br />Not time consuming but it takes enough time to build to enjoy it and get your money's worth<br /><br />This set is huge! I love it!  This set does have a lot of pieces and two seperate instruction booklets (make sure to pay attention!!  you can forget pieces if you dont).  However! There is a catch (and an excellent move on Lego).  They have you build the set in modules (i.e. building the cockpit and then switching to say building the bottom portion for example)  It makes for excellent starting and stopping points and also for team/family/or sibling builds.<br /><br />The bags are numbered for ease as well. The set also comes with multiple figures.  The set seemed to be durable for kids play.  Throughout the build you were reinforcing what you were building.  I'm sure however if you drop it just right you could snap off the wings.<br /><br />There are many moving parts and little cubbies and hidey holes to arouse the imagination of children and those young at heart. There is even a carrying handle that you build into the ship!!  There are \\"missiles\\" that can be \\"launched\\" so that could be cause for concern for tiny injury or being sucked up by the vacuum.<br /><br />Well worth the money!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun to play when you want to pass the time. It is good for all ages and easy to play. It reminds me of the game Super Mario brothers. The graphics are clear and easy to see. Fun game overall.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Won't run on my older PS3 (and apparently some other players). Get a couple \\"Universal\\" splashs, and then it freeze's. Did a little research and apparently it relates to some Internet connections it's trying to do on some players. Don't pick this up, unless you want ot mess up your settings on your machine. In about 5 yrs, this is the first Blu-Ray that has been a problem for me. I returned it... perhaps someday they will produce it without this issue.<br /><br />I will now be leary of any \\"Universal\\" produced Blu-Ray.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is ok I can only play it for 5 mins then I am board. It kind of remindes me of angry birds so if you like angry birds then you will love this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played it was challenging yet fun at the same time can't wait for more levels to come out!!!!!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you like urban fantasy, and just want to be entertained, this is a good series.  The story moves along quickly and there is plenty of action without getting bogged down with pages of teen angst.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This game is quick and challenging to play.<br />It works like tetris but in a better way.<br />I highly recommend it.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Like all James Bond movies it's paced with action, thrills and good vs. evil. Daniel Craig will go down as one of the best James Bonds. He is truly believable as this character. Maybe the toughest, slickest Bond since Connery.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The best game for bronies and pegasisters. I just love this game its awesome and I am a barony. buy it buy it buy it buy it. uh....wait.... download it download it download it download it.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|He may not have the youth to be an every day action hero but this film was perfect for him if you can handle an Austrian accent on a US Border Town lawman! You would think after all these years he would learn to cover his accent for a role.
B0012CH350|4.0|This cover is higher in quality versus the previous Weber covers I have owned.<br /><br />High quality product at a good price.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Honestly, its pretty fun. Something tells me this app is marketed towards girls. It's a good game, its a thinker. But if your not a fan of emotes or the color pink, not the app for you.
B000002H5I|5.0|One of the best performances (if not the best) by Tracy Chapman. Her voice in some of the songs is almost breathtaking. This is a 90's classic.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is the last version of the Nintendo GameCube control released to be used with the Wii.<br />It will not be available for much longer as the product is not being produced anymore.<br /><br />The cable is longer than the GC version and the build quality feels better than the original purple controller.<br />If you need one to keep playing GC games, buy it before stocks run out!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|My god!  This series is an incredible portrait of courage and grace and messiness.  Can't wait to see the next seaso n.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The first GI Joe movie was so forgettable that I sometimes question whether or not I even saw it. But I did see it, it just wasn't worth remembering.<br /><br />Not the case here. Sure, this is no Academy Award pick, but it's a solid crossover movie, realistic enough to be enjoyed by action film lovers, but staying true to the old cartoons for those of us who grew up watching them -- and especially the SnakeEyes-Stormshadow subplot, which was always a favorite among GI Joe fans.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This utility is very simple and easy to use.  Simply open it up and it does the work for you!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It really helped me break the plateau was on for awhile.  It help tone and lose weight. I would highly recommend this DVD!
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Good twist and turns in this movie<br />Rooney Mara, Jude Law and Catherine Zeta-Jones did a great job.<br />I recommend it.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I actually was on the streets in an earlier part of my life and can Totally!! relate to to James.  I only wish that I had found a cat.  He's lucky.  I hope he REALLY knows how lucky he was to find Bob.  This is the most touching and uplifting book I've read in a LONG time.  It makes me want to run out and get myself a ginger cat!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE cats, and if you are a cat lover, this is the book for you.  You'll really learn to have a true appreciation of your feline buddy, friend, baby...
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a top notch app with the great graphics  and a great gaming. I have thoroughly enjoyed it. everyday
0062255657|5.0|I picked this book up yesterday and read until 2am, finishing it, and immediately gave it to my 19 year old to read.  Devastating, awe-inspiring, amazing.  I haven't had a book grab me like this in a long time, I had to see it through to the end.  Fortunately, it is not a terribly long book so it let me have some sleep.<br /><br />It seems odd to say, but I think that this short novel is wonderful the way it is.  Usually I would want something so well-written to continue but this story feels complete in it's incompleteness.  There are many unanswered questions, many threads left loose, but it all feels right and seems to fit this story.  I will be thinking about this tale for a long time to come and I know I will be rereading it, passing it along and giving it out as a gift to those I love who haven't read it.<br /><br />An absolute must for fans of Neil Gaiman and a great introduction for any who haven't read him yet.  Haunting.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is much better than diner dash you do a little bit of everything and there is a storyline too!! Very addictive!
B002FOQY2M|5.0|These guys have a tremendously inviting message to us.  Their themes are simple but, by that, are intriguing as well.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|There's no action in this film which will limit its audience.  It's a bit of a chick flick although it could trigger some excellent conversations among open-minded people, young and old.  It's a good follow-up to Before Sunrise.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I like enthusiasm in music.  This team seems to taunt us to &#34;carry on&#34;, and placing 'one foot' to start off or restart.
B00DJXSKWU|3.0|So you have to play the game fully flat because it just flips the screen down. Overall the game is fun but the dang screen invert ruins the whole game. If they fixed that one feature the game would really be lots of fun.<br /><br />I have to give 3 stars since it requires you to play it like spider man hanging from a ceiling upside down.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Had the elements of good satire and was relatively funny in parts. Some of the observations were close to the truth
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one game that will keep you busy for hours and coming back for more.  With so many levels and features, you never get tired of this game.  Can't wait for Plants vs. Zombies 2.  If they make one, I'll be one of the first to buy it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am so glad they have an app for Android.  I like it and use it all the time switching from my Kindle to my phone.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It streams well and gives you the uprade to pro feature if the need arise. I recommend this to any who have doubts.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|At least this one avoided the 10 minute explosive-laying montage from the first, but replaced it with several montages of good spray bullets, bad guys spray bullets, bad guys die, good guys say \\"I'm out of bullets\\".<br /><br />A few nice martial arts moves from Jason, some fun dialogue, and a nice Chuck Norris cameo, but the core concept (though clearly profitable) just doesn't work as a movie: Tough guy movies work because the tough guy is tougher and saves the day. In this movie everyone is tough, so it's all just kinda dull.<br /><br />One highlight: putting Stallone next to all the other action stars really makes him seem like a good actor.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|I like the  movie. Purchased on instant video so not much to say. We watched instantly and had a good time
B00CWY76CC|3.0|ok game but not enough free levels. got through first ten levels fairly quickly though they were each fun and challenging
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have had the previous model of the Voyager and the only thing about this one although improved is the lack of direct mini usb. Now I have change the way I charge. It has a magnetic adapter that you have to carry around and if you lose it you're in trouble. No conventional way to charge. All that said it is a good bluetooth set. Much improved and with this case I am able to charge with its internal battery leaving the cord at home. I would buy from this seller again. Delivery was prompt and on time and in good condition.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great read, just so many people and clans!!!  But it is great to get to know all of them enjoyed it
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This was cool in 3D. Obviously, this was not shot in 3D but some of the battle scence really leaded themselves to conversion to 3D.
B000OP1M6M|4.0|I had bought this watch style as a Xmas for my dad about 15 years ago - it recently broke and I decided to get the same style for Xmas 2012. The watch arrived quickly, was well packaged to protect contents and even included the Seiko gift box. The only issue I had with this watch is that it took a l o n g time to charge correctly. For months, my dad would remove the watch at bedtime and by morning the watch had stopped running. BEWARE: the gadget that automatically winds this particular watch costs almost $200. My dad ended up just wearing the watch to bed to ensure it would self-wind . After a few weeks, it was finally charged enough that when he removed the watch at bedtime, it remained running in the morning.
B00B769XB8|5.0|As one would expect, there is lots of blood and gore. Good action and 3D effects so it was well worth the purchase. Looking forward to a sequel.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Lots of fun, get it and join the Uno party<br />Only bummer is loving it as much you run out of coins ~.^
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|I had heard bad reviews of this movie. I was plesantly surprised. Lots of good 3D effects. I like where they took the story. Hopefully they can work in a sequel.
B0025WX2YW|1.0|Throw history out the window and replace it with sex... overly dramatic dialogue... and more sex. Aside from that it sucked.
B0090SI460|5.0|This was another cool conversion into 3D. Great movie in 2D and even better in 3D. Certian scenes are particularly enhanced in 3D.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I chose this exercise DVD because I needed something that I could do at home and still watch my 5 month old.  It's a short video, only 30 minutes, but it is intense! Jillian Michaels is hardcore and doesn't let up for the entire video.  There are no breaks! I'm on day 5 and I feel every muscle in my body!  So far this has been a great at home workout video!
B00B4804KS|5.0|This was excellent in 3D and they did a good job in converting the moive to 3D for a movie that was not originally shot in 3D.
B008KHG2K2|5.0|This action figure is one of the best items I have ever purchased and it is 100% how it is advertised.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Very good, fast and easier to use than the web app that came with my cheap Stealth Pro  9.7 tablet.  Finnally I can surf the net without sinking in the deep water of the internet!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Thank you piper for writing this! Your book was witty, yet you didn't sugar coat and it opened my eyes to the way the female prisoners are treated.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game, customizable background and cards. Auto finish, and other convenient features. Between every game though, there are ads for other games that you have to skip...
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This film was very fun to watch, it catches you and brings you in on the action!<br /><br />Funny, decent story-line, great actors and actresses, and a decent amount of action!<br /><br />A group of retired agents on the loose, who would've thought that older folks can do what these R.E.D. folks can do...<br /><br />~ Willie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Class, class,  class! Shakespeare would be proud of what his fellow countrymen have produced. Deep characters, spectacular sets and costumes, brilliant acting. Magnificent series; I can't wait for season 4 to begin!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is very addicting! The variety of games is great, but a few tend to feel the same, just different looks. Enjoying making coins to open different games. Worth your time!
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|My husband loves zombie anything, and I can't stand them, but we both enjoyed Warm Bodies. I plan to buy it on DVD.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was hesitant at first, as I am with all free games, but this is a very fun game that makes you use your head. Glad I picked it up.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Maeve Binchy - God rest her soul - has once again created the kind of characters and situations that we ordinary folk can relate to.
B009346RSS|5.0|I use it to connect my PS3 and/or my xbox to my old stereo amplifier. I am in no way a hifi expert but to my ears it sounds good. I love the that it's small and handy, which makes it easy to hide. The power from usb is also neat. It's currently getting power from my xbox, which frees up a socket.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|When it comes to submarine movies this one is third on my all time list... the first being Crimson Tide and the second being Hunt for Red October... only fault with this movie is that its a 3 hour subtitled movie... may as well be reading a book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is not much to hate here. The writing, the acting, the cinematography and the production are all the highest level. There is no compromising here. Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is simply the best book I've read all year. Wonderful story. I cannot wait to read more of Hosseini's books.
B00E193TM2|5.0|By Far One Of The Best Albums Of 2013. This Is The First Album Of Theirs Have Bought And It Is Absolutely Amazing. There Isn't A Bad Song On The Album. I Can't Wait For Volume 2.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Does the job, very pleased. Some report it hard to rotate but I like that feature as it prevents it from slipping. Overall, good value for the price!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this Tablet...large screen quick down loads...easy to handle and sharp colors...great price, it would be a great gift!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to read the next books in this series.  Sylvia writes well. She develops the story with a lot of  thought and detail. There are excellent sex scenes but they are interwoven with the story to make them believable. Eva's love for Gideon is developing and she is coming to terms with her past. Next we are going to find out more about Gideon's past and see him come to terms with it. I can't wait!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|very easy to work with does not interfere with the other apps on phone very happy with the way it works
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a book like no other. I own it in 2 forms, hardback and Kindle. I cannot stop reading it and if my Kindle weren't dead I would be read it and all the other books I give 5 star reviews.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I love this movie. Had purchased it once at a regular retail store, but my original copy &#34;grew legs.&#34;<br /><br />Arrived as stated, no issues, fast delivery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love game<br />Best game ever . I hope the updates are better. Also I hope that this game turn into much for the better
B00CF34B2I|5.0|i picked this up on my pc first to learn the game, i quickly purchased mtgo once i got familiar with the rules. so then i purchased this on my kindle so i can get my fix on the go. works perfectly, i just wish my screen was bigger!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have this app on my android device (Google Play.) and it's one of the BEST picture editing apps out there. I currently have a Kindle Fire but this app is not compatible for it. So please consider making picsart available for Kindle Fire users. I would much prefer if I can edit my pictures on my tablet than my phone which is smaller.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Far from art house, but right in the zone for mixed audiences.  The actors appeared to have as much fun making the movie as we had watching it.  Nothing serious here, just crazy silly fun that left big smiles and a yearn for more.  Which is good since the sequel is already out.  Saturday night popcorn movie with no redeeming message, just good entertainment with lots of bang bang and silly antics wrapped nicely in some great, and some not so great actors.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Ive seen this movie a thousand times and i was so happy that it was on here! i loved it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great and unexpected. I have not read a book this enthralling in years. The first half gives you a fairy tail style romance while the second half just comes out of no where and hits you with a twist.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This form of solitaire is alot more intense than the standard version to say the least,play it for hours at a time
B009YN2M7S|5.0|loved it.  kept me completely on the edge.  wanted it to continue.  gates that it ended to soon.  looking for more
B0034G4P94|5.0|i love the movie, from start to finish. the story is amazing and the fight scenes are even better. j
B00E193TM2|5.0|Buy it. Listen. Rate it for yourself. I give it 5 Stars. If there was ever a time to back away, now is that f:/< > time.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Is a great interface to start recording and producing. It has outputs for studio monitors. It is really easy to install and use.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a fun addicting app that I love as well as my kids. it had some issues after the update, but it seems to run better now.
1781162646|4.0|A coming of age story of young Devin Jones.  He hires on at an amusement park for the summer hoping to mend his broken heart after losing the love of his life.  What follows is a ghost story, a murder mystery and several interesting characters.  SK goes into a lot of detail describing carny talk that I didn't find particularly interesting, but that is my only complaint.  This story becomes almost unbearably tense toward the end and I was sorely tempted to peek a few pages ahead to relieve the suspense and that is my personal indicator of a very good story.
B00ABA1OP4|4.0|I bought the blu-ray version of this set when it first came out (and was like $20 more than it is now).  Anyway, I wasn't disappointed at all.<br /><br />This disc has all their videos...even the newest ones.  And there's behind the scenes/making of selections for each video.  I even managed to watch all of those, thanks to the subtitles.  It's interesting to get to hear from the band...because they kind of fly under the radar.<br /><br />Rammstein makes the best videos...and they are the best live show you will ever see!
B004QSQMKE|1.0|As a huge fan of Ridley Scott, and a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi, I expected a decent movie here.  Wrong.  Very wrong.  This may actually be the worst movie I've ever sat through.  And the only reason I sat through the whole thing was... I kept thinking, maybe something will happen that will make it worth the suffering so far.  But nope.<br /><br />Casting is lousy, acting horrendous, script laughable, storyline...you must be kidding?  Effects and costumes so bad they are embarrassing.<br /><br />I realize this movie is a few years old, and so maybe a slightly different standard should apply.  Maybe.  But Blade Runner and Alien are older, and were both awesome.  How could a director of the stature of Scott stoop this low?<br /><br />I'm stunned.  What a piece of garbage.
B00AEFXXMI|4.0|have'nt open it yet but seen the movie 3/4 times but I'm sure if u've ever seen it u'd like to add 2 u're movies to keep
B00003CXA2|5.0|I think that Tom Hanks can put this film at his top 5 best. It will always be in my top 5 favorite films forever. No matter how many times I watch it, it will always make me cry gallons of tears.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The book was excellent! I cannot wait for the third one to come out. It is very well written and a great story line.
B000094P4U|5.0|This soundtrack will go down in history along with other Ennio Morricone works as classical music of the 20th century.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rules you can make portals to the nether you can find coal iron gold and diamond you can make tools with those materials its fun
B00002Z88D|4.0|arrived on time & in great condition<br />I think I was expecting more of the classical orchestral sounds to come through (but that was just my foggy memory) but it still TOTALLY ROCKED!!!<br />If you're not a hard rock/metal fan, even with the orchestra, this may not be for you.<br />If you still want to bang your head and get in touch with your old hair band-head thrashin'-slam dancin' self, this works almost as well as other Metallica CDs.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|The movie came on time. Its an older movie, much different when you see it years later. still an ok movie
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Love it! Couldn't stop playing. Normally I don't play any games, but this one grabbed me. My family hates it cuz they prefer dinner made.<br />Pam
B001LMO1CE|5.0|This is the song had me discover the group COLDPLAY. I like most of their songs but this one is one of my favorite!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true American hero! I knew about Chris before reading this, and after his tragic death, I had to get it. I don't regret it, and he provides a great insight into things bigger than himself.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is an amazing calculator. I use it all the time now. I got it thinking my kids could use it and i love it so much I'm making them get thier own!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|I just downloaded this album and it's another one of Bowies masterpieces.  His lyrics are full of metaphysical/occult symbolism (some songs, not all), which is something that is constant in his albums over the past 40 or so years, and probably the main reason I own everything he's ever recorded.  He's a genius!<br /><br />I hope we don't have to wait as long for his next project!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy facebook  very much. It's very informative and you get to connect with family and friends you may have<br />lost being in touch with previous co workers. Lots of different ideas, opinions, and receipe s.
0345803493|5.0|The story is moving and exciting.  I like her style of writing and her love scenes are beyond...  It is a book for people who enjoy a well written book with extras.  Most novels classified as &#34;romance&#34; are boring with a predictable ending.  Although the story ends well, one cannot consider it ended for real.  Example, What happens as they get older?????  Children change the scenario.  They grow up to be who they are.  Ana's life will remain in that circle of family, but Christian lives a life outside that circle.  Like a Venn diagram what will his world contain that she will never know?
0062215507|5.0|Boought this book for my son for his birthday.  He loved it.  I think it's a very collectable Harry Potter item.  Something that will be treasured for years.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Very clever game. Only needs some sort of hint for the harder levels but its a good mind motivating game
B00AXIZ5WC|5.0|This book is a good read I highly recommended for new CP's hobbyist that are new comers and seasoned CP's (Carnivorous Plants) growers.<br /><br />This book that Peter D'Amato wrote have whole of information about these strange and unusual that seem like the CP's are from outer space. It tells also when he was a kid that he got a venus flytrap and ending up killing the venus flytrap, not until one his friends showed Peter where they grow was in West Virginia. Nice little story where he wrote about different movies like Little Shop of Horrors, invasion of the body snatchers, etc.<br /><br />It gives great tips on how and where you grow CP's outside in bogs, or indoors right next too a sunny windowsill where I got my CP's growing using the tray method. Watering is rain water or distilled water.<br /><br />It is very informative in growing and propagate seeds and through leaf or root cuttings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|First my friend showed me the pc version but I bought this one.<br />I also have the pc and xbox version of minecraft. Minecraft is AWESOME!!!
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I was looking for an inexpensive case for my Kindle Fire and found this one. It fits perfectly, doesn't add much additional weight and keeps my Kindle safe when it's in my bag. I don't use the stand function but I'm sure it's fine. I recommend this product.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Really love this book. The writing is easy to follow, the plot line keeps you interested. This is also a book that my kids love and one we can all read over and over again. I love the characters in the book, our favorite has got to be Bigwig.
B000002LBH|5.0|hands down this is the best album The Smiths have ever done.if you love the Smiths you definitely need this album it  it is a all-time classic
B008M34INW|5.0|The character Mel plays is silent bad case, great on the narration , and no Slow up in the action, one to see,and or own. Go Mel, loved it...
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I am from an Anne Rice beginning of reading of fantasy fiction romance,  and thought it could not be topped, from the few books I read.  Never read the twilight series.  I have lately only read the more modern and historical romance books... Which you have to wait for a somewhat final after 3 books.  Dabbled in a vampire book.. Then tried this based on reviews...  Here is my review...  Had a hard time at the start, names and terms of the types of of characters and all the net, I could not identify with, actually would of stopped reading if wasn't for the reviews and price I paid.  Plowed thru and was surprised of how it slowly came together... Then it went full blast.. Could not stop thinking about the underlining politics and the romance that I want to survive.  At first I couldn't visualize the landscape, I had to make my own landscape with clues from the author, which in the end made a more personal to my thoughts.  It was nice to read something that made me think and cheer for hope and love.. And to have an ending not making you say wtf but still see more to come.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|This was fun to watch even though I knew how the ending would go. Probably not the best movie for youngsters to see though.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I've seen a lot of scyfy but this will be one of those that will stand out for many years.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This has to be one of my favorite remakes of an old fairy tale. Good action and great cgi but not overboard.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I have mixed emotions regarding this movie, not because of the plot or the actors but the unfortunate way in which the &#34;Evil Witch&#34; came to be.<br />This is probably a bit much for young kids because it does have some violence and scenes that a young mind is not ready to see let alone understand.<br />I would recommend this movie highly.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I dont under stand the game. Can someone please tell me what to do in level 1. I fixed the horse but idk what to do besides that
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia's books and stories are always amazing! I have read this book twice now and use her tips and advice almost daily.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Many different activities. Looking forward to more completion's and chances to earn gems. Keep up good work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am a pastor and now have access to my Bible wherever I go. Since I live in a rural are and do not always have a reliable Internet connection I just made sure that I have a usable version downloaded to my phone. Very useful.
B009R659L8|5.0|One of her best works in years. Grabs you from the start and keeps you in suspense until the last.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I saw a review of this book on The Doctors. It is exactly as promised, and I have had good luck with weight loss using the information contained in this product.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Easy to put on and use, and does a great job of protecting the kindle.  Wished it had come in yellow, since I'm  Steeler Fan
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This was a very fun game to play, like 100 floors, but there aren't enough floors to play, you quickly come to the end.
B008602KQI|3.0|Why waste so much time creating a movie based upon entertainment by murder or genocide?<br />Why have a society based upon killing the innocent or human sacrifice?  Similar societies of the<br />past do not exist today and the people are spending an eternity in Hell!!!<br />Wake up people as these arts reflect the downfall of present society in the USA and the world<br />which is moving quickly toward a similar primitive culture as shown it this movie, so maybe this<br />movie can serve as a very important warning to all!!!
B004P68T30|5.0|Love the choices on how to read. Read yourself. Can be narrated along with background noises. Lots of time spent readi g this classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is great book!! I will not lie I had a WTF moment at the end!!!  I got teary eyed at some parts.
B008BIZ06M|3.0|Classic Offspring.  Good, but songs do sound a little repetitive.  But if you like Offspring, you will not be disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It isn't the same as the one on my pc, but I do like it...........I guess compared to the pc screen, it is somewhat smaller too
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Keep it up Guys!  One of the best of my latest music purchases. Hopefully Ozzy will stay with the band and still put out his own solos.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|One of the better albums I have bought. Great music...similar to the last album they put out...my sons love it too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best free app! It changed my life and I go on it every day! I strongly suggest that you get this app!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What more is there to say. I am glad I downloaded it. It is easy for our 6 year old to play
B009AZZEU2|5.0|As alway, Soundgarden ROCKS! The sounds I've missed are back and rocking once again. Rock on! Keep making music! I will alway be a Soundgarden FAN!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Following on Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read out of curiosity, I hoped for some depth in story line and content in Fifty Shades Darker.  It was certainly less stilted, but essentially a follow through on the first in this trilogy.  I can understand that the heavy breathing serves as a great attraction to most readers, but in the end I was dissatisfied (excuse the pun) and yearning for  substance, structure and literary genius.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great for the whole family. Love that they have different difficulty levels! Awesome pictures and hours of puzzle building.<br />Highly recommend
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's a nice hack and slash will give you hours of fun but you will have to either spend days earning gold if you want upgraded weapons or pay cash for it online.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I think the biggest problem I had with this book is that the younger characters have depth and dimension to them while the adults (mainly) suffer from just facet --- and that facet is bad. Only one or two adults do you have any sympathy for in the entire book (and one of them dies at the beginning). The rest of the adult population seem to be line drawings of what is wrong with humanity --- delusional expectations, overwhelming desires to escape from reality, self-righteousness, narcissism, corruption, drug addiction, me-me-me-me. It just doesn't strike true that an entire book could be made up of such a sorry lot of humanity. The kids do come off slightly better and are definitely given a range of emotions, struggles and shades of depth. However, again, the person you are holding out hope for also dies. I just hope the next book by Ms. Rowling applies the same rule to the adults that it does to the youth --- we are complicated creatures, write it so.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Kids enoy playing shark's very much. They are 12 and 5.<br />It's easy and clear and fun. Father also recomends :).
B003L7DK74|5.0|Have all season with a concert in one collection is perfect.<br /><br />The best is that smart sense of humor<br /><br />I simply love it!
B00884GR0W|1.0|Would have a zero but it won't allow no ratings. The game is so stupid how the quests r I thought the game would be awesome but don't get it is a waist of 2$.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY RIP OFF I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I am very good at procrastinating, even better when there is a book I can't put down because I have to know what is going to happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great I love it totaly worth buying it! I hope they add skins on it and iorn doors. :-)
B00BMEF97W|5.0|They took their new sound in a great direction. It was a drastic change, but successfully done. I can't wait for more from this amazing band.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really adore this game, it is such an improvement to number 1 more graphics, more  opportunities to earn coins, characters are more  3Dish, there are crazy awesome obstacles and a whole new board to run away from the huge gorilla monster! And it is FREE so there is not a reason to pass by this superterrificawsome game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun for a just to-do game and if you really like horses  all I have to say is this game is f fun and if you want to get a horse it helps you with that to
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Read this because it's a classic, but it's really more suited for a teenager. If you'd like a diversion (at any age), go ahead and read it. It doesn't take long.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Since this is the only converter for MagSafe to MagSafe2 around, it had better work perfectly. Usual Apple quality control and brilliant styling and execution.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|It's always nice to have shows that I can enjoy watching with my kiddos.  This is a great show.  :-)
B002KVCA1O|5.0|This is the music of my early adulthood. The memories are great as is the mastering quality of these songs.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|As indicated by the other reviewers, this app fails to save any images you edit. I got it for $0.00 as the free app of the day, but it isn't even worth that much. Downloading the app and spending time editing your photos is a waste of time if you can't even save them.
0525952926|3.0|This second installment in Ken Follett's Century trilogy had definitely altered my dream pattern these last two weeks.  I felt immersed in conflicts on two continents, the barbaric atrocities of the Nazi regime, the behind the scenes subterfuge and espionage, and the lives of multi-national families as they struggled for survival.<br />Good 3.5 to 4 star read.
B004PGO25O|5.0|will help anyone get off their ass and do what they can do to make their life workable and enjoyable
B00ECUARO8|3.0|After reading the critics recommendations, was disappointed in the plodding pace of the story.  A touch more suspense and intrigue would have made this a block-buster!
0307271080|5.0|Immigration, race relations, domestic interaction--what more could you want?  The characters in this novel are so richly drawn that one feels that you know them.  The story evolves when Ifemelu, who was born and raised in Nigeria, but later immigrates to the U.S., leaves behind her love, Obinze, who was supposed to follow, but due to 9/11, stays in Nigeria.<br /><br />Ifemelu's story shows how difficult it is for immigrants to adapt to their new surroundings, trying to do things the \\"American way\\" while still clinging to what they left behind in their native countries.  Simple things such as her experience at a beauty salon which specializes in  braids  and listening to the hairdressers' gossip, going to parties with new acquaintances where party does not mean dancing but just involves drinking, listening to Nigerians who have been in the U.S. for many years but who have never adapted to life here makes one admire her quest for a better life than what she had in Nigeria.<br /><br />Due to her own perseverance, she succeeds in becoming a widely read blogger in the U.S., but decides after 13 years to return to Nigeria and perhaps get together again with Obinze, a now rich and successful businessman who has married and has a child.  This is a love story but the author has woven her story with the stories of the many characters in the book so skillfully that she puts down in writing what many people, white, black Americans and African immigrants are not willing to acknowledge.<br /><br />This is the first book of the author I have read, but her earlier books are now on my wish list.  Highly, highly recommended!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have used this bag now for several weeks. it holds my entire kit, including a nice sized 70-200 2.8 Sigma lens and an E5 with the battery grip. And multiple lens.<br /><br />I feel comfortable with it on the street, because it does not screem \\"EXPENSIVE DSLR CAMERA!!!!\\" as you walk around with it.<br />it has good, not great padding, but it works fine.<br /><br />I am about to take a trip, so I will update how it performs in travel.<br /><br />Update. Took it on safari. It handled great. It protected my gear nicely and allowed quick and easy access.<br />The amount of padding  was perfect and protected my gear on multiple flights. It was a perfect fit under the seat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun.  What else do you need. :-) challenge, nice graphics, keeps changing, engaging, good way to exercise brain, stave off altzeimer's... Fresh.. I like it lots.  Now I'm going to go play some more.  Way to go designer.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's so refreshing to find a truly innovative show that doesn't entail a ton of violence.  This is well acted, well directed and very well written.  I'm so looking forward to Season 4 when it is available for Prime!  Watch it, you will get hooked!
0199535906|5.0|The Oxford Shakespeares are, I think, an excellent first choice for non-academic readers such as myself. The introduction is helpful, readable and - most importantly for those of us who are actually reading for pleasure - actually adds to one's enjoyment of the play.<br /><br />Tone of footnotes and introduction is, thankfully, never of awful dumbing-down that besets the Macmillan current editions,<br /><br />References are all on the page rather than collected at the back of the book,<br /><br />Paper is of a high quality,<br /><br />Binding is solid,<br /><br />Typeface is clear and elegant.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is another very well written drama with a ton of curves.  I'm very taken with the actors - many of them playing dual roles.  I am very close to completing the last season offered for Prime members and can only hope the next season will be available soon!  Thanks Amazon!
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|animals is Pink Floyd at their finest.  I already knew the album before I bought it, but it is a joy to own it now.
B009YQJ322|5.0|DREDD is a great action film. It has a simple story set up and moves at a brisk pace. Karl Urban is terrific as Dredd. Amazing what he can do with half his face covered the whole movie. Also great is Olivia Thirlby as Dredd's training partner. A tough female character in an action film is always welcome. The film is violent and bloody but the violence has a beauty to it with the visuals. A shame this didn't do well because I would love to see a DREDD 2.
B000002LJW|5.0|I love this album.  There are a lot of well-known songs on it, in addition to(not surprisingly) some awesome guitar work
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is great. However, when my mom wants to know the forecast when she's away at work,-she doesn't bring her own tablet- she asks me to tell her the whole forecast, and with the new update, it really tires my lungs out. How do those forecasters say the forecast for the WHOLE COUNTRY without dying? Anyway, great update still, and just fix that forecast issue, okay Weather Channel, please?
B001P4ESGC|4.0|I had heard rumblings about this series, but did not watch it when it was on broadcast television.  However, in search of something smart, well-written and acted, I was delighted to discover Glenn Close as Patty Hewes and Rose Byrne as her ambitious protege Ellen Parsons.  Even though it is a legal drama, time spent in a courtroom is minimal.  The action and intrigue takes place outside the courtroom and wow, it keeps you on your toes!<br /><br />The series uses flash-forwards, flash-backs, and dream sequences to advance tales of flawed, complicated people.  At the center of it all is a ruthless woman who will do anything to win.  I am already watching Season 3 on my Kindle and am hooked!  If you are not a Glenn Close fan already, this will make you one for sure.  Highly recommended!
0307719774|3.0|Although the book is nice and interesting and I will use it - it is a lot smaller than I imagined and unfortunatley I didn't measure it before I bought it.  It's not worth the time to mail it back.  Very disappointing from what I expected.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very cool game!!I love all the graphics!I am not able to play it for hours though.This game could use more.More of something.I still love to play!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|The game was a lot of fun, believe it or not.  Whose leg do I have to hump to get more levels?
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|nice brain guessing, not to hard.what I would really like is for them to give us more coins when we guess
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I have so far watched a handful of episodes and I can tell you right now that I am already sad they canceled the series.  It has so far blown me away and is at the top of my Stargate rankings (just shy of the original SG-1).  I will definitely get through these episodes and will enjoy every minute.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it game and the movie is great. I wish it had good graphic like in my brother phone.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Pretty typical Weber story line.  Great writing.  Some interesting concepts and some surprises.  Very enjoyable although not stellar in my opinion.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I have a large number of favorites, but the app only shows about 20% of my collection,and none of the v-tube off line choices show at all.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|I'm not really sure why any Progressive Rock fan or Steve Hackett fan wouldn't like this album.  Yes, he exhibits several different styles on the album and the songs sometimes change mood and pace abruptly, but the overall arch of his talent cannot be denied.  So I guess most of the criticism of this release is about it's eclectic nature; most people seeming to crave some kind of singularity in theme.  But IMO, Steve Hackett is one of the best guitarist, songwriters on the planet; so just go with that thought and don't worry about the construction of the vehicle, simply marvel in it's eloquence and handling.<br /><br />Beyond the Shrouded Horizon is a winner!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|yes
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I love this game. The only con is that it talks to much and doesn't have enough mini games. I advise not using the hints.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Dave Grohl knows how to talk to people and that's what makes everybody love him.  This film was no different.  I loved hearing all the history of the early days at the studio.  It was fascinating.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love that there are different game boards and endless puzzles. Addicting and fun game. Good way to exercise your brain and kill time.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|The twist at the end is..... WOW & WOW<br /><br />That's all I can say without spoiling the plot for other people.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I read this because of Gone Girl, that was such a great read so I wanted something else by this author. This book is just depressing and evil and makes you want to take a shower afterwards and wash away all the ugliness. It's a great thriller, I couldn't put it down, but towards the end I felt myself skimming through the pages because I just wanted to find out who did it without all the gore and violence.  It was just page after page of pitiful characters living shady lives, making bad decisions and doing awful things to one another. You really, really feel sorry for the mom because obviously she can't provide a good life for her kids and it just made me sad because there are real, true people out there in situations like this one.<br /><br />The Satanic stuff bothered me a little but the overall tone of this book is definitely dark. You will also be stuck in a dark place after reading this book. The only person you find yourself rooting for is Libby, but after the life she's had and the trauma she's lived through, you start to wonder if maybe she shouldn't have escaped. All the characters are pitiful and ugly and leave you feeling sorry for them and then sorry for yourself for reading the book! I was actually mad that I wasted my time reading it. If you like a good suspense and morbid themes don't bother you then this is the book for you.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|This is Almost the same as the original the only difference is the back drops theres is No new mini games like the description says and the clothes are all the same. My original Star Girl save was erased when it synced now I have to do a bunch of stuff over Again. DONT GET IT unless you want ur other stargirl erased!!!!
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|I enjoyed the show, but I would say that my first experience with Amazon Instant Video was sub par.  The streaming quality of the video off the internet was poor, so I thought downloading the episodes would lead to better picture quality.  Unfortunately, this was not the case--the video still had problems that made watching the show unpleasant.  Comparing the video quality of Amazon Instant Video to movies I purchased on iTunes or those I watch on Netflix through my Nintendo Wii, I would say Amazon Instant Video had the poorest video quality of the three.  Furthermore, I regretted spending $31 for the whole season.  I only pay $8.95 per month for unlimited videos on Netflix instant watch and I could have seen this for no additional charge if I just had a little more patience.  A la carte purchases of video are what the studios would like us to do.  They want people to pay the max and not get unlimited videos.  F them!  Resist!
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Having never read Vonnegut before I was intrigued but it is not my &#34;kind&#34; of reading so I would only recommend it to anyone who likes this &#34;off the wall&#34; type of reading.  I find Vonnegut's life more interesting than his writing.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|The Third series in the Stargate genre. SciFi or I guess now SyFy channel did a terrible diservice to the SciFi community by terminating the series just as it was finding it's pace, The second season was well written and acted. Character development was peaking. Then SyFy CEO opted for a Pro Wrestling. Terrible move on the channel's part. However the series is awesome as is the other Stargate series. Amazon's streaming video quality was excellent and the audio was awesome. Better than when it was on SyFy channel. Highly recommend watching it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|These events happened when I was nine so I didn't have all the background. Since it was Historical fiction a lot of information was filled in for me.
B00CZAYL76|1.0|Very disappointed in this album, have been listening to 5FDP for years and have enjoyed every album up until The Wrong Side of Heaven... Waste of money, wish I would have listened to some of these crappy songs before I wasted even more money on the deluxe edition.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|You can't go wrong with any of the Temperance Brennan books. I liked it but was vaguely disappointed by the resolution.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works very well in a tackle box.  High quality and takes up almost no space.  Gets along well with others.  Personally, I don't like something even that size in my pocket.  I carry a very small Gerber everywhere, stainless steel with pocket clip for jeans and a very nice small black Gerber for dress clothes.  Gerber and I have been pals for a long, long time,  for my part, a long to come.  I've had to replace several of them with others just like them because of loss.  That's about the only reason you will ever have to replace a Gerber.
B005COO1X6|4.0|If you read this book you'll never be tempted to enter a highway rest stop again. I love Stephen King books.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I never saw the first Alien before I saw the Prometheus, so there were a lot of question I had for that movie. The documentary was another good edition to watch and understand the history of these movies.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|Reading this true story made me understand why she wrote The Lovely Bones which I liked much better than Lucky.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The story is incredible. The training unbelievable. You can't read this and NOT come away with an much higher regard for the Seals. The actual writing gets a B+ from me.
B005F2BBLK|1.0|Heck this movie was too eccentric for adults but especially for kids. Our kids didn't like it at all. The bad thing is I kept encouraging the kids to be open minded and give it a chance to grow on them but it kept getting worse and worse. Didn't like all the \\"spirits\\" talk in it either. I gave it 1 star b/c there was no opt for 0 stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Simple fun but can not stop. Must try it and enjoy the fun. I recommend this game and will continue to enjoy .
B00DAXXO98|4.0|elegant costume and characters with depth.. deep plotting and more interesting than expected... more sex than most would care for but fits the story line.. episode at Sentinal College engrossing...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely beautiful. I found myself crying in the car with my father and my two best friends sobbing uncontrollably. They're love, though fictional, was so real. Highly recommended.
B004U52VPS|1.0|This isn't very entertaining and seems to made cheap. The pieces are hard to put back into the box correctly for it to shut the way it came as well. The pieces are cheap thin plastic so stacking was nearly impossible. I wouldn't buy this again and I think we may have thrown it away by now.
B00846WWVM|4.0|This is a fun addicting game to play for all ages. From 3 to ++.  I enjoy playing this with my grandkids.
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is exactly like all other lego sets. So if you have a lego fan, they will LOVE this set. It's cute, easy to put together and durable. My daughter still plays with it months after she got it. It may need a few pieces put back into place here and there but it's not for anything the product is lacking, it's my daughter's hard play with it. She is 6. The girls are super cute that it comes with too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did not think I would like this book--but I LOVED it! I'm hooked on the entire series--reading Mockingjay--and already don't want it to end!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We bought this for cheap during Black Friday! It was a great buy and an excellent movie! My kids LOVE it and we still watch it often!
0345537998|5.0|I bought this book mainly on the short explanation of the plot I read on a website a few weeks ago and I have to say it really was a thoroughly entertaining voyage through space and beyond with Haviland Tuf and his band of psychic feline companions. I'm not a huge reader of sci-fi books, and the only other GRRM books I've read are the GoT books, but this did everything I wanted it to as far as feeding my imagination and providing a fun escape. In the GoT series, GRRM shows that he is quite adept at creating new and interesting worlds full of colorful characters, and this story has quite a bit of that - from the eccentric main character with his dry wit to the wild and mythical creatures and inhabitants found in worlds scattered across the cosmos. I won't retrace the plotlines or other things that many other reviewers have touched on, but I will agree with those who have said they wish that this was a continuing series - there are many more fascinating stories that could be told. I could easily see a Star Trek-like series where we get regular check-ins with Tuf and his adventures across the galaxies - running into strange people and beasts while trying to control/exploit the abilities of his \\"seed ship\\" while weighing the impact that his decisions can have on populations and humanity itself. I went on a binge and read all of the GoT books consecutively last summer, and I would definitely have done the same this year if there were more books in this series.
B00C061I3K|4.0|The cd title perfectly describes the tracks; some songs are slow and some are great for dancing to.  The cd arrived in great condition in a timely manner.  I would buy it again.
159448385X|4.0|Hosseini is an impressive writer.  This depiction of two women's life in Afganastan is revealing.  This is a good read, not as good as The Kite Runner, but an excellent book to pour into.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|While the 4th book was sometimes lacking for adventure and drama, it was loaded with character development  and new story lines.  So readers knew that at some point, there was a whole lot of overdue action to be had - It takes place in this book.  The excitement is non-stop!!!  It is very difficult to put this book down... I'm certain that I read through this one faster than any of the others.  In my opinion, this is probably the best book of the series so far.<br /><br />Now I just can't wait for Book 6!!!
1449430295|5.0|I love Dilbert Calendar.  I have my calendar at work and is my reason to show up everyday.  just to read what Dilbert has to say every single day
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|It arrived quickly and was in the condition described. It works great and is in perfect condition It will be a great addition to the movie library.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Actually I'm not totally sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. I didn't expect something this thoughtful, this well researched (yes, researched), this interesting, or this skillfully written. I guess I just thought it would be some fun roughage for my head.  Certainly didn't know I was in for a thought-provoking, slow-paced, almost intimate book. Such a great reflection of today's society and insightful discussion of past wars and conflicts. Ends with an entirely believable future (minus the living dead, of course).
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|The DVD arrived quickly and was in the condition described. The disc itself was perfect and works great. Good addition to the movie library.
B0058SNNK8|5.0|Came pack nicely and earlier than expected.<br />Comfortable to wear and color as seen on picture.<br />The price is worth the waiting than buying locally.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Love the challenge. Love the different mini puzzles.  Some of the puzzles are hard but like that you can get help.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Typical lame acting.  Even though you know the &#34;I'll be back&#34; catchlines are coming, it's still embarrassing.  Other than a few special effects, it was horrible.  At least in Rambo, you see all the gunfire, you accept Stallone's horrible acting, and that's just it.  Here, they layer on all the worst acting from all the old (and new) action heros...again.  Not worth more than free viewing on Netflix or Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Free is a lot of fun and is also challenging! The game makes you use your brain to win.
1118156307|3.0|Great concept, but I think it should have been more of a manual than a toolbox. I don't think the examples they provided were detailed enough. Felt like the book didn't deliver what it could have.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This movie was full of action and most of the great [action] actors of my generation. I think the best part is the collection of them all in one movie. The story seemed lacking and the fake blood-splatters everywhere began to get old after a few scenes but I still enjoyed the movie anyway, especially a few hidden puns that I'm sure were intended... I'm a guy, and it's a &#34;guys&#34; flick. There are better, there are worse... this is somewhere in between for me.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|This spin-off is a darker, more grown-up show than its parent show, 'Doctor Who'.  But it is fantastic!  The charming Capt. Jack Harkness is a much more complete character, full of mystery, anger, sexuality, and resolve.  His team at Torchwood is a socio-psychological study in PTSD.  But it works.  All the angst, terror, pain, sex, and play create a team that the watcher is at turns delighted with, frustrated with, and always fascinated by.<br /><br />And John Barrowman as its star is absolutely, fantastically, wonderful.  Were he not the embodiment of Capt. Jack, he would be nothing short of the Doctor himself.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoy anything that shows the world there is a real HEAVEN!<br />I will meet you in Heaven one day!<br />Eva
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This movie is sick. The good kind of sick and I like it. I'm going to buy the season on blue rat when it comes out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Author gave just enough in the beginning and hid just enough to make the reader want to know more, and more, and then the surprise - will there be a sequel?
0525478817|3.0|i did like this book however, i think it was the wrong timing for me to read it. my mother is going through cancer treatments and not sure what outcome we have yet. i liked the love story through adversity.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|this book was quite detailed, once i really got into the plot & all the details, i couldn't put it down.<br />i'm on #3 right now.
0345525558|4.0|i picked this book as a book club read. i have a few women in our group that are green thumbs. the story interested me with the flowers the main character picks and i enjoyed the flower dictionary at the end. that will be useful when i am giving flowers as gifts
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I converted a couple DVD I have to MP4, so I can download them onto my kindle for the grand daughter to watch.. player finds folders I cannot see when on my kindle screen ( Like document or downloaded )  and can play my movies.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! I normally do not like to repeat movies, but this was an exception! Very well made movie, worth the purchase!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Rented it on a 2 hour drive with granddaughter, who had seen the latest movie,  she watched it,, not much more to type
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|We ordered this as a gift for my Dad's birthday after my boyfriend saw the movie, and he couldn't stop talking about it!  Clearly the film resonated with him on an emotional level, as well as an entertainment level.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett never fails to delight and his duets are amazing.  Loved the ones with John Mayer, Lady Gaga and Aretha.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Such great voices and lyrics, along with playing.  Can't say anything neg.  I love this CD and the Carolina Chocolate Drops!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Never too good in math, I depend upon this tool for simple calculations, such as fractions and percentages. And it's free!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Nice toy and good seller. Baby seems to like it, but it's better for 4 months and older so they can jump and reach the ground.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow!!! Full of surprises as were seasons 1&2. Never disappoints for romance and intrigue and plain ole meanness. Hard to not watch the whole season @once but I do have a life that I must participate in. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I know what Fox News says about it and I continue to laugh at their ignorance. This is an excellent and informative read as I really never learned (or thought) about what life was like 2000 years ago.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great show. Once you start you won't be able to stop watching it till you're done. And Tatiana Maslany deserves every award for her fantastic performance here.
B005HED11Y|5.0|It reminded me the first time I watched it on tv..... good times!!! Rewatched after such a long time is just an awesome experience that I'm loving to share with my son!!! The special (de)effects!! hahahahahah I love it!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I was looking for something to do when I came across this game. I found a very addictive game! Thanks for developing such a fun and amazing game to play!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this knowing it's context, but having only soft porn as your plot made for an awful read. And the cliff hanger for book 2 did not leave me wanting to read it
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOMEST GAME EVER IN THE WORLD I MEAN IT IS 7DOLLARS BUT IT IS WORTH ALL THE MONEY YOU SHOULD BUY IT NOW!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is a awesome game especially on a rainy day and when you are bored and you don't have to put up with cards everywhere.
B0083Z614S|4.0|An easy read that moves right along. Suitable for readers of all ages. It was easy to overlook that the ages of the main character portrayals were not realistic for a child's actual development for their ages. Nonetheless, a very worthwhile read.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I found this to be an excellent third part. I almost don't want to read the fourth book because it will mean this story world will be finished.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Finally understand what all the buzz has been about.  Watched three seasons in about five days...and now each minute passes like an hour....still months away from season 4.  Addictive in the best sense of the word.  Very sorry certain actor (no spoiler here) did not choose to continue in season 4, but live in Downton Abbey goes on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I say this game<br /> is so so so sooo awesome rad raw and cool and I would tell anyone that.
B008W8X5N6|5.0|It had been a while since I have seen the original King Kong.  I just bought the Peter Jackson remake on Blu-Ray not too long ago and it wasn't until I watched the original did I realize just how much Peter Jackson's remake was a nice homage to the original.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I've had this scanner for 3 days and thought I'd discuss a number of issues. My prime use is to scan/digitize color negatives. The resulting stored images are jpg which when set to the maximum resolution of 10MP are 2600 x 3900 pixels. For proper exposure of my negative film strips I set the EV setting to -1 and found the resulting image to be exposed correctly. If your initial images are low in contrast and over exposed (or old and faded) you may need to adjust this setting. For scanning film strips you insert a provided \\"film strip holder\\" into the top of the scanner which then guides your film strips in front of the scanner. Each film strip slides through this holder which is made from 2 pieces of ~2\\" wide clear plastic sandwiched together, with a slot between them into which the film strip goes. The scanner light passes through the front of the  holder, the film strip, and the back of the holder.  It is these pieces of clear plastic whose scratching issues have been discussed by others.  After running somewhere between 100 and 150 4-frame 35mm negative strips through this holder I saw no scratches which \\"visibly\\" effected the scanned images. My biggest problem was dust and hair particles attaching themselves to the clear surfaces of the  film strip holder (as was mentioned in the directions) and showing up on the final scanned images. You cannot see this through the units viewer as they only appear when the images are enlarged (on your PC monitor). As the film strip holder is made of (apparently) soft plastic, I would recommend users purchase a soft squeeze bulb blower with a soft brush attached (commonly used by photographers to clean their lenses) to help clean the film strip holder. (without scratching it). I also noted that the film strip holder, when viewed by holding it up to a light, somewhat distorted the light that passed through it and could ultimately effect the quality of the scanned image.  I have printed the resulted images to as large as 4 x 6, have been satisfied with the results, and have seen no indication of distortion to-date. This distortion could however effect further enlargements.  It has been mentioned that a significant improvement would be to replace the clear plastic sections of the film strip holder with glass.  I strongly support that.
