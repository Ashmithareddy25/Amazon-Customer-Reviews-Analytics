B008RS4LO8|4|they are small i thought they would be a little bigger but its good for the price i bought it for and in each little space comes very few but its okay its just perfect for the price. I use it to bling my earrings which are perfect because they are small and some of my earrings are small and are just the perfect size for the job.
B000IB0G7S|5|This shaving cream is amazing. I had heard about via a youtube video. Guys, if you shave with a double edge shaver I would highly recommend this cream. A tiny, tiny amount foams up to a luxurious lather and really goes a long way to prevent nicks and &#34;weepers&#34;. (Read VERY economical) Also, don't be turned off by the rose scent. It is NOT a &#34;Girly Man&#34; smell at all. I really hate heavy perfume smells. The scent on this is very very light and a clean one at that. I am going to try the Trumpers Sandelwood next (The smell of &#34;Old Spice&#34;)  I think it would be nice to have a change every other day. I am an 60+ &#34;old guy&#34; who recently went back to DE shaving. I have been experimenting with shavers, blades and creams. This cream with my Mekur Future or old '59 vintage Gillette Fat Boy combined the Personna blades (Made in USA -Hooray!) gives me a better shave than my Mach 5 overpriced &#34;toy&#34; razor. Give it a try and think you will agree!
B0002FCD5I|5|I am usually very picky about my shampoos and conditioners. I use Herbal Essence as my shampoo of choice, but I didn't really like their conditioners. I have tried many others, but I keep coming back to the Suave Coconut. I'm very sensitive to strong scents, but this coconut scent is light enough that it doesn't bother me, but heavy enough to remind me of the beach. I can't find this in the store very often anymore, so I'm glad i was able to find it on Amazon!
B000IOQXL8|5|It is the best I have ever used. It was recommended to me.
B001BOAL1M|1|After reading about Pomega5 on Daily Candy, I ordered Pemega5 Daily Revitalizing Concentrate from Amazon. Alas, when I opened one of the little capsules, it smelled a little off, a little stale--like canola oil or grape seed oil that's been left out on the shelf too long. I emailed the manufacturer immediately stating my concern but have not received a response. I'm not satisfied with the product. Just saying....
B005FVVTUY|5|Don't really know if this helps a great deal or not but I love the way it goes on and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  I use twice daily under my normal moisturizer.
B000GLNQHM|5|Essie is an awesome product for the price, comparable to the very best department store nail products.  This color was perfect for me all summer and seemed to go w/ everything!  Love how it lasts, and is easy to touch up. A fave, for sure!
B0000536EK|5|Let's be honest. Mother nature has a part to play when it comes to pregnancy stretch marks. However, I've been using this toning oil since the beginning of my pregnancy (even before I started to show) and it has been wonderful! I am entering my third trimester with twins, so I've grown quite a bit already. I haven't seen a single stretch mark so far. I'm convinced that if I develop any stretch marks in my third trimester, then it's going to happen no matter which product I use!<br /><br />I'll be honest, the whole &#34;oil&#34; consistency put me off at first, but I quickly realized that it had no effect on my clothing and actually does absorb quite well into my skin. I don't even bother washing it off of my hands after, I just rub it in like a hand moisturizer.<br /><br />Also, if you're wondering how often to use, I've been using this twice a day: after my shower in the morning and before I go to bed. Seems to be working so far!
B003RF82UK|5|It's so extremely light, and just glides on your skin. It's not the best moisturizer for dry spots, but it feels so nice when it's on your skin. Really refreshing, and it feels like there's nothing on.
B005ECLAIU|5|Great addition to lotion and hair products . Leaves the hair moisturizer. Add to your current products it adds additional moisture.
B008X5GS5U|5|Great!!!!
B00DIHLZGU|5|love this
B003YJ70NY|5|I have had my razor now for almost two years and let me tell you this razor is awsome and with feather blades it's super awsome I got this razor when I was just starting de shaving and I had already had a couple of razor I now have 12 de razors all together and this is the one I use every day I would and have recommended this product to my father and he loves this razor as well
B002N5MIF0|5|As advertised.
B0056GDG90|3|Is not hot enough
B0010VLJ58|1|I have used this product in the past and loved it.    Not sure what is wrong this time - but this is sticky, clumpy, horrible stuff.    Does not apply well and smudges.    I will definitely not purchase this again.
B00Q5ERAWQ|5|Since I have been using Vitamin C Serums for a while now, I have noticed that my skin looks very smooth and hydrated. Since the Insta Natural anti-aging night cream moisturizes the skin, it also reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I have brown spots and using the cream has not made them disappear yet, but then again they even came back after I had them zapped with lasers. Stubborn little buggers!<br /><br />I can tell you however that the Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer is effective, because I have also tried it on my hands which for a while were pretty dry looking. I hate wearing gloves when gardening and planting several hundred bulbs in the garden left them looking dry and chapped. After applying the cream to my face, I also spread it over my hands and soon they no longer resembled sand paper, but looked smooth and hydrated again. So yes, the cream does work wonders! I liked that the white cream has just the right consistency and goes on nicely.  It does not feel thick, nor does it smell and it gets absorbed into the skin right away.
B008XWYBF2|5|Love bare minerals..  The coverage is amazing.  I'm 58 yrs old so I need the flawless look it gives you.  I've been using this product for a few yrs now and will never use anything else...
B000PY17PI|4|I love this product.  This is the second one that I have purchased through Amazon.  It works great for finishing touches on my natural curly/wavy hair.
B0000532VC|5|I am having surgery, and will not be able to take a shower for 6 weeks,  I have used these in the past, and they are great, They are not sticky, and leave the skin smooth and fresh.
B0081E6YX4|1|Have used this every morning and night for 1-1/2 months and have not noticed a difference.
B00PUSGQ32|5|I got this product at a discounted price for my honest review! It works great!! My skin is smooth and looks so much healthier after just one use of both!! I highly recommend this product =]
B009P2C4IA|3|The shampoo arrived leaking shampoo.  The conditioner was in excellent shape.
B000P9B3NY|4|I've been using this lotion for years!  It really toughens up your skin!  I got my belly button pierced when I was 18 and the guy doing the piercing had a hard time puncturing my skin.<br /><br />Only downside to this product is that it's slightly more expensive on here than going to a store and getting the 25% more bottle for the same price.
B000WUD83E|5|I've only been using this soap for two days, and let me tell you, I noticed a difference from the first use. This stuff removes the excess oil from your skin, while leaving a silky smooth coat of moisture behind at the same time. My face STAYS smooth way after I've used the soap, and so far my face doesn't get oily again right away for a long time after using it. I've had a problem with face washes drying out my skin and then causing my skin to release even more oil, further worsening the problem. This stuff does not do that. It just removes the oil and replaces moisture in a way that does not appear to clog pores. It also feels really nice as a body wash and leaves all my skin smooth, not just my face. I'm hoping can clear up acne on the shoulders too, but its too soon to tell. Clearly, my face is benefiting, which is a huge deal, because nothing has really worked before, and I've tried A LOT of stuff over the years. This can also be used a shaving soap, and provides a smooth shave. It foams just enough to be able to see the soap, but not too much. I've used it as a conditioning shampoo too, and I've had interesting results. It seems to clean my hair, but not strip the natural oils out, like I have noticed with other commercial shampoos I've used. Because of this my hair feels noticeably heavy, but doesn't really feel like it weighs me down. It also seems to have more volume and not lay flat as much as before using the soap. I also follow up with Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil brushed throughout my hair as a natural conditioner and do discourage against frizz. This is the first hair care regime I've used outside of commercial products and my hair is NOT frizzing. It looks good. I am pretty blown away by how well this is working. I guess your hair can respond to natural stuff super well! The only thing that's really been a negative is that since stopping regular store-bought conditioner, it is a little more difficult to brush through tangled hair. However, it is not impossible, and I think my hair will thank me for not using products that dry it out with sulfates and other ingredients like that. We'll see how this work in the long term, but I'm pleased so far. It's worth it for me to spend a little more on a bottle of this than buy separate body wash, face wash, shampoo, conditioner, and shaving creme. It really simplifies my life and takes off some stress I didn't realize I had so much of from having to keep up with five separate products. I'm so glad I found it and so thankful for the informative reviews people left on Amazon before I bought this soap.
B00755JWKM|2|They charge me $6.50 to ship a 2oz $1.70 purchase -- and then it takes over a week to get here! You can't make this stuff up!
B00LT91XK2|5|Very fast delivery and love item
B00KAB1TBI|4|I received the Cover Girl Lash Blast Bombshell Curvaceous Mascara complimentary by influenster.  I am so pleased with the coverage of this mascara!  It is a little hard to get used to the larger size handle (I have small hands) but once I did, my lashes were full and for once a mascara that does NOT flake after a few hours of wear.  Honestly, this mascara will not off until you remove it....which in my opinion is a plus!!
B000JLFFGE|5|This is my second order for the nail brush.  It is a wonderful product to cleaning your nails and hands.  I paint a lot and seem to always get paint on my hands and especially around my nails.  The top of the brush is great for getting under the nails and the bottom of the brush to clean around the nails.  I also use the brush to clean the paint off of my skin, it isn't all that rough and works well.  It is worth every cent I paid.  It is one of those products that should be in every home.
B0058A9OF4|4|This product has helped improve the way I feel.  Before- I had brain fog and could not concentrate.  My estrogen was through the roof.  Since I have been using this product daily I have a clearer mind and I am able to function at an improved level.  Thanks!
B00NF2PJ7E|4|I used this product with a couple of other oils Combined as a hot oil treatment I loved the result.
B008QMWM5U|5|Excellent quality. Very mild on hands
B00GMP521O|2|Something in the fragrance is missing .  I have purchased it several times, think I am going to go to the Egyptian White Musk .... To bad Santana Musk is no longer available.
B002LE8OX8|5|Works just as great still.  Tried it at a mall kiosk where they were charging a grip for it.  Got it here for a steal!!
B001CT053U|5|It smells wonderful!
B00405YP4S|4|Fragrance  smells really nice,My husband loved it!...Just was a little unappy with the way it was shipped.When I open the canister to the colonge.The clamp that was suppose to hold the colonge in place was broken.The cologne bottle fell on to marble floor in almost cracked. Wheww!,Was really a close  one can not believe in didn't break!
B005KT4T44|4|I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair 3 times a week so wanted something that would protect it from the heat. This stuff seems to work pretty well and it smells good.  Doesn't leave a greasy residue or anything like that. I like it.
B000II2ZOS|5|Great product.  Will definitely get again. Better quality than ones I have gotten in the past.  Good quality for price.
B00NR1YQFE|5|I can not get enough of this scrub, it leaves my skin healthy and a beautiful glow! I tested Neutrogena® Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.
B003YD9HWM|1|No changes in lashes, however the container was useful. Washed out, air dried, filled with Latisse. Excellent applicator. So basically I bought a $30 container...lol.
B00BBJXPMO|5|Nice pigment for building
B00EAYKVPQ|5|perfect summer color.
B00EAY3HSO|5|cleans the airbrush nicely. i use it religiously on my airbrush applicator.
B003FBG88E|1|It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality.
B000VUYJ74|5|good, good, highly reccommended
B0075X0Z46|5|I found this trimmer works exceptionally well, trims hair very closely, yet safely, even in hard to reach spots.  It's a keeper.
B00L1KFQKC|5|I had been purchasing a competitors &#34;cleansing conditioner&#34; for over two years but was tired of paying the high prices for lack luster results. When I discovered SILK I immediately cancelled all future shipments of my old brand.  Love how truly &#34;silky&#34; this conditioner leaves my hair...without having to use much at all.  A quarter size is truly enough for my mid-length hair worked through the ends of my hair with a wide tooth comb.  Don't be fooled by infomercials for other brands...you can have soft, silky hair without all the chemicals in this great little bottle.
B008KPO2MY|5|This was my first purchase of cocoa butter and I couldn't be more pleased! It really does seem to live up to the claims of being raw and 100% pure. It came in a bag of different-sized blocks and smelled heavenly!! We would all just open the bag and smell a while. :)  I bought it for lotion bars and it melted well and the bars are perfect. Since it is in blocks, we did have to google to see what weight should correlate for a cup of cocoa butter, but it didn't take that long and there were a variety of sizes of blocks so it wasn't difficult. I will DEFINITELY purchase this again!
B00MFWM1YO|5|Works extremely well in my daughters long thick hair! No more whining from her!! Light weight and easy for her to use as well! thanks!
B00AN8SOLG|4|My face feels very smooth and really clean after each use.
B0012BNVE8|5|I started using the liquid 5% Rogaine when I was 18 years ago when I began to experience thinning in my crown area and slight recession in vertex areas. I've also used Propecia/finasteride for the past 17 years. My crown filled in within four months of starting Rogaine liquid, my vertex mostly filled in within 6 months, my hair regained nearly all of it's pre-thinning thickness around 1 year after starting the Propecia and today I still have most of my hair (I'm between a Norwood I and Norwood II). I have slight recession in my temples and have been able to maintain most of my widow's peak. I prefer the foam to the liquid. It is MUCH less irritating to my scalp (although I understand experiences will vary among users), and right now I prefer the brand name Rogaine because it seems to retain more of it's foam consistency when applied, compared to generic minoxidil (store brand) foam. The brand name Rogaine foam seems to also be even less irritating to my scalp than the generic minoxidil foam.
B0009ML9E0|5|I freaking love this lotion. It is really thick and soaks into my skin really well. The smell stays with me all day and keeps my skin hydrated all day.
B008C130XS|4|Just got this about a week ago at rite aid for a few dollars cheaper. I used it with a primer and blending brush. I wanted to get something light for summer that would not leave my face too oily despite having sunscreen in it. I applied it the first day before going to the park with my kids and when I got back I was still pleased with the way my face looked. It helped with redness that comes from heat. I gave it four stars because it could conceal a bit more but it still does a good job. I will say though that I did still get a bit of sun burn so I don't know how much the spf 30 works. It was really sunny that day.
B00365DABC|5|This stuff is great for healing irritated skin.  I use it all the time....not just at night.  It really sinks in, and is not greasy at all.
B0087PWNJG|5|Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner, 25.4 Fl Oz<br />Category: Hair Care<br />Pantene wins again! I love love love this. Applied it and let it soak in the first time like a deep conditioner in a salon. When it was time to rinse, blotted and blew dried my hair it was smooth and healthy looking making me look salon pampered at a much more reasonable price. I'll be keeping this stocked in my house. Highly recommend for taming thick curly hair to \\"repair\\" your hair.
B007Q37Z9I|4|Yardley is my all time favorite
B00EZ82Q50|4|Love this shampoo. Both shampoo and conditioner are fabulous.
B000C1W3OS|5|One of my all time favorite perfumes!  Have gotten many friends/family members hooked on it as well.  Good for either a casual day out or a hot date. A little goes a long way and you can't beat amazon's pricing.  Would definitely recommend this product to others.
B000GHGYP2|4|i've been looking for this shampoo for ages; it smells amazing and makes my hair super soft, but for some reason everywhere i used to buy it has stopped stocking it. i was pretty happy to find it on amazon. only downside would be the increased cost due to shipping, etc.
B003WR3QSG|5|You really won't find a better brush for the price. I've been using this for a few weeks now and I'm completely happy with it. You do need to keep in mind though, this is not a $100 handmade brush, so it's not going to be amazing. Some could call it an excellent starter brush but I truly think if you are on a \\"beer\\" budget expect beer, not wine...In other words, it works. I lost a little bit of hair the first couple uses but that's normal. Just make sure to wash it first (some use shampoo some use dish soap, either will work) and soak it overnight and you'll have an awesome cheap brush.
B00OWA0NYM|5|Best deal around!
B00A7I957O|5|Awesome
B00EKRVIM8|5|Heard about this in the magazine MORE.  Thought I'd try it.  So little foam goes such a long way!  My face felt clean and soft.  A very good remedy for removal of makeup and for the rigors of daily air pollution.
B0035LCW0W|4|It works very well. My lashes stay on for a couple of weeks. Would definitely buy it again.  Great price too.
B00B1RTFPM|3|Just ok for me, I like their other products better like the Lazer Straight and the 7 seconds. I like more lather personally, but they do smell very pretty :)
B00G4I2DLG|5|This is a very nice hair dryer.  It's not too loud, has a good number of settings and comes with two tools.  If I had to make a complaint it would be that the switches are right where my fingers are holding on and sometimes I hit one while styling.  Otherwise, it's a really good dryer at a very good price.
B004ML689A|5|I had my overall doubts when first purchasing this product...since then I can honestly say that I have never been more pleased with an online purchase :) The &#34;hot&#34; steam feels wonderful, and the &#34;cool&#34; steam is so refreshing and feels great as an after-effect. I personally LOVE the fact that it can utilize essence oil, as I ALWAYS do, and it makes it a piece of cake to do so...on a cotton ball or cotton gauze pad folded. It smells soothing even, and my skin feels fantastic!!! I even brought it to my mom's and gave her a &#34;facial&#34; with this and some other products...GREAT JOB!!! Doesn't burn, works great!!!
B003E0XV0Y|5|I have already written several reviews on Pravana products,  They are absolutely wonderful!
B001CT02B0|5|Soft, clean smelling, a little bit goes a lOng way, I get tons of compliments from both men and women
B00MUBZIFO|1|I thought it would look very nice but I ordered it in silver and it came in black. Broke off the second I took it out of the package. Do not buy unless you have a glue gun handy.
B004TSF8R4|5|love these brushes... hold up well to washing as well.
B004UCLHXI|3|I liked this product, but it wasn't LOVE. I like that it's really thick, and Sulfate free, but I'm more of a cowasher anyway. This product felt kind of like it was stripping my hair a little too much. If it was gifted to me, I'd use it like any other shampoo- very seldomly. It's really nothing special. I had to condition with something else after using it. I used Aussie Moist to get my moisture back up that I feel this stripped away.<br /><br />Jen
B000O5VKK0|5|My husband loved it.
B0074NV31Q|4|My stylist had a sample of this ThermaFuse HeatSmart Serum and I after I smelled it, I had to get some for myself. It makes my naturally curly hair smooth and shiny.
B00EOAZZXO|5|It literally kills me inside how expensive this deodorant is, but I have to hand it to GT, it is great.<br /><br />It feels great (firm/soft), it applies great (smooth), it doesn't seem to melt or harden/dry up to a rock like some other natural baking soda deods... it really is good, but wow, this price is really hard to swallow.
B005N3FBO4|5|I received the wig very quickly and on time.<br />The wig was packaged in a plastic bag and also inside a ziplock bag with a hair net.<br />The wig is exactly as shown. Long bangs, long long hair!<br />The hair fibers are very smooth and silky and, as most wigs do, will tangle with lots of use so I suggest looking into correct wig hair care on youtube or a forum.<br /><br />I actually ended up cutting the wig to a much shorter length to suit my needs and it looks great.<br />It's a smidge large on me but I have a smallish head so it was expected, and there are small straps inside to tighten the wig to fit.<br /><br />It's pretty shiny, but not like the kind of shiny  you get from those ultra cheap Halloween wigs, more like- 'I just washed and dried and did my hair and sheened it with oil' kinda shiny- so its quite pretty.<br /><br />One advantage to such a long wig with long bangs, is that you can style it how ever you like, by cutting or shaping or putting it up etc. I cut mine into a stylish bob and it's really adorable.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that there isn't a more noticeable 'skin patch' at the top (I'm a fairly pale white girl so it's kinda noticeable), but there are tutorials on how to easily give yourself a more natural part or skin patch there to your own skin tone there.<br /><br />All in all I loved the product and I will be wearing it regularly, and ordering another to style to my preferences!
B000LXTNMW|5|This is a great deal for an amazing bronzer! A friend of mine suggested it to me after I accomplished my base tan. I'm naturally very pale and can't use a very strong tingler because of my sensitive skin. I wish I would have been warned to only use  this product for a few minutes in the tanning bed.<br />It gave me a VERY dark, beautiful tan - after I was in the bed for my usual 11 minutes. I wish I would have only been in the bed with this product on for five minutes because I was very red with welts.<br /><br />But eventually the tingle stopped my skin from raising and I had a beautiful, dark tan that lasted for days. Five stars for this product --- just don't stay in the tanning bed for your usual time! Take it slowly at first.
B000ZFI2PA|5|Ok, I bought this formyself, used this and am not crazy about it at all, I sweat a lot and it just didn't get me as clean as I'd like and it smells like cleaner you'd keep under your kitchen sink, On the other hand I have boy/girl twins, the girl has cradle cap and the boy has dermatitis, I put this in their bath water and since I've bought this around a month ago, his skin hasn't broken out and her cradle cap has cleared. That is definitely worth 5 stars
B004XWM1NA|5|Yum, my only gripe is I can't just stop eating one. I consume them all.
B003HWU1YI|5|I really love this product, it is the best lotion I have ever used, it lasts all day long. I am always getting compliments on the coconut smell. When they offered it with the bath soap for about the same price, I had to order it!
B00GMEXMAI|5|Works Great I use this for Lash Extensions
B001H4FN1O|5|Smells like lavender and not the floral notes of &#34;sweet pea&#34; like most other lavender scented products. I love it!
B00074LNUK|5|Love this mousse it really works great on my curly hair
B001Q8560Y|5|Beautiful texture and goes on smooth - buff it in pretty well and you've gotten yourself a good foundation. It's not the best but I use it daily - no breakouts - which is amazing and it stays on pretty well and starts to wear off only in the evening for a morning application; if I need to go out in the evening, I just retouch and powder it in place and I'm good for the night - no caking.
B004QB8WB8|1|I usually love Ojon products, but this cream is awful. Too heavy, dulled my hair, couldn't wait to wash it out. Too expensive for a terrible product. Don't waste your money!
B00A3BWYU0|5|Bought this chalk for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Great for little girls.
B001E6TDYS|5|A great product. Glad they still make it. Hard to find. Shrinks large pores and tightens skin like no other.
B0050WW24K|3|The product is good but the color was not what I really wanted. I love the lipstick because it stays on much longer than other products for me. Would not order this color again
B00AGG3MUI|5|I have tried a number of razors since I switched to double edge safety razors.  For me these are the best.  I have really sensitive skin and course hair that grows in all different directions.  I found that these razors leave little irritation.  It helps to know your face and develop a shaving process that works for you.
B000ZJDYTA|5|perfect. best exfoliator that already had, not dry out the skin and to wear all day if you want, my skin is much better now and thanks!
B006MUT06M|1|i have been using the nail care items in this set for the past 31 days since it was delivered on March 8. Today is April 9, one day out of AMAZON'S returns and refunds policy for free returns and a full refund or replacement. One day!! The nail clippers that broke this morning look like they are constructed out of some soft metal, certainly not stainless steel (even though it is not advertised as such).  In other words, for items that will be used to varying degrees of high stress, they are of exceptionally poor construction quality. I don't understand how this set has garnered such high ratings, given the poor quality of construction. Maybe my set was newer and the materials quality has diminished significantly since the positive reviews were published. Whatever, I am as upset with AMAZON about their return/refunds policy as I am with the inferior quality of this set!
B000Z4NACG|5|excelente producto
B001E724CA|5|I use this with the glycol if facial cleanser and my 50 year old face looks tighter and firmer. My college age daughter uses it and keeps her acne prone skin clear and reduced the scarring on her fair skin. I highly recommend
B007A4N5G0|5|i have very fair complexion and this staff works great for me.i'm putting a small amount around my face and neck in the evening and when i wake up in the morning i can see a natural looking, tanning glow.it does stink a little bit,but i guess every tanning does,beside that the smell is manageable,so overall i'm very happy with this item.
B006O71I9K|5|This is the best stuff I've ever used. Been using it since my grandfather recommend it years ago. Great product for a great price.
B000ZX5LTM|4|Helps with razor burn quite a bit. I've not found a better product for the price. I recommend and will continue to reorder!
B0081NLRE6|5|This stuff is amazing!  It is gentle yet effective and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth! And at the department store it it between 35 and 45 dollars!!!
B0045K6H1M|5|Great price. Excellent products.
B00021PEOY|5|Fast shipping, and great product.  I had bought this fragrance at a large department store and the bottle was much smaller and about the same price.  This bottle from [...] was MUCH larger and smelled the same, even though described as \\"sample.\\"  I purchased it due to the reviews, and I AM NOT disappointed.  I would DEFINITELY buy from this merchant again.  Very pleased.
B001OMVB38|5|This stuff lathers quick and thick. It leaves a pleasant after smell. It's still soap so it may dry your face a bit.
B000KP5BA4|5|The color is VERY dark, but not quite black. The formula is smooth, not too dry nor too gooey. Retouch after eating is a must. Sorry.
B00KOCKGCG|5|Best body wash on the market!
B0020MM7WU|5|If red had a color, it would smell like this.
B00JGN2HU8|1|Not for people with sensitive skin.
B00NV7V602|2|Color, what is shown in the picture, is misleading. The one I got was more of a dark and navy blue (which is slightly different to black actually) I should have gone with the writing than the picture  actually ! And its too dry too..not very flexible to apply.
B00021DJ1E|5|This is such a great blush, I can use it, my teenage daughter can use it and it really looks good on almost all complexions. It is worth the price, because although the color isn't heavy the pigmentation is.<br /><br />I actually save money on this blush, because prior to the wonderful color I had to mix a sheer peach and pink blush. It is well worth the expense, it won't end up in the trash.<br /><br />Jillian@AmericanBeautyAdvisor.com
B002BTETIC|3|this is a well made quality mirror.  Unfortunately the light is not bright enough for me.  I need to use this in a poorly lit room and it just does not have enough oomph.  other than that, I think this is a fine product and would recommend it for a room with already adequate lighting.
B004TGWRV6|3|Don't work as promised. I put it on and I get headaches.
B001QB7JM4|3|I used multiple trials done by bloggers to determine that this was the color that I was going for.  It gives a great glow, but there are a few downsides.  One, you have to push it up from the bottom like a rocket-pop, but, unlike the frozen treat there is no nifty stick. At least in my case, the product has seeped through and I get color on my fingers every time I have to push it up.  This may be my fault for leaving it in a warm car once or twice, but I feel that the moist nature of the product will eventually result in this no matter what.  Secondly, this color is Strongggg, if you're looking for subtle or natural, it only takes a few dabs.  This however, in my case, is again a messy proposition.  The stick is chubby, and I need just the tip of an edge to get what I need from it.  I've started using a dappling brush to apply, and then fingers to blend.
B0019AA9YM|5|good price for the real deal, beware of buying hair product online but not from these guys, its the good stuff.
B000FFYMYU|5|It has been a great item and I have used it much.
B004INEX3U|5|I've been using Loreal Melting Gel for over 15 years.  I have short, curly and extremely frizzy hair and it definitley keeps the frizzies in check. And the price is right compared to other gels or products like this.
B007MNYY14|1|From the reviews I can see this works for a lot of people, but for me it absolutely did not.  My hair was a greasy, tangled mess that only got worse.  I tried the Oily hair formula too, but had the same nasty results.  It nearly scared me off &#34;no poo&#34; cleansers.<br /><br />I gave DevaCurl No Poo a try at the suggestion of my stylist, and I absolutely love it.  It worked great on my hair.  I'd been having issues with other lathering shampoos... brand after brand.  Tangly hair, bad texture, my scalp couldn't decide if it was oily or dry...  My hair is baby fine with some natural curl and prone to frizz.  The Deva No Poo leaves my hair and scalp clean, my hair feels silky and healthy, and calms the frizz.  You don't have to have curly hair to use it either, it works on all types.  And it smells great.<br /><br />If this doesn't work for you, Deva Curl might.  Personally I can't say anything about Wen because I haven't tried it, but my stylist's sister, also a stylist, loves Wen and uses it religiously.  She uses Deva Curl No Poo if she runs out of Wen between shipments, so apparently they both work for her.
B0000536Y7|5|nothing better in terms of exfoliation
B00AFSJWEW|5|Best solid gel win win
B005LP5AA4|2|I try this cause saw a lot of before and after picture of a lot of people. I didn't saw any loss of inches at all the only thing i saw change it was the stretch mark that they fade a little bit but that was it. I was very disappointed
B002C92122|5|Love this fragrance!  Always get compliments when I where it.
B005OZC2MU|4|Love it...
B003UF0RB4|3|Went thru a bottle of this before realizing it had alcohol and parabens in it. I try to avoid those things. It was gentle on my skin, but at what cost? I'd rather find something without parabens and alcohol. Why do so many of these products contain alcohol anyway? How is that good for your skin? It's not.
B00161K26O|5|High quality, sharp, straight forward clippers. Doesn't have a file - I prefer clippers without a cheap file, anyway.
B000141XQA|4|The wax is great but I am not convinced by the creams that come with
B001GS6OB4|5|perfect.  Once or twice a week a quick once over and done!  LOVE IT  not like epilady of the '80;s where it yanked everything out.  smooth and quick
B000052YQ2|5|Excellent product.  Used this brand for more than 20 years.  My skin is clear and looks great!
B00B5DVYYC|4|i have used this a few times and so far so good. i'm about 2 months into a keritin treatment, and was running out if $$ salon shampoo, so i was taking a chance. love the tube, easier and safer for traveling. the salon stuff has a stylish bottle that opens easily in a suitcase, luckily it was in a zip-loc. there went $ of my $$ product investment. this shampoo seems to work as well as the pricy one. i'm going to buy the conditioner as well.
B00NV5QEEC|1|I had ordered this with the wing ear cuffs, got them at the same time as eachother, also with major issues. Te cuff i received wasn't the one pictured the one i got was similar but had a post on it and a wrap to go around the top of your ear which doesn't work unless you are an elf or jus have small ears it's that narrow a gap between the wrap and the dragon design. Also the post was bent beyond fixing it after i got my second order with the second order of &#34;wings&#34; i tried it very carefully on the first and it broke almost instantly. When i got my second order it was exactly the same as the first narrow wrap bent post not the cuff pictured the whole nine yards. I'm seriously glad i got my money back and from no on will triple check so i never buy from this company again.
B0001YXXUY|2|I have owned two Hot Tools hot air brushes in the last 5 years, same model.  My first one seemed to have gotten a short in it so I had to  stop using it because it would stop.  I thought I would try another one to see if this one pooping out was a fluke.  I have used my second one even less and it didn't last half the time as the other one before doing the same thing.  Poor quality which is highly disappointing from Hot Tools.  Customer service is weak in that the warranty isn't long at all and then you have to pay to have it fixed and shipped back.  Love the brush otherwise.   Just not worth your money since it is short lived.
B00C2P3JO0|5|My baby had baby rash all over his body and it started spreading to his scalp. His pediatrician recommended this and after a couple of baths, his rash began to clear up
B000JQQHSE|5|this striaghtening iron i got for my wife and it works great to my knowledge
B0030FCEUQ|1|OK, yes, I thought WOW -- $4 for that bottle of cologne!  It must be too good to be true.  Well it is.  4 oz. is the SHIPPING WEIGHT.  But what you will receive in the mail is a .08 oz SAMPLE vial -- you know, the sample vials that are typically given away for free.  Be warned!
B004N79BYC|4|Nice big bag, just what I needed.
B00LLND0BQ|4|The order was delivered in a timely manner and was exactly we hat I had hoped for.
B009PZF7WM|5|These extensions worked great
B0034UBHNM|5|I received a sample of this from a local Avon representative. I used it and fell in love with it. I have very sensitive skin and can't use allot of products that are on e market. It doesn't matter if ey are low in price or expensive. This cream is light weight. Not heavy like allot of moisturizers out there. I had no break outs and the cream is not greasy at all. If you have acne prone sensitive skin this is the product for you. I also use the night cream that is paired with this. It also works great.
B001EJMS9M|5|Great.
B00008X5CH|4|Williams has always made the best shaving soap, unless you know how to make your own!
B00K4PLC30|4|Great for skin but the main reason I got it was to mix with caster oil and sesame oil for scalp and hair. Have used the combo once and it was pretty effective. Will try to use every couple of weeks.
B00479L6F8|5|Product is as described. I have 4a hair this stuff is great for restoring moisture.
B00022WA9K|5|My wife loves it.
B00K09TZ3E|5|My go to, everyday gel color. Love it!
B0064RU5ZI|5|I went from very bad to very good dental check-ups with this product. At first, I was not sure about using the powder, but after using it a few times, I got so I actually looked forward to brushing my teeth with it because my teeth felt like I just had them cleaned at the dentist. I also recommend the mouthwash. I could drink that stuff. The company tells me that it is so pure that if I did drink it -- it would be healthy for me. Of course, they don't recommend doing that.
B000JPMHWK|4|They are sharp but hurt my face for a couple of times. Would they be safer?
B00VGF6JJY|5|Product was as advertised and was sent promply
B001FXUTUM|1|This pulls all your hair out at one time. The problem is it does not pull hairs out by the root, but by the tip. So this makes it painful and causes in-grown hairs. I hardly ever get in-grown hairs and they were terrible after I used.
B001WWUUBY|5|I have been using bare minerals for a year or so now, I bought the starter set first time out, and when it came to replace the stuff I ran out of(blush seems to last forever, as you use so little of it) it ended up being comparable to just but another starter kit.Happily there is a little twist to open/protect you from spilling powder everywhere thingy on the inside of the containers, which was a great bonus, since my last set didn't have anything of the sort and was kind of messy.<br />this kit lasts me over 6 months, with daily application of makeup. It is a very good deal and I get compliments often on my make-up.
B000OP3DIM|5|Smells like the beach to me. Sooo good. Not as waxy as other normal chapsticks. Seems like its all natural ingredients (although i havent checked the company) id use this to replenish moisture but not to protect against wind
B00027DMI8|4|I just started to use this for like a week and I like it so far, some times it burns a little but that it is it.
B001KYO30I|5|Great product and price!
B003QCRRNC|5|Favorite eye make up remover. Starting using when i wore contact lenses as its pil free and still using 10 years later.
B004TSFBNK|4|They are good quality brushes. I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought the largest brush would be a good powder brush but it's actually quite small. If you are prepared for that than you should be very pleased but to be honest I wish I would have skipped this set and just bought the single powder brush.
B0002JKQ5S|5|This is the only set of curlers which will make a lasting curl in my fine, straight hair. Have used  other kinds  with no success. A set lasts 2 years or so. Lightweight for travel.
B0050RUUZ8|5|I absolutely LOVE these lashes. Red Cherry is a great brand for false lashes. The band at the base is very flexible and is pretty easy to camouflage. I also love that the strip is very long. It's easier to trim the band if it doesn't fit your eye than it is to add length to a band that ends in an awkward place and makes it obvious you're wearing false lashes. #42 looks very natural on me but also adds length and a bit of volume. I like the very subtle spikes. I'm someone who wears false lashes every day and this is one of my everyday lashes. I have other styles that I use for a more dramatic look. If you're not the type of person to wear lashes every day, Red Cherry #42 will add a bit of glamour for a special occasion too.
B00BUHL4O8|5|Excelente
B0018QHWD8|5|I have dry olive skin.  This color and texture is perfect for me.  The product &#34;slides&#34; on well with my under-eye cream and blends really well with my skin tones.  I use a nice make-up brush designed for liquids.  It doesn't glop-up or crease.
B008M7N9EW|3|thought they were a little too small
B00D42KZQU|5|Smells great and arrived shortly after I placed the order.
B007WL2UL2|5|Lightweight and easy to apply, adheres well with clear polish. I especially like that they have a bit of flexibility, so that they can be applied at all different angles of the nail. I do not have artificial nails so I can;t say how they hold on gels and acrylics, but great on natural nails. I didn't get many of the silver (which is really what I wanted) and a few more of the Hello Kitty than I would have wanted (I didn't really want those), but cannot beat the price. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
B006LT7A7U|5|Was for my mom and she's hasn't any  bad comment so far
B008D5JRL2|5|Use this product every morning as my routine. Went out of town and two other friends saw and tried it now they are hooked. So much better than most expensive brands I use. Definitely a rebuy.
B003O2N6T8|5|I am a WEN user, but the WEN tea tree has been turning my silver hair slightly yellow. Just got this and used it today. Gives my hair a great shine. The smell is great and not overwhelming. Even lathers a little without sulfate. Keeping this product. I'm becoming a fan.
B000UWAWQU|4|I cannot understand why I was not informed about this product by my dentist or hygienist all these years. The water flushes out particles even after flossing and brushing!! I love this.<br />I don't like the water going down my wrist and arm while in use and the awful noise it makes when the tank runs low. Also, I am forever trying to plug it in and hitting the on button by accident with spray shooting everywhere. If there is another item like this without these impediments, I would switch. But overall, my teeth are fantastically cleaner, now. Since they are very close together, this is real progress for me and much appreciated.
B00W3K8AKC|5|Really amazing for the price. Goes on creamy and doesn't flake as much as other mascaras. I have allergies and regularly have watery eyes and sometimes touch them throughout the day so having this mascara that stays on and doesn't flake off into my eyes is really important. Makes my eyelashes really long and isn't chunky
B00517W47O|5|My husband is enjoying his new shaver.
B000GBICYE|5|My family has several different Oral B electric toothbrush models. All give us that just polished feeling that one gets at the dentist! I prefer the models that have the 2 min auto timer, as it encourages spending that extra time to get all surfaces clean. The electric unit and timer are particularly useful for young children and older folks who may be suffering with limited hand dexterity due to arthritis and sore joints. I have given up manual toothbrushes forever and even take the Oral B when I travel. A full charge will easily last a week.     I have noticed the children have fewer new cavities when they use their electric Oral B. It also promotes healthy gums. Although we were able to share one base unit with our own individual brush heads at home, each child was sent away to college with a new electric Oral B to maintain that dentist visit polish every day!     Of course the unit and brush heads cost more than a manual brush, but for sparkling teeth, fewer cavities, healthy gums, fresher breath--a real bargain!
B000FYVOJC|4|The blades are getting dull soon.there unfortunately is no part replacement for it
B002XITX8C|5|Very nice fragrance.
B003A88KDS|5|I think the fact that I bought 10 of them speaks for itself. This colour is nice and natural and I like to wear it when I don't want to put on all the makeup. A bit of mascara and a bit of Beige Infallible and off I go. Great for when I do field work too!
B008NCXZ4A|5|The best shampoo for fine hair! I have been a Cosmetologist for a long time and used many products. This is great.
B001443PLC|3|NOT for super thick and kinky hair...
B00NGOR01E|5|I love Lime Crime makeup! This color is so pretty and the product stays on great!
B004F7G4M2|5|My husband has sensitive skin and since using this shaving cream, he's had no rashes or discomfort.  The down side is that it can be hard to find.  So glad we checked on Amazon, as now we won't need to 'shop' in stores for this staple of our home!
B00E68O4JU|5|It can take a few minutes to complete, as only small portions of hair can be tsken at a time, but beautiful loose curls are created. My daughter has lots of thin fine hair.
B008DSM74I|3|The one I received is different from the one pictured.  It works fine, but the picture is misleading.
B00IEVCL72|4|vibrant color
B000KE6VIG|3|i have a very low thyroid. hypothyrodism for 3 years iv never lost any weight. my hair falls out im very very overweight have a slow metabolism. im not myself im always depressed. i dont enjoy life. my throats always sore my hair is AWFUL. iv tried every diet going. im currently on a steady dose of 250mcg thyroXine. its rubbish. iv just started taking thyroMine going to see how it goes. is there anyone out there with a thyroid as low as mine that thyroMine has worked for id love to know. thanks x
B00DME0HWC|5|Fantastic cream..It keeps your skin soft and non greasy...I have been using it for some time and will continue to do so.
B002R1CODG|5|I love it ...Goes on nice.. looks amazing!  Shipping was super fast. ..it was a lot smaller than I expected but. .. Its a great product so I'm ok with it. .
B000YGDRIW|5|Have been using Eucerin products since they were recommended to me by my dermatologist.  They work, are not full of perfume and for the price, you get a reasonable size tube.  Not the cheapest for sure but in my opinion, worth the extra $.
B00DPE9EQO|4|I was skeptical but after I tried it I really could see a difference in a week hope to continue seeing a difference
B001PMM3BG|5|Order came pretty quick. Product was legitimate.
B000EGK56O|5|I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER 20 YEARS..THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR DRY SKIN AND CLEARING UP SCRATCHES, BURNS AND OTHER SKIN DISCOLORING OF THE SKIN..THIS IS GOOD FOR MAKING YOUR FEET SOFT, ELBOWS SMOOTH AND FACE CLEAR OF BLEMISHES,,
B00JVZNYDU|1|Not very pigmented at all. It will take you a couple coats to even have it applied evenly. Came on time. It doesn't have have a bad smell. It actually smells like cocoa. Disappointed with the outcome of the product over all.  Wasn't what I thought it would be at all.
B00BN1RG0C|5|I LOVE this stuff. I love the feel of my skin after scrubbing and the scent is just so wonderful. MUST follow with the matching scented bodydew. ;)
B00FJ2WY0I|4|I'm ordering an other soon!!!! Waiting for my lace head band it's a little small but defiantly worth it because it's cute
B00GGZR9ZW|5|I love this nail polish, the picture doesn't do it justice. I have lots of nail polish and have been looking for a holographic color. This one is great, goes on easy and with a good top coat lasts for over a week. I liked it so much I ordered more right away. The color is just awesome. Try it ladies.
B00OK0I7U6|2|Cheaply made but you get what you pay for. :-(  I don't even us it.
B00006IVEN|3|Came with all the parts.  The color difference makes organizing it easier.  It is easy to use. Over all it is good for what paying for it.
B002SV5MBQ|5|This stuff smells amazing. I love the packaging and how it is put together. Plus I got a great deal than in the store!
B00517W45G|3|does not give a close enough shave-as reported by my husband
B0056YGW2A|5|This is amazing. I was using Rohto Ice for a couple days prior to receiving my Z! Pro. I really loved the Ice, but after receiving and using the Z! Pro a couple times, holy crap what a difference it makes. Unlike other reviewers or the pictures depict, my packaging came with the indication that this was not just a 7 on the intensity scale, but actually &#34;8+&#34; which I believe. For me it did not feel any colder or mintier, but rather that addicting &#34;freeze&#34; lasted much longer. Along with that, my eyes simply have never felt/looked better. I got a Playstation 4 recently, and apparently TV gaming makes my large sensitive eyes very irritated either due to less blinking or focal strain. Rohto Ice was doing the job better than any other prior eye drops I had tried, but Rohto Z! Pro is just freaking amazing. Perhaps ease yourself into it with something like Ice or Hydra, or if you're feeling trustworthy in your fellow reviewers, just go for it and get the Z! Pro. It is absolutely indescribable.
B00011JKCW|4|I do like this color, but not by itself.  It would take too many coats to be very opaque on its own, but it looks FANTASTIC as a top coat for other purples.  It dries fast and is good quality, but by itself it's a little sheer and streaky.
B0006UCDYU|5|I've used the Thymes Goldleaf for many years and never get tired of it.  I've tried their other fragrances but always come back to this one.  It's worth the splurge.
B002CMLS46|5|I first bought this item from my hairstylist who recommended I try.  This leaves no crunchy feel and you do not have to worry about it drying out your hair.  Like all of the MoroccanOil products the smell is wonderful!  I run through my hair and let my hair dry naturally and it leaves my curly hair soft yet shows curl definition.  Well worth the money!  This is the best hair cream for curly hair that I have ever found.
B00373HS02|1|I regret I did not believe others saying it doesn't work. I thought I'm smart and will manage to make it work. It turns out to be impossible. This little piece can't be called curler to begin with. It has some similar shape, but it does not work in a similar way, Please do not waste your money, you will regret it like I did.
B006W2SYHG|4|Its a good product for regular shaves (Daily or once in 2-3 days) only. Might take some time to get used though, if you haven't used  circular blade type of design before. Ideal for replacing your daily shaving blades.
B002L1B6P4|2|was not very good,  cheaply made, did not last long, had to replace after a few months.
B00KP5TS4Y|5|It got here extremely fast and the seller is very concerned that buyers are satisfied.  It appears to be exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I haven't used it yet but I don't have any doubts it will work.  Items are sturdily made.
B000RZPVV6|5|Awesome
B000C230QM|5|Love it!
B00DIFGS1Y|3|I think one of the ingredients in this product does not agree with my skin, Contrary it's review,  the 2nd week I started using it, I didn't see any lightening effect on my skin, instead of the lightening effect, I developed urticaria rashes all over. I still have the spots till now. By the time the lotion arrived, I had to call for its return.
B004BGQWTM|5|This tint is great; very natural looking, did not sting, burn or irritate my skin, looks very natural, the brush just makes it go on so much more evenly and easier to work with.  Would definitely recommend purchasing the brush if you are going to purchase the tint.
B0032322XA|5|This nailpolish remover works really well and really fast - so much better than other ones I've bought from the drugstore. Plus, it was the same price through Amazon prime as if I had bought it at a store.
B00IQWAO5A|5|I like the eye shadow. Smooth and easy to use. Feels nice stays on all day. Shipping was fast . Arrived in perfect condition. Will order again. Colors are very pretty. I have not found a product I did not like!
B009HLB56Q|5|Great
B00163NK9I|5|I love this color and OPI makes such great nail polish. This color is still really popular and looks great on anyone I think!
B000C1UBFQ|5|love it, amazing smell!
B008Q0E714|5|I have three different stamp plate brands and they all fit perfectly.  Great way to keep them organized and easy way to see them for clients. Quality is nice.
B0082Z6CNY|5|Great value, would definitely buy again.
B002K8SCQ4|4|Great for quick wipe downs
B00KWFDBKE|5|I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIAS REVIEW, I loved this product because my face felt smooth and so clean after uses, I have bought 2 bottles since, Im addicted to using the vitamin c serum.
B0060PA7A2|5|great
B003S516XO|5|Came on time love love love I brought this flatiron awhile bk and it was recently stolen I had to get another1
B00LMIVLXY|5|This is a great product if you are blow drying your hair. It will protect your hair from the heat and make it look smooth and shiny. Also it is easy to apply by spraying it evenly onto your hair.
B0001TJIYO|5|this product is great. its been really making my skin clear up and also allowing for my skin to look brighter and healthier.
B00JFSET0A|1|Smell horrible and tangles. Will not buy again, and I don't recommend
B001JQLNJ6|5|This bodywash is really creamy and thick, not runny like so many out there.  This is good, for one, because you will be less likely to waste much of it from over-pouring.  It's also good because the soap is really smooth and feels enriching.    The scene is very nice, with a not overpowering aroma of cocoa butter.  The soap also leaves the skin with a bit of sparkle (from the \\"ribbons\\" I imagine.)    All in all, it will come as close as soap can to making one feel they've showered after a relaxing day at the beach.      Nice.  It leaves skin feeling good and moisturized.
B00CVK1L0K|5|Great Dry shampoo, good smell. Always wish there was more in a can though. I color my hair and use it to extend the time in between shampoos and it does a great job without leaving a lot of residue.
B00E3AZPHQ|5|smells good.
B00GTZCKXA|1|I was warned that when you order these tanning bed lotions on line with Amazon you don't really know if its the original authentic product and I didn't believe it but they were absolutely  correct!  I used it once and I broke out in major red bumps on my body and I showed the employee who works there and she said this is not the correct color of the product or the way it smells.  So I threw it away. I wasted $26.10 on a fake product and I knew this was too good to be true.<br /><br />I am reluctant to do business with amazon due to this experience.<br /><br />Jill DeProto<br />jill@riverhomes.com
B001ET76GW|4|Bought for friend. She use it to smooth her baby and think it's quite good for that!
B002R3A4L8|5|Love it! Unique. ..a scent that people wonder what perfume it is.
B00K9081KW|5|Great
B000A3ZNA4|5|I love the color ,It looks very natural ,and stays in very nicely for a red,it's very well priced,it's a great product
B0043DMNHS|5|Husband loves it.  Works great!
B002AQC88Y|4|It didn't match up to the product I bought directly from the creator, but, it will suffice...I don't use it as much as the original.
B002KDNN8G|5|I have very thick 3c hair. I was so tired of using a million products to control, moisturize, stretch, and curl my hair... well now I can just use one. I wish I would have found this products years ago, I have spent so much money on products since I grew my perm out 6 years ago. Now all I do is wash and conditon my hair, rinse with medium cool water..add just a tiny scoop of pure coconut oil and then apply this product. It works great when I finger comb it threw for even distrubution and then twirl it around my fingers in little chunks. My curls last for 3 days without getting frizzy, I can wear it down for 2 days and then an updo on the third. The best part about this product is that even when my hair is wet I don't have a jerry curl drip. I am so looking forward to warm weather now.
B001QT8CVI|1|This stuff sucks. I got the shampoo and conditioner sample of this in the mail. I liked the scent and light feel of the shampoo and conditioner but when I got out of the shower I had to have my boyfriend help me get out all the knots from my hair. My hair was dry and knotty and my boyfriend said something weird, he said, \\"It doesn't feel bouncy and moisturized\\" as he helped me brush it. I even brushed my hair BEFORE showering to remove any knots and it came out knotty and dry. I will stick to Aussie.
B00CHOXN74|2|It feels watery and I'm not sure if it's actually Mary Kay; I ended up ordering Mac from the Mac website!
B00CO0VEE0|5|I got what i order got It for a present I think she will like it very impreset to the one.
B006QO4BRM|4|I have been doing my own gel manicures. This works perfectly for my needs, however when others comment that it not the most stable I would agree. The lights are barely in there, so keep it in a fixed location...<br /><br />Other than that, no complaints, my nails come out just fine!
B000NNAPIG|5|love it.. it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
B0094X4ZMI|5|I received one bottle of Rosehip Oil to review!  I absolutely love Rosehip Oil, it makes my skin look the best it has ever looked!  At night I put Rosehip Oil on my face and neck, about 30 minutes before I go to bed, then I put shea butter on top of that.  The results are quite amazing.  My fine lines have pretty well vanished, which makes me love the Rosehip Oil all the more!  I can't say enough about this AWESOME oil, but I'm very please with it and I would highly recommend it!
B007ZH6TVA|5|This file is exactly like the one I purchase for myself in 1968 and I love it.  I threw my original file away over five years ago because it finally became dull.  I don't see any difference with Made in USA vs. Made in China.  So happy to have another (I ordered two).
B0043OYFKU|5|thanks
B006U7NSO2|5|Works great.
B004HR93DW|5|Goes on beautifully. The color is lovely. I prefer it over lipstick now. I urge others to buy this.
B0077PLO60|2|I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond for around the same price. My mom said that she used to have an epilady,but had recently thrown it out because even though she said it work amazingly and you didn't have to pass over the same area multiple times, it was just to painful.We looked at this brand because it had very good reviews and frankly I can't see why. Even after multiple passes up, down, and side-to-side most hair was not removed. I understood not all hair would be removed but I could barely see the difference. If I buy another one these I want to at least be worth the ingrown hairs!
B00AY3S924|4|Looks natural. . But not for large heads
B000V0X61O|5|I purchased Jessica Mcclintock Eau de Parfum Spray for my wife and she still loves it. She has tried several different perfumes over the years but Jessica is still her favorite and I like it best on her by far. Got this product at a great price at amazon, who else?
B007Y91RRA|5|This is the best lip balm I have run into so far. It wasn't too sticky like lip gloss but not to dry like most lip balms. The wooden stick it came with was very useful. Also, the lip balm looked a lot like real honey which was amazing. The lip balm also moisturized my lips perfectly. It also lasted of my lips for quite a long period of time.The lip balm came also in a very cute container. I would recommend this product to everyone. This stuff is awesome!!!!!!
B00TTUTRJC|5|I love this conditioner! It's a great product and worth buying again!
B005FYJB92|5|Love this nude one of the best nudes I have. I wear this with everything.
B008769CEY|5|This product work like magic, in a short time (approx. 3 weeks) I started to see a noticeable improvement in my lashes. My lashes became longer and shiny with a beautiful slight black line in the bottom lashes line \\" idk why or how my lashes line became to be pigmented\\" but its already there; and it exactly look like when the eyeliner traces left there after removing your eye makeup, though the color of the serum is transparent. Well, I am still in the beginning but I'm happy of what I see now. The final result should be after 18 weeks so I still have long way to achieve it. will wait and see : )
B005K49XXQ|5|Fangtastic I brain multiple of them, they make me look like Monster High characters, I call them, I can do multiple things with them, & I love the beads they make me look so gorgeous and I love it! :-)
B001KYWEAY|5|This is an amazing product. I just can't believe that when my wife STOPS using this, her hair starts falling out in piles. But its just too expensive for a 8.45 ounce bottle. It does not foam as much and she does not use a conditioner afterward. Make sure to shake the bottle.
B00WXPUDUW|5|I use this every day all over.  It is fragrance free, which is nice if you'd like to add your own scent.  I love the consistency of this oil.  The mini bottle &#34;spritzer&#34; is great if you only need a little oil.  I normally use mineral oil on a daily basis, but like this oil much better.
B00AWR9AVQ|3|Not as impressed with this product as I thought I would be. I have tried it on dry and wet hair. Wet is ok. If you spray on dry, it made it almost greasy.
B00QQ7SU6M|2|It fits lots of stuff but it lacks in quality. Mine started tearing on a seam right after I started using it. I would pay a little more to get better quality.
B00FB3WZXG|5|Pretty cool. On time delivery
B004D2C57M|5|this is the best I have ever used. Roc has now been replaced. My 55 year old skin loves it and I had no drying or trouble with using it every day.
B0044Y51UW|5|best dental tool I have ever used
B005FYKCKE|5|For the last couple years,I had eczema around my eyes,nose and mouth. I tried several products, but they just seemed to irritate my skin rather than help it. Grandma's Rash Remedy apparently has mild yet effective ingredients that sooth my skin, and my eczema is gone. I am so thankful to have found this great product!(review by Brian's wife)
B00B88TM98|2|It is not really doing anything for my libido.  It is not what I expected.  I used it a few times already and did not get the desire I was looking for.  Sorry did not work for me.
B0018SAJAY|5|Really love this, for my old skin.  It really stays on all night.  Exactly what I need in the tropics, as always have the fan on.
B00HMEBRKO|5|My husband loves using this shaver and we had to buy a second one cause the children over twisted the handle and broke the piece that holds the blade housing on.
B0017OLP5W|4|Super cute, love how it hangs on the mirror
B0012EF9NQ|5|i have very fine, curly hair so products are very important to me.  I'm new to sulfate-free products so I can't compare this shampoo to anything :(  BUT I did like it...My hair is super soft & shiny using this.
B0096FNGSS|5|my granddaughter loved this
B00006ANDK|4|...and gets into those hard to reach places due to the size of the head.  Brushes are soft and leave your teeth feeling brand new.
B00EEEPGAC|5|He fell in love with this soap while we were staying at a Sonesta hotel.  He often has issues with commercial soap regarding smell and stripping his skin.  Not the case with this beautiful soap.  He was so happy to open it Christmas morning (and surprised that I called the hotel to get the brand!!)
B00OR1IL68|5|Love it. As soon as I put it on i felt the tightness under my eyes . it has helped with the puffiness and dark circles because I always have that . works great i would reccomend it . I got this as a sample from karma reviews but I thinking I will buying this in the future
B00PXDWR6O|4|Verified Purchase<br />  While I do like this item, I give it mixed reviews. Around my 10th day of use, I did, in fact, develop a localized breakout around my chin, & sides of face when used it with another moisturizer. Right away i used my Dead Sea Mineral soap to stop any more breakouts, & went back to my old faithful, Radha Eye Gel serum, on my whole face.<br />  This is where it gets interesting. The bottle was lying around unused for a couple days in the bedroom, & my husband got his hands on it. He RAVES on the change in his appearance!! He uses it 2 times per day for 2 weeks & he really does look younger!!  His face is full of color, he has a brighter complexion, & I see a new change in him almost every day, and he has NEVER had a breakout or skin irritation of any kind. He is running low now, & asked me to order him another bottle asap.  I read about some factory-issues over the bottle caps. but neither my hubby or I didn't have problems with that. THX RADHA!
B00IJ7EM78|1|Cheap... Couldn't fasten the back once I put it in my ear.
B00HB2ARDU|2|The titanium trimmer head is hard and cold against your face. I've tried a lot of trimmers, and this was was sent straight back for a refund. Also note the 'LCD' is actually just a sticker that looks like an LCD. The head is also narrow so gets less work done in each pass. I recommend a plastic comb trimmer like the Conair i-Stubble (non LCD version).
B00JX979CQ|5|Keeps my hands soft.
B004Y9MCNQ|3|Color is too light. Doesn't look like you have blush on.
B003LA90RU|5|My Grand daughter was breaking out, I used Noxzema when I was young and decided to give it to her to try, it is working beautifully, the original breakout is almost gone and there is no new ones.  She loves it also.<br /><br />I will definitely recommend it.
B002XITY5Y|5|I have always used Bijan and this is just a slight difference from the original. A fragrance to change off with. I still receive compliments when I wear this fragrance! I would recommend!
B0027VCNGO|4|I use this mainly because of how fast the drying time is. The shine it gives is also amazing, almost gel like. It also works wonderfully to fix most imperfections made from eneven nail polish painting and whatnot. But the biggest downside to seche vite however is that it shrinks most of my nail polishes (mainly essie and sinful colors), it seems to do fine with my opi's though. The smell is pretty strong and appalling as well.
B001V9LUQ2|5|I have been using this toner for over 2 years now and I love it.
B00H319IFC|2|I read all the reviews & was prepared for the nasty smell. Boy was it terrible. They're really cute though, but one of them came broken. & the piece wasn't even in the bag, so i know it was broken before it was shipped. I'll keep the other one, hopefully spraying it & airing it out will help with the smell. The one that's broken I'll have to throw away.
B001SBCG5C|5|this product came within a few days. delivery was great. i was cautious about the different sized bottle, but when i read other reviews that going with a bigger bottle is better, since you get more for your dollar, i decided to go ahead. i thought maybe there was a chance that the bottle would have a seal broken or something, since it's not a standard size, but it came sealed with a plastic outer covering and everything. i didn't bother to comment on the proactive product itself, since if you're considering buying this big bottle, you probably already know if proactiv works for you.
B00LRXJ56E|5|I have not seen results yet because I just got it but hopefully it will do what it suppose to do for my hair.
B004AI5IWI|5|We like this brand of flossers.  They are sturdy, the floss doesn't come loose. The pick end is quite sharp but I consider that good - it needs to 'pick' things so blunt won't do it.  Couldn't find them in local stores so we tried others, and went back to these.
B001ET76AI|5|I am so tired of this Listerin burning mint flavors - why do we have to put up with it? Please try this soft, mild rinse - that keep you feel clean but you dont have to burn your gums! this is mine forever -
B00SM82ATQ|1|Just so you all know, these are fake 5 star reviews. Warning you ahead of time. Not sure why Amazon allows this. Click on the reviewers, as this is the only one item they've reviewed. Coincidence? I don't think so.
B001KYO0NS|5|Shimmering Onyx is essential for fall 2013's &#34;Smoky Eye&#34; look.  It's especially beautiful for evening wear, and flatters any eye color.  This single kit gives you a lasting supply and is well worth its modest cost for an eye shadow product.  Highly recommend!
B000F8FBTW|5|Great product but pricey when purchased locally. With free shipping and no tax it is a meaningful discount. Do not over look the 1 gallon size as a refill.
B00AVZPZJK|5|About 40 years ago Pert sent me a \\"sample\\" of their new shampoo. What an idea,, combining a shampoo and conditioner in ONE bottle !!! Being basically lazy and using a brand that required separate bottles ,, for me,, it was a \\"No brainer\\" and have used Pert 2 in 1 ever since.<br /><br />Pert started selling a THREE in ONE, tried it out when I was in the U.S. and decided it was a \\"lazy mans\\" dream. Shampoo/conditioner and smell good all in ONE PACKAGE.<br /><br />Noticed the September 2014 price is about 20% higher than what I'd paid in July 2014. No inflation in the U.S. ?
B00G5L89JM|5|Perfect replacement brushes.
B000FED5DK|4|I like the G380. I have used it only about 5 times now, but it works fine for me. The only reason I give it 4 is because the hair and beard attachments are of delicate quality and I feel like they can break if I am not too careful (but I don't see why I would misuse them in the first place). The ear/nose attachment is not very good either. Doesn't cut hair as well as I would like it too. If you want something cheap that cuts your hair this is good. If you want something more heavy duty, try something else.
B000TCU7JS|5|A friend uses a Lancome eye cream sold at Macy's which seems to work well but costs around $80 for 1/2 ounce.  This product works on me and I have received comments about my eyes looking a lot better than before using it.  For around $20 a half ounce, it's a real bargain.  Supposedly the Brazilian plant product in it has been proven to work according to the Mayo Clinic.
B0018N1TT4|5|I love Dolce & Gabbana The One.  Although this is &#34;for women,&#34; I like wearing it because the scent is not too feminine.  Perfect scent.  Sexy and romantic.  I get a lot of attention (in a good way) when wearing this.
B007IM3RZI|5|My daughter loves this stuff!! She has fine, blonde hair and it air dries nicely after using these products
B000PKUZ0K|5|I love this product.  My skin has a healthy glow just after using the body wash once!  Couldnt be happier.  Now I know I can buy the large sizes and get great results.
B00G9XOYMM|5|my coworker like it a lot
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Excellent!
B002QI4R2Q|5|Beautiful
B002WNEOG4|3|the shampoo is nice but the conditioner makes your hair heavy and greesy. I didnt like that. It smells wonderful too
B000I4C22C|2|Tastes disgusting. .
B00KO7UZFO|5|I've been using this for about couple weeks and it's already showing improvements. I can feel my skin firming up and I see less cellulite. And the smells really nice
B001G5HZCY|4|Good blades, can get over ten shaves out of a blade if I don't let my beard get to thick between shaves. I don't like how the have word minimums for the reviews.
B00DYZ7ZCO|4|Great shaver with only one downfall. The trimmer comes out in a weird way that it is hard to shave with because it either makes you get al of you hair everywhere or on your hands. It is just a awkward design. Otherwise everything else is great. Great swivel on the head with great battery life and charger stand. Easy to fill and replace refill. Fits in your hand and looks good.
B00BFFQMBA|5|After reading what this product contained I knew it would provide the best results. I am happy that there is such a<br /> Product out there that has a natural feel to it. I am surprised to see such great results, but am  glad  I could count on Ultrax Labs to bring me something worth the money and time. There is no nasty taste that usually comes with some of these products, so that it is a plus. Got yourself a loyal customer here, thank you!
B0017DI8QM|5|Most amazing hairspray.  I have thick but very fine hair and this product gives me lots of texture and volume. Love the autoship feature
B00GJ1UK3G|5|This massager is incredible.  I've been using it twice a day since receiving it a week ago and I can already see a difference.  Shipping was very fast as well!  I am very happy with my purchase.
B005CWJF2K|4|It smells very well, for about 1,5 days I don't need to wash my hair. It's good shampoo, but it doesn't give that extra volume that I expected.
B00H3T9YKI|4|Smells amazing and neutralizes everything.
B0092BWWG8|5|I love them they make my hair look so luminescent and gorgeous I love it! :-)
B0049LUI9O|5|No more worry about the snout
B00ELNDKUY|5|I really like this scent. After using it, my husband complimented me on how nice my hair smelled. I love all WEN products.
B003M57E9A|1|I used the soap as directed  once and I have small spots all over my face and I stopped using it,I wish they could give me back my money. I  have oily sensitive and prone to acne skin, I look terrible and don't know  what to do
B00MW7YBWM|4|Although this one is smaller than  ones I have had before, they work great! Ive use it once and actually like it better than the larger one I had previously.  Hopefully this product will last for a while. I'l keep you posted!<br /><br />It is a little painful. But after a while, you get used to it and it really isn't bad at all.
B001SXPSD2|2|Surprised how bad they hold my thin hair. Definitely not worth my money.  I am willing to pay for a good clip, these were not it.
B0000AHS9X|5|I thank you for sending my flat iron I having used it yet but it looks exactly like the picture and it was sent fast
B00H93NJLS|5|is good oil
B0018RLR7E|3|I honestly cannot tell if this is protecting my skin or not.  I use sunblock to guard against photoaging rather than just as a shield against sunburn.  One thing I do know is that this 'extra fluide' thick, sticky lotion makes my skin look like I've been sweating pure oil for ten hours when I apply it immediately after showering (the oiliness does not disappear after a few minutes/half an hour).  It is not sheer, it is not mattifying, unlike what the product description on the company website implies.<br /><br />I use it when I deem it relatively unimportant how I look--e.g. when I'm not around much people.  Although it makes my face look filthy, it does not cause my skin to redden and/or break out.  But it's a big bottle, so it will be a long while before I use it up, probably more than a year after its expiration date.
B00ISC3KVS|5|So far so good!
B005D2VGPS|5|I have always used arnica gel to treat bruises.  Now I use this oil and I really love how it works.
B0018P1T1A|5|[[ASIN:B0018P1T1A Teeth Whitening Gel 36% 4 Tubes 10ml]]<br /><br />First, the reviewer giving this one-star because of incomplete product labeling isn't taking into account that this is a STANDARD USA whitening product that had to pass FDA muster before it came on the market.<br /><br />Use this product sparingly at first so that you don't allow the jel to spill onto the soft tissues of your mouth, increase the amount as you gain confidence in filling the impression mold, and watch your teeth whiten and your smile get wider!  I have no qualms about recommending this product.
B00AU5VZAE|1|I had back surgery.  My partner had neck surgery.  We were both &#34;given&#34; these by our doctor to the tune of about $5K each billed to our insurance companies.  Does it work? Not sure.  Who can really tell?  Did my fusion heal? Yes... but who is to say it didn't heal  without the help of the stimulator? I walked on the treadmill, 30 minutes at a time, 3-5 times a day.  I followed all of their instructions.  I was not sold on this stimulator and thus did not use it as regularly as they would have liked.  Yet I recovered from a global fusion at L-5/S-1, (aka 360) which is a combined ALIF and PLIF in two back-to-back procedures (in my case anyway).<br /><br />My point in posting this is that they send the patient away with this device that they cannot buy used (from the doctor, the manufacturer or elsewhere), they charge exorbitant amounts for it to the insurance company (of which the patient pays a portion of - if not all depending on whether the insurance covered it) then it self-deactivates and you have $5K worth of junk that no one wants and, according to the poster before me, is illegal to sell.  It just makes me wonder which is the more 'illegal' activity.... overcharging the insurance and consumer for a product that has questionable results or the consumer trying to get rid of it and trying to recoup their loss?
B004AXCF06|1|The Oster Free Rider  Sucks . The Hair gets clogged up in between  the teeth just like the fast feed I thought  since  they were named Free Rider  they rode free of being  caught. If you are not a barber  you won't understand  my language. Step yall game up Oster  use to be the best and one of the only  best professional  clippers
B00EOWKTHE|5|If you want a wonderful oil for your skin this is it! I would definitely repurchase, and recommend to anyone looking to try a high quality facial oil at a decent price!
B0048NWCKQ|5|This shampoo cleans my hair and doesn't ruin my hair color.  I use it with the hydrating conditioner and hair oil, so my hair is always soft and I rarely have problems with the humidity in the air.
B0009OAHOQ|5|I bought a mini dorm fridge to go with the two cases I ordered.  This stuff gets better with age and optimal refridgeration.  It's quite the hit at my block party, I raffle a bottle off every year.
B00016X68G|5|I have been using this bar for a few weeks now (purchased locally,<br />lower price) and couldn't be more delighted and pleasantly surprised at what a fantastic product this is, what a terrific job it does on my hair - leaving it beautifully cleaned but not stripped of natural oils (which keep hair looking & feeling great), and as a bonus, it is one of the most environmentally friendly products available!<br /><br />My hair feels wonderfully clean and doesn't need an additional conditioner, since this bar doesn't strip the natural (beneficial) oils, I LOVE the light & fresh scent, and love how small a bar is compared to a bottle of regular shampoo, making it SUPER easy to pack for traveling.<br /><br />It is made from all natural ingredients & is 100% biodegradable, as well as having a small paper wrapper instead of bulky plastic to fill up garbage & landfills.<br /><br />I have not yet tried the other varieties of this shampoo bar, but definitely will be trying them as well!<br /><br />An EASY five stars for this find - one of my favorite new-to-me product discoveries in a very long time!<br /><br />You will definitely want to keep the bar someplace where it can drain well and dry completely between uses, so it will stay hard and last much longer.
B0050PWTMM|5|Love this! This is the best product for keeping your makeup intact. I have tried other products and they don't compare.
B00147FGJ8|3|This lotion was okay. Not bad, but not good either. I was not a fan of the smell. It kind of smells like your run of the mill store bought tanning lotion. From other users reviews of this product I thought it would have smelled better. It has gotten me some color though and I was very pale to begin with. I would probably not repurchase it though.
B002XQ1YOU|4|I was very pleased with the swift delivery and packaging was great. at first wife of this perfume it seemed too citrusy but as it had time to settle on my skin I love it
B0079Z48S4|4|Little too smudgy to me but I like how dark it is, overall I can wear it n not a waste.
B00CLXPMIY|5|I love the color is a deep purple that changes to a gorgeous color in the sunlight! The shipping was fast and product was well wrapped.
B00Q2DVAVM|5|Beautiful well made piece.  Secure well in medium weight hair. I am using one to secure drapes closed. Much nicer than picture can show.
B00BYKML34|3|perhaps this is why their products are so expensive, such a tiny thing and so much packaging. The product is okay, wish it were more of a moisturizing stay on product like chapstick, but it is more just a sunscreen thing, not sure would be any different to take the regular lotion and use on lips.
B0019LWTQC|5|Its tea tree oil,
B002I4Z6TG|1|Got the iron it worked great for about 4 weeks after that the iron heated only to 150 degrees, which did nothing to my hair!  Don't buy this iron it is a waste of money.  Wish I read the reviews before I purchase the iron.
B00GF1NZLY|4|About six years ago, I learned about tea tree oil when I started researching natural alternatives for acne control. Since then I've tried several different brands of tea tree oil with varying degrees of efficacy.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when the Apothecary tea tree oil arrived was the scent. It was strong--nearly overwhelming. But it was the familiar tea tree scent I'd come to appreciate, a sign of the potent stuff.<br /><br />True to its scent, this tea tree oil was potent. I've used it for several things already: a break out across my face and shoulders (when I decided against my better judgement to try a new face and body wash)--using the tip of my finger to apply it where necessary, everything was cleared up within a few days; I also used it for a small toenail infection that cropped up--that one took a bit longer, but it too was done in by this oil. Overall, this gets slotted in on my &#34;quality oils&#34; list.<br /><br />My only complaints are that it doesn't provide potency breakdown, an expiration date (it does have a &#34;bottled on&#34; date), and the eyedropper is a pain to use. I eventually just pried it out and started using my own pipette.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a sample bottle for review purposes.
B007ML4O66|5|I was expecting less when I read the reviews, but this clipper does the job fine.  Large enough handle to clip easily
B0015K9BXQ|3|... this was the third one over the few years I had to purchase for my husband. It works great and is easy to use but doesn't last that long, dies out for some reason after awhile... loses the power and battery starts dying fast. After awhile won't do the magic anymore. Until then, awesome and easy to use.
B0062PEA44|5|Works like a charm. I'm interested in using other products that Hollywood Fashion Secrets has for sale because this one was so effective.
B0079R6BD2|5|I have been highlighting my hair for years now and tried so many products to keep my hair soft,bring the shine back,and most important of all prevent our crazy hair loss...unfortunately nothing seemed to work (all products were chemical based).<br />Therefore,my sister(non-dyed hair) and I decided to use an organic based shampoo as our last hope to bring life back to our hair.<br />After extensive googling,we came across Pura d'or Hair Loss Prevention Premium Organic Shampoo with its conditioner that we decided to try since it was 100% organic and had good reviews about it.<br />This is the third time we use this shampoo since our purchase where we noticed that:<br />-our hair is absorbing the shampoo more.<br />-the conditioner makes our hair softer each time we reuse it.<br />-hair loss decreased(did not totally stop yet,we hope eventually it will stop with frequent use).<br />-the product has a pleasant scent.<br />We really love this product till now and we hope we will get the hair we always wanted with more use.<br /><br />We personally do recommend this product(with PURA d'or Organic conditioner) to every person suffering from dried stiffed up lifeless hair.
B008U1Q4DI|4|I must of received a different product from everyone else because the stones I got are way smaller than what is listed/pictured, BUT I will say that they look adorable when used (I added them to my laptop decal to make it *pop*) It arrived in about a week and a half early, which I was very pleased about. I agree with everyone who said that there was nowhere near 3000 stones, but I didn't take the time to count each and every stone, you can tell by just glancing at it. I didn't receive any doubles of a color, so overall I'd say i'm very satisfied with this product and if they continue to hold as well as they do on my laptop, I'll be ordering from this company again. :)
B00CHJ34P0|5|Love it!
B004Q1GCFG|5|I have ordered these brushes via amazon. I have been playing with them for the past 3-4 days, just to see how they feel and how they work. So far I am impressed. My brush collection is various, but the dominating brushes in it are from this Italian brand INuovi, and they are quite pricey/good quality. To be honest, Sigma brushes are equally good, if not better, because they are so affordable. Overall, I am satisfied, and would recommend them to a friend, in fact I already have.
B000KGVMHY|5|I was afraid that it wasnt going to be the real Issey but after I got it & did a full comparison with a bottle I got from Macy's I knew it was the real thing & that I had gotten a good deal on this product
B004I5KZNA|5|This is the best eyeliner I've ever purchased in my life! It glides on pretty smoothly and it lasts almost all day. Plus, it's fairly inexpensive. For less than $10, the package comes with 3 eyeliners in 3 different colors.
B00BH0JJ9A|4|I bought this headband to wear with an outfit for a wedding. The rhinestones and floral setting are gorgeous. I can wear this piece with dresses or to dress up casual outfits. The reason I give four stars is that it became uncomfortable after prolonged wearing.
B00009RF1E|4|I bought this for my son.  He is very satisfied.  The only quibble is with the 6 level attachment.  It is plastic and tricky to get securely attached to the unit.  But once on, it is quite effective and useful.
B00B9K8P0M|5|I have not finding this perfume for over 18 years. It's a rare and wonderful masculine scent. Very good price.
B00GXFS6U2|2|Product had leaked into the bag
B004WJU3MK|5|Feels nice. Seems to help.
B00144013M|5|My husband likes it we thought it was going to be loud flower smell but once you bathe in it the smell is wonderful.
B001ET7HJI|4|My bedroom allows far too much light in the morning so I sought out a sleep mask. I figured all of them would do what seems like a simple task but I was surprised about a couple of things. The  bands that wrap around the back of your head are made of what I can only describe as standard Velcro strips of an elastic nature. The straps dig into the tops of the crevice of my ears as the edges are not particularly soft. It wakes me up regularly from the discomfort<br /><br />The mask itself, however is very soft and comfortable over the eyes but the second issues is that the eye pads don't quite conform to my eye sockets providing a good seal. The pad is flat and faces are not. In addition, when over the bridge of the nose, the nose pushes the pad out just enough to let a little light in.<br /><br />Overall, they are fine and I still gave 4 stars because I'm sure most people won't be as critical as I am being. My critical review is based on the fact I wanted and need total darkness. The don't block all of the light but the do block most of it and I'm sure most people will not notice. Perhaps I need to invest in blackout curtains.
B003S516XO|5|I just took this out of the package this morning. It heats up fast and works great. I use it to help curve the ends of my hair inward as they can get unruly.<br /><br />Unfortunately there must be a wiring issue with the one I got because as soon as the cord on the end jiggles in either direction it makes an electrical shorting noise and shuts off completely. I could tape it up so it stays in place and go on using it, but I'm afraid that with the messed up wiring it could be a fire hazard. Returning it, but open to ordering a replacement!<br /><br />EDIT:: I realize that I forgot to edit this review so here goes. I ended up purchasing this same hair straightener again and was pleasantly surprised! No wiring issue. The straightener heats up super fast and straightens my hair quickly and easily. I even purchased one for a friend for her birthday and she LOVES it. I'm the lucky lady that gets to use this to straighten her hair most mornings at work. She has coarse, curly hair and this straightener makes quick work of smoothing her out nicely. So glad I didn't give up on this. Best hair straightener you can get for the price!
B004QWST7Y|5|Perfect item for beard trimming and the stubble look.  I have search for quite a while to find the right trimmer and this is it.  I like the way you can set it for the stubble look and the trim is perfect every time.  Excellent product.
B00AHF1GK6|5|Schick Hydro 5 Disposable Razor, 3 Count (Health and Beauty)<br />I received the Schick HYDRO 5 Disposable Jeatables they are awesome, I can say it's the best razor I've used, the hydrating gel and the skin guards reduces friction for that smooth perfect shave, it has Aloe, shave oils with vitamin E that gives you a smooth glide while shaving that prevents irritation,m I could barely feel the shave and got an amazing smooth shave. The top white piece flips back so you can get the perfect outline, I highly reccomend these and will continue to buy them, my partner even took one and used it on the entire body and got a beautiful smooth shave , this is the best disposable razor for my skin, thanks BzzAgent for letting me these as I will continue to use them, their great
B003BQ6QXK|5|Excellent product.  I'm glad I went with this ToiletTree option because the item itself is well made, functions exactly as it should- and in addition their customer service is fantastic!<br /><br />Have no doubt- if you want a device like this, you can't go wrong here.  The price is right and the quality is more than you'd expect.
B001E6OERO|3|this product is good if u know how to wax..<br />Its also good for its cost, they best deal i found.<br />i try not use its strips but my own cut out of old jeans ..
B00A3C7P0I|1|Not good.
B008RTNSJQ|5|I thought It would be cheap since I only paid a dollar for it BUT it still works like its new. I do recommend you to buy this product
B006GUAM6U|5|I bought this becasue it was out of season on Bed Bath & Beyond site.  It came full and brand new, I just love this fragrance.
B0010G52VK|4|MARY Kay products are great tried and true products. However, sometimes the colors are a little off. NOT MK'S fault more mine for picking the wrong colors.
B00BTO3KXA|5|Love these new sponges.  Great for face and even eyes.  Thanks for fast delivery.
B007RTR9FQ|5|This is an extremely nice shampoo.  It has a nice blend of ingredients such as shea butter sunflower, coconut and almond, to list a few.  These ingredients promote a great clean feeling and a nice refreshing smell once the product is washed out of one's hair.  I also felt like my hair was lighter after using this product.  I did accompany this shampoo with its counterpart;[[ASIN:B007RTR9E2 CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]]  I usually do not use a shampoo and conditioner set, but the results were very nice.  And for what it is worth a little goes a long way.
B006W2SYF8|5|Excellent
B006L7SF4O|4|I've never really used eye shadow primer before so I have nothing to compare this to, but I will say it makes my eye shadow look much brighter and it stays put longer. I like it enough to keep buying it after this tube runs out. The price certainly beats a lot of the other primers!
B00NC2A2LA|5|Yes these are jumbo and of high quality. Around 1.5 inches in diameter. Will definitely buy again when needed.
B001RMP7M6|4|The lamp is lovely but I don't think it is doing the curing job as I anticipated it would.  My nails come out somewhat sticky and I know I am doing the process correctly.  The price got me on this one -- it was really reasonable
B001V9LAVM|5|The lasting finish lipstick is my favorite of the rimmel products and my favorite shades are alarm, drop of sherry, and dizzy. it wears for a reasonable length of time, although you'll have to re-apply it at times, and it's very comfortable on your lips. this a lipstick i'll never stop buying, it's such an awesome lipstick.
B001ET77YI|5|As with all of Dr. Bronner's products, this is an excellent one and I use it for many different purposed.  I used to take this camping as I knew it would not harm the environment.  Highly recommended.
B0009QZXP2|5|Excellent
B001ET7HJI|5|I love this mask. It keeps all of the light out, it is very comfortable, I never have creases on my face from the mask and I don't have to worry about it pinching me. It is a little big but I just safety pinned it smaller.
B002BABHZE|1|This is a horrible product.  It sits on your head awkwardly and you better hope the wind doesn't blow too hard or too light and don't even think about bending over either.  As a matter of fact, don't move or else it will fall out.  When it's on your head, it doesn't even look normal; one is too big and the other is ridiculously small (can you say, \\"cone head\\"?)  Needless to say, I was not pleased with this product.
B00JBV1FJE|5|Absolutely love this. I have received many compliments on this. It does look like the picture, even better. Definitely is worth the money.
B003SEO0BK|5|Best shave soap I've used. Well worth the price.
B000V193S8|5|I have fine hair. This product gives it body and shine without weight. It also just rinses off your hands with water. I was glad to find it on Amazon. I should have looked earlier because my salon charges a lot more. Lesson learned.
B004N1EQNO|5|I recommend that you try it
B00ACOFN0Q|5|I do not understand why anyone would pay more for any primer. This works perfectly. And it does not look purple at all, but counter acts any dullness in skin tone to help your skin look brighter and more youthful. I have tried different primers, they all feel exactly the same. For the size of this bottle and price, I highly recommend e.l.f.!
B007K6K0IY|5|Finally a clear gel that actually works!!! I have to use clinical strength deodorant because I sweat a lot when I get hot or nervous. Most deodorants leave me with wetness and sometimes odor. Clinical strength solids are the only deodorants that I've found to work well, but I get white streaks on any dark clothing. I was very skeptical about trying a clear gel because I have never had one that worked in the past, but thank you Secret for letting me try Secret Outlast for free! No sweating, no odor, no white streaks on my clothing! I can smell it working and the scent is fabulous! I will definitely be purchasing.
B0017QIUYY|5|Great stuff!  I am a fan of Mennen products.  This skin conditioner is great after a shave, or a great, &#34;slap-on,&#34; before heading out the door.  The fragarance is subtle and refreshing.  I have been using this product for years and highly recommend this product.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Great product!
B000GHVJWA|5|Sexy fragrance
B0060BNE38|5|I have used other salt/crystal type deodorants and have not thought much of them, but I really like this one.  I find it keeps me dry longer than others i have tried and prevents oder for even after I may sweat through it.  Also, i love the size, easy to keep in a draw at home or office, and a great size for travel or the gym bag.
B00461F4PA|3|Do Not wash your feet before using this product. It will burn. I used this product once before and the results were great. The second time I washed my feet before using it  and it started to burn so I could not ke it on the recommend time.
B00KR3FD66|4|The shampoo is ok.  The conditioner is great!!  It smells very good and makes my hair soft and shiny. I can't tell if my hair is growing quicker yet, but I do like this product.
B001GIOV8C|5|Its for my girl,I think she will love it
B00H7I13C2|5|Love this hair spray !
B000O5UWTA|2|Doesn't eliminate the yellow reflection on my slightly colored hait
B00943C9GM|5|Fabulous.  It doesn't make me dizzying and I don't have to take a water pill with it. Buy This!
B003NSPOF2|5|I don't use it for sunscreen. I use it for burns, sun related and sweat related and otherwise. It's absolutely excellent to relief the burning pain and sensation. Highly recommended
B001E0XS9K|5|Excellent product and timely shipping.
B000VUX4T8|5|This is SERIOUSLY the holy grail for anyone using well water. I have a tremendous amount of iron in my water and it all adheres to my blonde hair creating an unsightly orange tinge. I am obsessed with having good color--I will NOT tolerate brassiness in my blonde hair. It's just not negotiable. This product saved my hair from the well water and removed every last trace of mineral build up. My hair went back to its beautiful buttery blonde color, softness, manageability, and bounce. I don't know what I'd do without this stuff--move?? Bottom line: IT'S WONDERFUL.
B005HXH0XA|5|I should've taken a before and after picture because in the first week I've seen results.. Itfeels really smooth going on and leaves a nicelust renewed canvas to apply makeup... The serum has faded a broken capillary I've had on my nose for some 20yrs.. Thank you for not wasting my hard earned money.. Gone are of shopping for the perfect product.. For me THIS IS IT-
B000C1VSUS|5|This is a nice cologne with a really great smell. I like it a lot. This is an especially good buy as it is a huge bottle of cologne. This will easily last 6 months, quite the bargain.
B001J3YRU6|5|I like this color.  It's not over powering.
B001FYZLPE|5|A trial will convince you....
B006BIF0IW|5|Love kleancolor nail polish works awesome for stamping 👍👍👍
B00FS2N32M|4|These little brushes do a nice job but they are over priced!
B000G62I12|3|I recently ordered the Tweezerman Safety Slide Callus Shaver with Rasp and at first sight was reluctant to use it. The shaver is not bad at all, but the blade sure as hell is. I needed to peel off some dead skin, so I tried to lightly slide as directed on the instructions, and it would continually want to sink in deeper causing bleeding. The product works, but it hurts in the process.
B008YDXM28|5|nice scent and lather
B002YV9Q5I|5|love this mascara
B00J9MJSBW|5|Very different and pretty.  Tons of compliments.
B002SW9KWM|1|I rarely write reviews, but I decided it was very important to attempt to warn people of this seller and product. The product arrived in an un-sealed, oil covered bottle with a homemade printed label; not at all like the picture or description. I don't feel comfortable using this mystery oil on my body, and to make things worse,  it smelled rancid and not at all like avocado oil usually does. When I tried to contact the seller, I received the rudest email telling me to &#34;go buy avocados from the supermarket and smell those.&#34;  And my return was denied saying I OPENED the container: the bottle that I received was not in any way sealed... buyer beware!!
B001KWB85S|5|This polish is perfect for stamping art on your nails. Long lasting and fast drying, I highly recommend this brand!!
B004X1QY20|4|It's perfect for hot weather. It keeps you feeling cool and keeps your makeup in place if you perspire. The smell is mediocre.
B00TUE9GWK|5|good!!!<br />Thank you!!
B00008BQVL|4|Began using this product over eight years ago and have been pleased with the results obtained.
B0098U6S40|5|good oil but it did clog my pores a little bit!
B000RO3EMA|5|Smells a bit odd but it really works to soften up those dried out winter hands that seem to get worse with every year. I first came across this formulation when I worked for Warner Lambert back in the 1980s where they had this in the company store...along with the Listerine and many other consumer products. Unhappy with many of the other creams on the market I remembered it and put it into Amazon and voila, there it was! My hands are happy!
B001F51Q8Y|1|Always make sure to read the back of the box of anything before you purchase. \\"May Stain Teeth\\". Enough said.
B00BSD7RNQ|5|I purchased this to accompany my aloe vera based weight loss wraps. The company that sells the wraps wants a LOT of money for their aloe based body wash as it is supposed to support lingering effects of the wraps, but this is just as good and inexpensive. This is a fantastic amount for the price and I find that it does not have a strange scent as reported. If you are familiar with the way aloe plants smell, the scent of this body wash should not be a problem. It does not leave a lingering fragrance afterwards and it is great for businesses and large families.
B00HZ8JREU|5|Absolutly IN LOVE with this perfume and this seller. My bottle arrived 2 days earlier than expected and i couldn't be more thrilled! It smells amazing. thank you so much!
B00014GUPO|5|I love this product too.  Was first introduced to Neova by my doctor.  She does laser hair removal and other skin improving and anti-aging techniques.  She carried this product in her office and I liked it so much I have been using it for years.  Can't go wrong with this skin care cream
B004BCVAEI|5|I had to order this online because it's discontinued and no longer available in the stores.  Good quality lipstick that doesn't dry my lips.  It doesn't wear long, but for the price I don't mind reapplying.  Great simmery neutral on me.
B005EZLB5O|3|Loved the travel size so I could try this product for the first time. Product  absorbs  nicely in your skin for good hydration.
B007L5IB0I|5|I originally found out about this product through my hairdresser. This product works good and smells great. It is almost a perfume! I love it!
B003XQQGRY|5|These are very tiny clips and they are hard to find in a lot of stores. They are perfect for my daughters hair she has short 1 and half inch wisps of hair near the front and back of her hair- regular clips would look odd being put up so close to the front so its either these or a headband when hair is pulled back.
B005VSXU30|5|The Bergamot really comes through.  Reminds me of Earl Grey tea.  A very relaxing scent for the oil burner.<br />Adding extra words to appease Amazon!
B000FQA2K2|2|i bought both this and shave secret they both blow but this ones a bit better i tried one on each side of my face less burn with kinexium but like i said still no good
B006HL1RQ2|5|This is my second time ordering this particular style!  I just love it!!  Some women at my job have actually gotten their hair styled in this way, based on my purchase!  I I'm dark brown skin, so I have doubts abt actually going lighter without a professional opinion on hair and skin color.  But, I do wear the off black or jet black color.  I will probably order more of this particular style in the near future!  Winter is coming, I hate having to keep my real hair on point, due to rain and snow.  So, this wig will come in handy all year long!
B006YW60JS|5|I like this item,<br />I will recommend to my friends.<br />it is comfortable and soft, very warm.<br />that is fit the shoe.
B0043R52KO|5|Just as I expected it to be. Even showed up a day early.
B000HKPV8Y|5|I love Dr. Bronner's products. Started from lavender scent to peppermint to eucalyptus. I love them all. I use it to shower, wash my hair and my handwashed clothes. It can even clean dishes. It's perfect for camping where you try to minimize your stuff.    The only thing is the cap gotten loosed during shipping and so some liquid spilling out.
B004DN8F4S|2|I love Ott-lites in my sewing room, but the light was so bright I<br />could not even see my reflection in the mirror.  Plus the on and off<br />switch didn't work correctly.  Wouldn't stay on unless you held it down.<br />Amazon is wonderful with returns, so I refunded and and ordered another<br />make up mirror with confidence.  Much happier customer now.
B000BOA6S6|5|lovely
B001MIZCI4|5|This product improves pale complexions and hides ugly spots without a bunch of bottles of liquid caking products. Convenient size for carrying in your pocket. Having trouble finding in stores till found it on Amazon. Thank you for making it available.
B0017SRSSG|5|It was exactly what I was looking for. Helps with my lower back pain. I love it! Definitely worth the money.
B00WGVW7E8|4|This package has a nice assortment of tattoos perfect for summer festivals or any time you are feeling funky. The quality is the same as the less expensive tattoos, but this pack has cooler designs for sure.
B004SUPEOK|4|So, I just washed my hair with the same brand shampoo and then I put the hydrating mask on. It makes my hair feel so smooth. I actually have left it on for a day and wore my hair out. I do not know if you are supposed to leave in on this long but it is actually a great styling product. My curls are defined and look awesome.
B005MQ5JZS|5|It works!<br /><br />I purchased this product and it is awesome. My lashes are a lot longer and so beautiful. I have told all of my friends about this mascara. I'm so glad I stumbled upon it.
B00I2MH2V8|1|Hurt bad and was soooooo messy :( couldn't get it off my fingers or bikini line ouch!!!
B00MY5CHZ0|4|Full cover more foundation than bb cream the tone was little dark for me
B006GN76L6|5|Glad I bought a cup size bigger than normal works well took a while for shipping but for the price was worth the wait
B00JVTUA4M|5|Very much need to use the foundation
B00H2WIKCE|5|I bought this product because it's very similar and a knock off of a Young Living Thieves essential oil for a fraction of the cost  I love the fragrance and use it in a roller ball blended with fractionated coconut oil.  Happy with my purchase!
B00JS17HQW|5|Very good!
B0000AFUT3|5|Nice
B00DIYGGG2|5|I've been using it for years!  I've tried other brands but always come back to the Avon SSS.
B0094G3MRY|5|SHipped quickly, arrived undamaged and unused. Is a quality product.
B008TBTAAI|5|gave my friends haircuts with this pair of scissors.. it was sharp (i cut finger once) and it worked well!
B007MUASQC|1|I returned it!!  I recieved 12 nail polishes and no display, which my grandaughter wanted. However the return process was simple and efficient.
B003OP8474|5|I had never tried this product before, but it sounded good.  It is very moisturizing and smells awesome!  I definitely recommend it.
B0010P6D28|5|This product was recommended by my dermatologist several years ago.  I have been using it ever since.  You have to keep using it, but it works.
B002DOO1VA|5|This a great deal if you're looking to try new brushes. I think this is a great set to start with if you're new to makeup (:
B00HV8YHBM|5|love it
B000R830IE|1|Purchased this for my mother (retired cosmetologist) who told me her previous 1 inch curling brush died that morning.  Her previous one lasted for years (different brand).  I gave it to her and she tried it twice.  This unit gets so hot it singes hair.  Even on the lowest setting.  I thought, mom is getting older, maybe its just her.  Asked my sister if she wanted it - she tried it and on the lowest setting it burned the hair.  Unfortunately I missed the 30 day return window opportunity so I am stuck with &#34;firestarter.&#34;  If you hate  your hair and want to see it burn - purchase this product.  (I mention the retied cosmetologist because she has used these devices for years on herself and hundreds of others - she knows how to use the product)
B00GG0I7VM|1|Very bad product. I had many problems after using this product. I only used it for 4 days and my face started flaking, had crakes and cuts around my nostrils, eyes got puffed up, skin got very dry. I contacted the company, got voice mail so left a msg for them . It's already been 4 days since I left the msg, no body got in touch with me yet. I am very disappointed with the product and the company.
B00O8ODI5I|5|This is my favorite electric toothbrush ever. The combination of features is unparalleled and really help motivate good dental hygiene. I really do feel (this is so cliché) that just-from-the-dentist feeling after using it.<br /><br />I have been using electric toothbrushes since the early 1990s, everything from the Sonicare to the Crest Spinbrush to (most recently) three progressively-better Oral-B handles. The Oral-B toothbrushes and their system of interchangeable brush heads with different specialties, are fantastic, across the board. If you want the best Oral-B experience this year, this is the toothbrush to buy.<br /><br /># Bluetooth on a toothbrush?!<br /><br />The idea of a toothbrush as a Bluetooth device seemed ridiculous to me at first, but being a gadget nerd, I had to try it out. In the end, what Oral-B produced is<br /><br />Bluetooth is used to communicate brushing session information to an iPhone/Android app. Basically, it drives a timer, which is key to what Oral-B is trying to sell. They want you to brush a full 2 minutes, which seems like an eternity at first. Pretty much all Oral-B toothbrushes (this one and ones much less expensive) will pulse every 30 seconds and at the 2-minute mark to help you time your brushing session. The in-app timer helps you visualize this, and it is surprisingly motivating compared to the brush pulses. This is the first toothbrush gimmick that has gotten me to consistently brush for 2 minutes at a time.<br /><br />The toothbrush will give you a warning if you're applying too much pressure. It will also store session information (up to 10, I think) and sync with the phone later, so you don't always need your phone one you to brush your teeth.<br /><br /># The iPhone App<br /><br />The iPhone app is surprisingly good. It has a clean design that appears to be based on the average of modern iOS and Android design. Overall, the app is well thought-out and easy to use.<br /><br />The brushing timer starts and stops automatically with the toothbrush (over Bluetooth). It can also listen for the sound of the toothbrush if Bluetooth isn't on for some reason. To help you get through that entire 2-minute brushing session, the app displays news and weather, photos, and other things, in-app, while you brush. It is kind of clever, but the news articles weren't often that relevant to my location.<br /><br />The app will track your brushing, flossing, tongue-cleaning, and rinsing. It prompts you to do each one in sequence. You can customize these prompts to match your routine. The app awards smiles, sounds, and badges to help keep you motivated. Everything works really well. If you like to track your weight, food, and activity (with MyFitnessPal, FitBit, Jawbone Up, etc.), you will probably like to track your toothbrushing, too.<br /><br /># The toothbrush<br /><br />The handle is larger than older/lower-priced Oral-B toothbrushes, and is comfortable to hold. It has some very bright lights on it that are on when in use and when it is charging. The charging lights are very bright and are animated while charging, which could be a problem if you need to store it where you sleep--in a dorm room for example.<br /><br /># Brush heads<br /><br />The Deep Sweep brush head that comes with this toothbrush is my new favorite. It feels the most like normal tooth-brushing and cleans very well. There are various other brush heads you can buy that are compatible with this and with other Oral-B toothbrushes. The brush-head holder base encourages you to try several. I have been alternating between the Deep Sweep, Floss Action, and Sensitive Clean brush heads, and really like how easy and .<br /><br />Oral-B brush heads are quite expensive, which is the only con, really, of the Oral-B system. There are compatible generic heads available, which I usually buy because they are much cheaper. The generic brush heads are far cheaper and appear to be adequate, but they do not slide on and off as well as the Oral-B heads, and their bristles are not as high quality. That said, they are OK if you want to use them.<br /><br /># The base<br /><br />The base comes in two parts which snap together, in case you don't want to use the brush head holder.<br /><br /># The travel case<br /><br />The included travel case holds the toothbrush handle and two brush heads. This is a fantastic accessory, because it allows you to bring your familiar (and great) toothbrushing experience from home with you. The toothbrush should last a week (two 2-minute brushes per day) before it needs a charge. In my experience with older Oral-B brushes, that claim is true.<br /><br /># Keeping it clean<br /><br />Electric toothbrushes, like all toothbrushes, can become gunky and nasty if you don't take care of them. The easiest way to keep this one clean is to remove the brush head, rinse off the handle, and towel the handle dry after each use. This sounds like a lot, but it only takes about 5 seconds, and having a special brush-head storage area in the base makes it very easy.
B00IEC9UN4|5|I like that it's more natural. Works well keeping you from getting stinky! It is not an antiperspirant.
B009HULKLW|5|Works very well and shipping was super fast
B0012DP7NO|5|This scrub leaves skin feeling great and smelling even better.  I love this product and will continue to use it!
B000OFNDOQ|4|Mostly I like that this eye gel is safe for use during pregnancy. I like the gel texture, it is very cool and calming. I would purchase this again.
B00NY8KXNO|5|I put this on after showering.  This smells great! Not overpowering, just a soft gentle smell.<br /><br />The next day - my skin felt so soft.  Even my grandson noticed!  My partner was complaining of what she calls chicken skin so I handed this to her to try.  She could immediately tell a difference.  The next day her skin was still smooth!
B00FZKB51S|3|Pretty decent brushes I guess. My only problem is that the glue rubbed off and one of the handles feel off and it's starting to do that for other brushes too. Can be an easy fix, just annoying.
B00JT6036C|5|This is probably the best face cream I have ever used.  My skin has not felt this good in years.
B0049CJKK6|5|I have had this brand of Shea Butter for only a short while but can state I am extremely pleased with it.  For as long as I can remember I've had problems with dry lips and dry areas on the outside parts of my face.  Since using this product for only a few days, my lips are in the best condition they have ever been and the dry areas of my \\"combination skin\\" now feel normal.  In addition, I had contacted the seller regarding what turned out to be a very minor matter; the seller was courteous, helpful and offered to do anything necessary to address my request.  As it turned out, nothing further needed to be done, but I was very pleased and impressed by the seller's offer to help.
B009H44V6Y|5|I like this better than any other dry cleaner I've used as it doesn't leave any residue.  It also smells wonderful
B00631ZXRA|5|I love these plates! They shipped very fast. Nothing was missing  very  easy to peel of protective plastic. Edges aren't sharp. All in all I'm very pleased
B001P60R0Q|5|This has to be the best moisturizer with SPF! It smells good, light-weight, not greasy and I get the right moisture that my face needs! Ive tried many drugstore moisturizer and few high end brands but this is my number 1!
B00G99T60Q|5|Arrived sooner than expected. I love the fact that they came package separately so I wouldn't have to separate the silver form the gold. Thanks.
B002RS6KSY|5|great produt of TIGI arrived in ecelent conditions
B00JJB1PPK|5|Best travel bottles ever!!!!!
B0049LUI9O|5|Great product. Sturdy, and easy to set up and use. Well worth the price.
B00RDX2OWY|5|It is a good product just wished it lasted longer.
B00NQGA7X0|3|Thought it would numb better
B00YYURAJ6|5|This is a great product. It has a pleasant smell, but I personally prefer scent-free products. I did not read the instructions too carefully, so I sprayed it on my face (it says to spray on a cotton ball.) I was a little concerned about spraying anything in my face, as my eyes are sensitive (of course, I closed my eyes.) But that was user error (however, after reading some other reviews, it seems like most people are spraying it directly to the face, so I'm not alone.<br /><br />As it dried, which does quickly, it does leave the skin feeling soft and smooth. I have combination skin, but T-zone tends to get quite oily, and the rest, quite dry! So it is a challenge to find products that target my bi-polar skin!<br />This was not greasy, but was moisturizing, so for me it worked great for both zones/areas in my face. It is a generous amount, the bottle is quite big, and for the small amount you use, it should last a long time. It was also carefully wrapped, which is good. It comes with the spray adapter separately, so it is optional (and since you are supposed to use a cotton ball or a pad, so it's your call, really.)<br /><br />My only suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the straw smaller! At least the one I received, it was too long, It almost curled back up (it formed a letter J shape inside the bottle). So it was at least an inch (or a little more) longer than what it needs to be.
B00GNA9K8O|5|I like the size and variety. It is all I need.
B000NWGCZ2|5|This stuff is AMAZING. I have incredibly sensitive skin, as does my baby. Neither of us have a reaction to this. It's very thick but not greasy. Great for dry skin, eczema and psoriasis. LOVE this stuff. Will never use another lotion again and I've tried everything out there.
B000A3I3S8|5|Love this product. It is not made anymore<br />but I found it on amazon. It is the perfect color<br />I does not cake or crease. Get it!
B00GYF65TK|5|I really love this eye gel! I feel like it wakes up my eyes in the morning and I use it every night too!
B002QI2TPI|5|The BEST brow bar I have ever used!
B003NSPOF2|4|very good, keep me motorized and looking healthy
B002RTA8YU|5|These oils by Eden's Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.
B00EUFKVQE|5|Works just like the original!
B00336EUTK|4|So, I am halfway through using the product, and the sensitivity hasn't been that much of a negative. I have always had issues with sensitivity to whitening treatments, but I haven't had so much with this. I found that using fluoride rinse helps, and I did cut down how hard I brushed because there was some sensitivity (may not be the best thing, but at least my gums are not killing me). At this point, the whitening is satisfactory. Although, I am halfway through the cycle, I expected to see more of a difference (like I did with the Listerine strips that they discontinued). The result hasn't been extremely noticeable, but there is indeed some sort of a difference.
B001H963YA|1|It looked used, it was not sealed neither full all the way! I threw it away... I would not recommend it!
B006X77NQS|5|My husband loves all Dermalogica products and make his face soft and smooth.
B002LYUFTY|5|Amazing smell
B008MAON08|5|Got this for my girlfriend as a gift. Smelled just like I was expecting. Good long lasting scent and shipped fast. No complaints here.
B00I3VHKVK|3|4 of them were broken when I got them they don't seem to be glued together well but the actual brushes are nice and don't shed or tangle when washed and they keep shape. I ended up buying the elf studio brushes for everyday use since these brushes seem fragile but I kept a few of them in my collection.
B0077RSQMI|5|My kids do not like liquid or spray sunscreens so I use this for everyday use (when we are not swimming).  You can not see it at all on their skin.
B00K6NKJ3Y|5|I have a small wrinkle in the corner of my eye, probably from the way I sleep. I have tried at least five eye creams and this gel is the only thing that has worked to smooth it out! I am very pleased, the only thing that isn't really a negative but some would find slightly interesting is that before it dries it can be a little bit sticky. But like I said, it isn't a negative for me just something I noticed.
B00L5715WE|1|My hair became super curse after using this ! I don't think it is original . Definitely a FAKE :-(
B009EPEWAG|5|Very light sweet but masculine scent. Lasts for a long time. Bottle is beautiful. It was an xmas gift for my older son and he loves it.
B003SOO86M|5|works great, covers so well you only need a speck and LASTS FOREVER
B000SBCZTK|5|This was the only color and the only brand my mother used and she was extremely frustrated when she couldn't find it. I told her that it could be found online...and it was! She was soooo happpy!
B001BPRXK8|1|I bought this product because i thought the price was fair, i also always look at the reviews and everyone seemed to like it. I think it is awful it is so thin it splats on and i even used a little rolling brush, seeing as though i had to wash it all off the best i could get it off i would not give it one star if i didnt have to,[[ASIN:B001BPRXK8 Ocean Sunless AIRBRUSH TANNING 8.5 DHA Medium Tan SOLUTION QT]] i guess what they all say is true \\"You get what you pay for\\".
B004ZBHXLY|1|Very nice
B0048NWD5A|2|I agree.  Completely deceiving picture. I was very upset that I only received one for the price. It was listed cheaper by other sellers in a one pack.  I specifically purchased from this seller as it APPEARS to be a 2-pack. DO NOT BE FOOLED!  Love the product but feel Like I have been tricked by the seller and by Amazon.com. Yes, I should have read it more carefully, but if you look at 2 like items, one that shows one of the bottles and another that shows 2 bottles, which would you click on?
B000W7PKU6|5|5.0 out of 5 stars The Perfect Powder, April 15, 2008<br />By  Nicole Martinez (Japan) - See all my reviews<br />(REAL NAME)<br />I have fallen in love with products by Physicians Formula. I don't especially look for mineral or talc-free beauty products, just long lasting products within a decent price range that work well. I have previously used other powders by Physicians Formula and this is one of the best.<br /><br />I prefer loose powders which can be brushed on over packed powders or poof applicators. The case of this powder also allows a place for you to keep the little brush snugly and clean, which I love.<br /><br />Unlike some powder applicators, you can clearly see how much powder is on the brush and apply it to your face. The powder does a wonderful job of going on and you can clearly see the difference. It helps to reduce shine and even out skin tone very well.<br /><br />The brush may pick up a bit much powder for one dusting so I'd suggest tapping it to release excess makeup. Also, the container is a bit unique; you need to tap or shake it so that the powder will come up through the holes and if you have it bouncing around in a purse or bag, this will actually do the job for you very well.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effective product which works well, feels good on the skin, has a clear result, and even takes into consideration the storage of the applicator. I would recommend it.
B000FYVOJC|5|as entitled, this product is that, powerful and sturdy. i put in the energizer advanced batteries and the blades turn like that of a chainsaw. i also like the wide body for the grip, unlike the other slender bodied ones that i have purchased before
B003YPY4FA|5|I lived on Hawaii for two years back in the late 60's and new about the perfume then. I just remembered about it recently and figured my wife would really enjoy it and she does. She wears it everyday and we both live it. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00112PTUW|4|I read some of the reviews stating this cream was watery or did not rub in well, but I have not had a problem with that at all. I actually purchased it at big lots for only $1, so this is a great deal. I like that is feels very smooth on my skin & is only lightly scented as I'm allergic to most fragrances. I mix it with pure coconut oil for an even better night cream.
B002614J80|3|Works for me.
B00871KOQO|5|These are soooo cute and dainty!  They come in different colors and look great on the nail.  A great deal for the price!!  These are great for the DIY nail artist, beginners to seasoned.  I love how sparkly they are too.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves to do their own nails.
B0043OYFKU|1|It doesn't work.<br />Brand new batteries. Switched them and it still does not turn on.<br />Majorly disappointed
B004CJR9IG|4|price is pretty high.. i hope it works.. so we will see whether it work or not. i will be back to this review:)
B000C213ES|5|Purchased for my husband. I love it, he loves it, ladies in his office love it.  Not overpowering but smells divine!  I have migraines and can't be in the room when my husband sprays it on,  but as the scent mellows on his skin does not cause headaches or nausea.  Yea!  Oh, and did I mention is smells heavenly?
B000RH1RUI|5|Excellent Product, been using it for over 20 years. It's always been about $4.00 now the price is a rip off!!!
B003SZKUHW|5|Love this product! I can use it day or night - it's oily, however, it absorbs quickly without leaving any oily residue... I use a Retin- A product that illicits a peeling response so to have a product I can put on at night that encourages my skin to heal and hydrate is really appreciated. Smells a bit like a tea tree oil at first, but that smell disapates quickly.
B00IDWP4IA|5|Both my husband and I use this affordable, skin tightening product. We love it.
B00B21E58E|2|I was going to make my own veil but I have been feeling too lazy.  I saw this and thought it would do the trick, and it will but the lace is poorly stitched into the veil and quite noticeable.  It will do for the $10.00 bucks I spent but that I guess was the problem knowing I could have done a better job for half that price or less. The lace itself is nice and the veil seems to be a heavy material but it will still look nice for the 30 minutes I have to wear it.
B00006ANDK|5|These are great. I have very sensitive gums and these do a great job of cleaning my teeth but don't damage my gums.
B00H2YL8W6|5|This makeup brush set is Great!!! The brushes are so soft!!!
B002DPUY5G|4|I have always been a huge fan of Burt's Bees products, and this skin cream is no exception.  It goes on non-greasy, and keeps my face nice and supple all day.  However, I too have some reservations (as many others here have stated) as to whether the old formula has been changed for the worse following their corporate buyout (In 2007, Clorox purchased Burt's Bees for $925 million dollars).  It seemed that the old formula day cream used to last much longer.  However, by comparison, this still is a fine product by any standards.  I am very happy with it.
B00N6WHTRG|5|I actually like this product a lot. I've been using it for a small ( minor) skin pigmentation discolor with quite successes so far. I've also been using on my face and it's great. Will buy from this seller again.
B0081NLUC0|4|My skin quite likes this serum, which I wear under moisturizer for daytime. For my tastes, it's a bargain compared to the Chanel serum I liked to splurge on back in the day.
B00U1NREHI|5|What a great product!  I really doesn't elongate the curls.  It has a lovely fragrance and it's not greasy.  My daughter's hair looks amazing, shiny and soft.
B00G78MENK|3|It will be good for going shopping because it has a place for your cards and money so you don't have t carry a big purse
B00KOJ8ZPO|5|came right on time, I love it. Totally works
B001613S74|5|Just what I wanted for travel, to hold things in liquid containers with a little more security that a Ziploc bag.
B00J91NDTQ|5|Very good!
B00538TSMU|1|Do not go on well at all.
B001LNOCWW|5|It is very good
B004JYJVIK|5|I use this  lipstick daily.  It softens my lips and the reddish color is very vibrant!  I get numerous compliments when I wear it and I usually wear a clear gloss on top of it...The color last a long time!
B0043OYFKU|5|Quite light and small, quite soft bush head, and I can feel my skin is more smoothy after using it~!
B0016JP216|5|I kept asking my stylist if he thought I was thinning, i kept seeing small changes but wasn't sure. He said to try Nioxin, that it would help if I was. I couldn't believe it when I started to see a patch of re growth where I hadn't even noticed that it was thinning! I perm and foil my hair because I have such fine hair. I use only Nioxin cleansing products, the conditioner doesnt weigh my hair down and smells invigorating. I also use their scalp treatment, bliss (detangler) and their styling products. Thanks to Nioxin I still have a full head of hair.
B001BYV3J6|5|Very nice product, easy to use, I feel so fresh and clean after using it every time, the water amount is good enough, highly recommended!
B000WDWP3U|5|This color is THE BEST. I feel like I'm a Disney princess whenever I wear it! Just call me Jasmine!
B0084Y1K30|5|I have very dry skin and nothing was working.  I got the coconut oil and now my skin is getting back to normal. I use it for everything.
B00GWTNEKQ|5|I am a retired Infantry Marine and keeping your feet in top notch condition is a breeze with the Caswell-Massey Foot File.You will make your feet happy and ready for flip-flop weather.
B00ON1GWPO|4|I received a complimentary sample of the product from influenster and in previous mascaras clumping was a big issue for me, but I found that in the lash blast bloom I didn't see clumps to be a problem.
B00JH2B182|4|I had my doubts about Lime Crime for obvious reasons, but I ended up finally giving in and getting this velvetine because I had some spare Amazon giftcards and I'm really glad I did.<br />This lip stain/matte liquid lipstick won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I really love mine. Yes, it's a bit drying on the lips, but IT STAYS PUT. Even though eating/drinking. If anything, it'll start fading a bit (especially in the middle of your lips where you've exposed the product to food/drink) after a few hours, but even with that, it's longevity is excellent.<br />If you're looking for a black lipstick that stays put and is 100% matte, I would highly suggest this one. It's pricey, but it's worth it in my opinion compared to the other black lipsticks in the market (ie: the MAC HauteCore lipstick and the Wet N Wild Fergie Pagan Angel lipstick).<br /><br />***PS: I have heard that Pretty Zombie Cosmetics has a good dupe for this particular Black Velvet color, so if you're interested, you should look them up. :)
B00NFV1CQM|5|nice
B001PRJ9XQ|4|I like the Olay Active Hydrating Cream. It's cheap and moisture. Make your skin confortable. I always use Olay products.
B0017QK78Q|5|Best soap ever.
B001DVY632|5|I bought Plackers Gentle Fine flossers from Amazon, provided by Preferred Mart.  The transaction was quick and smooth per Amazon, and the flossers arrived quickly.  I had bought a package before and found them to be the best I've used, though more expensive than most - but they're worth it.  Other flossers had fatter strings that were difficult to push down between tight teeth, and the strings were prone to shredding and sometimes breaking.  This required the use of two flossers, which negated their lower cost.<br /><br />These Plackers have a single thin cord that seems to be very strong.  They're easier to use, and one floss-pick easily cleans all my teeth.  The floss-picks have a plastic \\"wrap-around\\" that protects you from the point at the tip.  To use the point, you have to flex the wrap-around part until it breaks off.  I could do without this \\"protective\\" part.  I'd prefer a pointed tip, and a sharper point at that.  But the flossing performance counts the most, and this product is tops in that regard.
B00WB87XEU|4|We are bombarded with endless ads for creams, moisturizers, salves, emolients, etc, all of which will do the trick when needing to hydrate dry skin. I really like Eucerin, both the super thick cream in the tub, and the thinner hand lotion in the bottle. Both are awesome and highly recommended. But I'm always on the hunt for something new, so I thought I'd give the Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer a chance.<br /><br />Like the label indicates, the lotion can be applied to wet skin, with great effect. I had no idea what to expect, but it went on smoothly and was absorbed rapidly. The scent is very mild and not perfumey (a big negative for me), and once applied, the lotion is not too oily or sticky.<br /><br />It doesn't quite last all day, so multiple applications are necessary, which can make the cost-per-use very high. At nearly $20 per bottle (at the time of this review), it's already hard to justify the price tag. Most moisturizers, as I mentioned, work well and cost far less.<br /><br />The bottom line is Jergens Wet Skin Moisturizer is a product that delivers on its promise, but until the price comes down, I can't give it a full recommendation.
B004VYRUU4|4|I'd give this product five stars, but the first container ALWAYS runs out first. I've bought five packages of this stuff, so I know it's not a fluke. I've even used less of the first bottle. So frustrating to not be able use all the product.
B002XOBO9W|4|So far a great product. It is still too soon to tell if it actually works for the price I paid but it is a good lotion regardless and it smells nice.
B00WQAMCG2|4|When I order liquids through Amazon I'm always a little worried they'll be a mess when they get here. Elrique Naturals clearly puts a lot of thought into their products because the packaging was terrific! The oil comes wrapped tightly in a layer of bubble wrap. Under that is a layer of plastic making sure you'll have no problems with it leaking in the mail. I really appreciate this!  The tea tree oil comes in a plastic bottle. I would prefer a glass bottle, but at least the plastic is darkened. You can use the nozzle to spray a few drops of the oil if it's convenient for you. I actually like unscrewing the top and using the plastic as a makeshift dropper. On the side of the bottle you'll find all kinds of great information on the tea tree oil as well as an expiration date which is handy. This is actually my first time using tea tree oil and I'm really enjoying it. It's supposed to help with dry skin so I'm giving that a try by mixing it with some almond oil. We'll see how that works, but at the very least it smells great! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are entirely my own and not influenced in any way.
B0017RLNJW|1|was not happy with the shade which I thought would be a deep berry .I think it is better to try a new shade across the counter than order online.
B001ET7892|2|So, I bought this conditioner at the advice of many a natural hair afficiando's. I was painted portaits of grand illusions of how my hair would bounce like Tracy Ross Ellis. My hair would smell like hope and success. And finally it would be as slick and smooth as a 1975 pimp. I raced home with the anticipation that Ralphie had when he finally got his Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle! I hardly could take my shoes and work clothes off fast enough. I stuck my head under the faucet, flipped open the beautiful pyramid of a bottle and squeezed the liquid \\"cure\\" in my shaky hands. I put a whole heap of it in my 4c natural hair. I giggled out loud as i swished and swashed the heaven in my hair and on my scalp.  What was this feeling I felt on my hair? The smell, the more I swished the harder the swashes got, my fingers were getting caught in the fast approaching nap balls. i kept going, thinking this was all apart of its ingenious! Maybe things had to get worse before they got better. But my hair grew tougher and tougher, I got nervous- \\"this can't be happening! Maybe some cruel 3a hair curly saw me eyeing the bottle at Whole Foods and went to the sink and replaced the real stuff with some other crap!\\" I rinsed my hair out, looked up in the mirror and saw a tangled, knotty, nappy, hard, silky mess.  I was pissed.  Mom was right-I shot my eye out! Its not for me and my 4c! Maybe it will work for you, but i am getting a refund. This doesn't/didn't work at all. It made it worse.  I'll stick with Herbal Essence \\"Hello Hydration!<br /><br />the end
B007D021F2|4|A good product.
B005Q7D2RA|2|I really don't like the smell of this powder and will be returning it.  Shower to shower or Baby Powder smells much better to me!
B000E7YL1I|5|Excelente
B00303YYTW|5|I really like Kyoku products and their scents in particular.  They are not greasy and work well.  The lava masque is great, the under eye cream is nice and their after shave balm and moisturizer also work well.
B00AOTPVS8|3|I really had hoped this would be a super cooling eye gel with  noticeable improvement.  But it was okay really nothing too special about it. For the price it is quite nice but I'm not so sure I'd purchase it again.
B004P7DYNY|1|This has to be the worst product I ever purchased from Amazon. It not only smudges but it looks ridiculous. Your better off using mascara than this product. It should be taken off the market. Want to get rid of grays as a touch up then use Gray away spray, now that works a lot better. I was very dissapointed in this product, I wasted my money!
B00GTBZHCA|5|I bought this for my husband and he love it. Compared to Dove which he use to use. He says this one smells better. Leaves his hair more moist and is faster since is 2 in 1.
B000V1EM34|5|My hair stylist recommend this for my long curly natural hair.  Since I've been using it, my hair feels so soft and healthy.  It's really nice and much lighter than the cheap drug store conditioner I'd used for so long.
B00G3RT5WI|5|Simple, nice, vegan. Very nice product. Highly recommended.
B001CX4JSS|5|Far better price than any that come close in power and efficiency. Easy to use. 13 year old likes narrow brush for around braces.
B001GIHKP8|5|i LOVE this to dye my greying hair. the smell takes a little getting used to at first. think about wet leaves - that's what it smells like to me. and it's like a head full of mud. but afterwards, the color is wonderful, and i will never go back to chemicals
B00DZT48IS|5|I love this conditioner it makes hair shiny and silky. It's great at detangling your hair and it smells fantastic.
B003XWOJ9A|5|Redken delivers consistent, predictable results every time.  Directions are clear, applcation is easy, and results are beautiful!
B002TSA90W|5|I switched to this brand some time ago and it is all I ever use now.  Very happy with these products.
B00IALDHDI|5|This mascara is absolutely fabulous. It doesn't clump and is very easy to apply. It gives my eyelashes extra curve and volume without making them look fake! It's so awesome. Thank you Influenster for the free sample!! I love being able to try a product without having to buy it and risk not liking it.
B0051BIF1Y|5|This is my son's favorite hair gel.  The large size lasts an extremely long time and the product itself works great.
B0033Z8ROK|1|Threw it away. Looked really old.
B00Q5DF3RQ|5|Fast shipping! Great lotion!
B000XEAYHM|4|as advertised
B000FRHWM2|5|With a newborn at home I find myself washing and sanitizing my hands more than usual. I love that it doesn't dry out my hands and had a very nice scent.
B000XDZVLC|5|Item was more than I expected.  The bottle came with a sprayer and was double the size I thought it would be.  This was a christmas gift and my mom loved it.
B0017OAYTU|5|Exactly what I had wanted. Good Quality. Would buy again any time, probably soon as I use a lot of this.
B004D1PPVG|5|I bought this box of hair color in the drug store.  They are now discontinuing selling it.  I found it online and bought several boxes of it.  It is easy to use and I like it.
B00B2F8EXM|5|I decided to purchase this since i want to learn hairstyle... I enrolled in a hairstyle school and bought this training head for practice at home...I love it! With the help of this training head i can experiment hairstyle.<br />Thr hair implanted is a human hair, so you can do whatever you want on it...You can curl, color, braid, do some updo's name it... The hair is also long enough to do a lot of styles :-)
B0034F9K36|5|I love this lotion.  I have dry skin and moisturize every single day.  I've tried A LOT of different moisturizers, and this one is the best.  It absorbs well, smells great, and makes my skins soft and smooth all day.
B00IW9TC96|4|I have used this cream before and know it to be a great product. The packaging was a little ruffed up, but cream inside was OK.
B00U2MX5VC|5|I love argan oil. It has so many great benefits for the skin, hair and nails. Every morning and night, I use this and I have noticed that my skin has become more softer and my hair looks so much healthier. It's not like most oils that leave a residue. This oil sinks into the skin. No oily appearance. Just beautiful healthier skin and hair. I also use this on my nails to give it strength and it works. I received this product for a discounted price for my honest review and I give it thumbs up. Great product.
B00AQRNA72|3|Too small
B00OFOVBKK|5|The red color is brighter than showed. It's beautiful and very divalicious. It's cheaper on zahra website. Seller had fast shipping. Only negative was it was chipped in the left corner but I think it was usps' fault but it should be protected better.
B005WWQXB6|5|Works better than similar products out in the market. I wet it with warm water and then brush which makes it easier.
B004QWVY8A|5|I've been using a old Wahl self hair cutting clipper for years that finally bit the dust. Boy am I glad that it did. I now cut my hair (shaved no guard) every week and it's easy to maintain. No screwdrivers needed and it's awesome.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Long lasting battery.<br />Easy to disassemble.<br />Rotates easily.<br />Useful attachments if you want longer hair.<br /><br />Con's:<br />I wish it was a bit wider, I would say it's between a mustache trimmer and a regular trimmer.<br />It's not truly washable, you take the cutting parts off and clean it. It still works great but it would be nice to submerge the whole thing and run it to clean.<br /><br />Overall, the price is amazing for this and I would not hesitate getting these clippers.
B00385WMIC|3|I like it but after several months the band extended way out
B000TGEJT8|1|I usually use the WEN Fig Cleansing conditioner and ran out. I have wavy, blonde, highlighted hair that requires TLC so decided to give this product a try.  I was drawn in by the \\"organic coconut milk\\" and \\"whipped egg whites\\".  I was hoping for and expecting silky soft hair but what I got instead was a matted mess of straw.  I used both the shampoo which left my hair extremely rough and tangled followed by the conditioner. I was hoping the conditioner would help detangle my hair, but it did not.  I had to raid my daughters bathroom for her condtioner and shampoo and re-wash my hair just to get a comb through it followed by hair shine.  My hair was a frizzy mess.  It DOES smell great but this isn't much help if your hair does not look great a well.  I guess you get what you pay for. I will be going back to my Fig WEN.
B001GQPUK2|5|My husband loves this perfume so much that he said he wanted to lick me everytime i put it on...
B000ZLQJHC|5|Works great!!! Will buy it again. I used it in England and wanted to buy it here in the US.
B003DKEATQ|5|I purchase this conditioner for my mom and I hair. We're both black women with natural hair. This is a great conditioner. It has a lot of slip and it helps you detangle as well! It left our hair soft to the touch and well moisturized! If you're a natural this is the go to conditioner!!!
B004UUQVKY|4|I am rating this hair color a 4/5 because it serves its purpose of 1) providing a nice color, and 2) is chemical free, both appealing to me. The downfall of this product is that it smells like cigarettes and has the consistency of mud which makes it very difficult to apply and stick to the hair. I do like the Surya brand and will continue to buy their hair dye in the liquid form not the powder.
B00G2TQNZ4|1|Wife has been using this for a month at least twice per week and has no visible improvement in her skin. She complains that her skin is dry and tight afterward but there is no actual improvement.  I bought her this for Christmas and she couldn't wait to try it with the derma roller.  Unfortunately like many cosmetics, they are often more expensive snake oil than miracle serum.
B0009R33U8|5|I have used this product for years and highly recommend it. Several years ago I grew my hair long and this was the key to keeping it healthly during the transition.  I had stopped using it for awhile when I started wearing my hair short, but starting having issues with my hair breaking and shedding. I started using it again a few months ago and my hair is healthy once again and growing nicely. It is very important to follow the directions with this product.  I follow up with the recommended Aphogee balancing moisturizer, but I follow that with a second moisturizing conditioner. Although the Protein conditioner is great, I don't think the Aphogee moisture works great on my hair (that's why I follow up with a second one). I now use this every 5 weeks and couldn't be happier with the results.
B001IZZX1C|1|I bought this because I wanted a really good quality razor for bikini line and under arms.  This one seemed to fit the bill.  Unfortunately it is a major disapointment.  For the price I wish I had gotten something else.  This just doesn't work.  I don't want to spend an hour delicately working on hairs growing a certain way, which based on the other reviews seems to be what this requires.  There are a lot of electric shavers out there and most probably better than this one.  If this razor was $20 I would give it a few stars, but at this price, lucky to get one.  Save yourself some cash and go with a different model.
B0072FTOW6|4|I wear this under my foundation and I like it because it does initially get rid of the shine but it doesn't last all day. I have oily combination skin and my problem area is mainly my T-Zone so maybe after a hour or so I'm back to being shiny like a Christmas tree. It's not a bad product but maybe for my more oily girls I would recommend a longer lasting product.
B009X0J8TC|4|I had previously bought a few masks that claimed to be real silk but were actually nylon.  This mask is made of real silk.  It breathes and does not get hot.  The strap is adjustable which is a nice feature.  I have washed it with the regular laundry a few times and it has held up well.
B00AGG3MNU|5|Sharpest shave blade I've ever used. Two shaves per blade and no nicks, scratches, or cuts. Just baby smooth skin!!
B000VSG1PO|1|I have used eyelash curlers for many years and was looking for a really good one. I found the shape awkward to use since it is more straight and not perfectly curved to fit the eye. It was very tight and hard to press. I even found it painful to use. Would never purchase again or recommend to anyone and it was fairly expensive. Maybelline is better.
B004VBA3J2|5|Ok so maybe not the Fountain of Youth but this product is as close as anything I've ever tried has come. Evens out skin tone, shrinks pores, even seems to tighten my 40+ skin. Yet another one of my favorite products by Loreal that s suddenly discontinued...what is up with that? It's so infuriating! My theory - they test out their best stuff in the mainstream masses and then when they see us gobble it up they decide that they had better take it off the drugstore shelves, triple the price and repackage it as one of their high-end (Lancome) products. Anyway, once again I am thankful to be able to still get it on Amazon!
B0041TZVNM|5|I am going to mix this with Eucalyptus oil equally parts and rub it on my lower back to see if it helps my pain. I am still waiting for<br />my shipment.
B002PBAJ4Y|1|I would not recommend this product as a primer at all.  I wouldn't recommend this as anything, really.  The consistency is nothing like a normal primer; it feels more like liquid sunscreen.  Instead of correcting redness, it leaves an unusual green tint to your entire face, which can be seen through foundation.  It also made my foundation incredibly cakey, which it never is normally.  I usually use Stila One Step Correct, and then a normal primer on top of that.  That works.  I was hoping for a cheaper alternative, but this product was truly a waste of money.
B00CWZ0BLE|4|24 isn't enough lol
B00LPS0KFG|4|Fast shipping and smells good.
B003N0M5WK|5|*****<br />This hand cream just has to be the best in the world. It makes my hands so soft, and they \\"glow\\" and smell wonderfully and naturally like roses. Incredible. It starts off very slick-feeling, but then absorbs in and is just soft and smooth in about 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />I bought this smaller size--the 1.4 oz--but am reordering the larger size--the 4.3 oz--as it is more economical. Both are very expensive, and the price can vary tremendously, so shop carefully and compare sizes and prices. Even though it is so expensive, it is worth it to me. I was tempted to try it on my face, and then decided to order a Jurlique face cream instead; if it works anywhere near as well as the hand cream, I'll be delighted. It is definitely a luxury product, but worth the extra indulgence.<br /><br />Even though this cream smells strongly of roses, I tried it on my husband's extremely dry and calloused hands tonight. He too loved it. I told him I'd get him some in another fragrance (like the lavender or calendula), but he declined, saying he loved the roses. I think it just feels so good to him that he wants to use it again :)<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
B00TR04W62|5|Great thanks<br />Could be a little cheaper, I'd buy more!
B00AFCP9FO|2|Not impressed at all.  It was no  different than the rest of the Hydration Hair Masque I have used.  Not to much to say but it is not worth the cose.
B005EIIAPA|5|I liked it a lot because the formula goes on super smooth and creamy and it's so easy to do eyeliner with this!! Plus it's extremely affordable!!
B005JRGJ2M|5|We love Dial Nutriskin With Fruit Oil, Grapeseed Oil and Lemon grass. This soap leaves soft skin and smell wonderful. First time we used this soap at my son's house in Canada. We came back to home to find this soap, but we could not fine this soap in Indianapolis, Indiana. I'm so happy to find this soap at Amazon!!!!!!!!
B00BD3OYIM|5|worth it
B006GQYSC8|5|I have not had the razor very long, but being able to use an electric razor with shaving gel is great!  I really like this razor so far.
B0037BQKTO|5|This was my favorite product until the protein strengthener came out (teal bottles)!<br />Great for smoothing - but always felt I needed a little more condition in my conditioner!
B00C5RM91O|5|Works great, but needs to be shaken really well before use or it gets gloppy when applying.  I had this on my toenails for three weeks without a single chip!
B0009OAI6I|5|I was highly pleased with the size and the price!!
B004LWAJB8|5|Beautiful selection of colors, exactly as described.<br />A bit curious after using the purple shade my eyelids stayed pink for about a couple of hours and I used cold cream to take it off.<br />So not sure if it's the eyeshadow or a reaction but other than that no problems with the other colors.<br />I'd recommend this as a perfeet gift for a girl who loves makeup and eyeshadows or if you're wanting to experiment with makeup tutorials.<br />It's best to use a primer before so these colors can really pop.
B00KYGSJVW|5|I love everything about it! The smell, the feel, the price :)
B00FIAW69A|3|I love the perfume scent, although the one of the perfumes has been discontinued. I was not happy about finding that out.  I buy these small travel sizes to &#34;try out&#34; the scent before purchasing a larger bottle.  Also, when you open the caps off of the bottles they do not go back on the neck of the bottle correctly,  so you can not take the perfume in your purse or suitcase because the perfume will spill.  Once you open them, sit them on a dresser or other table. Traveling with them will not work.
B004KZ4HOG|3|The best<br />Luv the color!
B000V3RZ04|3|Works well, but as pricey as it is, not very wowed. Least favorite product of this incredible line so far.
B00OUGGY5U|2|I am 14 and was planning on being an Elsa-for-hire. I put my own dress together and bought this hoping for a nice wig that would finally turn me into Elsa, since my hair isn't the right color and I'm not allowed to dye it. It's okay, I guess, but personally I wish I had purchased a different wig. When I put the wig on, I looked like I had an afro and was wearing hair extensions at the same time. The short pieces in the front are way too short and don't work the way they should. I tried to get them to where I wanted, but they just stuck straight up and refused to move. The rest of the hair is too thin. There needs to be either more hair or it needs to be thicker, but both would be ideal. When it came, the braid looked weird, so I undid it and braided it again, but strands of hair stick out and it kind of looks like I rubbed a balloon all over it to see the hair stick up. The widow's peak in the front is too severe. If I try to cover up my brown hair, the front is too far down, almost in the middle of my forehead, but if I try to make it look like a  normal hairline, my hair is visible. I guess it depends on what you're buying this for. A little kid would be very happy with it, and so would a cosplayer, but if you're planning on wearing this often then you should find a different wig.<br />Advice to the makers of the wig: There's too much short hair on the top. You only need about an inch in from the perimeter for it to work, and you should make it thinner like the bottom hair so it is easier to work with. On the contrary, the braid needs to be more like the short bits because it's really flat and the thickness of the braid stays the same the whole way down, You should try to make it thinner on the bottom, but the rest needs to have more volume or else the wearer looks like a middle-age mom who does Zumba, doesn't like her current short haircut, and sadly isn't good at putting in hair extensions. I will try to find a good wig for my cause elsewhere, but if I can't find one I guess I'll have to try and fix it up. Thanks anyway.
B0069U4YHU|4|My teenage son would not think of leaving the house without having used this in his hair.  We usually order two of the 4 oz jars but in the end that costs more than the 32 oz, so this time I ordered two jars one 32 oz and one 1 oz ( for traveling)  the look on his face when he opened the box was priceless.
B001P4FJ0G|5|It works! Never have I seen anything like it. More men approach me today and I'm over 50 than they have in years! I will continue using this product for years to come! Lol no joke!! :)
B009TCUCT4|5|I love it
B00KUTUNU8|1|Overpriced and not enough separation!
B00UJ0P4PM|5|Update*******<br />These are still going strong. Washing them is really easy and they always end up soft, like the first time I used them. I haven't had any problems with shedding whatsoever or  staining. The case is still looking brand new and it has not peeled or anything. I LOVE THESE!!!!<br /><br />I am currently studying to become a cosmetologist. Makeup class is one of my favorites, but it can also be one of the most expensive especially when it comes to getting a brush set. One of the things you need to do a really good makeup is a really good set of makeup brushes. This set is the BOMB!<br /><br />I really love the looks of this set. It looks really professional and sleek. The pouch is a Pu leather material, with a snake print pattern and a glossy finish. It is really sturdy and keeps the brushes clean and safe. One thing I do suggest is to let the pouch air for a day or two. It had a strong, plastic odor when I first opened it but it is now gone.The brushes are really good looking too. They are matte black with the brand name in the handle. The bristles are black with white tips.<br /><br />The brushes are really soft and really easy to use. They pick up and deposit the makeup with such ease. Also if you have sensitive eyelids like I do, these brushes are so soft that they wont hurt when using them. They are 32 in total and they all have different textures. One thing that really impressed me about this set is that it includes practically every brush you will ever need, even the big fan brush. I've been looking for that one for a long time, but it can be really expensive. Also, this set has many eye shadow brushes. This is really useful when you are doing a multi color makeup and don't wanna mess up the other colors. In my case, I had a makeup competition this week at school and this set helped me out a lot. And everyone was impressed by how professional it looks. I really recommend this set to makeup students, professionals and even diyers.<br /><br />One more thing, this set is really easy to clean. I cleaned them as soon as they arrived and after the competition. So far I've had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast. This last one is a mega plus. They are still as soft as when I they arrived. I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup and then I clean them with your typical brush cleaner.<br /><br />The only suggestions I have for the company are:<br />1) I really would have loved if there was a small, round blending brush for the eyes. This makes the job of blending easier and gives another option in the eye shadow brushes.<br />2) It would have been really handy to have the brush's name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.<br /><br />Even with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing and I really love it.<br /><br />I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinionlean.

B004SY0DM4|5|Best color ever, My hair looked better after my half attempt with this product than with a professional hairdresser!! And I usually paid around 80 dollars to get it done! Too bad I am doing Highlights now so I cant really use this one color.
B00QR6SS6O|5|This is amazing Lemon oil. There are so many uses for Lemon oil, from simply diffusing it to helping to treat symptoms of things like allergies or digestive problems. I used it to simply flavor my water a little bit. I have tried some other oils in my water and was not too pleased as they often left the water feeling slimy in a way. I was very happy to find that that was not the case with this oil at all. Even with two drops of the oil in my bottle of water it did not feel slimy or slick and it did not leave any after feeling in my mouth like some of the other oils.<br />I also have many oils from this company and am a huge fan of them all. I love the way they package their oils and I love how the eye dropped that it comes with can replace the cap for easy uses and storage. the eye dropper is also amazing for accuracy and makes it really easy to get exactly how much of the oil you want and where you want it. product was purchased for the intent of review. Overall I am very happy with my Lemon Oil and I would highly recommended it to anyone.
B00JFT2Z14|5|Great product!  Makes my skin feel soft and has already made in difference in my skin's elasticity and tone.  Very pleased.  This company also provides excellent customer service.  They truly care about their product and the customer.
B000QDLPEG|5|I just wanted a non greasy lotion that helps keep wrinkles away. I love that I can even put it on my face and my makeup looks great. Smooth. I pour lotion all over my body everyday to keep it young. So I guess i will have to buy alot more.
B00K6IEN6S|5|good very fast delivery<br />good serum
B0009OMU0A|3|Husband is pleased with beard trimmer EXCEPT that if battery is not charged it is impossible to use while plugged in. Obviously it is important to remember to charge trimmer on a regular basis.
B005T53M5Q|4|My grand-daughter really liked it when she opened it. Not sure if she has played with it yet, so I don't know too much about it.
B0084BPHIM|1|These are paper thin...when I got them in the mail they were in a huge bag and bent because of how thin they are...I went wrong by thinking I had a good deal
B001DKQFUU|5|makes your skin look beautiful amd smooth and clear at night when going to bed and surpringly does not come off on your pillow..the medium is perfect for my light olive skin
B00021VJXO|5|I already reviewed this purchase when it first arrived.  I was on time and exactly as ordered!  I was impressed!
B0050ZAYC4|3|Earth Mama Angel Baby a Little Something for Baby Kit  was a gift for my 4th grandchild.  Great for a diaperbag and such.
B0049LUI9O|1|Bought for my boyfriend. Broke after 1st use.
B00C5HSZVW|5|I purchased this item and it is beautiful!! I love it, I am really happy, that was a gift for my mom and she really like it
B00092M30Y|5|THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT STRAIGHTENS MY HAIR WITH EASE AND IT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR--PURPLE. I BOUGHT THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF HAIR AND IT'S REALLY THICK SO TO FIND A FLAT IRON THAT'S 3 INCHES WIDE CAME IN HANDY. FAST AT HEATING UP. PERFECT PRODUCT IN MY BOOK.
B004HCPZ0C|1|I bought two of these hoping to use it on other ares of my face after reading so many good reviews, but I used it for maybe 4 months and finally gave up and now they are nothing but a thousand dollars worth of dust collectors.<br />I think they actually make you look worse in the long run. I was hoping  in the beginning it was just the old skin drying up and I'd shed that. and have nice smooth skin underneath, but no such luck. My lines looked deeper and it took months before they went back to the original appearance. I was worried my skin was going to stay that way.<br />And I didn't think about it when I bought them, but you are then married to these and if they break you have to buy another which was not cheap. And now they have been discontinued so what will you do after it breaks?<br />I should have thought this one out better but I got caught up in the hype on their Facebook page. I also tried a red light therapy unit and then an RF machine. None of it worked and I don't like the shocks either you get with some of those devices. My eyes began flickering like a bad neon light was on after using the RF machine for a while and it scared the hell out of me. I was diligent with one of those too and it didn't do much of anything.<br />Now I am trying a Dermaroller as a last resort. At least it has some real science behind it, so we shall see, not to mention they are dirt cheap in comparison.
B003TW70E0|5|Just received this trimmer and have only used it twice but it is great. Cleans up the neck line well and trims body hair easily. I bought a second one.
B00NVGHQN4|5|The body butter is fabulous! It's very luxurious; so incredibly soft, creamy, and not greasy. I use it at night, and it is has a very relaxing effect.
B00GGXFJ7O|5|I've only had mine for a couple of days but so far I love it! I was worried that the bristles would be to soft or that it wouldn't spin as fast as I would like but those worries have been put to rest. It functions just as I had hoped. I went through a ton of reviews on this and the other products like this and I am happy that I chose this one. The pumice works just ok, but I'm not a big fan of pumice stones any way. All the other brushes and especially the sponge to apply moisturizer work wonderfully. It really makes a big difference, my skin is noticeably smoother and softer. I'm just hoping I don't run in to  on/off button problems like a few have mentioned. I did get a nice note from the company though and feel that they will remedy any issues I might have.
B000FKGDJW|5|My family really enjoys this lotion.  It feels great going onto the skin and smells pleasant, not purfumery.  It works well! <br /> <br />
B003STJV6E|5|It is a good product that I would recommend to all friends and strangers. It softened and brighten the complexsion. We have shared the products with number of people.
B00742JW8S|5|Many yrs. ago I had an Epilady at more than 3 times the price as the Satinelle. I always wanted to get a replacement and I finally bought the Satinelle.<br />I'm very pleased with it. If you follow the instructions you will have very little discomfort. The only area that &#34;smarted&#34; was the upper lip and I found if I stretched out the skin as recommended in the instructions it made a difference. I also used it under my arms and it worked great and putting on deodorant right after didn't sting like it does when shaving. It does a great job on peach fuzz on the face and back of the neck.<br />Use the Satinelle right after washing your face and showering and remember to stretch the skin.<br />I highly recommend this product, it does what it says it will do and is very reasonably priced.
B000Q46K86|5|This toothpaste obviously has a slight salty after taste to it, but I barely notice it and in fact kind of enjoy it (reminds me of when I got my lip pierced and used sea salt to clean it).  Anyway, I've tried other salt-based toothpastes and this by far gives me the freshest feeling afterward.  My mouth feels refreshed, my gums are smooth, and it makes you wanna lick your teeth they feel so good.  Pair this up with some floss and you're really going to feel like a team of excavators went in your mouth and dug up all that grime.  Although a metal tube means you have to put a little more thought on how you squeeze your toothpaste;  I enjoy using metal/glass in place of plastic for storing things because It gives me piece of mind that the contains wont get contaminated from chemicals used in plastics.  I recommend this product and will buy again when I run out.
B00RGXEQ8Q|5|Awesome awesome awesome little shaving brush. This and the Wee Scott are the two best small brushes you will find. Great backbone by very soft. The best of boar and badger!!
B002ACKKMO|4|The same than the pic. I didn't use jet but looks fantastic
B002TSA948|5|This was a great deal. It was almost two for the price of one. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, appropriate for men and women. On my second bottle now and love the fragrant lather that goes a long way
B007ZN5ATQ|5|The best toothbrush for keeping my teeth clean.  It can travel without the base for up to two weeks before needing to be charged.
B00GYB13OQ|2|This product is essentially baby oil (mineral oil) in a mister bottle.  And it hydrates well, as does baby oil.  However, it leaves my skin feeling oily and I wouldn't want to get it on clothes.<br /><br />The argania spinosa oil is the third ingredient, after fragrance.  Fragrance is usually a small fraction of ingredients in most ingredients, so I have to assume that the argania oil in this product is a small portion of its ingredients.  If that is not true, I'd be happy to know otherwise.<br /><br />The Amazon product page at the time I write this review is a mishmash of this product and a Suave self-tanning product.  The picture of the product and the product name are the same as mine, but the ingredient list is nothing close to the ingredients listed on my bottle of dry body oil spray.  This spray is not a self-tanner.<br /><br />I do like the smell of this oil.  The spray bottle works pretty well considering it is spraying oil, but the spray still has to be smoothed out with my hands, leaving my hands feeling oily.  I works better for me to spray the oil into my palm, since I'm going to have to wash my hands after using this anyway, and spread the oil where I want it.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is overpriced baby oil and not worth getting again.
B00B6U1JYO|5|So far so good!  I often have a very dry scalp and wanted to use a natural shampoo that would address this problem besides Tea Tree shampoo which dries my hair out. I've been using it for a couple weeks and it's been working it's magic. The longer I use it, the better my scalp gets. Highly recommend.
B000IZ6NHG|5|I tend to have dry skin on my jawline and forehead so I use a light light moisturizer all over and then apply this to my forehead and jawline (keep away from eyes, it stings). The oils keep my skin moisturized all day and on the rare sunny days we have I enjoy the sunscreen protection this lotion provides. In over a year of daily use from one bottle I have noticed no breakouts or ill effects to my sensitive skin. I'm on here to buy a new bottle because I can't seem to find it in my town anymore.
B001ULD0S2|5|Let me start out by saying that I'm very happy with this brush so far and I do believe that its a good investment and believe that it will work for most men. I did go through a bit of an extensive product search when looking at this item, debating what product to get, where to get it, which model to get (even color actually matters for Clarisonic a bit), so I decided to split this up into a few sections regarding decisions made for the purchase, alternatives explored, and then benefits of the brush itself.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Color/First important detail: If you're a woman, think carefully about purchasing this model (Pro) or any other Clarisonic brush in grey or black colors. These models are the \\"for men\\" models, and while the design is identical the brush head is different. The natural selection is \\"normal\\" as opposed to sensitive on every other brush. The brush heads are replaceable and Clarisonic will send two for 40 dollars (32 if you sign up for 3 month refills) so if you love the color its \\"fixable\\" just going to cost you something. You may even like the normal brush head more than the sensitive, but letting you know. Similarly for men, if you buy any other colors know you may need to buy the firmer brush head.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Warranty/Second important detail: Clarisonic only guarantees the warranty on products purchased from approved retailers and MOST of the Amazon sellers are not approved retailers. It cheaper (generally I assume) to buy from Amazon and I even spoke to Clarisonic who said it would probably be fine if I did need service and were able to register the product no problem, but no guarantee.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Selection of a Clarisonic brush: There are a few other options around that I considered before purchasing this unit as far as competitors. Pro-X from Olay seems to be the biggest competition and really is one of the strongest alternatives simply because of its price. Rather than vibrate the way the Clarisonicdoes, the Pro-X rotates. At only 35? dollars if you're really debating the Pro-X and can't decide I'd almost say just try it for a month and see if you like it, if it works for you why pay the extra money especially considering how reviews tend to flip flop. There are 3 factors that made me choose Clarisonic however.<br /><br />1) Charge: Pro-X uses batteries while the Clarisonic systems all use a form of charging. I personally hate having to switch batteries around and frankly feel better having a waterproof system than a water resistant one. Bonus Clarisonic.<br /><br />2) Vibration seems like a better solution: I can't cite a ton of science here but it seems to me that if both products make you're face clean and serve their purpose, than a vibration would probably be less grating on the skin. If the face is clean and smooth I just like the idea of putting something vibrating on my face more than something that sounds grating. Bonus Clarisonic.<br /><br />3) Price: I'm going to use the opposite of common sense logic here and argue that the Pro-X's price made me not want it as much. I'm probably a sucker but I just feel that at 35 dollars I'm asking for something cheap and the batter compartment seemed to drive this home for me. Maybe it works and maybe its even very nice, but I do feel like the Clarisonic would be sturdier and preferable to me. Bonus Pro-X until I warp it around in my head (yes I admit it I also have a Macbook Pro).<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />WHICH Clarisonic brush to buy: There's a wide variety of Clarisonic brushes out there to buy but I felt that the Pro was the best option.<br /><br />Mia: Clearly the cheapest of the brushes and from all I read about it most people seem to like it just fine. It has one speed and a one year warranty and sells for approximately 109 on Amazon. The speed just fyi is the \\"normal\\" speed (2nd of 4 speeds on the pro).<br /><br />Mia2: The Mia2 has a two year warranty and two speeds compared to the regularMia's one speed. Sensitive and normal (1st and 2nd of 4 speeds on the Pro).<br /><br />Aria: Two year warranty and three speeds (1st, 2nd, and 3rd of 4 speeds on the pro). The Aria also has what appears to be the best user interface and allows usb charging. Its frankly just a newer and prettier model than any of the other versions although it didn't seem to be anything significant in my opinion since all were easy to use.<br /><br />Plus: Two year warranty and three speeds plus a body mode (1st, 2nd, and 3rd of 4 speeds on pro plus body). The only version other than the pro with body function it seemed to run at the same price as the pro but lacked the 4th speed and extra year of warranty.<br /><br />Pro: Three year warranty and four speeds plus a body mode.<br /><br />In the end I decided the Plus was out automatically because I saw absolutely no advantage to it over the Pro. Similarly I felt the Aria, which was just under the price of the Pro/Plus and sometimes even more expensive because you can't find discounts offered no benefit I cared about. Lastly the Mia 2 offered an extra year of warranty over the regular Mia, but as a man I found it very unlikely I'd ever need the sensitive speed. I decided I'd rather either save the most money with the Mia for $109, or get the most options with the Pro for $168.<br /><br />Ultimately I decided that the 3 year warranty over one year, ability to use the product for body purposes (don't know if I will but still), and the extra speeds I debated possibly needing were worth the extra 60 dollars and went with the Pro. Having experienced the brush I've found that my favorite speed is \\"High\\" so I'm very glad I did spend the extra money.<br /><br />Location to Purchase: I'm putting this right after the model selection because the selection of models is important. I found what seems to be a very good website called Skincare. They have traditional prices with some sales, but most importantly they offer a 115% price match guarantee,where they'll match the difference between the cost they have and the one you find and even subtract an extra 15%, and this includes Amazon prices. They ARE an authorized retailer of Clarisonic and carry every model EXCEPT the Pro. I decided I wanted the pro though so I purchased on Amazon figuring I wouldn't find a better deal and really I've had great experiences with Amazon and their return policies.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Finally!... Why I like this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />  Feels good while using. I actually enjoy the vibration and use it after a work out kind of relaxing after the shower.<br /><br />  Usable in shower or bath. I don't actually use it here but you can if you want.<br /><br />  Multiple speeds. I prefer the high speed but I only use it once daily max. I have a feeling this could become a bit too much if it was used for more than once a day.<br /><br />  Auto timer with beeps. Lets you know the approximate speed you should be moving. First time I did this I was spending way too long but its really not hard to keep within the time frame.<br /><br />  Doesn't need Clarisonic cleanser. I don't want to feel like I have to use their product all the time, its not bad but I have my own I like using.<br /><br />  No need to use any exfoliating products. If you do this could probably save a decent amount of money over time.<br /><br />  Sensitive options. I've never had overly problematic skin, but its given me no problems with a normal brush on high speed. If you keep the usage reasonable and used the sensitive brush/speed as needed, I guess I have difficulty understanding how it could be too intense for anyone. Not knocking people who have had issues, just saying there's a lot of wiggle room it seems like.<br /><br />  Leaves your face feeling very clean. I never had many break out issues or oily/dry skin but I like the way it does make you feel very clean after using.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />  Shake the brush out for a second in the skin after you wet it, can hold a ton of water and you can splash yourself.<br /><br />  Normal/Oily cleanser that comes with it (3 trial bottles) seems a bit intense for normal skin. Even though it says normal or oily I'd only use if you have oily skin. The dry/normal was fine.<br /><br />  The model I got doesn't come with a body brush (some Pro versions do), and the casing for travel doesn't really do anything beyond keeping the bristles safe (only wraps around brush head). Still cheaper than buying for 225 plus tax in a salon.<br /><br />Anyway if you buy I hope you enjoy it and hope some of this helped.
B00DPTW8JY|3|The pin itself is very pretty, but the quality is abominable!! I used this one time, it wouldn't stay in my hair and broke! It wasn't even made metal!  The old adage about getting what you pay for is so true. I should have known better!
B001B1W2D0|5|Great product
B00KMYSLTG|3|Got this for my niece for Christmas.  The brushes look nice but the case looks cheap.
B000UIERXI|5|This perfume is the best and the company is awesome, I receive the product before the estimate date.
B000NMF3DE|4|We got a new furnace a couple years ago and were surprised how pricey these thicker filters are. Normally we shop for the cheapest price, and a two pack is nice so you have a back-up on hand. Nobody here is particularly sensitive to dust or pollen, etc. so I can't speak to how effective these filters would be in that case. But for value filters that will get you through 3 or 4 months, these are fine.
B0012RXAF2|5|I bought this cologne and my girlfriend loves it its really good every time i wear it i get compliments its amazing
B006LUAYZO|4|I have found Kleancolor to be a pretty decent and inexpensive brand of nail polish! My only complaint is that it seems to take WAY longer to dry that normal polish and seems to be more gel like which makes it easier to peel off than traditional nail polish. Overall though it is a fantastic value for a fantastic price.<br /><br />If you're like me and you like to change your nail polish color often the early chipping won't bother you anyway!
B002WDXGCC|2|I have used better but works ok
B00OUDUZEY|5|I received this as a sample size in a subscription monthly make-up bag.<br /><br />I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.<br /><br />My eyelashes look false they're so long!  I had a coworker ask me if I was wearing fake ones in photos thanks to this mascara - she couldn't believe it.  Night and day difference.<br /><br />This mascara is easy to apply and doesn't clump.  Even as it is getting older and starting to dry out in the tube a little, it still goes on without clumps and I never have to use another tool to separate my lashes and declump the make-up.  Huge plus right there.  I do not use any eye make-up remover and this stuff comes off like a dream.  I do not have residual mascara lingering on my upper cheeks after a shower.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this mascara again and again and again.  For reviewing purposes: I have average eyelash length, dark brown with blond tips from middle of eyelash out.
B00HN2IO42|1|Ugly.  Hair sticks out all over.  Cap is small.
B009NVFBQU|5|I have used this shampoo conditioner combo for a few months now. It leave my hair feeling perfect, it looks a lot healthier and feels better to the touch. It also holds volume better now, maybe because it is cleaner. The smell is wonderful. The previous commenter may not have liked it because of her ethnicity, ethnic hair needs different care and this is certainly not targeted for that hair type. I LOVE this shampoo/conditioner, would buy from Amazon but its priced better at Target.
B00ON1VGT6|5|My adult acne results from a combination of stress and hormones. So far, I'm having good results with this system. It's been almost 30 days, and took about 25 to really start working. I actually like it when a product takes a while to work because the effects usually last longer. Some highlights from my experience:<br /><br />1. PERFECT SCENT PROFILE: Finally a product that doesn't smell like cheap perfume. The Benzac system has a pleasant, herbal scent that smells great going on your body but quickly fades. Fantastic. I'm so tired of products trying to compete to be THE smell on my body. Hey companies: I choose cologne for that. I don't want to smell like my acne product. Ok?<br />2. BALANCED AMOUNT OF PRODUCT: This system comes with three steps. I've tried many multi-step systems and I dislike it when one or two bottles run out way before the other(s). It ends up being wasteful--particularly with products that are only sold in kits. The Benzac system is well balanced--the bottles are each about 2/3rds empty after a month of daily use.<br />3. SKIN ISN'T OVERLY DRY: We all know that acne systems dry out your skin and can create a vicious cycle of clearing your skin only to have the requisite moisturizing create further acne troubles. This system isn't drying my skin out like others do. I love that the lotion aspect goes on lightly and leaves my skin feeling soft.<br /><br />I think this is a system I will continue using. It's reasonably priced and has good results.
B000IZ8KZ4|3|so so
B00FECMIFE|5|Nice, small compact.
B006GQYSGO|5|It gives a very close shave, is very easy to clean, and holds a charge for a long time.  It shaves so close that you have to be gentle or you will end up with skin irritation.  If you have sensitive skin it might not be the best choice.
B002KG8DGA|1|I returned this item. I purchased thinking this was a regular sized brush. But it is a miniture sized for travel.....
B007SNGSFS|5|Great value.
B00IPT88UM|5|Love it. Good price and nice product for the price
B000P27754|4|A lasting scent. If you start your morning off with it, it's definitely still around in the evening. Beautiful scent.
B00OQG7TY4|1|Arrived very quickly. It had some relaxing effect on my slightly wavy hair. It is a gel texture and not moisturising but I have an oily scalp so ok for me. Did need to use another product on my dry coloured ends. The straightening effect only lasted 24 hours and who wants to be straightening there hair every day if another product I found lasts until the next shampoo, unlike this one. I have short hair and I needed about a walnut size amount to get any result. There are better products than this one.
B003MTLFD2|5|For forty years, I have used a masking system for facial cleansing at least once a week. I was a Mary Kay customer & representative for over ten years, but noticed as the years get on -- you need more, because of the various marks that develop on one's face.  This product brought my skin to a new level...
B00WH7CZXE|5|I had given up contouring, because with fair skin and blond hair, nothing looked right. I don't even know why I chose to try this, but I'm glad I did. It's wonderful. LOVE the brush - soft and blends well. The contour is perfect - not orangey like many shades are, and this is the only bronzer shade I've ever used that didn't need some kind of tweaking with a lighter powder or touch of blush. It is very natural looking.
B00MRH014E|5|Not only does this balm smell great, it helps control &#34; bushy beard &#34; I'm on my second tin, and I'll be back.
B0087O4XKE|5|ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT
B003SJ0FSW|5|I have used this product before and is still one of my favorites
B00AC2P7FO|5|My favorite of the Polos, so far.
B00FRDPNA2|5|I received this complimentary sample and I am sold on the value of this product; no frizz on this humid day and love the smell, highly recommend this product!!!
B007C5Q9FQ|5|The old lady was borderline hideous before she found this stuff. Now when she smiles I can see myself in her teeth which is awesome.
B002WF43FE|5|It is my girlfriends favorite perfume. It was also a great deal for the large bottle . She was so happy to open her Xmas gift to find it inside . Thank you
B0017JRKNS|4|i got this product after smelling a sample sized lotion a friend of mine had. it smells really clean, and sweet at the same time. not too heavy.     i love it, only complaint is, i think it could last a little longer for the amount of money you pay for it. layering the scent helps....
B00HO7AK6G|3|It was really<br />Cute but the pink flower piece came out right away i havent used it yet. I was looking how it<br />Looks anf the pink piece came out. But u can fix by adding glue<br />It.
B0031ZV8OS|5|It works! I bought this brush to try on my daughter's curly, tangle-prone hair. It gets out even knotted tangles, and I don't feel like I'm pulling/stretching/damaging her hair. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.
B001ET76AI|4|First, this product does what it promises: it does not sting or burn, and it does leave the mouth feeling clean and fresh.  I expect it is a godsend for those with severe halitosis.  I like that it's American made, not tested on animals and comes packaged like an old-fashioned private label product your town pharmacist would make up in the back of the store.  The price is fair and it gives good value.  It works.<br /><br />The reason I deactivated my subscription is that using this product temporarily leaves a strong metallic taste in my mouth that interferes with enjoyment of everything I eat or drink, even plain water.  It's like a combination of baking soda, peppermint and stainless steel that won't go away.  It works okay used in the evening for slightly less than the recommended one minute, then rinsed a minute later with plain water, when I'm not going to eat for about 9-10 hours. I made the mistake of trying it twice in one day and decided it would make a great weight loss aid - made food taste terrible.  It took two days for this lingering after-taste to disappear.  So it all depends on your priorities - odorless breath or the pleasures of good eating.
B005IVZ452|5|Just the right amount of color for me (fair-skinned redhead), keeps my lips soft, and it TASTES GOOD.  Even my hubby likes it.  I take this with me EVERYWHERE.  I don't wear a lot of makeup, usually just mascara and lip gloss, and this is BY FAR my favorite.  I'm buying up every one I can find.
B0009OAHC8|5|Smells great and the bottle size is very good.  A little goes a long way and my wife loves the smell.
B0012XO2W6|2|Who the $#@! would think it's a good idea to tint sunscreen, and a single tint at that? The shade of this stuff is far too dark for me and I would assume it would be far too light for a number of skin tones as well. A single shade that only matches a narrow range of people with medium skin tones is an incredibly stupid idea.
B001ELJO0Q|5|This roller set is perfect for me.  I had a new haircut, slightly above shoulder length, tho I will likely let it grow and will still be able to use this set. I do however, have fine, thin hair, so while 10 rollers are just right, I'm not going to say they'd be enough for someone with a head of thick hair. I have a slight wave, silky textured hair, if that is helpful to know. These rollers do not get caught, I did decide to look online and get another type of clip, after I misplaced one of the metal ones, and I think I like the \\"grip\\" type clips better, they are available on amazon as well, the metal clips are fine, but they sometimes take a little more time and effort to put in.<br />In essence, this set heats nicely, does the job, the rollers don't get tangled, and has not damaged my hair in anyway. I didn't buy it for travel, but for every day use and it fits easily in the bathroom and would certainly travel well, the metal clips are in a little inner slot behind the rollers.<br /><br />I'd recommend this item.
B00AF63QQE|5|Love this product it got rid of my blemishes and dark circles so fast . It gave me the confidence to go out without makeup
B00CC7TBHM|5|Fast shipping great material packed safely would buy again
B007O73GT4|2|Eh, I'm not impressed.  Really didn't feel energized and puffiness under the eyes didn't go away any quicker.
B00GM30OFA|5|item as expected.  works well
B000052XDA|5|The only cleaning solution that doesn't hurt my eyes.
B00FQD0LNW|3|I usually only stick to créme lashes the (ones on the left) but I thought I tried these ones out. They feel good they aren't plasticky or hard to bend. They could be more fuller though. I haven't actually wore them yet, but they seem like they will hold up okay, shipping was fast as well. Not much to complain about. 👍
B000NKHICK|5|Compact and affordable: hooked handle loops over showerhead and easily comes apart for storage. I take it on all my trips!
B001M1JC6O|1|Purchased as a gift & was very disappointed.  It doesn't heat the shaving cream very well & wastes a lot of cream because you can't control the amount it dispenses.
B0007Q3E78|5|I am prone to tartar buildup and this is the only toothpaste that seems most effective at preventing tartar buildup for me.  I have recommended it to all my family members and all of them have also switched over to this brand.  Thanks.
B008QFRPFY|1|Broke out my face really bad..had to stop using after a few days.  Will see about another product that may work better
B00D8LEMKW|2|and have seen NO change.  Still have the one age spot I am trying to diminish.<br />Will not purchase this item again - will find something better<br />I am a huge BioElements users as well - so surprisingly, disappointed.
B002RT71S6|4|Great hairspray, not too heavy and helps keep hair manageable. Also comes in travel sizes. I have been using for several years.
B00ADI0GVC|5|I love it this is the perfect razer to cut fimo rods with! you do not need five one will be enough. It is easy to use and sharp enough to cut each slice perfectly you do however have to be the one managing the thickness of thiness of each slice and know how to work the razer but its really simple to use.
B005LFR17O|5|If you travel a lot and have an electric toothbrush at home, you need one of these! I love how well it cleans, how long it lasts, and the fact that it's for travel. At this point, I can't imagine not having one of these.
B0064PKJ6A|4|bought this set for me and my parents. so far I've never experienced having a hard time using this. the handle is pretty cool too!
B001AJ6YS2|3|It's a nice shaver but the green light stays on all the time,can't charge the Shaver,so I gave this 3 stars,maybe mine is broken but it works ok so I'm keeping it,
B003YJ6RHE|5|A little expensive.  However the combination of shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever bought and I have tried at least 30 other brands.  Smells great. Works great.
B0016S43QC|5|Smells amazing, good for the environment and not tested on animals!
B000186XHA|5|When I received this product I was afraid that I would go through it too quickly for how much I paid for it, but it turns out you only need a little to cover your whole face.  It feels wonderful going on, and it really does unclog pores well.  If you're worried about blackheads, this is not your product, but if you can just see oils/etc sitting in your pores, this is the product to clean all of that out without hurting sensitive skin.
B000MPFKZ8|5|great shine and frizz ease!
B007NJ94U8|5|These are the perfect size bottles to carry with me in my purse, my car and my locker at work. This is also a cheaper way to test out all 5 of the different pleasures scents. Great deal!
B00CBW6VIU|5|They really stay on.
B002UEERKS|5|This is the best Shampoo...ever! I have using this product for years and I get compliments from my Stylist all the time on how good and healthy my hair feels, even after continuing to color/highlight my hair.
B00BHN5A68|4|It was small than I expected,  especially the foundation and the lipsticks, but I enjoyed.
B0000ZLEWS|2|I bought this for my wife.  We both really liked the Patchouli scent we remembered from years ago.  Unfortunately this did not measure up.  It had a sharp industrial smell to it like oil used on machining tools like lathes and milling machines.  Maybe if you were Tim Taylor from Tool Time you might like it.  I wonder if it is just defective becuase I cannot imagine anyone really liking it.<br /><br />We were very disappointed.
B00B1TKY8C|4|For the price I am happy - I did not want to spend too much money, but wanted to see what &#34;pure badger&#34; is all about. This was it.  After soaking in warm water for a couple of minutes, I shake off excess water, swirl it in the tub of Proraso Shaving Soap (exquisite!) and then swirl it in my ceramic mug until I get nice lather. Very economical and plenty of foam to lather up your face 3-4 times (which you may need with straight edge razor). I was using a cheaper boar bristle brush of the same size and I like badger better.  A few bristles do come off periodically, but I assume this is about standard. I've had it for almost 2 years and it's still going strong. I was concerned that the head might come undone from constant contact with water, but it's solid so far.  UPDATE: It's been about 3 years and it's still going strong. I have since tried a couple of other cheap &#34;badger&#34; brushes (one of them was not 100% badger as advertised and the knot fell out of handle after a few months). This one is still solid. It'll lose an occasional hair, but as bad as some others.
B002Z7FUXS|5|Lancome is one of the department store products I like to purchase, particularly when they have gift offers with purchase.  That is how I acquired my last 1.7 oz jar of this cream.  Normally I use different line of skin products but they caurrently do not carry daytime skin moisturizer with SPF.  So I picked Bienfait Multi-Vital for several reasons: it has SPF 30 that will protect one's skin from harmful broad spectrum light; product contains vitamin E, B5 and CG plus high potency moisturization.<br /><br />My skin is combination skin.  So when it comes to daytime moisturizers, I like the kinds that will not make my skin look shiny or greasy.  This product is great because only a little dab covers the entire face and neck.  Cream absorbs quickly and I can easily apply face powder without any streaking.<br /><br />It is important to mention that if you are going to stay outside, exposed to the sun for the extended period of time, you should re-apply this cream at least every couple of hours.
B0077LAJT2|3|Ok but nowhere near as good as the personnas that come in the 10ct dispenser which outlast the 100ct many times. The astras are better for me than these.
B00DDRXRFM|5|love it but i was hoping for some other design plates.
B003MJ7Z0O|5|This product filled up my atrophic scars from cortisone injections into keloids (in combo with derma roller), super soft baby skin, and thicker lips!
B00A3LHIO2|5|I have been getting waxed for a year and decided it was time to try doing it myself to save some money.<br /><br />Like other reviewers said, buy extra non-woven wax strips, as there are not a ton of them in the kit (I ran out when I was only 1/4 through the jar of wax and went to get some at the beauty supply store, only to realize that they are much more affordable here on amazon).<br /><br />Make sure you spread it on thin, that is key to how this wax works. I couldn't do my underarms myself, so I had the hubs help me and it only took 2 attempts to get the hang of it. I also did my bikini area with no problems. I found this to be less painful than hard wax, which was a pleasant surprise. And as bonus my sensitive skin didn't react at all (with the tiny white bumps or soreness) - I only had a little redness right after I did and my skin looked great when I woke up the next morning! So glad I found this.
B000068PBT|2|I am not sure why, but if I miss a day of shaving the next shave can be very irritating, and my face burns, almost as if shaving with a dull razor. I used this to replace my older heads, so you would think the shave would have been smoother.  And they were a little bit on the expensive side.  Next time I will just buy a new razor.
B007PUHYCU|5|Love it!
B003RRTUNG|4|It took some practice using it .learned you got to scotch tape the white sheet to the carbon or it just rolls it up in machine .good after got past that.
B0057UVWXC|3|I was looking for something with a cross between salty ocean and Mediterranean gourmand like figs and citrus, but this wasn't it. To me it just smelt like trees on my skin, and as a girl I do not want to smell like a tree, thanks, but no thanks.
B000C1VVQO|2|I purchase this for a gift and when I received it, it looked like it has been used.  Too much was missing out of the bottle.
B001L40OUK|5|I really liked it, i used it for new year's and it really looked natural. It gave me a nice color but very natural wish i really. really liked alot. Will definitely recommend it.
B004L18FY2|5|I was very skeptical about all these products.  I thought there is NO product that can really tame Black hair. (or African American if you prefer).  I am Black, with Black hair, no mixed anything..just very kinky black hair.  I am transitioning off a perm (thank goodness) and only have a few straight ends left.  I tried Carol's Daughter and Blended Beauty products.  They are both what I expected and resigned myself to their uses.  But a friend at work told me about Mixed Chicks.  I thought, yeah another product to buy with similar results.  Boy was I surprised after the very first use!  This changes the very texture of your hair, almost like a jerri curl but without the jerri curl juice drip or the greasiness. You can keep the silk serum though...does not add anything to the mix.  The real star of this quartet is the leave-in conditioner, it is priceless.  My real secret though is using the leave-in conditioner with a little bit of the Blended Beauty's \\"Happy Nappy\\".  They give me shiny, glossy, curly hair that makes people wonder if I am Indian.  Believe me, I am proud to be Black, but this stuff just makes your hair so nice and manageable.
B0063022XE|5|Arrived before scheduled time. Amazing product. Will always buy. And happy that I also purchased the Cleanser in Almond Cookie as well.
B0043OYFKU|3|face glowed after just one time but i lost a chunk of hair from behind my ear, put up all hair before using this product.
B001AJ6QNA|1|I bought a NORELCO ,  months ago , awesome deal , so I figured I buy a back-up but didn't notice , this one  wasn't cordless
B001VD7WQU|3|hard to keep short hair in the curler
B00S63656Q|5|I love this bag, it is actually just large enough to hold all of my make up in one place.  It feels nice to the touch, and is well made.  It arrived earlier that I had anticipated, so I was happy about that. And the price was fantastic. I would recommend the bag and the seller.  Excellent!
B000C1Z3CW|5|smells great.
B00113HNB4|5|Such a great moisturizing cream for sensitive skin esp when most other moisturizers I'm allergic too.
B003XWZM0K|1|This had a strong menthol smell and it wasn't the same.  I would not buy again from them.  I received this product from my dad who got this from his doctor and loved it, so I tried to order more myself after running out and found this to be again strong in smell and not lasting like the ones I used before. The reason why it was so wonderful was because you didn't smell like these products tend to. It also lasted a really long time. The real product is wonderful , I just don't believe the ones I received were the same. =(
B00KNZWIIY|5|My wife liked it, so that's all I need to know. Gets hot enough for do it yourself Keratin.
B00112BT88|5|I have black eyebrows and fair skin and reddish brown hair. These fill-in the sparse areas of my brows with just the right color. Great price and great service from UrBargain.
B000XR8NPY|5|These exceeded my expectations, very high quality, and a great price.They will last a long time, but when I need more, I will use this company.
B009C5SD4E|1|The front of this wig is so bulky and thick it will never be worn. Also much darker than picture! Don't bother purchasing....it's inexpensive but totally looks fake and cheap!<br /><br />However, the distributor was quite gracious and respectful in refunding a full credit. No loss on my part which is commendable in these days of scams and cheats.<br /><br />Thank you.
B003VPJM6O|4|It does smell like chai tea and is very smooth.<br /><br />Just an FYI ... nowhere on the packaging does it say SPF.
B000UD5LAG|4|I have had a large Widu brush for years, and decided to get a small one for my purse as this brush causes less static electricity than others. The small one fits perfectly in my purse and works as well as a larger one.
B00HXAIJH6|5|Great, loved it
B0060P0UUO|5|Very good product. Once per week repairs your hair.
B003RL666Q|5|I wanted this for my face, as it is a great pore reducer and skin toner. It is a very pure Aloe Vera, the only one I would use on my skin, especially the face. I feel it is a great value for the money, so I am very satisfied with this product.
B00OZYBE3E|5|This one is much larger than my previous case. I did not expect it to be but I was pleasantly surprised. I have some 30 ml bottles that fit perfectly in this bag! Love it!
B00BFFQMBA|5|Overall the Ultrax Hair Maxx seems to be working. My hair is definitely not falling out - though this wasn't a huge problem I dealt with. Still, it does seem to be growing at least a little faster. Certainly better than not using anything at all. There's no bad odor or taste, plus it's much smaller than a lot of horse pills out there. I always take pills on a full stomach, so I don't get nauseous and that works in this case too. I'll definitely need to check this out long term, but so far, so good!
B000F65JSC|5|I have used eye moisturizer for years.  It provides just the right amount of moisturizing and a has a nice tint that lightens up they under eye area.  No scent so good for sensitive skin.
B001KQ7JO8|4|My husband just started using this the other day.  His last one was wooden and broke.  Thought the metal would be better and nice the it collapsed smaller to store in a drawer.
B000XVSNTQ|5|As expected.  Actually, was expecting 3 blades.  One on the razor, and two additional.  But it is only 2.
B0056GDG90|5|it helps to lift hair makes better shape
B00GTWR7AO|5|When I decided to purchase this sponge, I was not sure what I was getting, only that it appeared to be something special.  I received the product and used it immediately.  I loved it...When you take it out of the packaging, it is moist and ready to use.  I didn't use cleanser the first time, and it felt great.  Yesterday I used a little bit of cleanser just to see how it feels.  The texture of the sponge feels great on the skin.  I will have to try the other sponges by Konjac.  I recommend this product!!! ;-))
B00VF4LZFO|5|The bottle itself stands out from others I've tried, It's stylish and gives a great convenient application with a measured pump.<br /><br />The serum glides on smoothly and absorbs well into my skin, it doesn't leave a sticky residue like I've had other vitamin C serums leave.<br />has a great mild floral scent from the Geranium Essential Oil. There are so many great ingredients like  green Tea and vitamin C and E that combine to help fight signs of aging.<br /><br />I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with no irritation.<br /><br />I love that the majority of the ingredients are organic. It's extremely important that products we are putting on our face are pure and free of harmful pesticides that actually might cause more damage.<br /><br />Retseliney products seem to truly care about the quality of product they are delivering. I'd recommend this anti-aging product to friends and family any day.<br /><br />I received a promotional discount on this item.
B00KQ4TGHS|2|This serum  feels like you are putting water on your face, and I did not see any results, nor did I feel any results.  Not happy at all with the Citrus & Kale line.
B00E4UOEX6|5|I can stronly recommend this item.<br />Not much stick and easily washable.<br />Good item!!
B000OYJ8UU|5|This body butter was recommended by my Nail Technician. She keeps this product on her shelves and goes thru quite a lot in her profession. The butter can be used anywhere and I like to use it on my feet. After only one use, my feet are soft & smell quite nice.
B000C1UFIY|3|You can't find this Once very popular great smelling perfume at Macy's anymore. Not even sure where else you might find it. But this is a good price for it and my fiance loves it
B001H93Z1E|5|Great makeup I use this all the time and go back to it. Color is good and am very happy with the purchase. Thanks!
B001B8HRII|5|The best!  Works like a champ.
B00HUR3BDY|5|Would definately recommend this product! My skin is very sensitive and I have tried several brands, but was always on the lookout for something better that lasted longer than a couple of hours. This is it!! It lasts me all day and I haven't had to reapply every other hour. So glad I finally found something my sensitive skin can handle! I prefer the lavender scent over the Orage Creamsicle, but I am just thrilled to find something that works!
B0043OYFKU|5|I don't own a Clarisonic brush but I don't think I need that big of a brush anyways for that big of a price (over 100 bucks and don't get me started on the investment for the refill brushes).  I have never really had bad skin and not the type to break out all over the face.  My traumatic experiences involve one huge pimple on the chin or around the nose every now and then, but overall my skin is clear of acne.  This Olay brush would be helpful for people like me that do not experience facial or body acne issues often.  I don't recall having to change the battery yet and its been a year!  I noticed it slowing down and I thought it was the battery dying but false alarm and it went back to normal speed the next day!  I like it for the small, portable size (which you can take with you easily for travel purposes) and easy to hold in hand in the shower.  I recalled watching \\"The Drs\\" show and they mentioned this brush being just as good as going to a professional clinic and getting the microdermabrasion (THAT IS IF YOU USE IT EVERYDAY AND DO IT CORRECTLY- you can achieve similar results as doing the professional thing for so much less).  I personally feel my skin looking and feeling better with the brush exfoliating my skin everyday and probably helps absorbs the face wash and face creams.  If you're on a budget, this product is trustworthy with it's brand (I know there are a lot of knock-offs of the Olay brush) and it should do its thing just as well for you if you just need a little boost in your skincare routine.  The refill brushes should be around 10 dollars for a pack of 2, which is decent.<br /><br />By the way, if you think you clean your makeup off well...check again and use the brush to really get into your pores and you might possibly see makeup residue!
B00H2XEZ7W|5|I use it for my massage therapy practice. It is a wonderful quality oil. I combined with pure Jojoba and it absorbs into to skin nice.<br />It feels very high quality and has a nice nutty smell. Would definitely order again.
B001BKK026|2|It has a pleasant fragrance, however, it does not linger for more than hour.  The &#34;DEVIN&#34; I have used since 1982 is the greatest fragrance and works best for me.  I am sorry I followed your advertisement
B008222NVW|5|I have coarse wavy hair that is difficult to please. Normal shampoos leave it dry, brittle and frizzy. I've tried at least 20 different hair style products to calm down my hair. This one is the most effective -- it nourishes my hair and gives it a shine without weighing down with &#34;gunk&#34;. Just a few spritzes after washing make my hair soft and shiny. I have shoulder-length hair and one 4oz bottle lasts me 4-5 months. The only downside is that the product is relatively expensive per bottle. I hope they continue to make it.
B0013ER62M|5|I love this product and am so disappointed it has been taken off the market. I am having a hard time finding it...come back!
B00DCF7QW0|5|Awesome
B00BG68EPU|5|i love it
B00E5IMNA8|5|Its so soft and beautiful! Really love this hair.
B00AF8DWYI|5|The smell of this product is AMAZING. SO happy with my purchase!
B00KYUXIOG|4|Have only used for a short time, but liking the results so far! My mom has also used and also liked the results so far!
B003O4FZQS|5|Excellent nail file!  Love the file and the case is great!
B00F2HDAZ8|5|Love it.
B001189I3A|4|This eye cream smells like vanilla and coffee! The smell is subtle and does not last a very long time. I really like the product, it's creamy, easy to spread, and works well. The results are not instant, it will take a few days for you to notice a change, but for me, I noticed that the skin around my eyes was less sunken and less dull at around 7 days of usage, 2x a day. I haven't seen any new wrinkles pop up and the fine lines around my eyes are less pronounced. My dark circles and eyebags are not so bad and with prolonged usage, it seems to me that the product will help improve the skin texture around my eyes. It is also long-lasting, my brother and I have been using the same bottle for two months, each of us twice a day.<br /><br />If you'd like, put the product in the fridge for a cold pick-me-up eye cream in the morning, but beware, the colder it is, the more difficult it may be to pump the product out of the tube later on.<br /><br />One thing to note: the product should always be stored properly, or it will be difficult to pump it out. Eventually, the product clumps along the sides of the tube and it difficult to get out!
B000KHTE8M|4|This shampoo works fine. I am glad I ordered it.
B009HULKLW|1|The Curlformers prices are high, but it's an investment worth making in my opinion. These counterfeit curlformers are a far inferior product than Curlformers<br /><br />* The hook is made of incredibly cheap, flimsy plastic.<br />* Mesh and coil quality are low-grade and not like the real thing.<br />* Hair snags and is harder to pull through the coil unlike the real thing.
B00HT6E2NY|5|Great price, much cheaper than the local stores. I love these razors
B002VWL2FW|1|I'm really disappointed in this product. It claims that it clears skin, but really it makes it worse. It smells nice, but when you use it, it feels like you're putting sludge on your face. There are so many oils in it that it can only be good for someone with incredibly dry skin. It makes my face break out terribly. There are much better scrubs out there on the market.
B005XUNG5I|5|This is so much easier than scraping with any other product I've used.  Leaves your feet smooth and not scratchy.....
B00H8V6J2C|5|Great brush.  Holds the right amount. Great feel with the angled bristles. Showed it to my friends and they are impressed.  We shall be ordering more. Love it!<br />Mary<br />Toledo, OH
B002PEBIKA|5|I luv it
B002DMJMVQ|2|I heard this was great stuff but it just didn't work out for me, so I returned it.  Maybe it works for others and is a good product but I found it difficult to work with, even following the standard way to apply concealer the professional way, i.e., using light fingertip taps and a professional brush.
B0091MEIO2|5|I love this Mascara!!! it definitely is my fav out of all iv tried (which is a lot.) It makes my lashes look so much longer and fuller without looking clumpy. I prefer the smaller sample tube over the large full size. I think it lasts longer without drying out.
B00C1NAQ8U|5|These wax-strips are absolutely perfect. (The body wax strips are also good.) I've never waxed myself before, but it's very simple. You rub the strip between your hands to warm it up, you peel it apart like a bandaid, you apply the wax side to your upper lip, pull the area taut, and pull. (I use a larger strip and apply it to my whole lip, I pull from the right, then the left, and then I get the middle.) If it leaves a few little hairs, you can reuse the strip to quickly catch those baby hairs, and the other side of the strip with the fresh wax can be folded in half and used for next time! The oil gets all the wax off easily. Seriously, my lip is now perfectly smooth, not a hair in sight, and it maybe took five minutes. It stings just like any wax does, but the redness wasn't terrible, (and I'm very, very pale, I can stay red all day, but it faded quickly.)<br /><br />The only tip I have is that the first time I used them, even though I showered right afterward, I guess I didn't manage to get all the oil off my face. I broke out disgustingly, it was awful. Now I use just a touch of dishsoap diluted well with water to get the oil off completely, because if you have sensitive skin, that oil wreaks havoc on your complexion.
B008PEMR0O|5|THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE. THIS PRODUCT I'D RECOMMEND TO<br />FAMILY AND FRIENDS. TRULY THE PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHOSE PERSONAL HYGIENES ARE<br />VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.
B0085MPNNY|5|Best eye pads ive found! The silk surface doesnt stick to the lash like the &#34;lint free&#34; pads ive tried. The adhesive is strong so they stay put but not so strong that it hurts to remove them. The shape fits better on smaller eyes too. My clients are happy! When my clients ate happy im happy :)
B0067YU8DC|3|As with the shampoo, this product just did not live up to the 5-star reviews I read, although it was ok.
B004T3W6KG|5|Hands down best hair powder I've ever tried - and trust me girls, I've tried them all. Lulu Organics hair powder smells divine and works wonders - both as a styling product and for that non-greasy look. Yes, the first try is tricky but after using it for more than a year now I'll have to say the Vetiver/black pepper version has become a close and trustworthy friend. Skip the comb and hairbrush, your fingertips will do.   Keep on rocking!   P.S  If there was ever any plans to make essential oil blends I want to be on the waiting list - somebody on your team has the olfactory sense of a goddess.
B001DR49PG|5|I brought both the shampoo and conditioner.  I have really dry, curly long hair.  They left my hair very soft and manageable. I would highly recommend this product.
B004K8QS1I|5|One spray of this after you apply your makeup and you are set for the day! I cant believe it worked so well. I am leery of most products that claim to do what this one does. However, it kept my makeup in place on my traditionally oily skin. I will definitely order this again. Its the new staple in my makeup regi....
B0058CJV50|4|I like this product but I use it sparingly because flat irons are so hot already.  I only use it once month to protect my daughters hair from the heat.
B004UALZNM|2|Poor quality. In my opinion.  I have full body tattoos and the ink that was used on me previously was better.
B000VDFJ9I|5|A little on the pricey side but it works great and has 5 in 1 can't go wrong there.
B00502NMU8|5|I've heard good reviews about Tamanu oil, and since I've decided to go &#34;crunchy&#34; with my skincare regimen, I thought this might be a good addition to my collection.  This oil is amazing!  So moisturizing, it smooths out the discoloration in my face and even reduced the appearance of acne scars.  I use jojoba or argan as my carrier oil and add just one or two drops of this and it makes a wonderful facial moisturizer.  I usually break out during my period but since I started using this that has not happened at all!  Pricey but well worth it's weight in gold!
B002Z7FRT0|5|It's thick and black, goes on smoothly, and the brush separates lashes nicely. It doesn't last as long as Maybelline Great Lash, however.
B009NQKKMU|4|Too many pieces, but a great kit.
B005KVQAUS|5|Nice warm scent.  This has been my signature scent for over 20 years.  Nice and light and not overbearing.
B0006B12KK|5|Wonderful product<br />Fantastic deal<br />Deliver the shipment on time<br />I'm looking forward to cooperate with you again<br />Thank you very much
B002EP9OUG|5|I purchased this kit a few months ago. I was a little apprehensive but used it anyway. This kit works well!!! I have no complaints. It's pretty straight forward; turn on the heater, wait for the wax to heat up then apply to the area in question.
B0000ZHOEU|1|This product is suppose to be for sensitive skin but it irritated my skin @ was too drying. This may be good for other people but not for me.
B001L9FZDG|5|This product seems to be the first product that really works for my skin type.  It keeps my face clean and clear and doesn't seem to dry out my skin or make it red.  Will buy again.
B005CHHO46|3|Okay, I was all ready to leave a 5 star review, as I have used the Remington IPL for one full body treatment, and have noticed markedly decreased growth in all areas.  I was very excited to start my scheduled second full body treatment tonight, only to get about 2/3 of my left calf done(30 pulses), and the thing quit!!  The little yellow indicator light came on that shows you it no longer has any flashes left, so ...dead in the water with only a small portion of one leg on it's way to being hair free. :(. I KNOW I didn't come close to using this product for 1500 pulses, so I'm highly dissatisfied with the fact I now have to order and wait on a new cartridge, not to mention dish out more money way sooner than expected just to continue the treatments.  This product is not that cheap, so to have to chuck out another $25 already after one body treatment is assanine.  I will post an update to this once I complete the remaining treatments.
B00L9D0106|2|I feel like it leaves a residue on your hair or doesn't clean it very well. It could also smell a little better.
B0007UD8FC|1|I tried this foundation because I bought Clarins Gentle Day Cream recently and really love it; however, I did not like Clarins True Radiance Foundation at all. <br /> <br />It comes in a nice sized glass bottle with a pump which is great packaging but the product is far from nice.  The color match-up was perfect, but it goes on too think and it sinks into pores which makes me look overdone and very unnatural.  I felt like it never quite dried, so it left a clamy feel to my skin. <br /> <br />I will say that I have very sensitive skin prone to break-outs and it didn't react adversly with my skin at all.  I gave it a solid week, trying it at different times of day and with different moisturizers and overall, it's just not worth it.  I feel bad that I spent a lot of money on a product that I won't use anymore. <br /> <br />My opinion--not worth the money. Try Mac or Clinique. <br />
B000X2FUXC|5|It looks cordless from the pics. I wish it was cordless, still a great pair of clippers, though.
B000U8SW5M|3|I have used this wonderful iron for YEARS and love it... trouble is the frustrating barrel SPRING! It comes with 2 replacement springs and you'll need them because they BREAK! Once the first one breaks, it's all down hill from there. Although the iron does a great job straightening hair while giving it a slight and flattering bend, it has ZERO long-term durability. I used to be able to purchase replacement springs at Hot Tools, but they would charge over $5 for each spring plus another $7 dollars to ship them--because as you know, the cost of tiny little springs mailed in tiny little envelopes is SO expensive *@#*!  By the time you've purchased 2 more replacement springs, you've paid half the cost of the unit!<br /><br />I spoke to a customer svc person at Hot Tools and mentioned there was a real issue with the barrel springs on their irons. I asked why they don't address the issue and improve their product, she awknowledged that it was a recognized issue, but said that's why they sell the replacement springs. So basically, they know it's a real issue, but rather than address it and improve their product line, they prefer to make more money off of you by overcharging you for replacement springs--again, not only on the springs themselves, but on the shipping too. What a rip off. This really could be a wonderful product if they would just put their Quality Control team to work over there.
B004Y0RKNW|5|So far I have painted \\"Sparrow me the Drama\\" and \\"Mermaid's Tears\\".  I'll add photos as I remember to take them.  I love the creamy colors, and they look great on my yellow toned skin.  Two coats is sufficient, but it looks great at three.  Very long lasting color- I think the best formula since they dropped the big 3!<br /><br />They look beautiful!  I loved the mauvey Sparrow Me The Drama, it was feminine but still current.  Mermaid's tears is just amazing- so many compliments on it.
B0041HN758|4|Good product- works nice and leaves hair soft and smooth. Doesn't  last very long and too expensive.
B000Q4VBDA|4|I generally use eyeliner cake for putting on make-up at home.  But if I'm running late and putting make-up on at work it's much more convenient to use this liquid eyeliner.  Crayon or grease pencil eyeliners tend to skip and if you have to go over an over and area to fill it in, you run the risk of getting it too thick in another area.<br /><br />The attached brush is really thin and I like that as I want to enhance my eyes without them shouting that I'm wearing the stuff.  The product goes on smoothly and I feel like I have a lot of control when applying it.  Those who like a darker look can add a 2nd line.<br /><br />The color I'm using is Black Pearl.  It stays on all day and once dry, there is no smudging.<br /><br />Purchased at Walgreens.
B001AV3YJM|5|I have been using this product for about five years, and swear by it.  I think my hair would be mostly white if left uncolored, and this covers it perfectly.  I use a mixture of half Light Reddish Brown and half Honey Brown; one bottle at a time; put on the whole head; leave on for an hour and a quarter without heat; wash my hair every five days; color it every two weeks. With that regimen it works very well.  I have noticed some of the waxy residue others have mentioned, but only right after coloring, and find that if I rinse it (a little color will come out) every morning until the first full shampoo, it looks fine.  Here's the clincher and the reason this hair color has improved my life: it can be used with a permanent wave!  I have straight, fine hair and need the perms to get some body and shape.  So to me this product is worth its weight in gold. The hairdresser who does my perms always says the color is very natural, and there's never a problem with gray hair at the part.
B000PWXKHI|5|I have used this shampoo, and the conditioner, for several years. I've tried other products, but always return to this one. It is a bit expensive, but is easy to stretch so the bottle lasts longer which makes it a good deal, imo. My hair has body and shine after using this shampoo which are the exact results I want, so to say that I am pleased is an understatement.
B00D1IUAQM|4|This is the perfect summer color collection and I can't wait ti try out all the colors. Plus, this is the best pricing I've ever seen for Essie polish (less than $5 per bottle!). The only thing that concerned me was that when the package arrived the box says &#34;Essie Gel&#34; and there was a separate sticker on the outside that said &#34;gel nail color&#34;. I couldn't find anywhere on the amazon page where is specified that these were gel colors. I tried a small area on my nail and was able to remove it with nail polish remover, so I don't think this will be an issue. I'll update this post if I notice any changes once I try the other colors out.
B00EPZCEPU|2|The opening on these was not centered, and the loop metal was too thick. It looks better online...
B000VZ25Q6|4|All in all this is a good quality set that works well.  I find the lather cup a bit shallow and the brush has a habit of dropping hair into the cream but it otherwise works fantastic.
B000XY09MM|5|I finally found something that works, and it discontinued at stores!!! Don't you hate when that happens. But thanks for Amazon!! I bought 2 right away! It works great on my hair, leaving my hair soft and shiny.
B00FH692PQ|4|I've been  using this product for only 2 months now and my wife have noticed some results.<br />She said my hair got a little bit darker, which means thicker. It might be still too early to judge  but I will continue to use this product for at least 6 months.<br />I like the fact that this product is organic, which makes me feel good about using it.
B000EMYHA8|4|The fact that they work says a lot for a pair of tweezers. The yellow makes them easier to find.
B00R1WNPIE|5|Love that this product is safe and not full of harsh chemicals. We used it at an amusement park the other day and it worked really well and didn't irritate our skin!
B002NVBR24|5|I have been using this product for years. I moved recently and was unable to find it around here. I bought some bump stop stuff, but it didn't work as well. Thanks Amazon for stocking this stuff! This is truly an amazing product! As a side note, the area needs to be completely dry before applying or it will not work as well. :)
B00006ANDK|5|My dentist recommended the Oral B to me about 15 years ago.  Been using them ever since.  I have receded gums.  These allow me to brush everywhere without abrading my gums further.
B002ZVV402|5|Really does work in reducing color spots!
B0098TNT3E|1|The makers of this product should not call this deep sleep.  Its a light oil-like fragrance applied to your wrists, neck and below the  temple. It did little to nothing for me.
B00HLH3UZW|5|Love this product.  Would definitely buy another one
B005BXVPWS|1|I've only used one bar so far and I see no changes in my skin. This survey may have come too soon. My dermatologist charges $11 a bar and I got 4 bars for $28 so buying from Amazon was a great find
B004BJQF1O|5|Works fine
B00020E1P8|5|Very nice, soft cotton pads.
B00J2APFMW|4|Great to shave. Cheaper than other places, such as target and Walmart! I will be buying again!
B005DHF668|5|These are the best glue on nails I have ever bought. They last about 2 weeks with hard wear on them. They don't chip and look as good as if you were to purchase a manicure... definitely worth the price!
B000JWQ3NC|5|I've been using this product for a month now and I received a great surprise. This product actually darkened my grays and greatly reduced the amount of visible gray hair. It does contain henna, so now I can hide my grays without having to buy hair dyes anymore. A little goes a long way! Great value for the money.
B00CJF21JC|5|These are excellent small scissors for fine work - such as trimming moustache, nose, or eyebrow hairs.  Overall 3 3/8&#34; long - cutting blades 5/8&#34; long.  While the tip comes to a point, it is not a sharp point that would easily penetrate skin, but very slightly blunted points.  These are very sharp and snip a hair or a few hairs readily with no effort.  Just the right tension between the blades for a good cut without being difficult to operate - this seems to be accomplished by the curvature of the blades themselves creating some tension against one another.  I was curious just how well they would work on very fine hair - such as on the arm - works great!
B0006ZM4LM|2|The Braun 340 does not shave as close as my Remington 407 and takes longer to shave.  The right angle trimmer on the Remington is a better design.  The huge plug on the cord could be a nuisance when traveling. After a month in using the 340, I am very disappointed in using this shaver.  George S.
B001N5IORC|5|I love my scrub
B0007VT4O0|2|I was disappointed with this product because having used the ANEW products, and other excellent Avon products, I had higher expectations. I think I learned that you definitely get what you pay for. I really didn't see any benefit at all with this. I am going to stick with Retroactive or the other ANEW creams I have used with success.
B0041HN758|5|this is a miracle and i wish i had known about it years ago.  Makes my hair very silky and no frizz or random waves; very good product
B003A8AJHS|5|Good everything
B002VUME42|4|It works!
B006L1DNWY|3|have not used this yet
B001ANJ1JM|5|I had a shoe from the medical center that had an open toe, was pressing uncomfortably on the top of my foot where my stress fracture is located.  I bought this shoe mainly because it had an enclosed toe.  The shoe is far superior to it in many ways.  First, it doesn't rub or crush my foot where the second metatarsal is fractured.  Second, the enclosed toe keeps my foot warm, and now that the temps are dropping, that really helps with comfort.  The last and most important part is the stability.  It doesn't shift from side to side, it doesn't require much pressing on the Velcro to keep it closed a the squared toe seems to eliminate the toe spread from hurting.  I'll be happy to recommend this shoe to anyone that needs comfort while healing from a stress fracture!
B001OVNI26|2|wasn't what i expected very disappointed, you all said that it was a thurible only to find out that it is an incense burner
B004AI7470|5|Saw results after 2 uses!
B007441K54|2|I have heard nothing but good things about Carol's Daughter.  My hair is in decent shape, so perhaps it's user error.  Maybe your hair has to be in really bad shape to appreciate this product.  I couldn't tell if it was the conditioner, shampoo, or both, but this was not good for my hair.  The mask was okay for my hair, and the only thing that I truly appreciated about the kit, other than the smell.  This should be a lotion (hint, hint).
B0014AYNBC|5|i like the soap but my wife loves it better - nuff said
B00GHON0JQ|5|This is one of the coolest colors I've ever seen, even better in person! This is officially one of my favorites!!!!
B0048A263W|5|I was very happy to find my favorite, discontinued lip gloss at such a great price!
B000VV0JSG|2|I wanted an exfoliating soap holder.  The exfoliating part works fine but the sack started unravelling in about a month, so much so that it wouldn't keep the soap in.
B000G0GW6K|4|I like this razor very much. It is very easy to use and you can use it dry or wet.
B0046VGPHQ|5|Great self-tanner. Good color, no streaks, the smell is not too bad.
B005PLQGUC|5|family thinks this is great. will by again
B002HV8Z7A|5|I have tried every conditioner in America I think to try and maintain my mustang's unruly manes!!  I bought a bottle of this on a whim and boy am I glad I did!!  I would buy stock in this company if I could!!  I sprayed it on my dirty, sun bleached, dried sweat covered horses tonight and in less than 5 minutes they all looked show ring ready!!  WOW!  A little goes a long ways and the spray bottle itself has a fantastic design!!  I highly recommend this product to anyone!
B001CS8BJ6|1|Received it quickly. At first my face barely had any hair and it failed to cut anything. I waited a couple days and it did very spot fully. Definitely not worth it and I gave it to a friend and he also had no luck.
B00JDOKJZK|5|gentle on skin, love it.
B000GHVJWA|5|Great for the price and it is original at the mall stores this same cologne goes for $60 so I think it's a great buy on here
B005RTVSGY|5|Love Moroccan oil and this travel kit was perfect to travel with. I went away for a week and it was more than enough.
B00IEU7VPA|5|I have used this product before from my estatician, but since moving to new state was unable to find it! Hurrah, here it is on Amazon, you are my hero ' it's a great product!
B00AFCOV76|5|I love the stuff because it tames flyaways but doesn't add a lot of weight which is important with my fine hair
B00593FEZ4|4|Ohhh when I first noticed that my always curly lashes were dropping after mascara application I tried the purple tube of this, lengthening, and got so much curl and hold that then I tried this one. Really very good as drugstore cosmetics go but my search did not end there, it went on to Armani Eyes to Kill waterproof which was my HG til I found Lancome Hypnose Drama WP, omg. I still use the Armani as sometimes I dont have time to use the comb then the brush of the Lancome. So Rimmel now seems clumpy but I have a tendency to leave a little mascara on and that is more likely what is causing the clumps. Both the Full Body and the lengthening DO curl, thicken, lengthen and hold the curl, I prefer this red tube to the purple. Great when you dont have a wad to spend!!
B00AAGF518|5|Very good
B00157OBRU|5|Absolutely fantastic. Great aroma and the easiest to light of any of the cones I have. Actually made me disappointed with some of the other cones I've bought because these were far superior.
B006ZYZ8S4|3|it's just alittle bit of exfoliating but no brightening effect. when l received mine, the pack did not say exfoliating brightening. just exfoliating soap
B00II2IYGO|5|Works very well!
B0049U660K|5|This product works great for me....as I have thin hair and I keep it short.  It helps me get the spike look that I like.  It gives my hair a fuller look, but remember - only use a little bit....that's all it takes.  My hairdresser used it on me and I loved it.
B003U4PT0O|4|For the price of this product I was suprised at the fairly good quality. The only thing I dont like is that there are only high and low setting but my clients dont seem to mind other than that I love it.
B000PHZ4XG|4|Great product<br /><br />Loved it
B00H8ZTQGO|5|I had originally purchased Lashperfect on sale at Pharmasave and was really happy with it compared to other mascaras I have used in the past.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find this product anywhere when I needed another one.  Luckily, I found this 2pk online at a reasonable price.  I recommend this product as it is superior to others.
B00MYFIOGG|5|I'm sold on Philosophy products now, and I especially like this night moisturizer!
B00EZ8PR1U|4|Using the Oral-B Precision Black 7000 in a darkened room is a sight to behold - with a plethora of blue-light indicators and meters this one will turn heads when in use and the not-often seen black color (for tooth hygiene products) exudes an undeniable sense of style and sleekness.<br /><br />The 7000 model includes a new 'tongue brushing' mode bumping up the grand total of pre-progammed cleaning modes to 6.  This set includes a charging stand and base attachment that holds additional brush-heads; a sexy black travel case and pouch and a wireless attachment that is used to meter brushing time per quadrant and indicators for which brushing mode is currently being used (necessary to know which of the 6 brush modes are being used).<br /><br />Those of you who have used Oral-B's premium line of toothbrushes in the past will know the satisfying cleanse that these brushes provide when used for the correct durations.  The 7000 line certainly continues the tradition and bumps up the styling form factor another notch making for one fantastically functional set.
B000TBVGBM|1|Crap
B001JL40V4|5|I really like Proactive Solution products and this is a great size.
B00022WA9U|3|Having shorter hair the only curlers I use are the smaller and medium sized rollers.  I could really use more smaller rollers and it would be nice if extra pins were included.<br />It does curl your hair fast but not very long lasting.
B00420TW1M|5|I 've been looking for this fragrance for quite sometime for my daughter. It no longer  is in the stores, they discontinued it. But, some very smart people bought a bunch and sold it for much more than it really was and made a nice bit of change. So, this is what my daughter wanted for Xmas and I found it and bought it. I wish I could have gotten the lotion and shower creme as well…too much money. I bet she will be happy with this. I did open the bottle to see what it smelled like and to me it reminds me  of cotton Candy  which isn't such a bad smell : )  I rated this a 5 because I know my daughter will be happy when she opens it Xmas morning : )  Merry Xmas all!!
B003VS8PHI|5|Great deodorant!
B005YWBOHW|5|I love this smell ever since my aunt gave me a sample of it and i fell in love
B009P4ZJXK|5|I am so, so impressed with this product.  We bought Splat hair chalk at the store for my daughter, and applying it was a mess, her entire back and top of her clothing was chalky and blue, and the colors looked faded.  These, on the other hand, were vibrant and bright, even the gold.  The silver was less bright on her dark blonde hair, but that's just because of the combination of colors.  We went swimming the day that we did the application, and after an hour and a half in the pool, there was still some visible.  It washes out, but it also has staying power.  And did I mention that it is super bright and has almost no mess while applying?
B0009PVV4A|5|I have had many flat irons, by many makers including Golden Hot, Ion, and CHI. This iron is the best, it doesnt get too hot because it has multiple heat settings, and it also doesnt fry your hair. I dont think i'll ever trade it in....
B00KWFDBKE|1|All the serum leaked out into the package, sending it back, I cant use it at all.
B000TBW0NA|4|I like it, I used it with the nail envy and I like the results. It will help with keeping your cuticles soft.
B001CA7PZU|5|Love it
B001LF4BDK|1|This lotion is so oily! It broke my skin out horribly after the first use. I have never had a reaction like this to any Olay products. But i think i will stick to using a Moisturizer instead of a lotion. If you have oily skin DO NOT BUY THIS LOTION!
B004QJ2L76|1|I LOVED this at first, it made my hair so extra soft and manageable that I wanted to sing its praises from every mountain top. Until my hair started falling out in chunks weeks later. I thought it was just a fluke until I started Googling it and it seems like I'm not alone. It was carried by QVC who has since pulled the entire line. I like their Volumizing Spray and Daily Treatment Spray, but this venture of theirs turned out to be disastrous.
B0073B3F06|4|I have a few gray hairs, but at 35 years old, I was recommended by professional hair stylist the Silver shampoo to keep up with my highlights, and blend in with the few gray hairs. Less chemical damage to my hair...more shininess to my long hairs
B004CQR9L6|3|not bad for the price and I got two pallets but they colors were just jumbled up to make it appear you are getting alot of colors when you are getting the same ones.
B0050C76CI|1|I am very dissapointed with this purchase. My daughter used these towelettes and after five minutes, her face was tomato red and stinging. She kept complaining her face was burning. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do not buy this product!
B003DL2QEQ|5|I ordered Beige #1 so I wasn't really satisfyied, but will use it anyway.  It was way higher price wise, than I thought too.
B0034E702U|5|If you have problems growing your nails this what you need
B008Z016X2|5|good!!!
B0049LUI9O|5|Love this grooming tool
B003BQ6QXK|5|Works just as described, never fogs!  It is a pretty permanent mounting solution with sticky tape and silicone so make sure you get it right the first time!
B0007CXQUW|1|This tweeze worked great a few times and then stopped working. I tried replacing the batteries and it will not turn on
B007MALUFK|5|Super shiny!
B000GBLM78|2|I found the clips on the end of the roller very difficult to attach and release.  I should have probably purchased a larger size.
B00QL593RO|5|just right
B005MMDC5G|5|Great stuff!
B000C1Z6VA|5|exelente
B008XWYBF2|3|She seemed happy to get it since it was on her gift list. I have some too and I like it
B00I32AN4K|5|Great product. i bought this product couple times and never had any problems nor dissatisfaction. Excellent quality  And excellent service ,fast shipping
B0016KC9GG|5|My skin problems come from allergic reactions to certain types of synthetic materials in the clothing I wear. Gardener's Dream Cream helps keep it under control, and eliminates the rash and irritation.
B005Y4CX3O|4|Wife is using EO for variety of purposes.  This EO seems to be high quality and was shipped quickly.  Would buy again.
B000VTQCIY|5|This is the best stuff ever for frizz and taming those flyaways I use it right after I get out of the shower while my hair is drying and also while pulling it back
B001D67O3G|4|I have tried A LOT of other lip stains and most were pathetic, this one is great!  It doesn't quite last all day but I put it on at night before bed, a little gloss over to \\"seal\\" it and in the morning it's one less thing to do before work.  This seems to make it last longer too.  The color is gorgeous, easily layered if you want it darker, no peeling or flaking, it just gradually wears off (which I like better).  I will definitely order this again, thanks Morpho.
B004G7JGHQ|3|It just takes the edge off, but the waxing still hurts really bad!
B00L9F1HE8|5|Overpriced but good product.
B005EH9ZY6|5|I love this polish for many reasons....<br /><br />- the color is amazing. Bluish, purplish. Not too dark, but not crazy bright. Works for adults, not just teens.<br />- smooth formula - even with the glitter, this polish dries relatively smooth (smoothest glitter polish I have)<br />- the 'glitter' is more of a foil look. Not real flashy.<br />- dries quickly and HARD - no need to worry about goopy polish that won't dry well<br />- have had the bottle for over a year and it hasn't dried out yet!
B000CSDDDG|5|I am so glad I can get these bath towels from Amazon!  I used to have to stock up and buy a whole bunch of them when visiting family in Hawaii, or beg them to send me some in the mail.  The rest of the mainland hasn't caught on yet (at least not mainstream stores - unless one is lucky enough to live near an Asian supermarket/store).  Thanks for making these available - I can buy them anytime now!
B006KH5BK6|4|It took a little longer to get it than I thought it would take. However, it's perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.
B000VOPG6I|4|The gel itself is great!  It smells wonderful, but isn't overwhelming.  That being said, the pump was broken and I couldn't get any of the gel out of it.  So, I replaced it with another one instead of getting another one.  I think I'd buy it again though.
B000KONYVI|4|Hello People,  if you have small lines above your lips, then buy this product.  It is the only lipline product that I have tried that actually works.
B00E4PMQAO|5|I'm a contentious shopper (I try not to buy ANYTHING made from China anytime I can!!! *uck China!) This product was made in the good ole USA!! Not cheap ass plastic (like in CHINA). It consist of metal, stainless steel to be exact, or maybe aluminum, idk. This is a great, quiet, quality piece of craftsmanship-ed piece of equipment. It has a light, and it cuts the hair in you nose clean, so, that when the hair grows back, it doesn't cut, or hurt you nostrils (anyone else have that problem?). This is good anyone who cares about their appearance should get this product, because, (1) it works, and (2) its made in America!
B000FVHRSM|1|Terrible!  99% of the product was old and expired!
B00KYW8CY0|3|Just ok
B003FBI9LS|3|Straight to the point. Yes! it works, it works wonderfully except the fact that it releases a strong oder & it leaves my hair smelling that way. Plus when you've been using this on your hair for about 10 minutes or more the grip part starts getting extreamly hot if you have it all the way on High heat. I can barely take the heat but maybe for someone who has sensitive hands you might feel like your hands are on fire. Which is why I gave this product 3 stars.
B004KB9OSE|5|This is my favorite perfume. I buy them for the fifth time. Love unobtrusive, subtle flavor. For the summer heat.
B004HSO124|5|These pencils were a Great buy!! I love the colors and they last until you take them off with makeup remover. Will be buying more if they are still available.
B000142Y2C|5|This product is the best of this type I've ever used.  I would recommend it.
B00JXOWAV6|5|The conditioner is better than the shampoo,  you can't use the shampoo every day.
B000ULH31I|5|My hair has improved so much with IRS and the Enjoy mask  used together. I get asked all the time about what I use to get my hair so shiny.
B000F9283S|5|This works. My husband uses it every day. It has never leaked once.
B00019DTOY|5|I am not a barber and can't do haircuts, but  it's great for me to use on my husband for trimming around the edges between haircuts.
B0093IPON8|4|Nice fragrance.  Wished had a longer staying power.  Would recommend it
B000B63Y1K|5|I have been using this product for about 2 years now.  I wash my hair twice a day and I needed a less harsh sulfate free shampoo.  This does the trick.  Nice smell, not girly at all.
B003M57E9A|5|This product was recommended to me by a friend.  Prior to that, I had never used it or even heard of \\"black soap\\".  Having bouts of adult acne and combination skin (dry and oily)...... this product has been a great change for me.  The overall feel of the skin is more smooth, tighter pores, and less acne.  I use the product 1-2 times daily as a wash and occassionally as a skin mask.  It only takes a small amount and works well.  I am a repeat customer and recommend giving it a try!
B00BR00YM6|1|New formula doesn't work. At all. I have very little gray but have had since I was in high school, been using this product. They recently changed something and now it doesn't work. All color is gone within a few days. Don't buy.
B006K9OQSC|5|I didn't purchase mine off of amazon, but I have to say that this is by far the best hair bun holder I have ever used. I have very long hair so only the long one works for me. I have used the donut ones in the past and they didn't work at all for me. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants a cute bun in a matter of seconds. :)
B0048NRQ8E|4|Love this product but you have to be careful with amount you use as it is a thicker oil.
B001H926PA|4|First time I've used mineral make-up.  It covers well and I don't feel like I have a ton of make-up on.  However, I only gave it 4 stars because it is messy.
B007OWPWGE|4|I would give this 5 stars, but I have small hands and this brush (no handle) is like people with regular-sized hands palming a basketball; I can barely hold onto it and I should have gotten the tiny version. If you have small kids who you want to use this on their own, I would recommend getting the smaller sized Knot Genie. It can get out any tangles and without pain. I have very fine hair, so my hair gets tangled when I wash it, after a little activity, when a breeze blows, etc. And I've always been tender-headed.This brush can even get hair untangled from a shellacking of hairspray, which I thought was impossible without a ton of pain.
B003CTVSKC|5|It's simply amazing, bit of itching if left on too long, but other than that, it's perfection I'd recommend to absolutely everyone
B000H3EMEA|5|Great coverage. Covers red spots and dark circles very well.
B003JN6JA0|5|While under a different brand, I have used this setting creme for more than 10 years.  It works for my hair and provides me with body, style control and bounce, without stiffness.
B000H7O5M0|4|So far so good. Nice detailer. I can maneuver really well with these.
B00KYW8CY0|4|So far I like this product, its too soon to say if its the best serum for anti aging but my skin does look better than when I started it.
B0002GTH1K|2|I have just general aches in my shoulder and back from everyday life. After reading the reviews I thought this would be wonderful to rub on, instead of always reaching for Ibuprofen. First- it is slightly oily and has a smell of Vicks Vapor rub (could've bought that for less). It also felt cool on, but did NOTHING - zero- for any pain relief. I did not assume it would take away ALL pain, but help significantly - nothing. Instead I simply added that odd smell to my shoulders and that's it. Would not recommend at all.
B000C235J4|5|It's a real 'lemon bomb'.  Great for the summer months.  Clean but different and 'interesting.'<br /> It is  reasonably priced too!
B001E6TYS8|4|Doesn't make a big impression, not a strong smell, but I don't have any complaints.  I wanted an organic hand soap and this fit the bill.
B00KGO8XY0|1|It might of been good but the Brush broke off n the container so I could not use it
B008SQSBJK|5|Lip s can get burnt believe me, its weird. so get this. i love the products of aquaphor. you will as well.
B0050ACZAS|1|This conditioner is horrible! It is so watery you can't feel it on your hair at all. I rinsed it out and my hair was super tangled and dry, almost as if I hadn't even used conditioner. It took me a long time to gingerly come the tangles out, and my hair looks dry and frazzled. Waste of money.
B002QHYYR0|5|This brush is great for the price.  Unlike a few other users, I have had no major problem with hair loss. (All brushes will loose a few the first time used.) A very fine bargain and the firmness of the hair is just what I wanted -- not too soft but not extra stiff either.
B00HF3XSO0|5|This is a great product.
B00CQ5Z4RQ|5|I actually bought this from Longs drugstore and I've worn it so much that I decided I should look to see if its on Amazon just in case they decide to discontinue this color anytime soon. I was so sad to see the reviews! I admit, that if I had chosen this lipstick based on the picture I would be disappointed. It is not as purple as the picture. I would describe it more as a purplish/pink. It works well with my tanned/olive skin tone. I love that it works well for a daytime work look or a fun flirty outfit. If you're interested, I recommend using a tester at the drugstore to judge for yourself.
B008DF6XXW|5|This is exactly what was required without going shopping.
B00HNJNDR8|5|Fabulous!
B00DGKH5VS|5|I currently went through a cancer journey for thirteen months. My skin was very dry and dehydrated, I went in to La Belle, just in time for Bella launching her new beauty line. Purchasing the absolute Glow Cleansing Milk, which was so gentle, Love it! Three times a week I use her Skin Refining Polish, giving my skin a boost and eliminating dry cells. Making way for her silky smooth line reducing oil and added in caviar carrot moisture. Finally, I had the skin I once had... My next purchase will be the mini pads and Age Reverse Serum, which should be in everyone's life!
B00BDJ9B3O|1|Despite reading the reviews of the off black color, I decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt and see for myself. Unfortunately, it is as other reviewer's have stated. The fibers are a charcoal or gunmetal color and not black. It is apparent as soon as you remove the protective plastic cover and see all the loose fibers stuck to it. I thought it may blend in once applied to your scalp/hair, but it's not the case. The color completely stands out and basically looks like you crawled out of a fireplace or someone grinded dust from a gun onto your head.<br /><br />I couldn't find anywhere on Amazon to upload customer images for this product, so I just uploaded them to imgur:<br /><br />imgur.com/2RZXvEe<br />imgur.com/FBafs2s<br /><br />Hopefully those links will not be blocked out and you can see exactly what it looks like.<br /><br />I was hoping to replace my Toppik with this as I have heard this is all natural whereas Toppik has one chemical compound in it, but it looks like I'm back to it until I can find a better alternative.
B00HH2I218|1|this stuff is almost like costume makeup but not even as strong, it hardly even goes on good.. just very poor quality
B00KVEEVNW|5|I received this moisturizer to try out.  This cream comes in a pump style container which I like.  The pump lets you control how much you are using.  The color is white and it has a mild smell. Once applied to the face it makes your face feel a little \\"minty.\\" LOL that's the best word I can use to describe it.  It only last a minute but you can feel a difference.  I feel my fine lines look less noticeable.  I would say the consistency would be equivalent to most day time moisturizers.  I have extremely dry skin. I would definitely use this spring, summer, and fall. Right now my skin has been fine with this because I am using a super heavy night cream for moisturizer. So far so good! For my full review, or other product reviews, check out my blog at SurveysByStephanie.tumblr.com!
B00011JOSM|5|Love this hair brush. This is the second one I have purchased. The first brush was purchased from a hair salon at twice the cost. It is lightweight and does not create any static during brushing. Can't say much more about it, other than it is a great product which I intend to continue to purchase as long as it is available for sale.
B000SSG0EE|1|Almost useless. Leaves marks on your skin.
B005F8ND8I|2|It is not the same as the Mac product sold in stores so better to pay full price instead after all.
B00F6IMIZG|5|Good stuff, strong as h*ll, makes hair shiny.  Don't go to barber, hairdresser  for haircut with this product in your hair or they will hate you lol.  It doesn't sweat or melt out of your hair and it'll take a torential downpour to ruin it's hold but it washes out very easily with soap and water in the shower.
B00SI5895C|5|I was able to get this product for free and let me tell you! WOW!!  This has a really earth scent and is quite lovely!!  My husband LOVES it!!
B004KEQNNK|5|Excelent
B00C5RIE68|5|No fragrance is great ! It doesn't mess up my eau de toilette.
B00TNS4V5U|5|Wonderful brush.  Have long hair and it glides through so nicely.
B004OHQR1Q|5|I really liked this product, I use it more than once a week. It is good quality and great colors, really cool.
B002RBF1PO|5|Best razor I've ever owned! Well worth the money. If you're thinking of buying this razor... don't hesitate!
B002N5MIBE|5|I live in a very rural area and walmart, target etc did not carry.  Hard to find on internet also, you can find the detangler, but not the conditioner.  So glad I finally found it.. Works great to moisturize my daughters thick curly hair instantly.  A great leave in
B0036OJEFO|5|Purchased this to add some volume to my hair and it works great. Took me a couple of times using it to get the best results (first time I've ever teased my hair was with this brush, so user error was involved!). But once I figured out the proper way to tease my hair, I have been unable to put it down. No complaints here. Excellent quality, especially for the price!
B00N20M8M8|5|Packaged in a 1 ounce dark brown glass bottle with a pump top. The brown bottle will help prevent oxidation of the Vitamin C, since the Vitamin C in this product is Ascorbic Acid, (better for antiaging),  SAP Vitamin C is the kind of Vitamin C in most Vitamin C serums, but it is really better for acne prone skin, but it used more since it is more stable. The serum is really a firm clear gel and has no smell I can detect. 2 pumps and it is enough for your entire face. Absorbs very fast, leave no oil or residue, and no irritation.<br /><br />I have used it 3 days morning and night and it makes my skin feel wonderful, soft and smooth. It has helped with the bags under my eyes and the firmness is a touch better also. Lines and crows feet are more moisturized and filling in a bit. Can't see any difference in dark spots yet, not had enough time, but the skin tone is starting to be a lot more even in general. I have a redness in my cheeks, capillaries close to the skin and this has helped with that also. Since I have had no irritation it is a keeper for me, I have sensitive skin and a lot of products don't work for me.<br /><br />This has quality ingredients, made in the USA, paraben free, cruelty free, not tested on animals and comes with a money back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose, only better skin to be revealed. Just a note, combine this with their cleanser and Vit C moisturizer and it is grand!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

B008CCO6LW|4|I love the cocoa butter smell. It's subtle, but nice.<br /><br />It can be shocking to see just how small the container is, since we're all used to seeing large Vaseline containers. This feels like a baby. But it makes sense, since you're just using it for your lips.<br /><br />The only downside is that I prefer not getting my dirty fingers involved in my lips. Or my clean hands greasy. A lip balm stick seems better for me.
9759091062|5|It clear up my dark blemish and i soooooo have to purchase more from this line. I couldn't be happier.
B001MA0QY2|4|The combination of the iron and the oil really helps smooth my hair out and leave a shine. Overall, it is a good product.  I have thick hair. I wish I would have ordered the 1-1/4&#34; iron instead of the 1&#34; but oh well. Just takes a little bit longer to straighten my hair.
B00006ANDK|5|I'm an RDA so my teeth are very important and my Oral B electric brush is a must. These extra soft brush heads are perfect and they are hard to find in the store; so ordering a years worth at time is wonderful
B000M8BE3C|5|It is so perfect and delicious. I really love this perfum is so good. Its perfect for a date, so sexy.
B0016D4RQS|5|Nag Champa is real incense, not some artificially perfumed stick like you find in most stores in the U.S. these days.  I highly recommend it.
B00008SJXK|5|This spa kit was VERY relaixng!!!  It took off all the stress on my mind and it makes your skin feel very soft and smelling good.  I recommend this and all of the other HoMedics spa kits.
B00QKW6JWA|5|Exceptional quality! The quality of the brushes is amazing! It is the same quality as a Mac brush with beautiful handles but waaaay cheaper. I love them so much!
B000XCS9U8|5|My niece has a garden tub & specifically requested bubble bath for Christmas.  This was perfect, especially with the scent.
B00CNOUZE2|4|Could have easly been five stars except for the paper backing on the reverse of the mirror.  It does not come off but it does get moldy where the mirror touches the wall.  Likely stays damp longer in this area.  Easy fix.  I just put a stick-on rubber bumper/foot to hold ot away from the wall.  Problem solved.  No more mold.  It helps the mirror stay fogless longer as well.  I like the oval shape.  Fits your face better than a square reflection.
B00BOJDQ9S|5|Devine
B00EW90H9E|3|This is the first time that I use this cream. It is as good as I've ever read the advertisment on this cream via internet. It' s better than some other night cream that I had used.
B0069SQQ2I|1|This has the worst smell and it gives me a headache, I'll never buy it again.  I've tried others and they were much better.
B00CPKH9Y8|3|Not as strong as I thought it would be.
B007T6XDF2|5|Sometimes I get lazy and don't feel like shaving at all....which is really bad since I'm like really hairy in general and my hair grows super fast. So in the winter &#34;down there&#34; tends to look like another person---which then requires scissors and several razors to fix. This was perfect because it took the place of the scissors plus I can totally see myself using this is the winter for &#34;trimming&#34; so that it doesn't look like such a hot mess once summer hits and it's time to go bald eagle....
B00NOAKUBM|5|It is light weight.  Wonderful!!!
B00277JKY6|4|I bought this a few days ago and tried it that same night after I showered. As I was putting it on I immediately notice the insane amount of GLITTER in this product. It's ridiculous! This is not subtle \\"micro-pearls\\" as the bottle says, but more like you just attended a 5 year olds birthday party. After going ahead, I also noticed how sticky it is. An hour later I still felt so sticky that I had to lay with my arms and legs not touching or they would feel permanently glued together. At this point I got up and threw the whole bottle in the trash and went to sleep. The next day, after much of the glitter rubbed off on my sheets (to my husbands dismay), I saw a beautiful, glowing tan. It was the perfect not too light and not too dark tone. I am pretty fair, have some facial freckles, but I'm not ghostly white so I can take a deeper color. This was great! I actually grabbed the bottle back out of the trash bin and decided it was worth the glitter and stickiness. I figure I can just wipe most of the glitter off before leaving the house... Because seriously, L'Oreal, I'm 32 and work at a law firm. I can't go around with chunks of glitter all over my body like I'm Punky friggin Brewster.
B00G2TQNZ4|5|The main reason I chose this product was the great price.  I have been using a very pricey vitaman c serum that was 3 times as much and did not have the vitaman E.  I like the way this goes on my face and is absorbed quickly.  It is not sticky or oily and does not have any smell to it which my other serum had one so bad I could hardly wait to wash my face.  I am 58 and my skin looks pretty darn good!
B00C7ODFOK|5|I received the item, it did have a small leak around the spray nozzle.  We checked to make sure it wasnt the bottle and it was not.  Overall we were very pleased with this item. Thank you Amazon
B009MY07F8|5|Paris Project Runway lipstick is lighter than it appears on screen.  It is a lovely lavender color and goes on smooth and creamy.  I Absolutely love it!!!
B000O3OZD6|5|this case is well built, sturdy and strong material. I would reccomend this case to every woman. Great price for a great case.
B002XQ1X4G|5|Excelente
B0085RKO4M|5|Exactly what I wanted!!
B00MR9BE1G|2|It doesn't work like it said it would. I was left with a lot of hair in my face.
B0038TVH3Y|5|This stuff is great! When used as a leave in conditioner, it made my hair smell amazing, kept frizz at minimum, and defined my curls and made them shiny without making them hard or crunchy. Its made with natural ingredients and it works better than any chemical based products i'v tried and keeps your hair nice and moisturized. Would definitely recommend to anyone with thick, curly hair!
B009ZURKZE|2|No one else had these on their shelves anymore so I took a chance and bought these. Kinda overpriced and kinda dry on the inside. They're usable but thats it.
B00K75TNYM|5|These  are wonderful, the size is great, they don't pull my hair, and they are a pretty color! The only complain is that they don't stay in place, so I have to use bobby pins, but that's not a  big deal. I would def. recommend them, and buy them again. They ship from Asia, so they do take a while to get to your home ( 3 weeks).
B00176GSEI|5|I love this so much - can't believe how great the quality is for the price you pay. I have long hair and always get compliments when i use this curler. I just ordered a 2&#34; to get a &#34;blowout&#34; look -- hopefully it will not disappoint !!
B00H86IDE4|5|I L.O.V.E it, I L.O.V.E it, I L.O.V.E it, I L.O.V.E it!
B003S56J4K|4|So far this product works really well and is very smooth. I do have straight hair already and this just helps smooth out the weird sleeping kinks. When pressed together, there is a slight gap between the plates. This doesn't really affect me but just so everyone knows! :) Enjoy
B005C1C02S|5|Great product for a great price and fast shipping!!!!
B004IJJV7W|5|Love it for my quick or short travel adventures. Not big enough for a trip out of country or longer stays, but perfect for my weekend sleepovers with my daughter. I also take it to work for essential toiletries. It's well made; I'm not easy on my things and it's holding up great.
B00COHAA4S|5|I am in love I want this dress, I need more reviews or assurance that will look just like the picture
B00OGNF62E|4|This Frankincense oil does not smell as pleasing as the one I purchased from a different company.  I do like it.  I simply liked the other one better.  However, I do realize that this depends on the location it is harvested and the time.  I can tell that it does a great job on facial skin issues already.  I would recommend it.  The service from this company is excellent.  I ordered several things a got them all quickly and accurately.
B007PM4M64|5|these products it's very comfortable to used and i like it
B000068PBT|5|return product
B00OQOH85Q|5|Smells good. Authentic lotion!
B007ZN5ATQ|4|The dentist insisted that I use this and it has resulted in better check ups and good plaque control. Great product.
B002VLSBF2|2|i had high hopes for this but i feel it didn't do anything. It feels like water, you have to be careful putting it in. i have to hold the dropper up to my face and dispense and hold my other finger ready to rub it in, if that makes sense at all lol I've been using it for maybe 3 weeks and I don't notice any difference in my skin, I think it works better if you exfoliate first. I might repurchase the higher concentration next time to try.
B00MPG5ANY|5|Nice brushes for small detail work, I am pleased!
B00429BU22|2|The black is not metal - it is a plastic glued on as a cover to the metal backing and it broke on one of the clips just removing it from the packaging. So I had to throw it away before wearing it. Good thing they were cheap.
B003Z4OD24|3|My three star rating is bordering on a two, but ultimately I am rating it a 3 because the only negative about my experience with this product is my disappointment at how mediocre it's been.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />- This stuff is thick and green--really green--and smells kelpy and earthy which, though not 'pleasant', is tolerable and preferable to the inclusion of chemical fragrances.<br />- Ingredients list = very natural, the only thing I think anyone sensitive would react to with it is the physical abrasions from actual scrubbing.<br />- As scrubs go, it's on the medium-fine side and feels like more of a skin polish.<br />- I don't notice much of a change when using this product, if at all.<br /><br />Based on the ingredients list, I was really surprised this didn't seem to do anything for my skin. I was super excited to try it when I got it, but ultimately felt that it did a lackluster job of polishing away any dry areas and I end up having to use a wet washcloth or another scrub to finish the job. Because it didn't seem to be doing much of anything as a scrub, I decided maybe I should scrub my face with it when I shower but wait to rinse it off for a while (this was born out of the hope of at least experiencing brightening effects). I've been using this almost every day for the last few months with no decrease in breakouts and do not believe I've experienced any improvement to skin brightness from this product. If there was an improvement, it was mild enough that I didn't really pick up on it. In contrast, I've added some new things to my skincare routine over the past few weeks and saw near immediate improvements to skin brightness with them, so I feel like I likely would have noticed if this had any positive impact on my skin during the number of weeks I had been using this scrub. I like Acure products a lot, but this has fallen into that unfortunate &#34;I just need to use it up&#34; category. This is the first Acure product I've encountered that I don'twant to repurchase. I see much better exfoliation and glowiness results with Ole Henriksen Walnut scrub or even by mixing simple baking soda with the Acure normal to oily gel cleanser. I'm glad this worked for other people, but it doesn't seem to do anything (either positive or negative) for me.
B003ANZ87O|1|I did not like this product. The solution was unevenly distributed over the mitt. I ended up very spotty and my hands were still orange.<br />Despite their claims that it doesn't smell like other sunless tanners, you smell the same as you would with every other sunless tanner. For what I paid for this I purchased a bottle of gradual tanning foam and had great results and have had several months of use out of the one bottle.
B00QJEM7ZM|3|bottle is smaller than I thought. The product is worked some. It depends on how dark of the spots. At least skin feels smoother and soften. apply it before the bed it keeps moisture all night long
B00AZG2H78|4|It certainly does get hot, even on the hair dryer's lowest setting, but it still did a great job of heat setting the hair color we were using it for. We just used it for a bit, then gave it a rest, rinse, repeat.
B00KBBAVS4|5|beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!! I loveee this color I can not wait to wear it, it is just amazing neon orange, just what I wanted
B000OYJ9AO|5|I bought a small sample of this lotion in my local pharmacy and fell in love with the smell. The larger bottle was too expensive for me and when I checked here it was $5.00 less. The lotion makes my skin feel very smooth and makes me smell scrumptuous. If you try it I hope you like it as much as I do.
B005IC2MTW|5|This baml feels so smooth and creamy.  No tugging on the lip at all.  Love this stuff!
B007UO79GC|5|Originally I just ordered this kit as an add on to a purchase so that I could get free shipping. lol. But overall....I absolutely love the eye shadows, mascara, and even the little brush that comes with it. I never used Elf cosmetics before, but I would definitely invest in more of their cosmetics!
B00G2GNKDK|5|Perfect for darkening the bedroom so you can sleep!
B000052YJM|5|I have an oily t- zone...NO lotion has ever worked in treating it (and I have tried MANY different matte lotions) Now having this lotion, I only have very little oil on my nose area but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before and i am 99.9% satisfied with this product.<br /><br />p.s.This stuff feels like Amazing silk going on the skin.!!!<br /><br /> Thanks Clean-and-Clear!
B001MV636G|5|This is the third one I buy.  Every time I used it the people asked me what I am using because my face looks fresh and iluminated.  I just can't travel without it !
B005I0352W|5|I bought different kinds of clips for my 3-old year girl before. They could stay on hair for long time. This time, the Goody girls daisy clips did it. I like these clips. They are not easy to drop off hair.
B001LF4G4E|4|We used this a few weeks to test and found it pretty good with accurate heating going on. It's a little on the heavy side for a female with tiny arms but otherwise excellent. Love the digital heat indicator that makes a huge difference over the older dial types that aren't accurate at all.  The DVD was interesting to view as well but seems rather gimicky to me.
B0041TGSYI|5|great quick bleach
B000KE88FU|5|Great
B004N1EQNO|5|This is a high quality shampoo, with a great cosmetic feel, with proven, effective ingredients against hair thinning and associated scalp issues such as seborrheic dermatitis. I use it 1-2 a week, and my scalp always feels healthier. I will definitely repurchase.
B000Z91JAQ|5|Who would have using an oil on acne-prone skin would help, but this does! I use it in combo with tea tree oil. I swipe a cotton pad with tea tree oil all over my face and let it absorb before applying straight jojoba oil or jojoba oil mixed with an oil-free moisturizer. It's a fantastic moisturizer, but I love it even more as a makeup remover. I tend to wear a lot of face makeup (bare minerals) during the day and I rub this over my face before washing with another cleanser. This removes the makeup amazingly well, just apply it to a dry face. After cleaning my makeup off, I reapply the oil to a clean face before gently exfoliating with a microfiber washcloth. This helps to remove any additional makeup residue and exfoliates any flakes from dry skin or healing blemishes. I have oily skin, but I find using jojoba oil on my skin helps to balance it. I also use it around my eyes and lips at night, so i wake up with soft skin in those areas.
B00EOP3NII|5|I finally found sun screen lotion that doesn't go on pasty or greasy.  A very thin, water-like lotion that actually soothes the skin when you put it on.  Stays active during my entire 3 hour bike ride!
B000HLCIY8|5|Love it!  Shipping makes it a bit pricey.
B005C4EVVS|1|The item did not look anything like the picture.  This cannot possibly be the same item that was ordered, it's going back.
B00FH692PQ|5|I just started using this Pura D’Or Argan Oil Premium Organic Anti-Hair Loss Shampoo with gold label, AFTER using the Pura d’Or Argan Oil Shampoo with the blue label for several months.  I could not figure out why this shampoo (with gold label) was so much more expensive than the other formula, but I must admit this seemed to make my hair much more manageable than the other shampoo.  This shampoo, like their other formula, works to help prevent hair loss.  There are no SLS, no harmful Parabens and no harsh chemicals.  It is safe for color treated hair.  You only need about 3 pumps to get a good lather.  The consistency is a bit thinner than other shampoos but it does an excellent job of cleaning the hair.  I liked that there are no heavy perfumes.  The shampoo has a slightly medicinal smell and I noticed natural smells of mint, citrus and a slight woodsy aroma.  This smell was not unpleasant and after rinsing and using conditioner I did not detect any medicinal smell at all.  What I did notice was my hair was very soft and manageable after using this product.  Much more so than when I was using the Pura D’Or with the blue label.  Overall, I have noticed less hair loss since using the Pura D’Or line and I would recommend this shampoo for men and women.  After using this gold label shampoo, I will stick with it because I liked the results over the blue label formula.
B004YGLSD4|4|Good magnification and look pretty good.  Not as nice as some solid metal more expensive ones .but this is much less expensive.
B003RBQYR2|4|Finally, hair products that make my hair soft and I've tried everything. The leave in oil is one of the best smelling products out there.  The icing I the cake is this is also a great value. The company shipped it very promptly.  I had no problem with l leaking or watered down shampoo.
B008HFY1BY|5|Im very happy with my product!! I will be ordering again!! I do alot of nail stamping! And its even better when i can get a good deal on it.
B000JWM8CM|5|Loved the soap. Brought back lots of memories. I gave it to my husband as a gift. He got his mouth washed out with it when he was a child. He got a big laugh out of it.
B00HGJZI2I|5|Love the Vitamin C serum! It absorbs quickly and has a nice fragrance. I am glad I purchased this superior product.
B00006RSKR|5|I don't know what other people think and I don't care.  This review is based on my experience and my experience only.  I don't work for Revostyler and have no idea where it is located.  I am a 21 year old who has been using the product since it first came out in 2002 and let me tell you, the purchase was definitely worth it.  My natural hair is very thick, long, and naturally wavy.  Too wavy.  Before I bought the revostyler, I was straightening my hair by using a paddle brush.  It hurt and I always had hair come out.  It wasn't fun.  So, I decided to buy the revostyler.  When I first bought the revostyler, I too was skeptical.  I thought that nothing could straighten this hair. But, it really does work.  The time it takes to style my hair has been cut in half and it never looks limp.  Same goes for everyone else I have invited to use this wonderful product.  My mom uses it all the time to style her thin, limp hair and it always turns out wonderful with the least amount of effort.  So, don't listen to anyone else.  Listen to my review.  Like I said, I've been using this for 2 years and for 2 years, my hair has definitely been at it's best.
B000RH1TRE|4|I liked
B000IAK2NW|5|both soft and stiff bristles to get all the bits of shavings out of my razor.  it &#34;works&#34;.... recommend it.
B00M9NW5JU|4|NuJu Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream contains NutriLayer, Duo-peptides, green tea and white tea extracts. I never heard of NutriLayer before, but it is a newly discovered natural extract that helps to retain skins moisture. Together these ingredients work to treat fine lines and wrinkles as well as moisturize and protect your skin. To use NuJu you simply apply it, after cleansing, to your neck and face in an upward motion.<br /><br />I have not used NuJu long enough to see real results, but so far I can say that my skin feels soft and moisturized. I like how smooth and creamy NuJu is. My thirsty skin drinks it right up, and I am ready to apply my makeup in no time.  I hope to experience a change in my fine lines with continued use.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.
B00C2FW5S6|5|this is a great product, great results as well, thank you for the fast service
B004TSFBJO|4|Ships in no time at all. Super soft fiber and I haven't experienced any shedding. Although I prefer angled brushes for blush this is really good. I just wish it was a bit more firm.
B007K6K0IY|2|I received a sample of secret outlast clear gel completely clean deodorant to try. I was completely excited to have received it. I tried 2 clicks on each armpit the following morning. But noticed about half way thru the day I could smell body odor. So I reapplied and hoped for the best. Don't get me wrong I love the smell and the way it goes on.  It leaves no white marks but it doesn't last 24 or 48 hours. Thank you secret for the chance to try the clear gel, I'll stick with you but in invisible solid.
B000SSWYC6|5|This was the first aftershave I used when I started to shave, and fifty years later it is still one (with Old Spice and Aqua Velva) of my three favorites.  It is mild--there isn't an alcoholic shock on roughed-up skin--and has a manly smell.
