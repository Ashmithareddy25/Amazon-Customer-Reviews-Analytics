6305428425|4.0|Although I am not so fond of light-plotted films, acted out by airhead loser characters I enjoyed watching this particular movie because it was funny & I really loved the soundtrack which reminded me so well of my own High School days.<BR> <BR>It is also an eye openner because now I look back & realize how strong peer pressure is when you are about that age.  It is during this stage when being \\"in\\" is so important to teeners & the feeling of \\"being\\" or \\"belonging\\" in a popular group is so paramount that you would not dare contradict what the majority thinks is \\"cool\\" or \\"uncool\\".  <br />Also, the flashbacks & flashforwards make me look at myself & rate my own accomplishments (whatever they may be) over the years since I have graduated HS.  Have I taken the world lightly like Romy & Michele? Or am I successful in my career like the lady who invented fast burning cigarette paper or that fashio executive from Vogue?<br />But most of all, it reminded me of the special friendship that I have found during that stage, which up to these days last.  Romy & Michele, losers as they may be, could have been any of us.  That's how close one can get in reviewing your life for the past xxx years since you have left High School.
B00000G3I2|4.0|Eight housemates from the University of Michigan reunite some fifteen years later for the unexpected funeral of a friend.  Great 1960's soundtrack livens up weekend of grief, laughter, revelations, reminisces, sex, and some closure of unfinished business.  Director Kasdan isolated the cast together in a home in South Carolina so they could develop their chemistry, which comes off as entirely believable.  Unknown Kevin Costner played the deceased friend in flashbacks that were cut from the final print; that's still his \\"corpse\\" being dressed during the opening credits.  Another lost scene that originally was to close the movie was a flashback with the cast in 1960's garb preparing thanksgiving dinner together in college.  Included is a great retrospective with cast and crew and a few deleted scenes.
B00004R99L|5.0|By sitting back and watching this movie! I love Alice in Wonderland for the pure mystery and whimsy of it--every character is enjoyable...even if one does get a little MAD. But then again...we're all like that here (a la Cheshire Cat...who is just great!).<br />I like the DVD bonus features and find that the picture is wonderfully clear and colorful, but has Alice in Wonderland ever not been?  5 out of 5 for a funny story that just leaves you with a nice sense of WONDER. A personal favorite for as long as I can remember.
B000002NIW|5.0|In my opinion this is the worst Deftones release so far, but don't get me wrong. I love it. I just like Adrenaline and White Pony a little better. A lot of people think this is Deftones' best album. Very heavy and agressive for the most part, but songs like Mascara are soft and excellent too. \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" is one of the most beautiful excellent songs ever written in the history of the world. I love that song to death. The Acoustic version of it (Not on the CD) is pretty good too, I suggest downloading it. (Anyways, each song on here is 5/5 stars. Definitely one of the best albums I own. Don't miss out. You'll regret it.
0790744295|4.0|for those who love horror.  I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out many, many years ago.  I was an adolescent then.  But I can still remember how scared I was when they discovered what was in the mysterious trunk hidden away.  Lets just say, the short stories that make up this movie are not only unique, but they will scare you (if not gross you out just a bit.)<br />Compared to the technology of today, this movie seems dated.  But you can't beat the low tech effect of Stephen King turning into a \\"plant creature\\" after having encountered a strange meteor.  Nor the creepiness you feel along your skin when the roaches take over E.G. Marshall's pristine apartment.<br />You'll even get a good laugh or two while watching this...a murdered father coming back from the grave demanding his Father's Day cake!!!<br />This movie has it all.  If anything, it is a great throw back to the days when movies didn't cost you an arm and a leg to get into.
630469797X|4.0|George Romero pulls out all stops in this excellent sequel to &quot;Night of the Living Dead.&quot;  With the &quot;zombie&quot; problem now out of control, four people commandeer a helicopter and attempt to flee the madness of the city.  Low on fuel, they land atop an abandoned shopping mall, seal it off from the living dead, and then proceed to indulge themselves silly.  The group then lives peacefully...for awhile.  Not really scary like the original film, but very shocking with some poignant social commentary.  This &quot;Director's Cut&quot; restores some 11 minutes of footage, sloppily cut from the VHS version, and some of the music has been changed (for the better).  Also included are two trailers.  The most hideous gore is confined to the first and last half hours, just to warn you.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White is my favorite movie of all time--ever since I saw a theatrical re-release of the film at a very young age.  I must  have been 5 or so at the time, in the early 80s--now I am 19 and NEVER ashamed to say that this movie has remained with me as a gem.  I bought the video on the very day it was in retail--back in 1995--and pre-ordered the DVD in September...and got a free Little Mermaid DVD as well.<br />The moment the film started I noticed how sharp it suddenly was!  And the backgrounds came to life like never before.  I had always seen a little \\"dust\\" on the video.  But all of a sudden Snow White's dress was bright canary yellow...and the dwarfs' tunics brighter as well.  The Queen even took on a more graceful appearance...But I must say that the scenery was what really popped out first.<br />Disney certainly made a spectacular film back in the day--1937--but watching this DVD you would hardly notice that this movie is 65 years old.  It could have been released last year...that's how brilliant it now is.  So...a big tribute to the team that polished this \\"apple\\".  <br />I truly recommend that everyone who is a Disney fan get this American Classic for their DVD library--because she's now locked up (or is she just on vacation at her Prince's castle??  I prefer that choice) for about 10 years.  <br />Will the other Platinum DVDs have two disks...that certainly would be exciting!  Now that \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" will be coming out in October of this year--I'm very excited about the possibilities.  The series will continue in this way: Lion King (03), Aladdin (04), Bambi (05), The Jungle Book (06), Cinderella (07--that long??), The Little Mermaid (08), Lady and the Tramp (09) and 101 Dalmatians in 2010.  I can hardly wait to see each of these completely restored classics.  Woo-hoo!

B00005RY7X|5.0|After suffering through years of &quot;everything is horrible&quot; music and oh-so-cute young boys and girls, this is what rock and roll, popular music, and most of all, I needed.  This is pure, simple, hard driving music not trying to be anything.  Sure, &quot;soulful&quot; bands like Creed and all the rest have some cathy tunes, but come on, are any of those discs likely to get stuck in your CD player and just left there because it makes you feel GOOD to listen to the music?  That's what Andrew W.K. offers.  Pure, simple, make your toes tap and make you feel good about the world music.  Forget the bubblegum and forget the deep lyrics being foisted on us a rock these days.  Go and get &quot;I get Wet&quot; and have a good time...finally.

B00004TLN3|1.0|i give this film 1 star, because no  star was not an option. it was boring, disjointed and senseless. in sum, totally disappointing. a major directing and editing disaster.<BR> <BR>i find it hard to believe it was a bbc production, which are usualy top notch. with that, and the fact that i'm a jane austin groupie, i bought the film without checking the ratings. i actually watched it twice,because i was sure i had missed something. there was nothing to miss.<br /> northanger abbey is the only austin book i haven't read yet, but i am looking forward to reading it in order to find out how far off the film missed its mark. i'm sorry i can't return it--the used copies don't seem to be selling very well.
0743201140|5.0|In Now, Discover Your Strengths, readers learn how to identify and develop their skills and talents, as well as those of your employees. Effectively managing behavior, our own as well as that of others, is an extraordinarily complex task, but the mastery of which is an essential prerequiste for success in the workplace. Now, Discover Your Strengths proposes a new and somewhat radical approach as Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton place their focus upon the enhancing of people's strengths rather than eliminating their weaknesses. The authors articulately describe thirty-four positive personality themes (included &quot;Achiever&quot;, &quot;Developer&quot;, &quot;Learner&quot;, and &quot;Maximizer&quot;) while clearly explaing how to build what they called a &quot;strengths-based organization&quot; through capitalizing on the fact that such traits are already present within ourselves and those we are responsible for which we have a management responsibility.

0553106635|5.0|One of the best writers I have ever had the grace to read in a long, long time! Anyone who thinks this book is too violent doesn't have any place in reading these types of books in the first place. Go read Ed Greenwood if you want to read books about the good guys always winning. <br />Yes alot of awesome charactors die but thats what makes these books so great since it gives the good guys a chance to avenge themselves on the injustices of this realistic fantasy world.<BR> <br />I hope the Starks win for once and crush the Lanistars. I know alot of people probably like Dany but I don't really wan't her to win. One I think her charactor is very arrogant and thinks the world of herself, which actualy makes me hate her all the more.<br />Two I don't like what she did to the man that truely loves her while going for a man that probably could care less about her, accept for her status that is. From what I gathered I don't think she is going to survive this series just for the simple fact that she places her trust in the wrong sort of people...<br />As for other parts of the book another charactor I hope gets killed off is the red woman and her fire god. Personaly I am starting to think she and her god are hardly good at all. I meen she burns people alive, destroys and disrespects the old religions, etc. Also something near the end of a \\"Storm Of Swords\\" interested me, on what a Measter said about no heat comming from Stannis's sword, what was ment by that exactly? I doubt that she is ment to be a good charactor if you can actualy indeed state that any of the charactors are actualy \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\"<br />My favorites has to be Bran and Arya oh and Davos, since he seems to be catching on with Stannis being seduced by promises and falsehoods from the Red Woman. Anyway I could go on and on but I won't I just hope the next book comes out soon!
B000002MY3|5.0|keeping this short, I'll just say that this is the first album I ever heard that acknowledges the capacity for both rage and gladness, joy and sadness, and all the emotions that fall into the broad spectrum of human feeling... she's a truly gifted songwriter
0767817710|4.0|The Quick and the Dead has long been derided as a Sharon Stone star vehicle that flopped.  However, there is much more to this film than meets the eye.  Featuring an ensemble cast that includes, Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, Gary Sinise, Keith David, and Lance Henricksen, this film is a refreshing change from past takes on the western.<br />Stone plays a quiet and beautiful gunslinger, come out of the dusty plains to the town of Redemption, seeking revenge for the murder of her sheriff father years ago by the town dictator John Herrod, a dark and malevolent old gunfighter intent on maintaining his stranglehold on the frightened populace by staging a quick draw contest, the better to publically eliminate any opposition to his rule, and to squash any hope of salvation.  Drawn into this dark contest are Herrod's former partner turned preacher Cort, a man whose tortured soul still seeks it's own salvation, and who Herrod seeks to pull back to Hell.  Herrord's son, The Kid, enrolls in the contest as a way to seek fame and glory, and to prove himself to a aloof and uncaring father. Thrown into the mix are a number of colorful characters come to town to seek their own fortunes and the fireworks ensue.  There is strong symbolism throughout this film, shades of death and rebirth, powerful archetypal figures in the charaters of Herrod, the powerful demonic ruler of the underworld, and Cort, the misguided but eventual redeemer and saviour.<br />This film boasts a strong and talented cast that give some wonderfully enjoyable performances.  Sam Raimi does an incredible job once again of producing a stylishly directed tale of loss, redemtion, salvation, and revenge in this telling of the western as mdoern myth.
0066620996|5.0|Why some companies thrive and others do not is the core theme of Jim Collins' Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap... And Others Don't. Collins and his team of researchers surveyed 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They refined their list to eleven corporations (including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo) and in the process discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of what goes into the forumula for corporate success. Collins and his associates found that the corporate transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the core of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Profusely illustrated with dozens of stories and examples from both the great and not so great, Collins offers well-reasoned recommendations for others seeking to achieve excellence in their corporate performance regardless of its size or fields of endeavor. Also available as an in abridged audiocassette and CD formats.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This was a great movie, and as far as i'm concerned a faithful adaptation of the book.<br />But why do the americans have to go and change the title? To the whole world (except the US), the book (and movie) is called \\"Harry potter and the philosopher's stone\\".<br />Do they not know what a philosopher is?

B0000041Q3|5.0|As said by so many reviews already, this Turandot is the combined superlative collaboration of the three most famous and glorious singers of our time. These three singers - Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Caballe - in no particular order, defines the &quot;20th Century Golden Age of Song&quot;. <br />There are other great recordings of this masterpiece - notably the Nilsson/Corelli/Scotto and theNilsson/Bjoeling/Tebaldi versions. These two great recordings also feature glorious singing, but the Sutherland/Pavoratti/Caballe's set has by far the most complete combinations of what makes an operatic recording definitive: The singing, sound quality and conducting.<br />First, the singers..Dame Joan Sutherland, the sublime voice. She is outstanding as the Princess of China. Her large soprano is only gorgeous but expressive. With such a sensitive reading of the leading role, no wonder Prince Calaf falls madly in love with her. And that is the main reason I prefer her to Birgit Nilsson. (Even though Nilsson is also splendid).<br />Luciano Pavarotti is superb as well. He is more lyrical than Franco Corelli, yet more robust in timbre when compare to Jussi Bjoeling (at least in the studio) We, as big opera buffs, know that Corelli is unbeatable in the realm of spinto singing and his &quot;attacks&quot; of the high notes. Yet Pavarotti's top tones are very nearly the equal of Corelli, while his phrasing of Calaf's vocal lines are infinitely superior(to Corelli's). <br />Caballe's control of the Italian &quot;art of bel canto&quot; is without rivals. Her ability to deliver pianissimo is one of the greatest thrills in 20th Century opera going. She not only does not disappoint here, she goes beyond my expectations - She holds the highest notes in pp for what seem to be an eternity. Additionally, Caballe has the art of pathos. She simply breaks your heart. <br />Now to the sound...There is no despute that the sonics of this definitive Turandot is among the finest available today. Decca's engineers have managed to capture an orchestra painting of such beauty and depth that one feels like they are back in Peking thousands of years ago.<br />The orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta is exciting, emotional and rich. It is also &quot;larger than life&quot;. Everyone always mention how great the singers are and forget the conductor and the orchestra Let me assure everyone that both Mehta and N.Y.Phil are sublime.<br />In summary, a definitive recording. Surely the most complete Turandot on record and one of the great operatic recordings of our time.
B0000029DD|5.0|I am a recent convert to Jeff's music, and I have to say I am glad that I have finally given it a chance. buy this now<br />if you dont own it already.  and jeff's cover of hallelujah<br />is better than the leonard cohen original.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I was one of the few who missed Sade when she came to town recently so I knew immediately once I lerned that this disc would be available (after unsuccessfuly trying to get the Live CD of the Love Deluxe tour) I had to have it. As I am still listening to it in my office I'm still feeling it. ON the other hand I am disapppointed that \\"King of Sorrow\\" & Pearls were not included with this set. I guess I'll get over it. <br />Sade is still one of the few that can sound as crisp & clear live as they do in their recording. Sade fans this is a must have.
B00000DGUG|5.0|to be brief, I'll simply say that this album is one of my all-time favorites; the introspective, revealing nature of her lyrics combined with the complex, layered melodies and harmonies she produces left me in awe... she is truly a gifted artist
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Where were you when you first heard \\"Smooth Operator\\" on the radio in 1983? What were your feelings? Delighted? Depressed? Annoyed? Refreshed? Intrigued? Uncertain?<br />Now fast forward to 2002. Is there any song on today's pop radio that has even come close to the impact of the above song that you know just where you were or what the time of the season was when you first heard it? <br />I didn't think so. God bless Sade. The singer and her band.<br />I was at first very hesitant about purchasing \\"Lover's Live\\" for many reasons: 1) I had seen some clips of the concert on VH1 Soul and was purely blown away. 2) I'm kicking myself hard with regret for missing this tour. 3) That the audio CD was going to be a teaser for the VHS & DVD coming out in March (and directed by Sophie Muller).<br />Yes, the CD IS a teaser. It's only 70 minutes long as opposed to the two hours-plus worth of material that will be on the video edition. Example? \\"Smooth Operator\\", played with more urgency this time, fades out when the extended jam is about to begin. Plus, the booklet pictures (and slight memories of the 1994 \\"Sade Live\\" video) only give a slight hint of the visuals about to be released in a month's time.<br />But, oh, my God, what a teaser this is!<br />There is a beautiful psychedelic flow that runs throughout the 13 tracks worth. It's still jazzy and pop, but with other elements of dub, folk and slow soul that make the whole listening experience very dreamlike. Plus, the fact that the crowd is sometimes louder than the band at times is almost surreal yet comforting. <br />And Sade had never sounded better. There's plenty of wisdom & experience that has crept into that unique voice of hers and has made it stronger with age. The same applies to the band. Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale & Paul Denman provide some magnificent ear candy and a solid sonic foundation that grows better with age. Kudos also go out to regular Leroy Osbourne and new members Ryan Waters, Peter Lewinson, KarlVanden Bossche & Tony Momrelle and fitting just like a comfortable glove.<br />But let's get to the nitty-gritty, shall we? This is still some emotional & very warm stuff here, considering that back in '84 it might have been a manufactured item (a' la the British jazz-pop, \\"Absolute Beginners\\" trend). Sade (the collective) are an endangered breed. Pop music that is pleasing to the ear but can be unpredictable and occasionally unsettling. They strike some very deep nerves here and have created some of the most timeless & long-lasting music that has made a seamless transition from one century to another. <br />And Sade Adu? This is one classy, warm, sensual, sexy and human lady that will always rises above the trends (especially today's sickening state of affairs) and show some TRUE STYLE & CLASS. Today's pop goddesses & divas have A LOT TO LEARN. <br />This is no 80's retro act that will be stuck on any throwaway compilation soon. Long may they wave and GOD BLESS THEM.<br />Buy this album. Enough said.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I've always liked the Peppers though they frustrated me no end.  The problem?  They had never put out a complete album.  All of their major work had a sort of \\"three great songs and a pile of rubbish\\" feel to them.  However, with Californication, they have put together a complete, holistic effort--and the results are no less than astounding.<br />The usual \\"great three tracks\\" are here with a vengeance.  The Pepper's have always had a knack for managing to create popular music with an edge-a welcome skill in this world of manufactured bubble gum music that the one or two companies that own all the radio stations seem bent on subjecting the world to.  Scar Tissue and Other Side amply fill that bill.  Where this album soars however in the not-quite-top-40 area with tunes such as Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top and Road Trippin', where the band unique, high energy blend of Hispanic rap/hip hop comes into play. This is the work that truly defines the heart and soul of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a side of the band anyone simply familiar with their hits parade songs would be totally ignorant of.<br />This is an incredibly powerful album-killer songs, high musicianship, a vivid message-that obviously struck a chord on it's release.  I never would have imagined any RHCP album could ever attain the success that this one has.  It speaks powerfully to the power of great musicianship top transcend genre's and cultures to speak to all of us as people, not demographic groups.<br />No record collection can be complete if Californication isn't among its titles!
B000002BFZ|2.0|Ok, here's an album with lots of potential...and lots of unfinished ideas.  Perhaps more fascinating than listening to this album is thinking about what they might've done different.<br />First of all, this whole album sounds like it was mixed in a cardboard box or something.  The instruments really don't come to life. And unlike, NIN's Downward Spiral, it doesn't come across as an improvement here.<br />Next, songs like &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;I'm Open&quot; get off to a really good start and just cut off after 2 minutes.  Others, like &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; sound like they need more verses.<br />Next, Eddie Vedder as at his most mumbly and least passionate.  Which actually makes me glad that Stone Gossard sang &quot;Mankind.&quot;<br />Last, it's likely the band spent more time assembling 144 polaroids for the artwork than making the album, which is a real shame, since I prefer music to artwork.<br />Now for the good news.  While songs like &quot;Hail Hail&quot; and &quot;Who You Are&quot; aren't up to par with the band's earlier (and later) material, they are solid, well-rounded songs.  As for songs like &quot;In My Tree&quot; and &quot;Off He Goes&quot; the results are quite positive.  And then there's &quot;Present Tense.&quot;  Hands down the best song on here.  It's too different from PJ's other material to fit on any of their other albums very well, but it's just as good as say, &quot;Even Flow&quot; or &quot;Daughter&quot;, without being a repetitious in style.<br />If there is one thing I can say about this album as a whole is that PJ fulfillis its unspoken promise to make each album unique and different.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since Nevermind was released.  It's one of the albums I always have in my traveling CD pouch. Not long ago my son and I were talking about this fact-he asked my why I always had it with me in the car-and, after giving it some thought, I decided it was because the music so uniquely expresses a personality.  Cobain was charismatic-admittedly in a sort of unsavory way-and so is his music.  It has a power to truly connect creator to listener.<br />The most common criticism of the album usually cites the lack of fully formed, mature musicality present on the album.  I fail to see the point.  The early Beatles weren't the musicians they later were; that fact in and of itself doesn't detract from the vitality and sincerety of the music in that case any more than it does here.  I was in Hong Kong last October and went and saw an exhibition of pottery form the earliest Chinese dynasties through today.  The really old stuff was simple and flawed-and far more powerful in presentation than some of the far more sophisticated recent pieces.  To be rudimentary is not necessarily to be meaningless.<br />Clearly Nirvanna spoke to something fundamental in an extremely large audience.  Some of my son's friends are primarily C&amp;W fans-yet all seem to own a copy of Nevermind.  Sometimes it's the message that's more important than the musicianship.  This is an instance of connection over craft.  You want guitar virtuosity?  Listen to Clapton.  Want to feel something?  Listen to Nevermind.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This CD is not like Madonna last CD. The tracks are slower and are a bit more mature than her earlier work eg:Like a virgin.<BR>The CD can be listened to right the way through and evry track has its good parts so you never tire of hearing the songs. This album is great I really enjoyed listening to it and you can listen to it over and over again.<BR>I think personally that this is the best album that Madonna has ever brought out. A masterpiece. Thanks Madge.
B00005UEAR|4.0|If it weren't for the ill-conceived theme & hackneyed lyrics of \\"The Great Debate,\\" I would have given this disc 5 stars.  It's sad...the music is amazing, but the lyrics...yikes!<BR>Petrucci wrote the lyrics to that one...but then he turns around and totally redeems himself with the poignant, more simplistic lyrics of \\"Solitary Shell.\\" \\"Glass Prison\\" is definitely my favorite new DT song right now.  There's like 15 completely original, equally butt-kicking metal riffs.....most bands would just use one of those riffs to make a whole song out of.  Not DT...they're so flush with great musical ideas, it's scary.  Buy it...you won't be disappointed.
0446678430|3.0|I've read almost all of the Rich Dad series, and I continue to give each one of them mixed reviews.<BR>On the one hand, these books stress that people are NOT going to become 'rich' by saving and investing for retirement.  The truly rich DO think different and have different options, primarily because they own their own business.<BR>The information provided is, on the one hand, so obvious you wonder \\"why bother\\".  Then, you realize that Mr. Kiyosaki is the only person out there putting together books like this, and then you have to wonder \\"why isn't anyone else saying this!?!\\"<br />The RD,PD books form a cornerstone of my personal finance library, NOT because of the depth of information provided (as one other reviewer mentioned, specifics are THIN), but because these books are designed to make you THINK, to make you expand your potential, and to find out the rich person in you.  That sounds esoteric, but the reason each book repeats earlier books is because the messages need to be repeated, repeated, repeated until you finally _realize_ what he's trying to say!<br />Yes, this book is a rehash of the previous books.  Yes, it does provide a few new insites that make it worthwile.  BUT, the fact that Mr. Kiyosaki finally goes into a little bit of detail of HOW he raised himself up, how he APPLIED the lessons he's been teaching, and a bit about some deals he worked.  The series isn't about specifics; remember that.  It's about changing your CONTEXT.  <br />Read the book and you'll understand.
B000002J1L|5.0|Ladies and Germs this is not only my favorite Genesis album but it's my favorite album whatsoever.Every song is a masterpiece, has meaning,and has pure musical creativity.I honestly cannot find anything I don't like about this album. Without rhyming Gabriel takes us with him on a strange storytelling journey.Some story's such as the opening track &quot;Musical box&quot; are harder to make sense of, other's like &quot;Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; however are more concrete. I love how instead of showing us the irony, and emotions of  life via first person, Genesis chose to do it with short stories. I'd recomend this album to anyone who has imagination,has an open mind,likes progressive rock, or just likes great music.
B000001F7R|4.0|The debut of Def Leppard can't get any better.  I got this album for Christmas last year along with a bunch of other cd's and this is one of my favorites. It has a much better hard hitting heavier sound than the likes of Pyromania and Hysteria. It is raw and the real deal. Lots of very good songs on this album and a great debut. The sound quality isn't the greatest and def leppard is definetly due for some remasters but it is still a great album. This albumr ocks the whole way through and there aren't any bad songs. My personal favorites are &quot;Rock Brigade&quot;, &quot;When The Walls Come Tumbling Down&quot;, &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;Overture&quot;. &quot;Overture&quot; is an excellent track timing in at close to 8 minutes. This album is well worth it for any fans who like a mixture of hard rock and heavy metal. Any Def Leppard fan should own this album.
1586210912|5.0|I wish that I would have read this book my senior year in high school because I believe that I would not have made the financial and educational mistakes that I did. Luckily, I am not completely money illiterate and I am capable of overcoming my past mistakes. So with Robert T Kiyosaki's helpful advice, I am confident I will not get trapped in the middle class - I am rich!
B00003CXXI|5.0|What a marvelous movie.  Such wonderful technology!  Great story line, with appeal for children and adults as well.  I have watched this movie 8 times and still delight in the presentation.  My neice/Goddaughter has watched this repeatedly and still enjoys this movie.  Best movie I have seen in a long time!
B000003S0P|4.0|After the disappointing Starless and Bible Black, an album of meandering instrumentals and ill-fated attempts at satire, the second incarnation of King Crimson let out the hot air and unleashed the sheer, potent sonic assult of 1974's Red. Crimson, shortened down to guitarist, Robert Fripp; bass-player and vocalist, John Wetton and drummer, Bill Bruford after the resignation of violinist, David Cross (Cross guests on \\"Providence\\"), act as a progress rock version of the power trio, mulling through raucous, grinding riff-rock and buoyant funk with a no-nonsense attitude and little time for quirkiness. A straightforward approach may seem implausible for an album that consists of five tracks and clocks in at 40:01 but, with the exception of the sluggish beginning of \\"Providence,\\" every moment bursts with ontarget energy. A more basic approach does not mean, however, a loss in King Crimson's wonderful penchant towards experimentation. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is a magnificently shifty track, changing tempos in mid-lyric and the bone-crushing title track continues their fascinating flirtation with classical music (The instrumental is based around the tritone, a age old movement banned throughout the ages because its devious tone made some feel it was invented by hellish means). There is just simply a greater, clearer precision at work on Red than on other Crimson albums. It is the type of grinding, rapid-fire, no-nonsence hard rock that absolutely shatters sences.
1878424319|5.0|I know what some of you are saying, &quot;Not another self-help book.&quot;  But please everyone do yourself and others a favor and read this book. What could be so difficult about reading four simple agreements that will change the way you view certain situations in your life forever.  Plus, its not like some books that have hundreds of pages of useless information that requires some scientologists to translate before you can even grasp what the author is saying.  This book is simple to understand and the author uses a language that we can relate to.  Four simple things is all you have to remember and you will find yourself dealing with life more successfully.  Simple things that use to bother you will become unimportant.  And when people talk bad about you or to you remember the 4 agreements and their words will be their baggage and problem and not yours.  Suddenly you will find yourself saying more meaningful things that will create more of an impact around you, because you have learned to &quot;Speak impeccably&quot;  as the author explains.<BR>I worked in a book store for years and I highly recommened this book to alot of customers.  I also told them that they would be back to buy more copies for their family and friends.  And sure enough they returned not only to buy one more copy but several.  At Christmas time I couldn't keep the book on the shelf.  My customers were buying 10 copies at a time and giving them as stocking stuffers.  I gave one to my daughter who just recently got a taste of what it is like to work in an environment with different personalities and she couldn't believe how cut throat people can be.  She read the book and now has a new attitude about the way she deals with her co-workers and customers.  So please don't walk by and think its another self help book, pick it up and read it and you will agree that the &quot;Four Agreements&quot;  is a must read for everyone.  You owe it to yourself and others around you.  And besides, it is a fastread that gets right to the point and it doesn't cost much.
B000002UAC|2.0|In 1963, popular music was like hoola hoops or pet rocks; mere merchandize assembled to purge the allowances and summer job cash of fickle, trend-abinding adolescents. It was rarely artistic and that made no difference to the executives and managers who had omnipotent control over the music. They solely wanted to discover the next chart-topper and make as much money off of him, her or them as possible before the performer was replaced by a new sensation. Recognizing these rules, the executives and managers who had the Beatles under contract, rushed the group into the studio to record their second LP, 1963's With the Beatles, in order to quickly cash in the craze early hits such as \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"From Me to You\\" had created in Great Britain.<br />The hurried recording process resulted in a disappointing follow-up to their wonderful debut, Please Please Me. With the Beatles' original compositions sound as if songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, simply prodded around for a cute chorus about a girl and a somewhat catchy riff, laid down the track and then moved on to the next, sweating under the deadline. Songs like \\"All I've Got to Do,\\" \\"Little Child,\\" \\"Hold Me Tight\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" sound like autopilot echoes of their previous clever, infectious hits and have, for the most part, been understandably forgotten. With the Beatles' R&B and 50s rock and roll covers, such as \\"Money,\\" \\"Devil in Her Heart\\" and \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" fare significantly better than the Lennon and McCartney originals. For such zesty young rock and rollers whipping up the vigor and spirit for impeccable, energetic versions of these tunes could be done at the stomp of a dime. The creative process by which the Beatles composed their own catchy classics was another story. Like any great artist's muse it needed time to recharge and room to breath. The big wigs and stuffed shirts who put a deadline on this record should have understood that they were dealing with a different type of pop sensation, one that would never be forgotten and one that deserved proper patience and respect.
B00005V0X5|5.0|IF YOU HAVE THE FIRST VERSION, YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY WHEN YOU HEAR THE SOUND ON THIS ONE. COMPLETELY REMASTERED AND IT SHOWS SPECIALLY ON DRUMS!!! GAR WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS. R.I.P
0671027573|5.0|Out of all the Linda Howard books that I have read, this is by far the best one. This book was funny and romantic, and the suspense was a plus, but not the best part. The &quot;list&quot; as incredibly funny! I couldn't wait to tell my friend's about this book. If you read any of her books, which you should, read this one first because it's her best!<BR>I also recommend Nora Roberts and Elizabeth Lowell for romantic suspense.
6305428557|5.0|Do you think that good movies are the ones like....Fast and Furious?...The End of Days?...Matrix?....PLEASE!!! THIS is a very-very-good movie! The beauty of this movie you can find it in every minute, every second... what's more wonderful that the set found for the movie?<BR>Music...oh music...how wonderful you are, the best i've heard...and FORGET titanic! To be honest you don't need to know the plot of the movie, just buy it, sit, and enjoy it, really, is that simple. Here, a fan from SPAIN.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Megadeth have outdone them selves with this release.  The remastering of a classic Speed/Thrash album circa '83 - '84.<br />This release includes the completely redone cover art (The one the band REALLY wanted), excellent remixes that really brightens up the mix and brings the somewhat dismal mix of the original (Combat records) to a wonderful clarity and heaviness.<br />Dave Mustaine starts the album with a scorching commentary on what his life was like just after the \\"Firing\\" from Metallica and his mindset when putting together his band.  Then Dave Ellefson's and Scott Ian's (From Anthrax) introduction.<br />On top of that you get commentary from both Dave&#8217;s (Mustaine and Ellefson) on each song.<br />The Final topper is the 3 demos at the end (Last rites/Loved to deth, Mechanix, and The Skull beneath the Skin) which are wonderful to see how the song transformed into the groundbreaking tunes they've become.<br />Congratulations to Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson for being able to get this chance to remix history and make it better than it was before.<br />R.I.P. Gar Samuelson
B000001G1E|5.0|Absolutely essential listening for anyone with any desire to delve into the origins of funk, hip hop or modern rhythm and blues. As one who grew up with the origins of hip hop, this box set acts as a catalog for me of thousands of \\"funky breaks\\" used in hip hop music since the advent of the affordable sampler. But it also serves as a course in the study of popular music - period. While every would-be Cobain can trace their roots back to the Beatles, anyone who's played or programmed beats comes back to James.<BR>This collection is offered in chronological order, allowing the listener to follow James Brown's development of the genre referred to as funk. Not a great musician (he can play keys, most notably Hammond organ), and not a composer (can't read or write music), James Brown is the best bandleader (some members might say \\"taskmaster\\") of the past 35 years. Many of James' best tracks are arranged on the spot (\\"take me to the bridge!\\"), challenging the band repeatedly to be on their toes at all times.<BR>Some of the best players of the genre (Clyde Stubblefield, Bobby Byrd, Bootsy Collins, Fred Wesley) have played with James, adding to the impact of his importance. Is every song a classic? Not by a long shot - James' grooves far outweigh any of his lyrics. But the world has always had an appetite for mindless dancable chants (from Chic to Daft Punk). The included booklet is fantastic and easily worth $15 by itself. A must-have by anyone claiming to \\"know\\" and love popular music, especially those who's listening tends to the funky and rhythmic.
0446608955|3.0|My friends and I all read the same copy f this book withen a week. I haven't seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book. The first 180 pages are introduction. The next ten pages are the climax and ending. And the ending wasn't that great anyway. There were no clues leading up to the why certain things happen at the climax, and the things that do happen are two pags before the climax. Pls, I wish this book was more historical fictiony. If I didn't know it took place in the 50s, I would have guessd it took place now. I don't really reccomend this. My friends said it was really sad and cute, but it wasn't at all. Read OUT OF TIME by Caroline B. Cooney.
0790742780|5.0|Don't believe what Leonard Maltin says, this is a great movie. It is on the borderline of being an action movie and a drama, but at the same time, it could be reffered as a 'dark comedy'. But that's what makes this movie so watchable. I recieved this movie... yesterday and I've already watched it twice. It is that good. But this movie is not for everyone, though. It is fairly violent, and has a pretty powerful ending, not to mention the strong(really strong)language. This is definitely not a movie for kids. Is this movie worth the asking price? Of course, as this is the best film Douglas has acted in. Period.<br />But, don't take my word for it. Watch it yourself, and you'll understand.
B000058983|5.0|Love was a great band of the 60's that deserved more recognition for it's influence. Love was all about the L.A. scene. Love's leader Arthur Lee was influenced from Miles Davis' \\"Sketches of Spain\\" on this album. Side One opens with their hit \\"Alone Again Or\\" which features a Herb Alpert style horn effect with flamenco accoustic guitar accompliment. The album flows together with sweet sounds and catchy lyrics especially from \\"A House is Not A Hotel\\" i.e....\\"the news of today will be the movies of tomorrow.\\" <BR>\\"Live And Let Live\\" is my least favorite track (I have alittle trouble with the \\"snot\\" lyric). The bonus tracks are okay...they don't really add much to the overall enjoyment. The music still<BR>has a beautiful timeless quality that it still relative today! BUY IT AND FIND OUT!!!<BR>I also recommend the \\"Love Story - 1966 to 1972\\" CD which contains all of \\"Forever Changes\\" plus 33 other tracks.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If I had to chose one reason for why this movie was so good, it would be because of the acting. The acting was excellent. All the actors and actresses played their roles exceptionally well. For the children, I especially liked Hermione, Harry, and Ron. Hermione's bossy personality led to a few laughs and the way that all three interacted together throughout the movie was simply brilliant. For the adults, Hagrid was among my favorites. He was funny because he would sometimes let important information slip so that the trio could solve the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone. Snape was another favorite of mine. I definitely wouldn't want a teacher like him, but it was humerous how he treats Harry and is always taking points away from Gryffindor for any reason that he can think of. Finally, Mr. Filch was also great in this movie. His expressions and ideas on proper punishments, when talking to Hagrid in the dentention scene, are just excellent. I felt that the movie stuck pretty close to the book. If it included everything, the movie would be much longer (I wouldn't have mined myself though *hehe*). I will agree that there were a few parts that were wrong... such as the using light for Devil's Snare when its supposed to be fire... and the picture book of Harry and his family showing a boy much older than Harry was supposed to be... and James Potter (Harry's Dad) being a Seeker instead of a Chaser... but nonetheless I still think the movie deserves 5 stars! It was great, go see it and buy it on DVD :)
B00005U11Z|5.0|An enjoyable DVD!  Very well done in sound and picture.  As a longtime fan (also a friend of Mike Baird, drummer during the &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; tour 86-88) the guys make it look easy.  I've seen them a few times (even this tour) and the &quot;New sound&quot; is impressive!  I think however, the new vocalist Steve Augeri struggles at times (it seems) to meet the classic Steve Perry sound, (nobody can I know).  It's fun to see and hear the best of Journey on this one!  A &quot;Must have DVD&quot; for your collection.  Enjoy!
B000060OFT|5.0|if you love the original romeo and juliet you will ove this movie. this version has a present day twist to it. people like to say that it makes fun of the original, but i think that it makes it easier to understand. this is the best movie to have in your collection.
630522577X|1.0|If you are going to enjoy the movie, My Fair Lady, here are a few suggestions. First, ignore the fact that Audrey Hepburn is really not the one singing. Second, forget that this was a Broadway smash hit which enjoyed its success thanks in large part to Julie Andrews. And finally, never ever listen to the original Broadway cast recording starring Ms. Andrews. The movie will be ruined for you forever. This movie has been reviewed time and time again so there is not alot I can add. Some will think it is wonderful and not mind that the role of Eliza Doolittle was so horribly mis-cast. Others, like me, will not be able to sit through it without thinking how wonderful it could have been if only Jack Warner had had the sense enough to cast Dame Julie. What could he have been thinking?? Instead we are left feeling cheated that such great Lerner and Loewe material could be so wasted.<BR>  I just finished watching the movie again after not having seen it in several years and felt like writing this review. Throughout the movie, every time Marni Nixon started singing for Audrey, I just cringed. It is so bad, it is almost painful to listen. I guess I am just partial to the Broadway cast recording because it is fantastic! Julie Andrews sings the role of Eliza to perfection. The movie's only redeeming quality is Rex Harrison and the supporting cast. Can you imagine anyone else playing Henry Higgins other than Rex Harrison. Oh, the irony!<BR>  My suggestion is put My Fair Lady on the shelf and instead watch The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins or Oklahoma! to name a few. This movie is not even in the same league with these other great musicals!!
B00003CXI1|3.0|The film is great, the actors fantastic but I feel given the budget of this movie that it was let down by the animations of the Quidditch game and the troll scene. Given the technology we have seen in the matrix, Star Wars and Lord of The Rings I think they could have done a lot better. <br />Sticks close to the book, which is unusally good to screen<br />Having said all that it is still well worth watching, and I will be getting a DVD for my HP mad girlfriend.
B000003S0P|4.0|This is not only one of Crim's best records, but one of their most accessible- if you haven't heard Crimson yet, Red is possibly your best choice for a first purchase.  This is excellent, progressive, and very accessible heavy rock with a bit of psychotic improv thrown in for good measure.  Starless is the album's biggest highlight, and one of my favorite compositions in all of rock music.  It just builds up to an amazing climax that puts me in a state of total euphoria every time I hear it.
B000002LR3|5.0|Anyone who was between 16 &amp; 25 in the late 80's early 90's should have this in there collection.<br />A great Scottish band, a brilliant Album. I have bought this CD several times as I keep leaving it places when I travel.<br />Nothing short of magical !
B000000OU6|3.0|OK, it is Slash, and I would buy every CD that has a tune played by Slash - I'm sorry but I just love the style, now since this CD is not only instrumental but has some guy who is screaming trying to sound like Limp-Axl-Nirvana or god knows what... Slash is just too damn good for this kind....<BR>GNR worked because of the amazing talent pool they have there, you need a good lead vocal, who is also an amazing song writer like Axl, and an innovative Guitarist like Slash... In this case you got the guitar trying to cover for the poor vocal performance. So what can I tell you, I wish it was instrumental but if you don't mind listening to some little kid trying to be noticed and screaming as loud as he can you should buy this CD, after all, This IS Slash!! BTW, I wish he could come out with some instrumental record some Rock-Blues style...
B000002GCT|4.0|As their last effort with Roger Hogson, &quot;...famous last words...&quot; is listenable all the way through. The group seems to be keeping the winning recipe that has made &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; their major commercial breakthrough, by writing accessible, poppy and rather soft music. Being not as consistent as their other albums, this one is rather a collection of songs spanning a wide range of musical styles.<br />Crazy is a great pop opener I will never get tired of. The bubblegum hit It's Raining Again will either make you sick or cheer you up for the day. My Kind Of Lady sounds like a 50's ballad Rick Davies must have written when he was 6... but is still enjoyable though.<br />My favourite cut is the haunting Waiting So Long, which is the darkest of the album. Know Who You Are is a simple yet great moody track which, like Waiting So Long, reminds us the group's earlier albums.<br />Like any other Supertramp album, there is no real weak track on this one. Ok, some sound like silly music for children, but they're still enjoyable. And others show clever melodies and arrangements that always chracterised them. If you liked the diversity and pop sound of Breakfast in America, give a try to this one. However, if bubblegum and silly lyrics makes you sick, there are still 3 or 4 track you're gonna like.
B00005U122|5.0|OK, so it's not exactly Pink Floyd, but believe me  - it's just as good, waters has surrounded himself with very talented people, and each one has excellent guitar and vocal skills, you should really see it, they play may kinds of instruments, and the performance is amazing. This is my first Pink FLoyd related DVD and I am extremely satisfied with the purchase, I could not expect something better, and as a guitarist - this is a wonderful performance, the solos in comfortably nub are amazing, the improvisations is wonderful, the Acoustic sessions are unbelievable, hey I could go on and on, why don't you just buy the CD and see for yourself? believe me it's worth every penny.
0452281881|5.0|For the first few pages, you have to go slowly and adjust to the style of writing as well as the idea of having no physical descriptions to help distinguish the characters. After that brief period of getting to know the characters' email &quot;voices&quot;, it's a quick read that will have you laughing out loud.<br />If you work in a place where there is entirely too much email you will probably find this so much funnier. I could relate to everything: the CCing of superiors in someone's subtle power play, BCCing people when I thought I'd written a particularly clever email, bosses who have no idea how their email works...it's all in there, every element of the email-based workplace as well as every annoying clod you work with (or for.) <br />And if you work in advertising...<br />This book has already made the rounds at the office, and I'm yet to hear anything approaching negative commentary.
B00000373U|5.0|The Best Elliot Smith Album.  The recording quality is excellent. Finally no screeching guitar strings!!!!  \\"Between the Bars\\" is haunting and addictive.  \\"2:45AM\\" is the story of so many searching nights.  Smith makes Ryan Adams seem a little less special.  In \\"Say yes\\"  I thought Elliot was about to rock- time for a tribute album by a reunited Guns and Roses:)
B00005RDAF|4.0|i expected that this dvd would have all of britney's videos, in fact it only brings 3 (4 if u count \\"crossroads-overprotected\\"). this dvd was rushed, its just a plug for her upcoming movie \\"crossroads\\" and dvd release of \\"britney: live from las vegas\\". they should have waited a bit longer on relasesing this dvd cuz only a couple of weeks later the actual video 4 \\"overproteced\\" was released. they could have added her eye opening performance 4m the 2000 VMAs and 2 more other videos which i would have liked 2 see on this dvd, \\"from the bottom of my broken heart\\" and \\"i was born to make u happy\\". and just 2 add, it would have been better if the whole uncut pepsi commercial was on it, insted theres the version that cuts back and forth 4m britney 2 people watching her on the tv. all in all, i think it was a good dvd but not worth wut i payed 4. if ur a britney fan, get it but be warned.
B000007U6V|5.0|Probably the definitive album by the Masters of synthesized pop music. No one does it better. I've got 6 of their albums, and &quot;Autobahn&quot; lies closest to my heart. Perhaps because it was the first one I ever heard? I don't know. But it you're going to buy one Kraftwerk album, you can't go wrong here. Essential.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|I am so impressed by the music on this disc and the sonics.  Sade and her band make their studio music come to life as they perfectly recreate their sound - live.  The singing is better than the studio discs.  That is how good it is.  The backup harmonies are tastefully integrated.  The band is just great and this is a very professional group.  The songs are even given more of a depth by the extended live arrangements.  The disc is 70 minutes long.  You get alot of music for your money.  The sonics are just warm, clear, millenium technology.  Her music is very warm and this is brought out by the flat production that this music is supposed to have.  Very down.  Recorded like they record accoustic Jazz.  Very appropriate.  Very authentic.  &quot;Cherish The Day&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;, &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Life&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot;, 13 in all, and some new.  One of the best pop music live performances I have ever heard.  So why 4 stars?  THE CROWD NOISE.  They left in the crowd noise.  Why did they do this.  All you hear is screaming throughout the disc.  The intros to songs the crowd is screaming.  Is the crowd an instrument I need to hear?  Then the songs are going and you hear the noise intersperrsed with the song.  Building to  a crescendoe.  It's like a gun that you are waiting to go off.  The band plays some music in between the singing and the crowd goes nuts.  I didn't buy this to hear the crowd.  I think the technology is such where the producers know how to cut out crowd noise already.  If they were trying to give me the feeling I was at a concert, I have it.  But who wants it?  This is the last type of music that you want to hear screaming while it's going on.  Too Bad.  I would still buy this disc, because the music is just fabulous.  It's great.  The producers get a zero and a ticket to an asylum.  They should re issue this without the noise and it would be just an incredible disc.
0792156684|2.0|You may be confused with my rating. No--I am NOT anti-TITANIC. In fact, I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is just that Amazon.com had asked for the rating of the DVD, and this DVD is absolutely horrible. Sure, the picture and sound quality is okay, but there are no special features! For the highest grossing film of all time, this is a pretty poor excuse for a DVD. And not only are there no special features, but this DVD is only available in widescreen format. And just how many people these days have widescreen TVs? Certainly not me! So why are all these DVDs only coming out in widescreen formats? Where are all the full frame formats?<br />But now onto the movie. The movie itself is really wonderful. I have the double video tape version and I have rented this DVD so I could compare the two. I have to say that the video tape version is better and much more worth the price. TITANIC takes place in the year 1912. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a young lovely first class woman who is forced into marrying the money-made Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) by her money-hungry, overprotective mother (Francis Fisher). But on the Grand R.M.S. TITANIC, Rose meets her true love--the handsome young starving artist third class passenger, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who won his tickets on TITANIC in a game of Poker. When the ship sinks, it is up to Rose and Jack to make sure they both survive.<br />I do not know one person who had not seen TITANIC in theaters. I only got to see it once in the theaters, but know it by heart now because of all the times I've watched the video. Some people think the love story is cheesy, but it is not. It shows the power of true love...and just how strong it can be. DiCaprio and Winslet are convincing and charming in their roles, and the supporting cast is wonderful, too. The special effects are just incredibly stunning--and this is one of the few films which I believe deserved the 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. <br/>James Cameron has created a masterpiece--a film that will not ever be forgotten, no matter how many people hated it. The screenplay and diolauge isn't even all that bad. The acting is absolutely superb...no one could have done a better job than these actors in their roles.<br />I just wish Paramount would have come out with a better DVD. In fact, here are some suggestions and ideas I'd like to make for a future collector's edition and/or special edition DVD (Paramount--are you taking notes?): behind-the-scenes, cast & crew biographies, cast & crew interviews, photo gallery, Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" music video, Oscar night footage of the film winning each award--including the performance Celine Dion did, documentaries, real-life stories from real-life passengers on the real-life TITANIC, the making of the sets and special effects, the original screenplay by James Cameron, production notes, interactive CD-Rom games and extras for your computer, TITANIC's original theatrical trailer, picture-perfect quality and sound, widescreen and full frame formats, and perhaps even more! Now THAT would be the perfect DVD. I refuse to buy TITANIC on DVD until Paramount comes out with a special edition or collector's edition DVD!<br />Besides, doesn't the greatest film of all time need the greatest DVD of all time?
0064407667|4.0|This is the beginning of the \\"Unfortunate Events\\" series.  It all starts out as a day at the beach with each other for siblings Violet, the 14 year old who likes to invent things, Klaus, a very intelligent pre-teen, and Sunny, a baby who likes to bite things.  They soon find out that their parents have died in a tragic fire, burning down their whole house.  Violet will get the fortune of the parents, but when she is of age (eighteen).  They go to live with their very distant relative, Count Olaf, a horrid man who forces them to perform hard labor and all sleep in one room.  The author seems to make the story humorous (as it is depressing) by using running jokes throughout the story like Sunny's baby talk (\\"Gack!\\"  probbably meant \\"Who's that mysterious figure in the fog?\\") and defining words throughout the book.  The book series ends once it reaches lucky thirteen, and I'm in no hurry for it to end.
B000000W5L|5.0|There's not much to say other than this CD rocks! I got it today, only knowing of one song (Happy), and I loved all of them. One of my favs was &quot;Soul Survivor.&quot; If you are a Rolling Stones fan or a rock lover of any sort, this is for you.
B00005V4O5|5.0|I have been listening ot this album all day since I recieved it this afternoon. I must say, it is completely engrossing to say the least. These guys have emotion and complexity existing in the same domain constantly. Thay have perfected the art of intertwining progressive structures with melody and glorious harmony, yet they use it tastefully. Some tracks make me want to weep, and others remind of the wonderous things to enjoy in life. Overall, I cannot praise this album enough, it is coming close to the level achieved by &quot;One Hour By The Concrete Lake&quot;. Highly recommended for PoS fans as well as fans of other acts such as Vanden Plas, Dream Theater (Whose new album is also incredible), and Fates Warning.
B00003CXTF|1.0|Pearl Harbor was superbly marketed almost everyone knew about this movie.I went into this movie being very excited,but when the movie started 20 mins into it I got bored,the romance should have been atleast serious,no spark between Kate and Ben,this looked like a slap-stick comedy.Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't even have<BR>a big role,i have no idea what he was doing here.The romance failed to topple over Enemy of the Gates romance,the battles failed to top over Saving Private Ryan.Michael Bay is too paranoid,and during some romance scenes he just cuts into a war build-up.Acting is horrible.Could be the worst movie of the year.Doesn't even deserve a rating.
B000059H99|1.0|I got this movie on DVD at a store today thinking I had made a good buy at a good price for a movie I really loved.  Unfortunately checking some widescreen scenes on this dvd and comparing them to some pan&scan scenes have led me to believe that this movie is in FALSE widescreen format (just pan&scan with black bars covering parts of the top and bottom; nothing extra on the sides... you actually lose some of the actual picture because of it).  The widescreen of this movie on tape is the same as the dvd...  It's a shame, because you'd think people who produce movies on dvd would actually care about retrieving the actual footage, instead of giving customers this manufactured garbage.  There should be some law against this.  We lose our money, and they get to falsely advertise about a bogus product and get away with it (reminds me of similar complaints of \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Stargate\\" also being in fake widescreen; who knows what else).  The extra's on this dvd can be seen by renting the dvd at your local store.  That might be all it's worth.  Rocky (movie) = 5 stars.  DVD = 0 stars.
B00003CXTF|4.0|...If you like action films,you will like this film.The acting is very well done and the cinematography was indeed first class.Will it win any awards?probably not,but it is certainly worth seeing on the big screen.The trailers for the movie pretty much show you what you want the movie to be like,so if you liked the trailers,you will like this film.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is magnificent!  I am especially drawn to Only Time because of its connection with September 11th.  I have seen pictures of faces and the utter destruction and that song is often played in the background.  Until I found out the name of it, I would be shopping and when it came on over the sound system in the stores, it would stop me dead in my tracks!
B00003CXTG|5.0|'Pearl Harbor is simply one of the greatest movies I have seen in a long time.It wasn't until someone recommended this movie to me that I took an intrest.I never wanted to see it in the cinema,but know I wish I had.It is also hard to believe that it performed so poorly in UK box office.I believe like many movies 'Pearl Harbor will find its audience outside the cinema and in our homes.I have seen many corny American movie and to be honest believed this was going to be one of them and that it was going to be a 3-hour cheese fest.I was wrong.There are alot of negative reviews here,more than I expected but that is fair enough as everyone is entitled to their opinion.I guess people are really hard to please these days.Two very big thumbs up for the powerful epic.
0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning is the best book I have read in a long time! The Baudelaire Children's lives are filled with very unfortunate events and unforgettable characters. The book is very humorous in a strange, dark kind of way. I bought the first one and couldn't stop! Now, 2 days later I am on the third! This is a really GREAT book! I know that if you start to read it, you will not be able to put it down!!!!!!!!!TRY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie was really a great picture.The cast does wonderful jobs at playing their roles.The love story was okay,but the action scenes were incredible.I love when they went back to bomb the Japanese.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good time.
0060976624|5.0|In Thank You for Smoking, Christopher Buckley effectively uses  stereotypes to create a wonderfully ironic satire that will leave the reader literally \\"gasping for air.\\"<br />Buckley is clever in his ability to get the reader to excuse the faults of his self-serving, over-indulgent main character, Nick Naylor. Buckley persuades the reader to be sympathetic with Nick, despite his less than honorable job as a spokesman for the Tobacco Industry. <br />Buckley's satire leverages popular stereotypes about the FBI, the Tobacco Lobby, the Gun Lobby, the Alcoholic Beverage Lobby, Hollywood, bosses, cabbies, newspaper reporters, co-workers, office politics, the Christian Right, and lawyers in order to make us laugh but also to drive home deeper points about what we have become as a nation.<br />This book works on so many different levels - whether you're looking for a good laugh or a well-written political satire, you will enjoy this novel.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't care what anyone says,this is the best movie i've ever seen.It was a long,but never lost my intrest.The effects were stunning the cast were brillant,the story I thought was very good.I recommend having the DVD edition as the extras disc was just as fascinating as the film.Plus with Dobly 5.1 surround it really took you into that attack sequence.Brillant.
B000000H40|5.0|I could easily say this is my 2nd fave Death cd....certainly a step into the right direction for Obituary it's a shame the later stuff isn't as good...except for \\"World Demise\\" buy this bad boy if you want a raw and powerful album to your collection...it kicks!
B00003CXTF|5.0|\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is one of my favorite movies of all time.I really enjoyed every thing about it.The scenes were breathtaking as well as the special effects.Bravo to the cast and crew of this movie.Ben,Josh,Kate,Cuba,John,Alec,and their supporting cast do a good jobWay to go.
B000001F76|5.0|This album brought back many childhood memories of my older brothers and sisters and also my  parents listening and dancing to Hank Williams.  These songs have a lot of meaning in the lyrics and Hank was a  man of emotion..  We lost a great singer at the  young age of  29...but he lives on in his songs..<BR>It is worth every penny and more...
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is excellent-the cast,the story line,and the amazing special effects are all spot on.Its definately up there with Titanic and Armageddon.Good for a girle night in as u will all fall in love with Ben and Josh,and will definately be crying your eyes out by the end.
B00005UEAR|5.0|First thing first, i don't understand all the negative reviews on this album. I agree to some of their points, but to say, money would be better spend on Blink 182. COME ON!!!  Hello, there albums are shorter than half of Dream Theater's average.  Half the bands out there right now, have no imagination, and are writing all the same lyrics. As far as Dream Theater \\"copy catting\\", it is not true, they are merely experimentally with different types of music, paying homage to most of it. This is the music they listen to, and they enjoy, they are musician first and foremost. They know that they have some of the greatest fans on the planet, and they always strive to please us, with every album (save FII, but i blame that on Derek S.), regardless, these guys work hard and the are best musician out there right now period. With that said, on the the review.<br />I love this album, i can't stop playing 2nd disc, it is contagious, and wonderful to listen to. The whole album is awesome, there is not a band anywhere that can touch there musical prowless right now. They have the talent to incorporate there on style and mix in other musical style and it just flows. Yes, i admit they use a lot Floyd, Rush, and Yes influence, but that's one of the reasons we like them right?  I love the fact that they are trying new stuff, it's cool to listen to \\"The Great Debate\\", and all of the sudden i am hearing Tool. I love Tool, and so does Dream Theater, that is why they did it, to pay homage to a great band, like themselves. My favorites on this album have to be Misunderstood, The Glass Prison, and Disappear. I love the entire 2nd disc, would not even try to pick out the best part of it. Blind Faith is also an awesome song, but the ones above just stand out. I have already made my comments about \\"The Great Debate\\", it is a great song, and i love the experimentation. Overall this is one of their best albums, end of discussion, in terms of melody, raw musical talent, and songwriting, it is allgenius, sheer genius. And now for more of my editorial comments on Dream Theater's behalf. <br />Their music has to evolve or else it will get stale, and all sound the same. I know we all loved I&W, but they just revistied that album, remember SFAM?  This is the natural musical movement Dream Theater should make. Jordan on the keys was the best thing they could have done, I couldn't stand Derek S., he was good just good enough. Jordan is equal to and  in many areas better than Kevin, they were both keyboarding geniuses who knew how to blend all types of music. John Petrucci and John Myung are two of the greatest guitarist to ever walk the earth. As far as Mike Portnoy goes, I will just say one thing. Five time drummer of the year in Modern Drummer magazine. James is easily one of the best vocalists in prog/metal history, Geoff Tate (Queensryche)WAS good, but they lost their touch after Empire. How many other rock vocalists do you know of that have the range that he does, I mean, he has operatic voice training for goodness sake. There is nothing this band can't do, and they prove it with every album. Just remember one thing, they don't sale that many albums, and their concerts in the states usually don't sale out (although they should), so if they are not doing this for fame and fortune (compared to people like N'Sync, Britney, and BSB), what are they doing it for?  Here is a hint, look in the mirror, that's right, you ,me and every other true Dream Theater fan out there. This is a band that knows their fans, and knows what they like, and will do everything in their power to deliver quality THINKING man's music. If you are new to Dream Theater start with Images and Words, then get Metropolis Part 2., Awake, and only then will you be ready for this album. To all the DT Fans out there, GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!
B00003CXTF|5.0|Pearl Harbor was superbly marketed almost everyone knew about this movie.I went into this movie being very excited,but when the movie started 20 mins into it I got bored,the romance should have been atleast serious,no spark between Kate and Ben,this looked like a slap-stick comedy.Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't even have<BR>a big role,i have no idea what he was doing here.The romance failed to topple over Enemy of the Gates romance,the battles failed to top over Saving Private Ryan.Michael Bay is too paranoid,and during some romance scenes he just cuts into a war build-up.Acting is horrible.Could be the worst movie of the year.Doesn't even deserve a rating.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I think this CD ROCKS!  It is extremely rare to find a CD that every song is good on, and No Doubt's &quot;Rock Steady&quot; has accomplished that. Congrats to them for being such a great band!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Not your typical loove story,this film is probably going to have you weeping for days to come.Perfect for a good night in.
B000002GVO|1.0|This has two pretty good tracks - 'New Kid in Town' and 'Life In The Fast Lane'; and one track, the title track, that has interesting lyrics, but is spoiled by the limp reggae beat. (Check out 'Watching the Detectives' by Elvis Costello and 'Police and Thieves' by The Clash for a more productive use of reggae -artists who understood the genre.) The rest of the album is bland, disposable, certainly forgettable, soft rock. Hip-easy listening at it's worst.
B00003CXTG|5.0|What can I say? Pearl Harbor is simply the best film since the industry began.It has an all star cast with Ben Afflich just one of these.If you want good looks or great special effects the film has it.At a great price from amazon co.You can have it all for next to nothing on DVD.The film is un missable.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I have always liked Pink, but was never totally crazy over her.  Her last CD was very good and stayed in my CD player for quite a while.  <br />I picked up her newest CD on the release date and absolutely LOVE it and PINK!!! The songs are great, edgy, rock-like, inspiring, sad, fun, witty etc etc etc - I could brag about this CD all day.  I say  go buy it- sit back relax and listen closely to the words!!!!  <br />Also for all you PINK fans- for those that loved the remix of \\"You Make Me Sick\\" take note that Arista- actually released a United States CD Maxi Single containing the club mixes on 1/29/02!! Yes- 2 years after the song was a hit!!! Still amazes me that I actually got my hands on this becuase I loved this song off her first CD and they released it!! THANKS ARISTA- can you release the club mixes of \\"There You Go\\"???
B00003CXTG|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about seeing Pearl Harbor at first.When it was released in theaters I passed it up thinking it was going to be boring documentry type deal,but after watching it when it was released on DVD,I loved it.Its not just a story of the tradgety Pearl Harbor,but a story of love and the effect of WW2 on the different characters Rafe,Danny,and Evely.Not to mention one of the sadest endings iv'e ever seen.Rafe goes off to Europe to fight the Nazi's while Evelyn and Danny are stantioned at Pearl Harbor.After receiving word that Rafe has died in action.Danny and Evelyn fall in love.This all turns upside down.When Rafe turns up alive and returns to Pearl Harbor to see his love.The attack scenes are well done.All of the characters in the movie are played out well and Ben Affleck gives a unforgettable performance.
0553712837|1.0|This was too silly for grade school reading group.  I couldn't believe Grishman was the author (at least not a grownup Grisham). Did he write this as a pre-teen.  Stereotypical goody-goody characters and stupid people doing stupid things.  Ugh.. I think I'll celebrate Christmas and skip Grisham!!!
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams hits a grand slam with this one. His performance, the guest vocalists and the arrangements are all top-notch. It's a pure example what a great singer teamed with world-class musicians can do. <BR>     Frank, Sammy and Dino are all smiling and having another round!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great adaptation of a great story.  The two leads are perfectly cast, and the entire work appears to have been a true labor of love for the film makers.  Any Jane Austen fan would love to have this dvd.
0064407667|5.0|Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire are three very unlucky children. When their parents perished in a fire, they thought life couldn't get any worse. They were wrong. When the three children are sent to live with a distant relative, they had hoped their luck was about to change for the better. Unfortunately, they had reckoned without Count Olaf and his diabolically fiendish scheme to steal the children's inheritance.<br />The Series of Unfortunate Events are books that are very different to the typical image of children's literature. As the narrator says, \\"There is no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and there are very few happy things in the middle.\\" The author uses a dark, dry sense of humor and depending on how you focus upon the book, it can either be depressing or very funny. I personally found it very good, but from reading it I can understand why some parents say it gives their kids nightmares. Some of the things that happen to the three orphans are just plain awful.<br />The characters are both entertaining and interesting, it keeped my intrest and enthusiasm throughout the whole book. Count Olaf is repulsively evil - and the Baudelaires are intelligent, resourceful children who enjoying inventing and reading. No matter what happens, they will always find some solution to their problems, even though more bad things are just around the corner. <br />I recommend this to all kids over the age of 9. Some people call it a JK Rowling wannabe but I disagree. This series is nothing like Harry Potter, nor it as good, but then what children's book could be? I'll definitely be buying more in this wonderfully miserable series.
B000005S6B|4.0|Wow! This is good stuff.  I am a recent convert to Irish music, and as I have always leaned to the more raucous side of music, I thought I would give this a go.  This stuff is great!  I only wish I would have known about this group earlier.  Pour me a pint o' plain ( or two...or three....) and lets kick!
B00004W510|4.0|Releasing an album with alternate takes of the same songs has always been a pet peeve of mine, especially when the difference between the bonus tracks and their official counterparts are minimal (other reviewers will disagree).<BR>That being said, this is a wonderful album, much more earthy than 'Big Pink' (which I feel is superior) but still retaining the classic Band trademarks that would erode over the next few albums. Start with 'Big Pink', then get this one.
B000002UDG|3.0|I finally have listened to the entire c.d and am somewhat disappointed. When I just listened to the &quot;hits&quot; that I actually know and like, is when I liked this album. It really is very disappointing about three quarters of the way through. I always skip over these, tracks 11 through 13 are boring!  and I have never liked &quot;No more Lonely Nights&quot;..that is another Mccartney dud in my opinion.<br />I've always been a huge fan of the Beatles, and like most of the music from Wings'.  Some of the choices as the best here, just aren't the best in my opinion.<br />One is better off listening to Beatles records for his truly best work.  His solo efforts are just not the same.<br />He still is one of the most talented musicians out there..and he did a great job at Superbowl halftime.<br />I did like most of the album  ..it's worth buying for the real hits.
B00004W50T|5.0|Words can't possibly express how beautiful this album is. The nine bonus tracks make it clear that this was one hell of a fruitful peroid for The Band. The inclusion of 'Ferdinand The Imposter' is an absolute masterstroke.
0783107986|5.0|Don't call yourself a history buff until you've seen this-preferably more than once. This is a stunning example of documentary filmaking. I can't even begin to explain the amount of archival footage, newsreels, and interviews that are included in the twenty-six hours of the set. Countless *millions* of feet of Imperial War Museum footage could not be included due to time constraints.  This set shoots for completeness and comes quite close. Watching the whole set is like taking a whirlwind tour of the years 1933-1946. Immense and worth every penny. Of particular importance is a one hour discussion with producer Jeremy Isaacs about the processes that brought us THE WORLD AT WAR.  In an age when revisionist history threatens to overshadow truth, Isaacs goes to great pains to describe the strict criteria used when his team examined historical film and when they went into the editing room to edit interviews.  I very much appreciated the fact that they threw out some (obvious) propaganda film and the fact that the production utilized many foley artists to record sound effects for what were usually silent films.  This knowledge makes the series all the more trustworthy as a historical document.  Another nice extra not included on the VHS version is the 45 minute \\"The Two Deaths of Adolph Hitler\\" -discussing in detail the circumstances surrounding the suicide of this most hated man.  I'll put it this way, I know more about Hitler's teeth and how fire shrinks the human body than I ever thought I would.<br />The interviews are amazing.  Nazi officials, housewives, camp survivors, businessmen, clergy etc. all contribute riveting stories to the overarching narrative.  Many are heartbreaking.  Some are funny.  All are informative.  The European theater and the Pacific theater are covered in great detail with interviews, archival footage, graphics, sound recordings etc.<br />Perhaps the most creepy thing is how the film starts with Olivier's full, brooding voice \\"Down this road the soldiers came.\\"  So begins the best film series in the history of celluloid.  And at the end of it we come back to that single solitary French road where the series began some thirty hours earlier.  In between we've been to hell and back.  <br />Essential.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I think this movie sucked. I'm a fan of the books, and I say Mr. Columbus worried too much about being too faithfull. It had no life of it's own. One example; John Hurt is normally a good character on screen, and he should have been in this, also, especially as the fun character that the wand-seller in the book was. He wasn't. It was one of the most boring scenes in the movie. I only give it two stars because of the Quidditch match.<BR> Thanks Chris, for putting Harry Potter images into my head which are far less stimulating than my own imagination.
0887307280|5.0|This book is a must read for any person considering jumping into the entrepreneurial world and running their own business.  It is also a great book for those that want to be the intrapreneur within a larger corporation.  Before you even start to think about opening a business, read this first.  It will save you from a lot of headaches and confusion.  I wish I had read it first.  This book is now required reading for a Small Business Management college class I teach.
0790729725|5.0|This movie is a wonderful movie exploring the second generation of lower-level Mafia, say Michael Corleone's underlings, though that is perhaps not the most accurate description. These guys certainly aren't as smooth as the Corleones, and not nearly as rich.  <BR>At any rate the fast pace and fabulous directing of this movie really take it from mediocre to superb. Of course, the solid corps of actors, from Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco to especially Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, make for superb characterization. <BR>GOODFELLAS shows a more middle-class Mafia that is often funny and almost surreal, and always interesting.<BR>Highly reccomended.
B000006OS2|3.0|McLintock is a great movie for John Wayne fans.  Lots of fun, the typical John Wayne brawl, plenty of humor.  Chill Wills adds much to the show.  Maureen O'Hara is the shrewish wife who the Duke eventually tames.  I'd give this movie 5 stars except for the quality of the reproduction, which is really poor.  I really love this movie, and if it was reissued with the quality we expect from DVD, I'd probably buy it again.
0792140346|5.0|First off, \\"Primal Fear\\" is an excellent movie, and shows why Richard Gere is such an underrated actor.  His performance as Marty Vail is right on target, and is probably the best work he has done in films.  Laura Linney, Andre Braugher and Frances McDormand were top notch as well.  Even Alfre Woodard's minor role as the judge was brilliant.  And of course, we can't overlook the Oscar-nominated performance of Edward Norton.  I don't remember who won, but Norton should have.  It's an understated, complex performance.  Notice his eyes when he's the soft and gentle Aaron; then notice them again when Roy emerges.  What a stunning turnabout!<br />Now, if you've read William Diehl's book upon which this movie is based, you have the distinct benefit of understanding a lot more about Stampler's background and driving forces.  Unfortunately, the movie could not provide a real motivation for Stampler's murder of the archbishop.  If the movie has shortcoming, it's that it never really explains why Aaron killed him.  And the book has a lot more involving the alternate Roy that also helps deepen the complexity of Aaron/Roy.  The chilling ending, however, in both the book and the movie, still packs a tremendous wallop.  If you liked this movie, read the entire Marty Vail series by Diehl; if you think Aaron was bad in this one, wait till you see what he does in the future!<br />Oh, by the way, Gere and Linney's relationship was one of the most honest I've seen in some while; wish we could have seen more of why they really had \\"split,\\" so to speak.<br />A great movie, though.
B000001DTM|5.0|I became a fan U2 in 2000 and I started with All That You Can't Leave Behind and continued backwards. I have to say, this is the BEST album of their third era (Era 1 was Boy, October, War. Era 2 was The unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Rattle And Hum and Era 3 began with this and continues today). Here is each song rated on a scale of 1-10<BR>1. Zoo Station (10/10) If you see this on ZOOTV live from Sydney, you'll agree with me. This is one of the best songs.<BR>2. Even Better Than The Real Thing (10+/10) This is THE BEST song on here.  I used to hate this song but it and The Fly are the best songs on here.<BR>3. One (9/10) Beautiful. Besides, it's \\"One\\" need I say more?<BR>4. Until The End Of The World (10/10) The live performance on ZooTV is probably the best performance of this I have seen.<BR>5. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses (7/10) I don't really like this song much but I certainly don't hate it, it just isn't one I like to listen to that often.<BR>6. So Cruel (6.5/10) See above<BR>7. The Fly (10+/10) The first single off of Achtung Baby was and still is awesome and the performance on ZooTV is the best performance of this song i've seen.<BR>8. Mysterious Ways (10/10) Another excellent song. Great guitar work by the Edge<BR>9. Trying To Throw Your Arms Around the world (7/10) This is another song that's a little too slow for me and is sort of boring, but by no means is a bad song at all.<BR>10. Ultra Violet (Light My Way) (9/10) Great song!<BR>11. Acrobat (10/10) A masterpiece. You never hear much about this song but I love this song.<BR>12. Love Is Blindness (10/10) Soulful vocals by Bono and is a great closer to an excellent album.
B000059GEH|4.0|&quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot;, produced in 1953 by 20th Century Fox, was the original vehicle for introducing Fox's revolutionary Cinemascope presentation to the public (however, &quot;The Robe&quot; would be the first CinemaScope film actually released) and it showcased a number of Fox's established and rising stars. <br />The main body of the movie follows the lives of three New York models (played by Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Lauren Bacall) in their pursuit of luxury and ease through matrimony. Bacall is the driving force of this team effort, arranging for for them to live in a luxury flat, laying down the ground rules, and singlehandedly maintaining the facade of a sophiscated livestyle. However, Bacall's character tends to judge others by their apparent sophistication. Monroe and Grable characters are less mercenary than Bacall and each has a small character flaw that sometimes leads them astray. Monroe has poor eyesight but refuses to wear her glasses in public which leads to the predictable bumping into people and objects. Grable, on the other hand, is somewhat scatterbrained, usually leading her to miscontrue statements made to her. After initially working together, each character goes into her own vignette, highlighting her path to love, and then they meet up again at the end where of course each of their paths ends in a manner different than the one they had imagined.<br />Considering the mostly lightweight script, the acting is very good on the whole. Although many viewers today would see the movie to watch Marilyn Monroe, it is Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable who give the better performances. Bacall is excellent in her debut in a comedy role and Grable is an absolute delight, dispensing a sometimes skewed view of life that often finds its mark. The supporting cast is also quite excellent, in particular the performances by William Powell, David Wayne, and Cameron Mitchell.<br />There are a number of things in the film that may confuse or at least put off today's audiences. The movie opens with a orchestra playing a composition by Alfred Neuman (who is seen conducting) and then shows a number of panoramic shots throughout the film. It is important to remember that the biggest star of this movie was suppose to be the new Cinemascope presentation and Fox's new High Fidelity sound system. While these scenes wowwed audiences in theaters during the film's initial release, watching the same scenes from a DVD widescreen version on a television set greatly lessens their impact.<br />Nonetheless, if you like the movies of the fifties or a fan of of any of the three principal actors, &quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot; should be one to add to your collection. Today's audiences will find the story a dated one but much of the humor will translates well to the present. This is a very enjoyable movie.
630264366X|5.0|Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer both star in this great film based on the book, \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\\". The story is about Monsignor O'Flaherty, a Vatican official who hides Jews and other World War II escapees from the Nazis, who have just taken over Rome. Peck, as O'Flaherty, masters the protrayal of the Irish monsignor. Plummer, who portrays the Nazi colonel sent to head the Gestapo in Rome, adds passion and vibrance to the screen. As Colonel Herbert Kappler of the SS, Plummer takes the viewers into a realm of unspeakable cruelty, violence, and zeal, qualities worthy of the harsh Nazis. I, as a viewer, strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in WWII, the Vatican, or just a great sit-down feature. This film definetely gets my vote for a \\"thumbs-up.\\"
B00005TT77|5.0|after a friend (who knows i love the beatles) bugged me for the thousandth time to give this album a listen, i finally got it. wow. true, no one does it like the beatles, but these artists have come pretty darn close. there is not one bad song on this soundtrack. my personal favorites are sarah mclachlan's &quot;blackbird&quot;, rufus wainwright's &quot;across the universe&quot;, and nick cave's &quot;let it be&quot;. in my humble opinion, this soundtrack could only be better if it was done by the beatles themselves. excellent and highly recommended.
0393317552|5.0|Interesting new perspective of human history, full of evidence and based on strong arguments. I would highly recomend it to people working in agriculture and research. Its only problem is: too many repetitions about the main points. I can understand long before the repetition number 100, as most people do. (Dont worry anymore Mr. Diamond, we got your points). Besides that style issue, this book will always have a special place in my collection, considering it a must read for anyone interested in world history. Enjoy it!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This is the movie that made me fall in love with Meg Ryan (before I met my fiance!;) <BR>It's funny, the scenery is absolutely beautiful, there's romance, and it ends in love! It can't get any better! Kevin Kliene is hilarious as a frenchman, and Meg Ryan's quirky, cute, spunky personality comes through in her character as Kate. <br />I would recommend this movie to those who love to laugh, love beauty, love the romance....and love to love!<br />FABULOUS MOVIE!
B000056VJ7|5.0|When I grew up in NY in the 70's I was introduced to various groups and music genres. Meatloaf definitely hit the chord and produced such a great album that I had to purchase the CD to replace my LP. I reminisce and I still enjoy the sound thoroughly. Amazing voice, amazing guitar - definitely worth it!
0743201140|5.0|\\"First, Break All the Rules\\" left my wife and me asking, \\"How do you learn your strengths?\\" While buying a copy of \\"First...\\" for my boss, I found \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths.\\"<br />The book is fascinating. The concept of locating and concentrating on using strengths (your own and your employees') rather than fixing their weaknesses is well layed out.<br />Strengths are talents, innate or developed tendencies and abilities which have, through experience, education or training been honed to a level placing the possessor in rarified air in this regard.<br />The book and tape give you a code which serves as a password to take an online test to discover your top 5 strengths of 34 identified by the Gallup Organization.  I would guess three will not really surprise you, two will send you diving back into the book to read more about them.<br />By the way, my wife called the number on the StrengthFinders Website and explained that I bought the book and she, too, would like to take the test.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I have read all the books and then on opening night I saw the movie.  A lot of the story was breezed through missing 2/3's of signifigance.  For instance the loathing of the Dursley's that Harry feels, why the Dursley's hate magical people so much, how extensive Harrys fame is in the magical world.  But the thing that great fantasy movies have which this film lacks is a narative at the begining.  like the scrolling script at the start of Star Wars, or the spoken narative at the start of the Highlander.  That's why I can't wait to get the DVD, so I can see all the cool extra stuff.
0380973650|3.0|This is a well written story but I feel that he coped out. I like the premise of the story, but how can he talk about gods in America and not mention the Judeo / Christian God. Yeah these other gods, Odin, Loki, ..... have been forgotten and not worshipped, but what about the God that is. No matter if you are a Christian, Jew or atheist, this country is built on those Judeo Christian beliefs. Yet not even a page dedicated to God. Too controversial? Too much heat from people who would object to the idea that gods are created by man and not man created by god. I've never been one to think that man is the center of the universe (God help the universe if we are), but I feel Neil could have taken the next step and talk about all the American gods and GOD in general.  None the less, it was a good read, just not a great read. My two cents worth.
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row had an unusual problem with their self titled debut album. When you release a debut album this good there's only one way to go after that. The same \\"problem\\" has been the curse of a handful of other bands as well (Van Halen + GNR to name a few) but unlike all the others Skid Row managed to make the impossible with their second offering, \\"Slave To The Grind\\". Their debut was perfect in every way but their follow up was even beyond that! After that their downhill has been fast, which has not been the case of the other bands sharing the same problem (Van Halen was able to maintain somewhat of their strenght till their last album with Sammy Hagar & GNR didn't flop till Spagetti Incidence). Too bad they just don't make albums like this anymore...
B00005R23X|5.0|This review is about \\"SUPERBIT COLLECTION\\" an outstanding Home Theatre version of Bram Stokers Dracula, a Francis Ford Coppola film.<br />Columbia Pictures has raised the bar on DVD video and sound quality with the new \\"SUPERBIT\\" series movies.  This feature improves the picture by doubling the bit rate digital transfer.  Simply, twice the picture quality of existing DVD transfers.  Also the sound has been enhanced equally in performance.  <br />NOTE: GOODS NEWS - All this can be enjoyed on existing DVD players with noticeable improvements.  BAD NEWS - Its not really bad news its really the \\"BOTTOM LINE NEWS\\" - the \\"SUPERBIT COLLECTION IS FOR YOU IF\\" you have; a Home Theatre, HDTV WideScreen (Enhanced 16:9)w/Component Video, Progressive Scan DVD (480p) w/Component Video & DTS or 5.1 Sound environment.  IF you have this then the \\"SUPERBIT COLLECTION\\" Dracula explodes of the screen!!!!!!<br />Summary: SUPERBIT Dracula directed by Francis Ford Copplola is a very beautiful photographed eerie love story.  With a story line more to the tragedy of Dracula (brillantly played by Gary Oldman)than the viciousness of vampires.  The detailed scenes & colors explode off the screen with this \\"SUPERBIT\\" version film.  The 5.1 sound is crystal clear and adds immensely to the eeriness of this dark gothic horror film.  This SUPERBIT detailed film makes for an unbelievable visual experience.  Coppola does a grand job providing us with an unsusual twist in the story of Dracula.<br />This is the best \\"SUPERBIT\\" transfer so far in the Columbia Pictures Collection.  Just remember, \\"SUPERBIT\\" was developed to give the Home Theatre owner a new improved DVD experience and they have done this with \\"Bram Stokers, Dracula\\".  Enjoy.
B00004TDRD|5.0|One of the best movies ever created. It will grab hold of you from the  opening sequence and hold until the end.An amazing piece of storytelling that will have you rethink that next trip to the beach.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|None of you know what on earth you're talking about. S&amp;M is one of the best concerts I have ever seen. (The audience seemed to enjoy it, too. Hmmm. Wonder why... Maybe because S&amp;M ROCKS!) The orchestra really adds a lot of (for lack of a better word) body to some of Metallica's material- Of Wolf and Man and Sandman being two good examples. I personally do not think that the two new songs (Human and No Leaf Clover) were unwanted rejects from the Load/Re-Load sessions. The sounded similar, but leaned towards the older material. <BR>The picture and sound quality are very good, capturing the feel of the concert. <BR>All in all, this was a good album/DVD. Some of the arrangements fell short of what they could have done (Master of Puppets, Hero of the Day), but the vast majority of them were excellent, which makes S&amp;M well worth owning.
0446608955|5.0|I really liked this book. The author is very good about<br />pulling the reader into the emotional discourse of the<br />story. I have read one too many dry witted well executed<br />books of late. It was a nice change of pace to read a<br />story in which I found an emotional attachment with the<br />characters. It's an old story, with familiar hooks, but it<br />worked for me.
B00004RIV4|3.0|Moloko has the knack to successfully evolve their sound while still sounding like Moloko.  From &quot;Do You Like My Tight Sweater&quot; to &quot;I Am Not A Doctor,&quot; the band made amazing musical strides.  &quot;Things To Make and Do&quot; is an even further departure from their original sound, almost completely abandoning their funky electronic style for live intsrumentation and catchy pop riffs.  Moloko's music is deeper than it has ever been, crafting wonderful tunes that unravel and grow more complex with age.<br />But as much as a departure as it is from their first two releases, &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot; is also a return to the band's roots in a sense.  With &quot;I Am Not A Doctor,&quot; the thirty-second interlude tracks were reduced to a minimum. With &quot;Things to Make and Do,&quot; they are back in full rotation, getting more frequent as the CD wears on, making less room for actual songs.  It is because of this that the CD sort of falls apart at the end, almost completely losing my interest until the remix of &quot;Sing It Back.&quot;  Granted, &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot; has some of the most finely-crafted songs in recent history, and the first three-quarters of the album is a masterpeice, but it can't stick together at the end.  Definitely listen before you buy.
B00005R2IS|3.0|Like Mel Gibson and I like this movie but I didn't see the big changes I expected. Maybe I missed something. It happens.
1567184855|3.0|If you are of the view that death is the end, then this book provides a little food for thought and delivers to the reader an alternative. I can understand how many readers rave about this book - we all want to believe that as individuals we do not reach our final destination and that the road we travel is a journey without a destination.<BR>I was more interested with what this book did not say. For example is the soul only exclusive to humans? I guess so because none of the case stories refered to other occupants of our planet such as dogs, apes or dolphins. One would presume that prior to pre modern man we were subject to a world without souls. I would also have appreciated that subject past lives were validated with historical references - Doctor Newton did not comment upon this, which would of at least provided some validity. Also, like many books of this elk, it fails to deliver a scientific alternative. For example, it is well documented that as the human brain shuts down our vision fades into a tunnel of light and chemicals are released that create a feeling of well being. This view is not considered when describing the story of our soul departing the body. Why? Perhaps it would taint what we prefer to believe.<BR>In conclusion it is an enthralling read, but would be dangerous to be taken at face value. Please balance the easy to believe story with other theories... then believe.
B00005QHSN|3.0|I decided to purchase this CD on a bit of a whim. I was a TTD fan in the early '90's, and so I decided that this \\"new\\" CD may be worth [the money]. <br />In Summary:<BR>I do not regret the purchase, but this album is--- at its worst, trival, maudlin and cluttered.(Tracks 1,3,5,6,14) At its best-- WILDCARD is funky, sparse and passionate.(Tracks 2,7,9,12) I expected WILDCARD to be highly inventive and orginal--after all, it has been several years since TTD/SM's last effort. But what I heard often sounded like bad free verse poetry. TTD/SM's latest effort warrants a listen, but it may leave you feeling less than inspired.
B00005JKJA|5.0|A riveting and innovative meta-cinematic masterpiece! In true postmodern fashion this film brilliantly explores the narcissistic and schizophrenic nature of Hollywood and the individual. <BR>A complex labyrinth of love, confused and reconstructed  identity, naivete, broken dreams, and heartache, Mulholland Drive mirrors the film industry which reflects back to us our own dream worlds. The audience is doubly seduced into becoming riddle-solvers like Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49, and like  Betty (Watts) and Rita (Harring) themselves, trying to make sense out of Drive's ostensibly inexplicable connections, ever-shifting identities and occurrences, and surrealism. Is leaves us wondering: is there such a thing as an authentic or fixed identity? Do demons emerge, as they do for Diane, when we lose ourselves and our \\"true\\" identities within our dream worlds (be they in the movies or in our own imaginations)? Or is the fluidity of identity more appealing and perhaps more real than what we perceive as \\"real\\"? <BR>The two moments in the film that best affirm existential value are the love scene between Betty and Rita, rendered with utmost tenderness, and Del Toro's beautiful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's ballad \\"Crying,\\" during which one is compelled to cry along with Betty and Rita, to cry at the simultaneous beauty and ugliness that marks human existence and the many-sided, multi-layered and contradictory state of the human soul that Drive mirrors so well. <BR>The film's end seduces the audience with a reminder, \\"Silencio...,\\" but Drive seduces us to be anything but silent.
B00005MP58|3.0|This is such a watchable mini-series.  I'm giving 3 stars because my copy of this DVD ... is full screen TV format, eventhough the box says widescreen; and because the image quality is pretty dismal.  This is the only DVD I own that really forced me to fine-tune my TV's contrast, color, and brightness colors to get an acceptable picture (I've tried 2 TVs and 2 DVD players).  In particular, watch the contrast.  Overall, I'm thinking I might've done better by buying the VHS version!
0790751216|4.0|If you're a Clint Eastwood fan, I'd recommend viewing this movie.  If you like movies that are true-to-life and that make some sort of statement, this isn't one I'd recommend.<br />The plot is well developed, although it's the usual David vs. Goliath story.  John Russell gives an excellent performance as Marshall Stockburn, a man who you'll love to hate when the movie is over.  Richard Dysart also does a nice job as the wealthy miner Coy LaHood, bringing out the snobbishness and arrogance of 19th Century aristocrats very well.<br />Eastwood gives his usual performance as the \\"bad\\" good guy.  This time Clint Eastwood plays a man known only as \\"Preacher\\", descriptive only of his name, certainly not of his profession.  I'd compare \\"Preacher\\" to Robin Hood, robbing from the rich (Dysart) and giving back to the poor (Michael Moriarty and others).  If you can handle a little blood and violence, this is a very watchable film, though it's not Eastwood's best, and it's not something I'd let a five-year-old watch.
630179849X|4.0|Howard Hawk's swansong is a good one.  The train robbery at the beginning of the movie is exceptionally done, and it gets this film off to a fast start.  It sags a bit in the middle, but is bolstered by the comic performance of Jack Elam, who is downright hilarious.  Great gunfight at the end.  Supporting actors are OK, but could have been a whole lot better.  You couldn't find two more beautiful women than Jennifer O'Neill and Sherry Lansing, and they certainly add to the dynamics of the movie.<br />Duke, as usual, delivers a fine performance.  The similarities in plot line to El Dorado and Rio Bravo are obvious, but Hawks again does a very nice job.  Jack Elam's character really saves this movie, though, because the middle is downright slow.  Overall, not John Wayne's best, but good.
0792110188|5.0|This is one of the best Westerns ever made.  John Wayne delivers his usual grand performance as Cole Thornton, a hired gun who carries a fearsome reputation.  Robert Mitchum almost upstages him as drunken Sheriff J.P. Harrah, Thornton's old friend.  These two exchange some of the greatest dialogue of all-time, and viewers can see that their relationship dates back a considerable amount of time.  <br />James Caan is terrific as the kid who's a better shot with a knife than a sawed-off shotgun.  \\"I hit the sign, and the sign hit him\\" is one of the funnier parts in the movie and still makes me laugh.  Arthur Hunnicutt is the old geezer whose fiery spirit and witty comments provide a few laughs as well.<br />Ed Asner and Christopher George deliver believable performances as villians Bart Jason and Nelse MacLeod, respectively.  Great heroes, villains, sidekicks, dialogue, humor, and action make El Dorado a film worth seeing.  Besides, it's a John Wayne movie, how can you go wrong?
B00005B4GU|5.0|Had this come out first there would be no talk of &quot;Kid-B&quot;  Amnesiac is a far tighter and less indulgent disc than Kid-A.  I base this on the fact that I'm not disconnected enough to think that Kid-A was all that groundbreaking.  A great disc that did much to improve the stone-soup of post rock, but nowhere near the edge of the edge.
0062515675|1.0|I imagine the author thinking to himself \\"mmmm, I want to write a spiritual, new-age, self-help book full of lessons for leading a life of harmony. I could just list all the things required for a better life - from goal making to meditation to listening to emotionally charged music - especially since they've all already been covered in one book or another.  But that would be way too dull, to just list them. No, I need to write a story, even a novel perhaps, to teach these lessons indirectly. Wait, I have a great idea, how about the story of a lawyer who learns all these lessons from a monk and then recounts them to one of his friends.\\"<br />In the end, he should have stuck with the list.  Because the \\"story\\" (if it can be called such) is so contrived,  unimaginative and shallow. Correction: there isn't even a story -it's just plain boooooring. Which explains why I'm still 3/4 the way through the book and can't finish it, even after 8 weeks (and having picked it up and restarted it half a dozen times).  And I'm somebody who usually loves this genre of book, finishing the Alchemist in a day.<br />Wait, I've just realized WHY he didn't just write down the list - he's saved that for his second book. I wondered when people would jump on the bandwagon to cash in on the spiritual, new-age group.<br />When people ask me about this book, only 2 words come to mind. \\"Fake\\" and \\"Contrived\\". Worst of all, it puts you off reading other books in this genre.<br />There is no depth, and there is no story.
B000002A3T|3.0|I would enjoy this album so much more as a Gilmour solo effor than as a PF record.  It lacks the aura of mystery and discovery that made DSOTM, WYH, and Animals true audio landmarks.  Mason's drumming has really fallen off in the last few years.  It's no wonder that Guy Pratt does most of the work live.  The guitar work is decent.
B00005U1YO|5.0|Awesome! I am utterly confused by the mixed reception this phenominal CD has encountered. ... - All of you! I place this CD right there on the list of instant mainstream classics. Something like...<BR>\\"White Room\\", Orbital's \\"Green Album\\", \\"Screamadelica\\", \\"Leftism\\", \\"Moon Safari\\", and now \\"Come with us\\". It's an instant classic. Club pumping electronic evolution. It's a huge leap forward. So much energy... going in just the right directions. My only concern now is which tracks will be used to try and sell me a new car on TV.<br />Thumbs way up high! - I can't stop listening to this!!!! Top notch lads! Top notch.<br />Behave!
B00000K0DT|5.0|what i mean by this is that this isnt the newest idea.that said,this is an absolutely fantastic,exciting take on the subject.every actor is incredible(yes,even the baldwin guy!)the one who steals the show is mr spacey.but youll have to find out why yourself.like i always say,LEAVE OUT RAPPERS/SINGERS/MODELS and your movie will be 80% better.but i dont think even the curse that is ice-t could have altered my rating for this masterpiece.keyser is the man!!!!!!!!lets start a petition for the return of keyser!!!!!!!!!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Got this disc recently and really enjoy it. I wasn't sure about buying it. But I got the recent LIVE album for the holidays and really liked that. So it motivated me to get this disk. My favorite tracks are: &quot;Packt...&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Pulk-Pull...&quot;. Radiohead continues to surprise -- even if they can be a bit odd in their style. But in my opinion, that's what rock needs to keep it interesting -- someone who doesn't care about what's worked in the past and tries to stretch it in different ways. Radiohead accomplishes that consistently. Buy this.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I thought that this movie was excellent and that everyone, especially Russell Crowe did an excellent job. Its basically about this math genius and how he must battle his mental illness. There are some scarey and tense scenes, so I would reccomend it only for the mature audience. There's been a huge battle in hollywood and how they left some things out of this movie, like John's struggle with homosexuality. <br />I haven't read the book but I definately get the idea that this movie is much cleaner, and much more family appropriate than what is written in the book. Therefore its a movie that's worth seeing.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I just want to comment on how strange it is that many reviewers (even apparently professional ones) don't seem do notice that the plot of Moulin Rouge is a deliberate retelling of La Dame aux camlias or Camille by Dumas. Its part and parcel of this clever movie's dance through clichs and irony and an integral part of the movie's finely woven structure.  Anyway please spare Dumas, I've never heard his famous storyline (used countless times since he wrote it, for instance in Verdi's La Traviata) thrashed as often as in these reviews of Moulin Rouge.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate and Leopold is the perfect date movie. Its not the most original, and may be predictable but its certainly one that's worth seeing. Its about this duke Leopold and how he ends up in the 21st Century, and falls in love with Kate. Anyways in this culture it seems as though women are nothing more than sex objects since there are songs that degrade women and women in movies are often portrayed that way. <br />Its nice to see a movie where women are respected and honored. Kate and Leopold is a movie that's worth checking out, despite some of its minor and objectionable content. This is not just a chick flick, women and men can both learn from Kate and Leopold. That truth, respect, and honor is still something that is valued to this very day.
6300268470|5.0|John Wayne gives probably his most endearing performance as Sheriff John T. Chance.  &quot;T, for trouble&quot; said Angie Dickinson, Wayne's love interest in the film, and one of the few women who was ever able to stand up to Duke on the silver screen.  Dean Martin's performance as &quot;Dude&quot; Chance's drunken deputy, makes me cheer everytime I watch the movie.  Obviously, Walter Brennan's performance as the old cripple is unparalleled, and his comic relief adds to the genuine enjoyment of this movie.  Ricky Nelson is good as the cocky young gunslinger who's out to make a name for himself, although sometimes it seems like his role was simply thrown into the movie to give it more of an appeal to younger viewers.<br />If you want a great western with drama, humor, romance, and action, look no further than Rio Bravo.  I would have to say that this is my favorite John Wayne film, although El Dorado and True Grit both run a close second.  A film for western fans and non-western fans alike.  No larger-than-life heroes, even with the presence of Wayne, but the bad guys sure make you hate them.  Rent it today!
B000056NX5|5.0|I agree with an earlier reviewer that this version is different than the 73 film.  It takes a bit of time to get used to it.  For me it was hard not to see some of the actors / singers from the earlier film, particularly Carl Anderson.  Once I got over the adjustment, I found this production to be simply wonderful.  Because it is shot on a set rather than outdoors, and because of the advances in cameras etc. the viewer is transported into the action.  You see all the subtle facial expressions and interactions between the characters that is simply missing from the technically challenged Jewison film.  There is for example, no \\"day for night\\" film that leaves one barely able to make out Jesus singing the climactic song in the Garden of Gethsemane.  Glen Carter is refreshing as Jesus though I, unlike many others, always liked Ted Neeley's performance. Jerome Pradon presents an engaging Judas.  Chiaphas and Annas are perhaps a bit over the top, yet they are entertaining, as is Pilot.  I still am debating the appropriatness of giving the Romans/Pilot's uniforms a Nazi look, and I think Pilot's Characterization is over stated, but it is very intense, captivating and powerful.  Mary is beautiful and has the greatest voice of any of the Marys to date.  Her presentation of \\"I Don't Know Hot to Love Him,\\" in my opinion the most important song in the musical, is breath taking. In my estimation, I think this version, with modern look and feel, will help make the entire piece more approachable to younger viewers.  It will better communicate the emotions of fear and pain that Christ experienced.  The strength of Superstar has always been the ability to make Jesus more than just an historical figure.  He is someone who was real, as was his sacrifice.  Another valuable perspective is that of Judas.  He is more complex than is traditionally presented.  This Judas is someone who has faults, but they are similar to the everyday faults we all share.  Superstar portrays Judas as committed to the ministry, but not fully committed to Jesus.  He is competitive with Christ to the point that he thinks he can force his hand if Christ is arrested.  The motivations for Judas's betrayal are akin to subtle self centeredness that most of us battle on a regular basis, and they stem from his ego rather than his greed. This production best conveys to youth today some sense of what these real people actually felt and how they experienced life.  A few years ago, I showed the 73 film to a youth group.  They were so turned off by the very obvious 70's characterizations, costumes and choreography, that they laughed at some of the most powerful and intense moments. No one does that with this version.  The 39 lashes is most powerful as is the \\"Could We Start Again\\" seqence.  Again the voices from top to bottom are top notch without sounding too theatrical/formal which I have found to be distracting in other recent recordings.  Alas, I simply find this production to be, in the words of one of the Pharisees, \\"top of the pole.\\"
B00005BCOL|5.0|This movie is so great! Even if there aren't any men in it, that doesn't matter. Joan Crawford as the scheming Crystal is so funny! This movie really shows how women are, even in today's time. It has all the emotions in it, love, hate, revenge...........<br />I highly recommend this to any one!
0930289528|5.0|An important piece of literature, even if its technically a comic book. The story of a lone Anarchist bent on bringing a Fascist government to its knees with great success. V is a hero to be idolized. Though we boast that we Americans live in a free country.... V shows us that the only true freedom is in anarchy, not chaos, or rulership, and that we must take control of our own lives and not give such a treasure to others for control.
B000002L5P|5.0|The Smiths were the best musical moment of the 1980s -- I know, I lived through them.  This album is probably my favourite, and must be in the canon of amazing debuts: nothing like it before, and nothing since.  For one thing, there was the cover art.  At at time when most bands favoured monochromatic &quot;new wave&quot; dots and blobs, the covers were sober, nostalgic, personal and iconic.  Crushingly vivid colours and their signature style made it exciting just to *see* their albums.  In this case, the murky photo of Joe Dellesandro gives a hint of the Morrissey world view and aestheticism, but it's ambiguous and out of context, meaning that the Smiths became very hard to &quot;brand.&quot;<br />But of course the appeal of this record came from its musical beauty.  Morrissey's plangent, steady voice was astonishing, but moreso were his lyrics.  &quot;I dreamt about you last night, and I fell out of bed twice/ you can pin and mount me, like a butterfly.&quot;  Reel Around the Fountain still gives me goosebumps -- it's an anthem which evokes not just the usual teen angst, but what is unusual, and sad, and real about it as well.<br />I love every track, but most of all its wonderful beginning, the glorious insouciance of &quot;Hand In Glove,&quot; and the mordant &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot; which evokes the grisly Moors Murders as a foundation myth for Mancusian angst, but also for all of us who were trying to sort out the sixties of our childhoods in the early eighties.  Morrissey &amp; Marr, along with Squeeze, were the poets of the eighties, and this cd will give you a rich sense of its virtues, rather than the gelled and synthesised excess most people know.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Why do people always have to analyze everything? Forrest Gump is a feel good movie, simple as that. And that's what it makes you do, feel good. You feel down, throw Forrest in. Chances are, that bad day at work, or that 20 bucks you lost the other day, won't seem that bad anymore. Forrest Gump is a great, simple movie. Easy as that.
B00000253N|5.0|If you don't know, then find out for yourself.  B on the T is about as essential as the air you need in order to breathe.  Its futile to try and explain such a beautiful collection of songs - get this disc and be enlightened.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|It's great music to listen to when you want to replay the movie scenes in your mind. The music really reflects the action in the movie. My complaint lies with the cover. After having spent twice the amount, as compared to an ordinary CD, I thought some  kind of artwork from the film will be featured on the cover. The red, mock-leather cover is too plain.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Is this a low budget horror flick with cheesy special effects? Oh yeah. Is this a scary (and thus fun) movie? Well let me put it this way, the 1st time I put in the DVD after the 1st 45 minutes or so my wife fled the room saying it was just tooo creepy! A week later I was able to play it again but my wife insisted that all the lights in the room had to be on. The story puts the hook in you pretty quickly. I will say that if supernatural is not your bag then skip this movie. The ending is rather abrupt but does make sense after you think about it. There was some fine cinematography work done in this movie. The old scratchy record playing the song Jeepers Creepers will stay with you a long time after viewing this movie, even make your skin crawl much like the line &quot;have you checked the children?&quot; stayed with people after seeing the movie When A Stranger Calls. As an added benefit Gina Philps is really a little hottie, even if you don't like the movie if you are a breathing, non-vision impaired guy you will appreciate checking her out, she's a babe in waiting. She could make some more low budget slasher flicks and become the new Jamie Lee Curtis/Slasher Queen. Oh yeah...
B0000203YT|2.0|**  No, not another a chick flick, February 7, 2002 <BR>Revived: Antoine Napolitan from ,mass<BR>   Shakespeare in Love  was an okay movie.   The parts I didn't were when the Queen didn't let Violate be with Shakespeare.   Also when they were going to arrest him for nothing.     I wouldn't go to see this movie in theaters.  I might not even rent it, but if it was on television or on a movie channel I probably would watch it.   I don't think its fiction on his life I think its real.  Also I like the fact that he wrote most of his stories  were about his life.
B00003CXXP|5.0|If you're a fan of Haley then you'll love this movie.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I watched her show on HBO and thought it was completely amazing.  I immediately went to ticketmaster and ordered tickets for her show in Atlantic City which was ten thousand times better then the HBO showing.  She is an awesome dancer and she could not have had a cooler stage.  And though I LOVE her to death, it is so apparent that she is lip syncing throughout the entire performance...Anyway, the DVD is a must have regardless of whether or not she is singing.. :)
0783222475|5.0|This is probably the best movie I've ever seen.It has everything you want to see in a movie (adventure,romance,and heart racing experiences.)I nearly jumped from my seat watching this movie. This is a must see and that is why I gave this movie 5 stars.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Amazing...I went to see it in the theature, then I saw it on video, and every time it left me breathless.  The speacle effects are REALLY high-level, (as I'm sure you've heard already,) The filming is beautifull, and the music is really nice.  If you haven't seen it already I'm sure you should.  Add this one to your collection, you might be in the mood to see it sometime.  <BR>-love story-<BR>sorry, lousy, un-realistick, and un-believable. It's the type that you prity much yell at the movie becuase it just messes up ALL THE TIME! it's the kind of romance that's sort-of unsatisfying.  <BR>     HOWEVER!  the movie is very... for the lack of a better word, the sence of reality is definently there.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a must for anyone how liked a few of Madonna's songs but didn't buy the original albums.  This album picks up were the immaculate collection leaves off.  It has material from Erotica, Bedtime Stories, Evita, Ray Of Light, and Music.  All of these albums are  good but she has selected the biggest hits for this package.
0446525537|4.0|Normally I do not like love stories, but this novel is not like others love stories. There is some suspense and humour in it, which makes it interesting. The end is quite sad, but this shows quite well that even when you finally reached happiness you cannot be sure that you stay happy. So the book makes you think about life in general and your life in specific. The long descriptions of some people, houses or so are quite boring I think. Nevertheless, it is a very good book for young people, the best book I ever read in school.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Well - it's good to see that some of you have caught on.  Mr. Verlaine would be very happy.  The album may get it's fair share of critical acclaim, but that just guarantees backlash.  I say - just listen to the music, that's all.  Bought the album early last fall.  Then I listened to it.  And listened to it.  And listened to it.  In fact I am still listening to it.  Saw these guys last September.  Great show.  Julian has a knack for the stage, that's for sure.  You really should see them live to get the whole effect (preferrably in a smaller venue, like I did).  The vibe that these guys give off is so truly honest-to-god sloppy rock 'n roll, I couldn't stop smiling in ecstacy.  I hope they don't let detractors bring them down because they are one of the only bands that is doing something memorable for the genre while continually getting great exposure -- keep it up! (Cole, your brother is a genius!)  I can't wait for their second album (of which NME says they have already written 4 songs).  Until then, &quot;Can't you see I'm trying....&quot;
B00005RFAI|3.0|I heard &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; on an NBA commercial, and a, usually, reliable reference said that this was a great album. So, I went out and bought it on a cursory listen only. Should have listened more carefully.<br />The album has some good songs, but suffers from severe personality disorder. Is it a dance mix (&quot;Get the Party Started&quot;)? An R&amp;B meets alternative exploratory (&quot;Goin' to California&quot;)? Or is it just an immature collection of whines(&quot;Lonely Girl&quot;)?<br />If you can borrow the album from someone else, it's worth a listen. Maybe you can figure out whether Pink wants to be Alanis Morrissette, Janis Joplin (I swear the bit on &quot;Missundastood&quot; sounds just like her), or Brittney Spears.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This is more of a live review but I had to write something after seeing Ryan Adams in Sydney. If I can't convince you to at least try &quot;Gold&quot;, well, I guess you have no musical soul, but if you have a passion for music, this is your man.<br />RYAN ADAMS AT THE METRO, SYDNEY 22ND JAN, 2002.<br />Very rarely you attend a concert that comes under the heading of \\"Life affirming\\". This was one of those nights. It was that special.<br />I was lucky enough to spend most of October in the United States. Every magazine I picked up seemed to have a Ryan Adams story. \\"Alt rock bad boy/writer who saved Elton John/the man reinventing the 70's songbook\\". There seemed to be plenty of slants, but nothing captured the key element of Ryan Adams, the live performer.<br />The gig had been sold out for a week, as word finally reached Sydneysiders that this could be something very special. It was. From the moment he walked onto the stage announcing \\"this is our first gig of the year\\", there was an intensity that is missing from orchestrated, follow the set list, play by numbers rock'n'roll.<br />Opening with \\"Somehow, Someday\\", there was real electricity in the air. With a band that could adjust to every nuance and change of direction, songs took on hues missing from their recorded counterparts. It soon became obvious that this wasn't a night about ticking off which songs were played, but a total experience.<br />It's pointless trying to recall highlights, because for three hours, Ryan Adams grabbed hold of every heart in the room, and refused to let go. He told stories, ran us through TV pop culture, introduced the band, dealt beautifully with a call for \\"Summer of `69\\" and sang sons of heartbreak and songs of passion. This was music that really mattered. \\"Nobody Girl\\" built in intensity until it felt as if the Metro would burst. 1 000 souls all soaring to unchartered heights. It exploded as the band joined in, leaving those 1 000 souls enriched and exhausted.<br />What can yousay about a show and an artist that presents you with an acoustic and full band version of \\"New York, New York\\"? One of the many memorable moments was certainly Ryan having to stop the acoustic version as he forgot the words at the start of the third verse. It simply added to the feeling that this was a real performer delivering a very genuine performance. A stuff up in \\"Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues\\" only further enhanced his standing with the audience. It was this ragged glory that was so enticing, so captivating and so compelling. Watching Ryan Adams live is like going surfing. There's the incredible sense of anticipation, the frenzied paddling for some huge wave, and the release of total exhilaration as you slide down the face of the wave, dissolving into ecstasy at the critical moment. That's Ryan Adams live.<br />Trying to recapture the atmosphere is impossible. Trying to convince someone they've missed the show of a lifetime is pointless. You just have to hope those poor people will have some future opportunity to make amends. One small measure of the man's ability to understand the Australian character was his decision to shout the packed front rows all a beer. Realising that nobody there was able to make it the bar (and noone was going to willingly surrender those hard won spots), he got the band to find 10 dozen beers and distribute them to the packed front rows. A simple gesture guaranteed to win him adoration in Australia.<br />This was a very special night. It's fair to say that this is the reason that rock'n'roll still matters to me 35 years after entering Sydney Stadium to see The Easybeats. It still retains the power to move me to the very core of my being. Concert of the year? Almost certainly, because whatever tops it will have to be earth shattering in its intensity, scope and power. Ryan Adams is a very special talent. They are very rare. You simply must grab every opportunity to see, hear and experience this life affirming rock'n'roll.
B00005QB42|5.0|&quot;My favorite CD to do yoga to is Deva Premal's 'The Essence'. As a matter of fact I drive my teacher crazy because it's the only one I want to listen to! I can't wait for the new one to come out!&quot;  <br />Cher, Academy Award Winning Actress
B00005YTFG|4.0|Not only are the visuals beautifuly presented, the two main stars are great on the eyes. Nicole Kidman looks and sounds spectacular, the same can be said for Ewan Mcgregor who has a great boyish charm about him. The chemistry between the stars is wonderful and the songs make you want to get up and dance. Overall a very enterntaining and beautiful love story. Im sure I will be watching it numerous times.
B00003CXXI|5.0|See it once , see it many times.. Awsome entertainment movie for the whole family. Enjoy !!
B000002KD5|4.0|Ah, the first album by the \\"Fabulous Five.\\" Some call it the \\"White Fleetwood Mac Album.\\" This one is one of their best, and I'm sure that many fans agree with me. Many classics stemmed from this album. I'll do a song-by-song breakdown:<br />1. \\"Monday Morning\\": In my opinion, a classic Buckingham tune. The lyrics are average, but the melody and hook are amazing. Classic rock. 5/5<BR>2. \\"Warm Ways\\": This is one of Mcvie's best. Great words and melody. The title is very appropriate because the song gives you the feeling of your loved one wrapping you up in his or her arms and you feel all warm inside. I can't explain it any better than that. 5/5<BR>3. \\"Blue Letter\\": One of my favorites. Just a good, solid song with great vocals from Buckingham. 5/5<BR>4. \\"Rhiannon\\": This is the song everyone recognizes first from this album and ranks up in my top 3 Stevie songs (Also my favorite song on this album). Wonderful lyrics which are about a Welsh witch (Stevie said this is what the song was about an the bands \\"Live 1980\\" album). This is also our first glimpse into Stevie's witchy persona and is a good example of it. I have to complain about the album version of this song because Stevie is so tame on it. I wish she sang it on the album like she did in the bands live show in the 70s and early 80s (you fans know what I'm talking about! It truly leaves you spell bound). Still this song gets a 5/5.<BR>5. \\"Over My Head\\": This was the first single from the album and was a top 20 hit. It's nothing special in my opinion. However, it is good. I like the simile used in the song (\\"Your mood is like a circus wheel. You're changing all the time.\\"). I like the instruments, too. 4/5<BR>6. \\"Crystal\\": This one is WONDERFUL. A ballad sung beautifully by lovers, at the time, Buckingham and Nicks. I get the feeling that this song was something left over from the Buckingham/Nicks era. Stevie wrote this song, but Lindsay sings more on it. Good tune. 5/5<BR>7. \\"Say You Love Me\\": Another classic FMsong and another top 20 hit. Plain and simple, but catchy pop. 5/5<BR>8. \\"Landslide\\": My second favorite from the album. So touching. The wonderful guitar melody from Buckingham and Stevie's soft soulful vocals blend so well. I know no one who doesn't know this song. Even the Smashing Pumpkins re-made the song (and ruined it!). 5/5<BR>9. \\"World Turning\\": My least favorite. Good drumming from Mick but that's about it. 3/5<BR>10. \\"Sugar Daddy\\": Another song from Christine. One of her weaker songs altogether. I think the lyrics are funny. It's slightly catchy, and you can dance to it. It's okay. 3/5<BR>11. \\"I'm So Afraid\\": My third favorite from the album. Everything in this song works so well and is in the right place from Mick's drumming to Lindsay's guitars (and John's) and his vocals. I wonder if this song is autobiographical. This is a haunting song, and it is always done so well in their live shows. 5/5<br />There you have it, the first Fleetwood Mac album from the \\"Fabulous Five.\\" An album that very successfully blends pop and rock elements with unique touches of Fleetwood Mac's own. A classic album that will go down in history. But, little did we know what was yet to come...
B00005R87Q|2.0|This movie is [not good], Highly over-rated.  Let me tell you why I say this:<BR>1- THE ACTING IS [not good]<BR>2- The creativity and film work is at its best an amature level<BR>3- The story is [not good]<BR>The only good part about this movie is it has some nice cars to look at.  So my advice is just go find yourself a website with some nice cars and there you go, no need to put yourself through this [movie].
B0000029DD|5.0|Premature death can add a certain glow to an artist's output, but this is as good a debut as you will hear. There is so much<BR>fakery in pop or rock or whatever it is that the sincerity Jeff Buckley injects into GRACE is thoroughly refreshing and probably<BR>unfashionable.  <br />Buckley was a gifted and subtle guitar player, a fine songwriter (on this evidence, anyway) and a freakish singer. On<BR>'Corpus Christi Carol' he really does sing like an angel; on the title track he screams with the best of them, hitting notes no man has a right to hit. On 'Mojo Pin' (my fave) he does both. Incredibly, he could actually sing like this live.<BR> <BR>A tight band (Matt Johnson is outstanding on drums), and interesting arrangements round off a superb first effort which would have been hard to top had he ever got the chance. Get it.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the best pop-rock album ever made in the history of music. Period. There is nothing better.
B000000Y87|5.0|Im wasting my time trying to write a review of this.  I copied it because id heard so much about it and well im not at all dissapointed.  <BR>Someone said its great while studying or taking coffee in the morning.  Well i cant concentrate on anything else but the music but definately early morning jazz.<br />Oh get Waltz for Debby too its just like disc 2.<BR>Anyone who likes jazz should have these 2 Its just that simple.  Listen to it and decide for yourself... describing it is fruitless...there are no words. Just 3 musicians playing as one telepathically.
B00003CX96|5.0|A film for all ages and times. It is about the American dream, defined through despair, failure,perserverance, and ultimately, on a short circular track, redemption. This is a classic American tale masquerading as a bicycle racing movie. Bike racing? Yup, and you'll be riveted by every turn of the pedal because you will care for and form a bond with the characters riding on the bikes. They are all of us, on anyday, in good times and bad. This movie is America defined.
B000002JSN|5.0|I had a very interesting, very \\"awakening\\" experience while \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" was blasting in the background, and it has become one of my favorite songs of all time and unarguably the best hard-rock song ever. Led Zeppelin certainly know how to add a \\"sexual charge\\" to their music -- it's like they're making love to every note, every guitar strum, hell, every second they're making music. Damn this is good.
0446677450|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. Nice easy to read style. Top quality content and subject matter. Now reading the other books in this series. GREAT STUFF....
B00005U1YO|5.0|I am a big Chems fan, and this cd is their best by far. It seems as though they can do no wrong. The first song (Come with us) starts out with a bang and prepares you for a thrilling cd. &quot;It began in Afrika&quot; although many were not 2 fond of this song, I loved it, and it still gets me dancin' everytime I hear it. &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; is a great thumpin' song that is an obvious standout in the crowd. &quot;Star Guitar&quot; was the main reason I bought this cd. &quot;Hoops&quot; was a definate new style for the Chems, and it looks good on them, providing plenty of great beats over a great tune. &quot;My Elastic Eye&quot; although my least favorite song, was great. &quot;The State we're in&quot; was another song with vocals by Beth Orton, and much like the other ones she did, doesn't dissapoint. &quot;Denmark&quot; is probably my favorite song on this whole cd. It takes you to the edge of dance music, and pushes you off. &quot;Pioneer Skies&quot; is a very creative song that shows what variety The Chems show. And the grand finale &quot;The Test&quot; with vocals by Richard Ashcroft. This song ends off, a great ending song to a great cd. This cd should be bought by anyone who loves the dance/house/techno genre, and even for those of you who don't, pick this cd up, I know you won't be dissapointed. :D
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour is definitely the Beatles' masterpiece. All of their other albums (except for Abbey Road) have some inferior or throw-away tracks, but this one is perfect. It's so underrated!! ....
B0000073BG|5.0|Rock critics are quick to dismiss the progressive era as contrived and full of excess. They are wrong, and the best example of progressive genius is Renaissance's Scheherazade and Other Stories. I believe this is one of the best rock records of all time, although it will never be acknowledged as such.<BR>The music is absolutely stunning (with the exception of &quot;A Trip to the Fair&quot;). On side one, &quot;Ocean Gypsy&quot; ranks among Renaissance's best pieces, but it is side two that defines this album. The Scheherazade suite is one of the highlights of rock history, featuring gorgeous melodies and fabulous musicianship as it retells the Scheherazade legend. Aficionados of classical music will also appreciate the album.<BR>Renaissance was a staple of progressive radio in New York City, and deservedly so. I have introduced my kids to the band's music, and they love it too.<BR>Buy this album; you will love it.
0064407667|5.0|These books are so magical and really are grabbers, I am a [age] but i know [age] year-olds that LOVE these books, they really make sense and are really enjoyable to read. Lemony Snicket does a great job.  I have read all 8 books and can't wait for the 9th to come out in June. Read these books! You won't regret it!
B00005RHGK|5.0|I got this DVD as a gift from my sister. She said \\"Pop in this movie. Its great. It scared the hell out of me.\\" <br />I had heard about it on entertainment sites and horror sites and found it was getting some decent reviews. <br />I finally, after a couple of days, popped in the DVD.  An hour and a half later I found my new favorite horror movie!<br />The movie is loaded with suspense.  The movie itself kept me interested at all times. The old JEEPERS CREEPERS song, that played on the radio, was very spine-tingling (spelling??).<br />The Creeper is a conficing evil being. He is truly, \\"creepy\\" and evil. What is he? a demon? gargoyle? a monster? what? I loved how the director slowly reveled the Creeper and the features about him alittle bit at a time, as the movie moved on. If moma's boy Jason Voorhees or Freddy Kruegar (who are laughable and very unbelievable) took one look at the Creeper, they'd [wet] their pants. <br />The ending shocked me and was very scary. 100 times better than Scream and the other teen horror hyped movies. I would put it up there with HALLOWEEN and THE EXORCIST, definately.
B00005V0X5|5.0|this is, hands down, one of the greatest metal albums of all time.<br />the new remastering work is amazing. it's awesome. this is what you've been waiting for people... if you  get this new remastered album, you will not regret it. i can say that confidently.<br />get it. be amazed.<br />thanks DETH!!!
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney doesn't really tread any new water with this third outing, but it is a somewhat pleasant experience. The stand out tracks on this CD are \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". It is not only her best ballad, but her best song she's done overall. The other best song on here is a song called \\"Cinderella\\". It's very catchy and fun. The big collaboration with beau Justin Timberlake was a big bore and dud. Sounded like a leftover from an N'Sync song. Decent.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Having seen the trailer for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", I thought I knew what I was walking into when I sat down in the movie theater. Little did I know how amazed and moved I would be. The movie is based on the truely extraordinary life of a math genius who because of the love and caring of special people around him, and his stubborn will to survive, overcame and triumphed over great odds. Russell Crowe playing John Nash was convincingly brilliant and noble. He deserves another Oscar. And Jennifer Connelly as his loving wife Alicia gave a strong and multi-layered performance. And the musical score added the extra mystery that surrounded the film. All of the secondary characters, especially John Nash's roommate at Princeton, were quite wonderful. And personally, having had to deal with this terrible problem for the last decade, I can only say that it is unimaginable that a better movie could have been made about living with this devasting illness. Bravo Ron Howard!
0679746048|5.0|Sanity is something most people cling to like a security blanket.  They think the &quot;insane&quot; people of the world don't cling to it also, but in the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, you see that she does.<br />All she wanted was to be a normal girl, but when normality abandoned her, she had to check herself into McLean hospital to figure out how to regain it.  After spending a year and a half in the hospital, she left with no great advice to give on how to live her life or with a realization of what the meaning of life is.  This doesn't mean that she learned nothing.  Far from that.  She learned more than almost anyone else did.<br />She learned how to survive.  Not how to live, but how to survive.  No one can be taught in a hospital about how to live, because the whole essence of the hospital prevents the person from living their life.<br />When the money ran out, she was kicked out of the hospital.  This, sadly, is how the system works.  Of course, she'd only expected to be in there for a couple of weeks.  Weeks had turned into months and months into years, and by the time she was released, she thought she was a forever patient.<br />She made friends with the other members of the ward, because all of them had been doomed to longer than expected stays.  They were a tight group.  A group of people who cared for one another, took care of one another, but also aggrivated each other in so many ways.<br />I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br />1.)  I loved the movie it was based on.  It's a bit different.  Some of the scenes are the same, and if you've already seen the movie, you'll be picturing the characters doing certain things as you read about them in the book.<br />2.)  Susanna was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is my diagnosis.  I wanted to see how she (at the same age) handled the diagnosis.  I see many similarities in the diagnosis, as well as differences.  I also saw many differences/similarities in our psych hospital experiences.<br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written.  I am glad that Susanna decided to share her story with everyone.  Maybe a book like this will better help more people to understand mental illness.
B000001ESP|5.0|Pretty much everything you hear on this album is what they did on stage, keyboards and all, with just the three of them.  Brilliant stuff, well before the MIDI invasion that has long since removed the human element from everything aside from the initial construction of modern electronic music.<br />This album is a studio refinement of 3 strong players playing together, each a master of his instrument and sincere in the desire to explore, enjoy and entertain.  Well worth the price.<br />I read of people referring to 'Vital Signs' as 'reggae' and I just can't laugh hard enough!  It has an up-beat guitar rhythm hook in the intro, but has nothing whatsoever to do with the intent or feel of Reggae.  Whatever!<br />Geddy's voice?  I hated it at first years ago and have loved it ever since.  Nerdy?  Sort of, in a very cool way!  A crotch-grabbing heavy-metal howler just wouldn't work here.  Neal Peart's lyrics  on this one are especially colorful and interesting, a rarity in this age of macho chest-beating thunder-chunk nonsense.<br />Beware, this album will make an air-drummer out of even the most severely rhythmically-impaired!<br />Enjoy.
B0000048TX|5.0|Really, this is a GREAT movie, though not for the faint of heart.  Stallone is, well, Stallone in his prime..ripling muscles and rock solid grit.  The real gem performance is turned in by John Lithgow, who is the best darn evil villain I have ever seen on film.  Lithgow, now known for the comedy \\"Third Rock...\\" is quite the composite of ultimate evil.  Great movie for a boring rainy or snowy day, but not really one to view with the young ones.  Teens are probably OK with this film but the magnitude of the violence is pretty high, though the blood, guts and gore are about average.  I have owned this movie for years and it is definitely on my MUST OWN list.

0786915749|5.0|So at this point there are 167 other reviews of this book on Amazon, why should you read this one?  Simple, I'll give you the straight dope on it.<br />To start, the three Dragonlance Chronicles (I'm reviewing them together) are a strongly recommended read.  I've read many of the other reviews here and there is commonly reference to how this book is clichéd, how it \\"stole\\" from Tolkien, and most popularly, how the characters are either amazing or flat.  Permit me to address these concerns...<br />This is a standard fantasy epic.  A group of heroes, diverse in skill and personality, meet and decide to face the growing evil in the world.  They eventually find out they are among the chosen and meet the most powerful beings in the land, and inevitably face the evil and defeat it.  To say this is cliché is in itself cliché.  If you are a fantasy reader you are obviously not averse to authors adopting conventions, any more than fans of other \\"formula\\" genres are (Crime, Law, Romance, etc).  It's like giving a poor review to a car because the engineers had the lack of creativity to give it four wheels and to put the steering wheel on the same side as all the other cars.<br />As far as stealing from Tolkien, I have this for you: whatever.  Tolkien defined a genre and others have followed in his footsteps (hence the reason it is a genre).  Keep in mind that Tolkien didn't exactly invent elves and goblins either, but adapted and shaped them to his own purposes.  While this trilogy isn't as much of a milieu piece as Lord of the Rings, it has other strengths.  As far as exploring the environment itself, you can see the visible hooks throughout the series for the other (future) books to latch onto.  There are now over 100 if you really want to explore the world of Krynn.<br />And finally we come to the characters.  I strive to be objective of others opinions, but to say these characters are flat is ludicrous.  The depth these authors have achieved is that of long books with one or two characters, not the 6+ this one utilizes.  Are the characters themselves cliché?  Yes.  Keep in mind this world is defined by and for a role-playing game, where you are given finite choices of roles to play.  To step outside those roles would cause dissention among both readers and players.  However, instead of begrudging these boundaries, the authors revel within them.  We find the conflict of the characters themselves with these roles, something rarely seen in this genre.  Sturm, the knight, is bound by a code and not only do we see the conflict of a rigid code with a changing world as we would expect, but we see the struggle of the character himself with his beliefs.  I won't go through each character but suffice it to say that several are explored in depth, especially Weis' \\"signature\\" (or for those more cynical, \\"franchise\\") character Raistlin.  For most, we find their strengths, weaknesses, fears, loves and hatreds.  To ask more is a little much I would say.<br />The above points are valid discussions, but most people seem to miss the real strength of this series, perhaps because they were too concerned about evaluating its \\"quality\\".  To put it plainly, its fun!  I read these books soon after they came out in the mid-80's, and have just re-read them, finding myself surprised to find they were as enjoyable now as they were then.  On top of the character development, we have lots of action in various environments; we have an appropriate amount of comic relief that is well spaced and spread among a few characters.  We follow the characters through times of happiness and times of horror.  I'll make no claims at this point of how good or bad Weis and Hickman are as writers, but I can say they know how to tell a story.<br />So the short and sweet of it is: read the books and enjoy them.  If you aren't so overly concerned with ranking them and evaluating them (as you should never be on a first reading), just follow the tale as the authors spin it for you.I can say that you will definitely have fun if you let yourself.  I would give it 4.5 stars, but that isn't an option, so I'll round it up to 5.

B00003CXFU|4.0|Erin Brocovich made me cry i'll addmit it. But There was so much language and revieling clothing it made it less enjoyable then could be. Wile it presented talented acting and some good morals on the whole it was about a woman who used her body (cleavage mostley) to get were she got in life.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Helen Folasade Adu has been my favorite singer since \\"Smooth Operator.\\" Hearing the disc is like a confirmation of what I already know; thousands of fans exhibiting the same joy that I hold for this dear, unassuming yet vibrant woman. There are no complaints on any of the tracks. The lady's smoky vocals and sensual intonations are not lost in the crowd, and the band's pristine execution of the music is flawless. Curses to Amazon.com for only allowing me to give this album five stars. Fifty is more like it. I love you Sade, and I love the part you've played in the soundtrack of my life...and judging from the exhuberant crowd on the album, I am not alone. You will not be sorry you bought this album. If you have one live concert CD in your collection, this is the one.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Oops!...I Did It Again is perhaps the best album that Britney Spears has released to date. I'm saying this because I'm a fan of music, and not just a Britney fan.<br />Rock on Britney!!
0452282152|5.0|I just finished the book this morning after reading much of the night.  My own process connected perfectly with the empathy of the characters, their blights, dreams, fears, and the resoltion of what happened to them.  That empathy hit me in a place where I wept for myself and the characters of the book.
B00005U1YO|3.0|it's been a steady slide downhill from &quot;exit planet dust&quot;, if you ask me. they've gotten progressively into the bland world of electronica and sound like some terrible trance knock-off rather than kings of big beat. those first few years, i was sure the chems could do no wrong. after listening to &quot;surrender&quot; and now &quot;come with us&quot;, i'm not sure they can do anything right.
B000001DYA|4.0|Vincebus Eruptum , (as the title seems to suggest), remains one of the most raw and uncompromising debuts in rock history. This was also crudely recorded, giving the band the sound of a reckless garage band. With their blues-based sound, the band at this stage should be considered a naive version of Cream or the Jimi Hendrix Expereince, because their songs were unrefined. However, they were heavier and more extreme than anyone that had come before, featuring uncontrollable acid-guitar feedback, massive bass lines, and the drumming of a burning spastic. Rock Me Baby is one of the loudest covers of slow blues in history, while Peterson's intense Doctor Please, and the acid-dazed Second Time Around both rock loud and hard with unparalleled energy. Their blazing cover of Eddie Cochran's Summertime Blues somewhat surprisingly made #14 on the pop charts. Like Steppenwolf, Vanilla Fudge and Iron Butterfly, this group is overlooked today, but one must remember they were a year before Zeppelin, and a full two years before Black Sabbath. For fans of heavy metal, this is an essential purchase.
B000001FS3|5.0|I find myself very fortunate to have seen The Joshua Tree tour in November of 1987. I really liked the music then but I had no idea what I was headed for at the Tarrant County Convention center in Fort Worth, Texas. Bullet the Blue Sky was one of the most powerful live performances I have ever seen and I've seen lots of them since 1979.  The show had so much power that afterwards it didn't even seem to end.  People were singing and still smiling even an hour after the concert.<br />However I guess this is a review on the album, not the concert. Not only does it sound good, but it really flows well. This band really put a lot of emotions into this recording and it not only shows, but it reaches out and grabs the listener which was proven once again with the powerful super bowl performance.<br />The first three tunes are really great, but the rest of the pack really solidify this as a phenominal listening experience that I don't think will ever get old. Obviously I am not the only one that had my emotions tapped by the looks of all of these other reviewers.
B000002I2M|4.0|L.A. Woman, the last of the Doors releases with Morrison, relied even more on blues than it's predecessor. Morrison's voice occasionally sounds worn, but the lyrical quality is undiminished. The hits on the album were Love Her Madly(#11) and Riders on the Storm(#14). The former was written by Krieger, and was one of the most well arranged short singles the Doors ever made. Some of the straight blues seems common in places, (both tracks 3 and 4 have the same key and progression,) but the simpler lyrics and burning slide guitar make them enjoyable enough. The title track has become something of a car-cruising anthem with its regular classic rock radio airplay, featuring a strong and steady rhythm section led by Densmore. The Changeling was also effective, being in a similar style to Peace Frog, with the lyrics more down to earth and Manzarek's keyboard to the fore. L'America and Hyacinth House were also admirable, with the former, a mysterious rocker with the latter being melodious and melancholy. The Wasp was perhaps a bit pretentious, though the musicians made a creative backdrop for Morrison's poetry. The album ends with the hit Riders on the Storm, which featured impressive jazz improvisation, and occasional, but effective Morrison lines. This writer sees L.A. Woman as the Doors third best album. This and the rest of the Doors first six studio albums are recommended.
6305538018|3.0|&quot;eXistenZ&quot; uses virtual reality as a loophole and an excuse to whittle its commitment to the viewer down to nothing. It raises questions and then pretends it didn't. It begins a philosophical parable and ends a horror show (though, I have to admit, a staggeringly simple and effective one).<br />I find it rather ironic that the first entry I made in my notes while watching &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is the following: &quot;From the first scene there is a feeling of artifice. The speaking characters are continually framed so as to make them appear alone before the camera. They talk, they grimace, but there is neither cause nor effect. They are reciting lines of dialog, but the dialog is cast in stone. There is no sense of reality.&quot; The film is indeed about detachment from reality, and, for all its simplicity uses a number of tools with great mastery to evoke a powerful knee-jerk response from the viewer, but (unfortunately) little else.<br />The scenery is a big help: a sort of X-Files meets Sliders ominous evergreen forest, a forsaken ski chalet, a dark, lonely gas station (one character suggests going to &quot;a local country gas station,&quot; and seconds later arrives at a building conspicuously labeled &quot;Country Gas Station&quot;; elsewhere, there is an equally anonymous Chinese Restaurant, though it's nothing like you would expect). There is a lot of reasonably cheesy squishy, squirming, stomach-turning, slimy little things, like mutated amphibians and the Metapods reputedly cobbled from their flesh. Cronenberg doesn't even reveal the true story a good while into the film - he's too busy grossing us out with the over-the-top wet sounds of umbi-cords being plugged into spinal bioports.<br />A glycerin coat of tongue-in-cheek humor keeps the level of absurdity down. &quot;eXistenZ&quot; continuously pokes fun at the gamers' technobabble, with some accuracy (&quot;It's most probably a pathetically mechanical attempt to heighten the emotional tension ofthe next game sequence&quot;).<br />Sadly, &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is a bit too trigger-happy with the virtual-reality switcheroos. Whenever any single storyline becomes potentially interesting, it is revealed to be unreal, just another level of Allegra's game. Pretty soon I stopped caring, since whatever was established in the previous stretch is put on its head in the next. A fairly good sci-fi thriller, but don't hold your breath for any meaning or insight.
0446608955|4.0|Dear reader!<br />We read the book \\"A walk to remember\\" by Nicholas Sparks in class and it was very good. The book was very easy to understand and we always were able to follow the plot.<br />It is an emotional lovestory in which you can identify with the main characters. The plot is about a teenager relationship between Landon and Jamie. Landon is just a normal boy, but Jamie is not a normal girl...<br />She always carries a bible with her. Jamie is the star for every mother and always friendly to everyone, but she hides a secret. Only her dad knows about the truth.  <br />After reading it, you will think about your own way of treating people. Make your own experiences with the (happy?) ending...<br />Just \\"marvelous\\"!!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I never thought I would be able to say that with a straight face, I guess the pigs are flying now...But anyways, Incubus really achieved their pinnacle of success last year with the hit \\"Drive\\", and though I did enjoy the song I never thought to buy the album.  Until one fateful day in the record store, there was \\"Morning View\\"...hmm interesting hey why not...so I picked it up and gave it a listen.  Lyrically very impressive, unlike other \\"Rap Metal\\" bands (I don't put Incubus in their category, being that there is no rap involved besides the DJ influence) Incubus puts effort into what they do, not garbage.  Brandon Boyd's vocals are definetly something to be admired, the guitar and bass playing will also delight any rock fan.  And believe it or not, the sampling and scratching mixes in quite nicely and adds to the unique sound of Incubus.  2001 was rocks come back year, and Incubus was there to help see it through
B00005QZWI|5.0|I always liked this kind of music, epic music from great movies. I simply adored this movie and the first thing I did when I left the cinema, was to go and buy the soundtrack. I'm really glad I did it. The best soundtrack ever, I think I'm in the movie. My favs are &quot;The breaking of the Fellowship&quot; and &quot;May it be&quot;. Enya has a great performance in this CD. The perfect gift to all fantasy lovers...
B000002GKT|5.0|I first bought this album about 30 years ago and couldn't get enough of it but somehow it got lost.<BR>I recently bought it on CD and it's as good now as it was then - in fact better!This is classic rock at its best with amazing vocals from Steve Marriott and hard hitting guitars that can't fail to get the adrenalin going.<BR>Some songs, such as Walk on Gilded Splinters, may be indulgent as live rock of this era only can be but the audience are there all the way and the atmosphere from a crowd hanging on every<BR>note is amazing.<BR>No one should miss this one!
0446525537|5.0|i have to be one of the few teenage guys to have read this of my own (heres a Nicholas Sparks word) volition...i saw the movie with some friends (all girls) who asked me to come...and i cried...and i borrowed the book from my friend christina, and i read it in less than a day...and i cried some more...the last ten pages were impossible to read because i kept tearing up...<BR>this book made me wanna go out and be a better person and do something nice for someone immediately...it also made me want to find a girl to fall in love with like that :)<br />this is without a doubt a fantastic novel, read it, because you just should
B00003CXXP|2.0|Haley Joel Osment stars as the robotic replacement for the terminally ill and comatose son of a privileged American family in a not-so-distant future.  The artificial boy is infinitely cuter yet so docile and obedient that he allows his \\"owner\\" to dress and undress him.  Always loving he seems in every way the perfect child until the recovery of the son not only makes him redundant, but sparks off a rivalry which plays on the fears and anxieties of the \\"real\\" boy's parents.  The robot child is abandoned and from here on the tight, sensitive claustrophobia of the film gives way to the epic scope and sentimentality of an \\"E.T.\\" or a \\"Jurassic Park\\" -- Kubrick in other words metamorphosises into Spielberg.  From a beginning which suggests a cutting edge exploration into technology and exploitation, into the corruptibility of love itself (unlike the robot boy's love, \\"human\\" love is too evidently perishable, too evidently morally suspect and morally suspicious), the film becomes another high-action spectacle drumming up the already much-trodden and oh-so-familiar spectacle of a \\"beautiful\\" protagonist triumphal not only over his \\"ugly\\" society, but over the logic of Space and Time itself:  robot boy gets reunited with human mum a thousand years into the future by aliens.  On the way of course, we get all the obvious moralising of a Spielberg direction complete with a \\"Flesh Fair\\" where these unwanted robots are systematically rounded up to be exterminated.  From the disturbing vision of the death of individuality, where perfect little boys and little girls may be mass produced, we get essentially a story from the eyes of a Pinnochio searching for a means to become a real boy.  The ending -- which I will not describe -- is so ludicruously illogical, so inflated with a hogwash of sentimentality that I felt terribly cheated. An apparently \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" has been turned into something which would do Walt Disney proud.
B00004XOWM|1.0|If you want to hear Limp Bizkit at their best, buy either of the first two albums. If you have [$] that you don't want and an aversion to good music, by all means pick up a copy of this album. <br />Don't get me wrong, I used to be the biggest Bizkit fan in the world, thier live shows were the best I've ever seen and 'Three Dollar Bill' was (is) fantastic. But when a track like 'Get Your Groove On' makes it onto a record, [I start to lose interest]
B0000029J5|4.0|Though Mo' released an earlier R&B-flavored album under his birth name, Kevin Moore, this delta-inspired acoustic-blues release is really his artistic debut. Playing guitar, banjo, and harmonica, Mo' shows a heavy influence from Robert Johnson (whose &#34;Come On In My Kitchen&#34; and &#34;Kindhearted Woman Blues&#34; he covers alongside eleven originals). At the same time, he displays a playful, gregarious side that brings to mind Taj Mahal (with a touch of Bobby McFerrin and Lyle Lovett), and expands his songs to encompass modern folk and jazz ideas.<br /><br />Mo's expressive singing and penetrating lyrics are highlighted on spare ballads, backed by the sharp fingerpicked twang of steel strings and the harmonica's mournful wail. Mid-tempo tracks retain the acoustic innocence even as the band kicks up the energy with backing organ, bass and drums. The result is an album steeped in classic blues but not enslaved by it; a recording that finds new avenues for the blues without losing any sense of its history.
0394800389|5.0|This tongue twister of words is great fun.  This was my favorite Dr. Seuss book as a child.  My sister and I read it over and over to see if we could read it all the way through with out messing up.  What a great way to encourage your child to read.
0446525537|4.0|I think the book \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is easy to read and understand. <BR>The story is about a growing relation between two teenagers, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. <BR>Jamie often reads the bible, helps others and is always friendly. She's what adults would call an angel. But her classmates don't like her at all, including Landon. Landon is exactly the opposite of her. He likes playing tricks on others.<BR>But they come closer together because Landon cannot find any other girl for a dance. So he \\"has to take\\" her. In school, they have to spend more time together because Landon agrees to play the main character in a Christmas play (Jamie is the female protagonist). Landon develops feelings for Jamie but does not show them because he is afraid of the others' reaction. But later he invites her to a dinner and walks her home after the rehearsals. You can say that he has finally fallen in love at that moment. One night he kisses her...<BR>Then this very emontional story turns into a dramatic one. Jamie says that Landon cannot be together with her because she is very ill... Although Jamie dies in the end the story has a happy ending! Even if you hate love stories this book will interest you, because it is not only about the \\"normal stuff\\". Nicholas Sparks describes very detailed but sometimes it is a little bit too long and therefore too boring!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|&quot;Lovers Live&quot;...You won't find any flashy improvisations on this offering. What you find is an artist that does what she does best. Sade displays her &quot;smoldering cool&quot; style, complemented by a band that is as tight as drum. I had the privelege of witnessing this tour last year in Dallas. It brings back wonderful memories.  What are you waiting for? Just get this!
B00005T30L|4.0|It should simply be noted, that had the makers of this DVD chosen to do what DVD makers so rarely do(i.e. go all out), they could have included<BR>a lot more in terms of alternate/deleted scenes.  When I saw that said \\"alternate/deleted scenes\\" were to be included on the disc,  I had high hopes that some of the stuff referred to in the (considerably different) shooting script would be included:  the different ending, Enid's dream, and her fling with Josh,  all of which more closely mirror events in the graphic novel.  Suffice it to say that none of those things are included.  In fact, all four of the 'alternate' scenes appear in the movie, in some form or another.  Hey, the movie is still the movie and it's great, but I for one was disappointed because I was aware of the wealth of deleted material that could have been included.  On the other hand, I found the uncut 'Jaan Pechan Ho' clip to be alot more entertaining than I would have expected.
B000002WPI|5.0|If you are a fan of mid-ninties hip hop, or if you are a hip hop fan at all this is the cd for you.  I cant get by a day without thinking about this cd.  It has the pure rawest lyrics and beats that WU has ever produced.  Without a doubt THE WU-TANG CLAN  is the greatest hip hop group ever.  If you dont have this cd there is definately something wrong with you.  Trust me and buy this cd.  I have hundreds of cds of all different genres (jazz, rock, bluegrass,fusion,hip hop) and this is the stand out cd of the 1900's.
0446525537|5.0|It is by far my most favorite.  My emotions were right with Landon and all the small details of their lives, their love and the world around them.  I would love to read another one just like it.  Made me feel like I was home!
B000002VC5|5.0|With it's various twists and turns &quot;I Robot&quot; will wind you tighter and tighter with the intense energy that each song, even the softest ballad, has. A really great Progressive album and a must-have for anyone who is discovering this style of music. The opening title track is fantastic when you are listening through headphones in a dark room late at night.
6301868684|5.0|THAT is the only way to put it!  No holes barred here, this one does surgery without anesthesia!<br />JENNIFER JASON LEIGH stuns as the prostitute [?] Tralala, yeah, it's been said before, but \\"Bold\\", \\"Daring\\", \\"Raw & Honest\\" [with that heart of unplated gold] aptly apply.  Still unappreciated!  THAT ending!<br />A great period piece, set in the early fifties [err 1950ish] it covers everything from Unions, sexual awakening [with deadly results], \\"coming of age\\", and good old homebuds!<br />It's based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. - well worth reading AFTER seeing this.<br />Brilliant direction by Uli Edel.<br />Cannot say more - that would ruin this experience - a close cousin \\"Strangers In The City\\", an earlier work - tough!
B000021YQV|5.0|i first heard chop suey! at a dance at my high school and i began to ask around to find out who the band was.  athough i head listened to the rock stations all summer, i had not heard of system of a down.  the first chance i got, i went out and i bout the cd just to see what it was about.<br />the cd is very very good, but you have to lean more toward the harder end of rock to really understand how good it is. the whole cd talks about really deep important issues and it's very interesting the way that everything is displayed from a different angle. you can chose to either follow the lyrics of the songs or just the songs themselves.  either way this cd is worth buying.
078322608X|3.0|Deja-voo-doo time with Bruce Willis and Co.!<br />Inspired by the now famous yet hard to find \\"still\\" short, this tangled tale of time-travel, violence, time-travel, sex, time-travel, homeless people?  You get my drift.  It is fun to watch a few times, then to revisit, and has quite it's own life too.<br />Willis as the \\"criminal\\" incarcerated in 'some future prison', optioned to return to the past to find out Why or What polluted our atmosphere, the future Earth dwellers, like H>G> Wells \\"Time Machine\\" creatures are forced to live underground.  It all has something to do with the \\"12 Monkeys\\" - a subversive group; possibly run by the versatile Brad Pitt - excellent [and double nominated / Golden Globe,Oscar] for this role!<br />Our Bruce flashes back and forth in time [the process still has a few bumps] and along the way encounteres bemused psychiatrist the lovely Madeleine Stowe - more complications and radical deja-vu.  Then we have those homeless people - but that's another story - don't want to totally ruiin this for the uninitiated.<br />Monumental sets, even sinister props [\\"Dark City\\" time.....quite a good companion].<br />Great visuals - a perfect book-end to \\"Brazil\\" another Gilliam nightmare [the good kind].
0446525537|5.0|I just got back from watching the movie, and it is deffintly the best movie that I myself have ever seen. Shane West and Mandy Moore make a coute couple on and off of the screen. I think they should make many more films together. I love Mandy Moores songs that she sings in the movie. She is very talented and is still pretty with and without makeup. The movie is so good, that I have already bought the book, A Walk to Remember, and have seen the movie twice.
B000050FEN|5.0|It is a matter of taste - Hannibal? The Tooth Fairy? Or Buffalo Bill? Then this Creepy Guy comes along - brilliantly orchestrated by director David Fincher and brought to sinister life by KEVIN SPACEY [pre-Oscar this is, and very noteworthy].<br />Others? BRAD PITT and Morgan Freeman as the detectives, one sober - one new and slightly rash. Gwyneth Paltrow as the newlywed wife, so vulnerable, and equally stellar!<br />It's revenge ala Biblical prorportion here, and very nasty indeed!  [If you'v seen the campy, classic art-deco \\"Dr. Phibes\\" series with the Great Vincent Price - this is similar, but too, too real....]<br />To say more would be to dismantle this dark work of cinematic art by Mr. Fincher - grabs you by the hair from title straight through to the end.<br />Flipside? \\"Bedazzled\\" [1968, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore].<br />Or more darkness? \\"Exorcist III\\"<br />Another severe experience, slightly lighter - but with an even quirkier punch? \\"Fight Club\\".
0425163407|5.0|I am not really sure why these books appeal to me, but they do. The subject matter here is unusual and not appealing to everyone, but, I have not read one of Ms. Cornwell's books that I did not like. In fact, I bought one of her newer books at a book fair and was so taken with the characters and story that I have gone back to her first books to catch up on the side-stories. Kay Scarpetts is a woman in a man's world and she doesn't let anyone get over on her. She fights hard for her place and yet, she doesn't seem to make it the focus of her life. Her confidence in her own abilities allows her to focus on the victims of crime rather than being taken seriously in a male-dominated field. Kay is tenacious and head-strong and she is a bit of a hero as are most people who fight crime. Even though she is not a law-enforcement officer per se, she lends a great deal to the solving of crimes. In my naivete, that could very will be part and parcel of what a forensic pathologist does. Ms. Cornwell is totally in control in an area where most people know little or nothing as far as processes and procedures. Ms. Cornwell lets us know from the start that she knows a lot about her subject. Her detailed descriptions of autopsies and crime scenes should make me queasy, but I find that, in the context of the story, these descriptions fit in so well that they only make me a bit uncomfortable, which, I believe, is what she wants. I find her characters from Kay to Moreno to Wesley to be well-rounded and appealing. I also find that, from the first book, Post Mortem, to the last, Ms. Cornwell's writing grows and learns. She has no problem bringing more and more to her characters and stories as she learns and grows in her craft. This book and her others are great reading and worth the time.
B000023VR6|4.0|Much anticipated and much hyped-about album from Dre after almost ten years out the game. He still makes a come-up (albeit with the help of Eminem) and comes through with the one of the best albums of the year. This album has new beats, same old lyrics, an overload of guest appearences, and is still a BANGIN album. Best songs were What's The Difference, Forgot About Dre, Still D.R.E, XXplosive, The Next Episode, The Watcher... The hits keep comin'. Not to mention almost the entire west coast is on here, such as Eminem, Snoop, Xzibit, Kurupt, MC Ren, you name it some of the biggest names in hip hop are on here. This album is highly recommended to anyone who likes good hip hop although fans of The Chronic may find it a bit too new-school. But it goes to show when all else in rap fails, you can always count on Dre to deliver!
B00005U1YO|5.0|I have anticipated this album ever since I picked up the \\"It began in Afrika/Hot Acid Rhythm 1\\" single last year.  Upon my first listen to this album I felt as though there was something missing. Then, after repeated listenings, I realized I went into it expecting certain things that I heard on previous Chemical Bros albums and that was the problem.  This is different than their other albums.  Sure, there are similarities, but the Chemical Brothers fan will notice the difference.  I think I was waiting for \\"Block Rockin' Beats, part 2\\" to pop up and it didn't.  \\"Come With Us\\" is refreshing and it gives me another reason to like the Chemical Brothers.  I won't do a track run down because I don't want to try to describe their songs.  If your into the Brothers, you've already heard them.  I think anyone who thinks this is \\"more of the same\\" should re-listen to it.  The title \\"Come With Us\\" is so appropriate for this group and this album because I think it takes an open mind to appreciate what they create.  I am a drummer, among other things, so I was first attracted to the Chemical Brothers for their creative beat manipulation.  They have a way of taking the simplest beat and making it slam.  The beats are still exciting (I love the opening drum roll and beat for the title track)but I have grown to appreciate all the little bleeps, barks, and melodies that surround them.  I should have been more ready for anything when I first listened to this.  That is what makes the Chemical Brothers exciting.  You think you know what their going to do but you havent a clue.  Thank God there is still \\"music\\" like this to battle the manufactured ... on MTV.  The irony is, MTV is how I first heard the Chems (\\"Block Rockin'Beats video)but that was back in the day, right?  Anyway, \\"don't stop the rock\\" Tom and Ed!
B00005NRO3|2.0|I was a big fan of the first Scream movie - and consequently, Kevin Williamson.  However, with this and other projects like Dawson's Creek, he's proved himself what he really is ...  This movie is just a retread of the first film, except what works there doesn't work here.  Williamson's writing has the feeling of an intro creative writing workshop.  Much has been made about his young characters being too smart - in actuality, they're exceptionally dumb...they just have a thesaurus.  In Scream he found a gimmick, in Scream 2 he's beating a dead slasher.
0385486804|3.0|'Into the Wild' is the true story of Chris McCandless, a twenty-something kid from a well-to-do family in Virginia who takes off for the wilderness of Alaska on a Dante-esque journey. McCandless's travels make for an intriguing story -- He ventures from the fields of the Dakotas to the deserts of Mexico with almost nothing but his wits. But the question is, and the author touches upon this quandary in the book: Why should we care? McCandless can be seen in one of two ways: One of the last true idealists who rejects society and its conventions; or a mixed up kid with no common sense. However you view McCandless will ultimately define whether or not you enjoy this book.
6305903182|2.0|After Kevin Williamson dropped out of this project, I thought that there might be a glimmer of hope.  Alas...no.   The dialogue is laughably bad and the plot is ludicrous.  The only bright spot is a surprise cameo by Jay and Silent Bob.  By the end of the trilogy, Sydney has become so annoying that you are almost rooting for her to get killed.  Fortunately, Courtney Cox gets more screen time in this one.
B000006045|5.0|Definately one of my top 10 all-time albums period. No matter what kind of pop/rock/electronic/r&amp;b/rap music you think you like, there is a melding and blending here that transcends all genres and take it to a beautiful, if ecclectic high. It is the soundtrack to the future - pop from the pages of dark cyber-fi. One listen and you will wonder why everyone is not making music this progressive, yet resoundingly gorgeous. Awesome. When's the next set?
0780622553|5.0|Before the Matrix, there was Dark City. I believe that the Matrix borrowed Dark City's concept and ideas. I enjoyed the Matrix but I think Dark City is a much better film that's better directed, almost to perfection. I would put this film among my 3 favorite films of all-time including Blade Runner, and The Crow. What amazes me the most about this film are all the symbols and hidden messages within the plot. Roger Ebert's commentary on this explains a lot about the meaning of the spiral, the importance of lighting and the power of film noir. He compares the fantasy world and the set designs to Metropolis and Blade Runner. Ebert absolutely loves this film and named it the best film of 1998. There is even a review by Neil Gaiman in this. The theatrical trailer is awesome and the chapter menus are cool with actual scene bits you can watch with sound without actually playing the movie. There is also the full screen version on one side of the disc so you can compare the two versions and see just how much picture is really taken out. This is a superb Dvd with outstanding sound and picture quality.  This film should not be passed up. Dark City is a rare visual feast that will open your eyes to a world you have never seen before.
B00000623W|4.0|I would say this is the only movie that I can watch over and over again without getting sick of it. It's a true classic!
B00005V0X5|5.0|I usually view &quot;remastered&quot; records with a bit of skepticism; they're usually a disappointment.  Not so with this one.  Simply saying it's remastered with some extra tracks doesn't do it justice.  Every single cut is incredible, superb, dare I say exquisite?  You have to buy this album.  You may as well do it now, because you will eventually.
0786915749|5.0|I will make this short and simple.  If you like gripping fantasy books this is for you.  You wont be able to stop reading!
B000002JNJ|5.0|Whenever I put on this CD, I can't even remember the name of that has-been metal band.  Now don't get me wrong, I like Metallica and all (well, back in the day I did), but they are way overrated, and Pantera was always far superior.  This is the album that best exemplifies how great Pantera is.  You've got some really sweet rhythms, amazing solos, great drumming, and very good vocals.  All of which are superior to that of Metallica.  Dimebag is quite simply a guitar god.  Anybody ever see a tab of one of his leads?  You just kinda stare at it and go, &quot;Uh, how am I supposed to do THAT?&quot;.  He is one of the greatest guitarists in heavy metal, and probably one of the best in the world.  Vinnie's not the greatest drummer in the world, but he knows what he's doing, and his playing really stands out.  Phil is a very versatile vocalist, which you can see on songs like &quot;Shattered&quot;, where his voice elevates to heights that would make Halford proud, and on &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, where his growl gives way to soft vocals that are just sublime.  If you haven't heard that song, by the way, you gotta give it a listen.  One of the greatest ballads ever, period.  Just compare it to any of Metallica's ballads, and you'll see that there is no comparison.  This song has musical and emotional power that is just awe-inspiring.  Other great songs include &quot;Heresy&quot;, &quot;Clash with Reality&quot;, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, &quot;The Sleep&quot; (nice acoustic guitars), and of course the title track.  The great thing about this album, other than the fact that it's technical and heavy, is that there's a lot of harmony here.  Take for instance that little melodic flourish in &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, or the intro to &quot;The Art of Shredding&quot;.  It almost reminds me of Iron Maiden.  Very nice.  Metallica certainly never had the sense of harmony and melody that Pantera does.  The only song here that isn't so great is &quot;Primal Concrete Sledge&quot;, butonce that time change hits, you realize it isn't so bad.  But, there's a little bit of everything here.  Heavy riffs, melody, variety, it's perfect.  If you love metal, buy this.  You'll be glad you did.
B00005QDW1|5.0|As a No Doubt fan I completely understand why someone would be put off by this album at first. But who says a band cant explore different genres? Not only do they have the guts to do so but they pull it off in a big way. As someone mentioned earlier the music influences are indeed Jamaican dance hall music and obviously the eighties. Not Britney Spears or NSync which is just a stupid and uninformed thing to say. Who says they have to stick with the program...why get boring? I for one think the album is wonderful and addictive. Listen to it a second time and pretend you dont know who they are...I bet you'll like it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I recently read a Wall Street Journal article and it listed SHREK as the best selling DVD to date (Feb 2002)! Eight million copies.  If you have not seen this movie, go rent or buy it today!<br />I have been waiting for a movie like this for a while.  <br />(1.) Shrek is unique. It's totally computer animated yet has exceptional voice acting.<br />(2.)  The Voice acting is done by proven professional comics.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy bring their characters to life!<br />(3.)  All ages can enjoy this movie.  Rarely have I seen a animated or computer generated movie that could keep the interest of both adults and children. <br />(4.)  The DVD is packed with entertaining Extras!<br />(5.)  Shrek takes place in a medieval-fantasy fairy tail.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I read comic books as a kid but never got around to the X Men, though they were very popular.  When I saw that this movie was coming out, I thought I'd check it out and I'm glad I did.  The characters are really good and I especially liked Wolverine, Jean Grey and Storm (who I would like to see more of in the sequel).  With great actors like Patrick Stewart and the incredibly talented Ian McKellan it would have been hard for the director to go wrong.  The dvd has some cool extras and it is well worth the money.  If you like comic book heroes or not, this movie is worth your money.
0451191153|5.0|This book is fiction, with Rand's ideals thrown in for good measure, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad read. Actually this is a very interesting book, the characters A.R. uses are basically, stereo types, built up into real people. The main characters are predictable when alone, yet they are very quirky and unpredictable, when then interact. It kept me interested till the controversial ending kind of ruined it for me. It would have been good if this were a perfect world, but we all know it is not. After 6 months I still can't her out of my head.
B00004XMTH|4.0|It's obvious that he or she wants to ruin the fun for others.<BR>This video is very good,and they do NOT repeat things over and<BR>over(and &quot;Viewer&quot;knew that).Don't be mislead by what the<BR>anti-CATS people try to tell you.Watch the video,and judge for yourself.I've watched this video myself-and there's a whole<BR>variety of things in it.I thought the &quot;Ripley&quot;viewer was drunk<BR>when he or she wrote that review-I saw NO repeating whatsoever.If you don't like CATS,then keep it to yourselves-don't try to ruin it for others by vicious lies and<BR>false facts that you made up.
B000002UY3|5.0|terrific record and definitely the best from Mazzy star.  Another goodie is Souvlaki by Slowdive which is sort of UK Mazzy.
B0000507R0|5.0|In 1973 I bought this albumn and hear it for the first time in a small record player with a small single speaker and I was amazed by this kind of sound, years latter I bought it in cassete and again I was amazed by the sound in my car stereo.<BR>Almost 30 years latter (29 to be exact) I bought this album in DVD audio and again I'm overpowered by the sound, I heard sounds and textures that I never heard in previous versions, of course it helps that the new set up is Dolby 5.1 compliant and the player is  DVD-Audio. If you have the components, please don't restraint yourself of this wonderful sound. I close my eyes and almost can touch Emerson, and I heard Palmer just behind me and Lake was to my right. I recomend this version to any hard core progressive rock fan
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is truly a great film.  Covering all the genres, Fight Club is funny, sad, violent, mellow, suspenseful and most importantly great all throughout from beginning to end.  Keeping pretty true the book by Chuck Palahuniuk, Director David Fincher did a really great job portraying it.  This DVD also has some great special features:  deleted scenes, 4 or 5 commentaries, advertising trailers, commercials, and internet ads, easter eggs, and much more.  The was one of the first DVD's I bought.  After seeing it in Theaters (which I drove 70 miles to go see), I didn't think watching it home could ever be quite as good.  The VHS version doesn't offer much other than seeing it again, whereas the DVD scores an eagle as far as entertainment, quality, extras, and superb sound...featured in Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, and mastered in THX.  This is my favorite movie of all time!
0425170349|5.0|This is the 2nd Tom Clancy book I read and well...I LOVE IT!!!<BR>It started off full of action....and though it died down it got started right back up.<BR>The action of how they take out the terrorist network is awesome, and how he makes it all come togethere is great.<BR>Highly recommended book...makes me want to read more.
B00000DFSK|5.0|Best of 1980-1990 is an absolute must for a blooming U2 enthusiast. Although this is definitely not the colmplete sum of U2's greatest hits, it is the perfect place for the casual fan to pick up most of the bands best songs for a reasonable price. Even better is the 2-CD pack, It comes with the Best Of CD and the B-Sides; some of U2's lesser known work.  I believe U2 to be the Greatest band ever formed, Best of 1980-1990 lives up to my standard and then some.
B00005B4GU|2.0|This album sounds like it's comprised of a few mediocre new tunes penned up in a jiffy and then all the leftover junk from the Kid A sessions. Really uncool (and lazy) of this otherwise talented band to put out an uncohesive collection of leftovers in the guise of an LP. Even and EP would've been acceptable. OK Computer was creative and brilliant and Kid A, at least sonically, continued to break new ground for the band, but the bulk of this album is just rubbish. The Morning Bell reworking is just awful. People giving this album 5 stars must be tone-deaf and easily swayed by hype, cool covers and packaging.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|There are only two words that describe Sade....beautiful and timeless. Sade is easily the most beautiful women in the recording industry today, and is blessed to have the most beautiful voice the music industry has ever known.  With all of her timeless hits recorded on one CD (live at that...), how could you go wrong? If there has ever been an artist who could make hits over a long timespan without ever getting old, Sade is it.  Please, just stop reading this review, head over to the nearest record store and [get]THIS ALBUM!!!! Trust me, you wont regret it
B00005B36H|5.0|I may sound inconsiderate for saying something negative about this incredible album after a wait of five years, but it does indeed fall the slightest bit short of Aenima. I have composed a list of improvements and bad points as compared to Aenima.<br />Improvements:<BR>Aenima may have more good songs, but Lateralus's good songs are better.<BR>The lyrics are much more thoughtful, with a lot less vulgarity (the only swear is in Ticks and Leeches)<BR>The range of Maynard's vocals is more thoroughly expressed. He can do everything you're used to and then some (screaming for instance)<BR>The good songs are longer and provide more action and flat-out greatness. <br />Unprovements (bad points as compared to Aenima):<BR>Less good songs<BR>Many of the tracks aren't even songs, just a series of noises or eerie rift.<BR>These songs are more for a seroius mood (not that its a bad thing) but some of Aenima's songs may better fit a fun mood. (Hooker with a Penis, for example)<br />This album is anything but bad, in fact its one of my favorite albums of all time. But if you are finally deciding to dig into the best band of all time, i suggest you pick up Aenima first because its the best album of all-time.
B000021YQV|5.0|Yes this is the best album of the new millenium so far. Yes it is even better than Slayer's God hates us all which came out a week later. This album is so powerful that ALL the nu-metal bands only wish they had the power and kick this band has. I see promising things to come from this band. Also IMO the title track has got to be one of the best metal songs to come along in the longest time. Best songs are: toxicity, aerials, atwa, chop suey and prison song.BUY THIS NOW
6303168507|5.0|The holocaust was a most painful era of thw orld's history (though not the worst) and the gruesome scenes depicted here do not even come close. I think this movie was pretty glamourised by hollywood. I also think that the movie was too soft on children, in real life, nazis were merciless with them, they thought they were the \\"nits of the lice\\" which were the jews and therefore tried to exterminate them all to prevent them grwoing and producing more \\"heathen race\\",  children were thrown against tanks, their legs pulled apart (pulling one leg and the other apart until their body rips from the base)  hanged from a hook, experiment on, gassed, shot, tortured, diseased, and probably other stuff. This movie was powerful,  but it was really hollywoody, people who say it wasn't obviously never saw a movie that was not made by big companies in hollywood. <br />      as to the good points of the film,  the picture of this film was really splendid, you feel as though you are there.  the acting is great too, i think the most powerful acting was ralph feinnes who really explored his dark side to come up with this powerful and convicing act. the scene i think is the second-most powerful is the liquidation of the ghetto, again, hollywood censored it. probably better to cause of audiences, but they tamed it very much, nazi officers and soldiers wouldn't just shoot them, they would beat them to death with their rifles and rods, and again, smash little kids against tanks and artillery trunks ( i got this from a survivor's testimony) and a lot more.  and the conditions before the ghetto was liquidized was hollywoody, in real  life, ghettos were full of starving people and dead people all over the place, people would get killed all the time, everyday, horribly, but hollywood did not have the guts to make this a realty in the movies. <br />    the MOST powerful scene was the very ending, when survivors went(real life) to oskar schindler's grave, there was no acting here, here was peolehaunted by what happened to them, real life, not by speilberg or holly wood.<br />    and the significance of the girl in the little red coat is that it is symbolising an individual, when you see a whole bunch of people getting killed, you know it's horrible, but it is just a lot of people, it is powerful and sad, but there is so much people in the same sistuation it doesn't mean as much, and the girl with red coat is walking amid this chaos, you realize these are individuals, people, who had lives, who are special, and this little girl is symbolising that individuality, and later when you see she is dead(in the second part of the movie) it really crushes you.<br />   despite all my complaints, this is a real acheivment for hollywood, good work
0688172377|3.0|I am pleased that I read this book.   It is an often harrowing account of Waris Dirie's personal journey from the life of a Somali nomad to that of an international model and  special ambassador.  It is often brave - Dirie lays out incredibly personal aspects of her life, which goes against all that she learned as a child about the privacy of one's body and of one's own culture.  <BR>That anyone suffers the pain and oppression of female genital mutilation is an international crime.  It is important that word of what is happening to millions of women should be spread as wide as possible and this is a very accessible means of doing just that.  The book is very readable.<BR>Despite this I was left feeling that there was just something lacking that I have found it difficult to pinpoint.  It is not a literary masterpiece by any means.  Some things just don't ring true, and it seemed rather too self-congratulatory to me.  <BR>If you are looking for details about FGM try Hanny Lightfoot Kleins work.  If you enjoy memoirs and autobiographies there are much better ones out there.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is one of the most refreshing, innovative artists to emerge in years... and as far as being a Dave Mathews \\"sound alike\\"...??? Maybe the vocals on some tracks, but musically it's apples and oranges. While I appreciate Dave Mathews music, it is disjointed and out of sync at times. <br />This recording is smooooooth as silk. Sip, don't chug :)
B000056VIY|2.0|I really like Jennifer in movies.  She's beautiful and has a depth and quality that I admire.  She's mysterious and can handle herself with total confidence.  In front of the camera, that is.  On this CD, she hides behind so much technical mixing and erotic-robotics, that you can't even hear her voice on a lot of the tracks.  Pitiful.  I did not like this CD at all.  Even her slow songs don't show the true depth of the quality her voice actually has when you hear it on a movie.  I wouldn't have even known it was her except she's pictured on the front of the CD.
B0000024JA|3.0|I was told by my friends that this album was the best, but when i bought and put it in my cd player, it was not what i expected.  Method man doesn't live up to the lyrical skills he showed us on 36 chambers, overall this album is ok with a couple of good songs such as #3,4 and 8.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I know that most people consider Peace sells and rust in peace the best of megadeth but I gotta disagree. Nothing to take from those great albums they just cant compare to this masterpiece. Just listen to that riff in Symphony of destruction which is argulbly megadeths best song and riff ever. If your just getting into megadeth get this album now!!! Best songs are: Symphony of destruction , architecture of aggression, cowntdown to extiction and foreclosure of a dream.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is an awesome album.  Every single song here is great.  My favorites are Jeremy and Even Flow.  This is a great beginning for a great band.  Pearl Jam is probably the best grunge band ever.  They are the best grunge band ever (even better than Nirvana, plus I can understand what they are saying.).  This album is great, from beginning to end.  You will never get sick of this album unless you hate good music. Trust me.
B000002JSZ|5.0|FLICK OF THE SWITCH is probably the most underated AC/DC album ever. For instance, it is definately the most raw AC/DC album in their history. Most people say it is one of the weakest albums the band has made, but i must disagree. This album cooks from start to finish with 10 ear bashing songs. Brian singing as he always has & great guitar work from Angus & Malcolm. Let's not also forget the great bass & drums from Phil & Cliff. The title track is a great song which is fast & furious. Other great tracks are NERVOUS SHAKEDOWN, RISING POWER, THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE & the frenetic LANDSLIDE. Vintage AC/DC.
078062999X|5.0|Best Hamlet movie EVER -- except for Jack Lemmon, ill-cast in a cameo as a sentry and seemingly mangling his lines in revenge.  Winslet actually does a decent job as Ophelia though, and Jacobi's Claudius is a study in the banality of evil.  Where's the DVD?  Get on the ball!
B000003N7K|5.0|When I met my husband in 1968, he introduced me to Johnny Hartman. Over the years we often went to see him perform.  When we enjoyed his gig at Gulliver's in New Jersey, Johnny had some 33LPs of his for sale. Unable to choose, my husband asked Johnny for his recommendation...Johnny replied, &quot;Take the Coltrane...it's the best.&quot;  And it is without question. One of our favorite records EVER!! &quot;You are Too Beautiful&quot; is the all time best love song and Johnny is superb!!
B000001C6M|5.0|this is one of the best debut album that ranks along with kill em all,cowboys from hell and led zeppelin and black sabbath's debuts. Although this is not slayers best its still classic and has some great riffs and solo's. The best songs are the antichrist, metalstorm/face the slayer, black magic and show no mercy, but with all of Slayer albums they all rule.
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black in my opinion is the best AC/DC album & one of the best albums period. On this album the band really got it together & it shows. The songwriting is great on this album and their are no weak tracks. It was the first AC/DC album with new singer Brian Johnson formerly of the band Geordie & he does an excellent job with his powerhouse vocal delivery. Also in top form is the rest of the band ANGUS, MALCOLM, CLIFF & PHIL.<BR>All tracks are great with BACK IN BLACK, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG & SHOOT TO THRILL just a few of them. A must have album.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Easily the worst movie ever.  Why was this ever made?
B00000294R|5.0|Well, I was doubting a little or I should give this album 5 starz or 4.5 'cause I think Big L was and still is one of the most talented rappers out there but some of the beats are wack. Unfortunatly I don't own this CD, I just borrowed it from a friend but I'll buy it for sure! All the lyrics wich come out of his mouth are true and deep and he's one of the best storytellers in the game. Everybody who likes hip hop should have this album, I can guarantee you'll love it. True, the production isn't outstanding but that's just another think wich makes this sound so great, it makes you feel back in the earlier 90's. And not ALL the beats are plain, there are some good ones too like &quot;put it on&quot; wich is my favourite, &quot;No endz no skinz&quot;, &quot;8 iz enuff&quot; and &quot;All black&quot; wich is also on Nas' Illmatic album &quot;Halftime&quot;. Anyway it's a true classic and it should be in everybody's collection! COP it!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I initially got the CD for Lady Marmalade.  At the time that was the only song I liked on the CD.  I finally saw the movie yesterday, and listened to the whole CD last night.  Now I love it.  Seeing the movie puts visuals and understanding to the songs.  I especially love Hindu Sad Diamonds...a wonderful beat and mix of music. It is a refreshing CD!
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity stunned me. It was better than the immortal debut. Perfect vocals are a complement to the hard metal guitar tones. The drumming is impecabe especially on the title track, Toxicity. It's anti mainstream and just a perfect rock album.
6300182770|5.0|It doesn't matter what you have to do to see this movie, just see it as soon as possible.  David Cronenberg made this film way back in 1983, back when t.v. was still somewhat good.  The message?  Television is the root of all evil and perversion, and will only lead to our demise.<br />Needless to say, this movie is incredible.  It defines that genre of film that most of us just like to call \\"weird.\\"  This film has no limits in where it takes the viewer.  I felt like I was on some sort of bad acid nightmare the whole time I was watching it.<br />Say what you will about James Woods, but if this was his only movie, he'd be the finest actor of all time.  Nobody else could have done what he does here.  Add to his performance an incredible performance by a beautiful (and naked) Deborah Harry (singer for Blondie), and you've got one of the scariest, yet most thought provoking movies of all time.<br />This movie also wins my award for the finest ending in a movie I have ever seen.  James Woods says his final line with such conviction that it just adds a huge level of \\"Wow\\" to the movie.<br />Once again, do anything to see this movie.  It will probably NEVER be on network television, so buy or rent it.  I'm still saddened that there is no DVD version.  This movie could have used it.
B00005A46T|4.0|I am a Slipknot fan and I believe that some of the commentaries that I've heard about IOWA (the new album from slipknot)are not true.  ...slipknot has great band members that know how to play their instruments.  ...Slipknot's album is a good album.  It has good songs such as Left Behind and Everything ends.  The best song in the album will probably be Disasterpiece.  I have to say Slipknot's last album was better, but IOWA does not fall too short from it.  All the songs from this album are cool except for IOWA the track, I did not like  it for some reason.  But this album is worth buying.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This was a wonderful adaptation of Rowling's Harry Potter - the 1st in a series.  Very faithful to the book - although I must admit the text was much more 'complete'.  You don't have to read the book to enjoy the movie.  While some may view the story line as lacking, this is just the 1st in the series and serves as the basis of all that is to come.  It's your introduction to Harry and friends at Hogwarts.  What follows is even more creative.
B000059XYA|2.0|This movie is at best average.  It's a violent \\"normal\\" sequal and as usual can't live up to the original.  The original lived up to the comic book and was very faithfull.  Christopher Reeve was again great as the man of steal and who could top Gene Hackman.  Terrence Stamp was good as General Zod and Sarah Douglass was goods as Ursa but Jack O'Halloran as Non was a wasted and useless character.  The great Superman theme by John Williams is still there but as massive and exciting.  If you want a good sequel see Superman 3.  But only see this if your a die hard fan.
B000007SPT|5.0|After listening to this magnificant set of songs for over 12 years now, I still enjoy it today as much as the first time I heard it.  It was just by chance that I stumbled across this great amalgamation of groups.  I would have never even heard of This Mortal Coil had it not been for a friend playing &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; for me.  After hearing that one song I was hooked.  Unfortunately, the only airplay the album seemed to receive in my area was on the college radio station, so I was only familiar with one song - Another Day - which for me is the second best song of the twelve.  If you enjoy the likes of Kate Bush or Tori Amos, then this is a definite must.  I consider myself to have a wide range of musical taste - from Linkin Park to Paul van Dyk to Janis Joplin to Madonna - but this is still tops on my list of the best.  I will however be the first to admit that this not an album for all occasions - such as a party or anytime you are looking for a pick-me-up.  It is however great for the following occasions:  after a break-up, unrequited love, a rainy/snowy day, a late night coming home from the bar alone, or anytime you want to just chill out or relax.  So my suggestion is to light the candles, grab a good stiff drink, put on This Mortal Coil, and chill out.  And just try not to end up in tears after it is all over with!
B00005A46T|4.0|I am a Slipknot fan and I believe that some of the commentaries that I've heard about IOWA (the new album from slipknot)are not true.  For example the guy that said that Joey was the only one that knew about its instrument the drums.  This is not true slipknot has great band members that know how to play their instruments.  That very same guy said that if you really want to listen to metal you should listen to some wierd ass bands that no one has even heard of.  This guy is probably just a hater.  Anyway, back to my opinion of the album, Slipknot's album is a good album.  It has good songs such as Left Behind and Everything ends.  The best song in the album will probably be Disasterpiece.  I have to say Slipknot's last album was better, but IOWA does not fall too short from it.  All the songs from this album are cool except for IOWA the track, I did not like  it for some reason.  But this album is worth buying.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is almost the best album Dream Theater have ever wrote ,but im sick of the people that say bad things about it .If its bad , then why a lot of people LOVE it .Its must be something wrong with these haters EARS!
B000056K04|4.0|alright, i've heard enough!  yeah, so the songs are a little shorter... the melodies a bit more sylized... but come on, this album still rocks compared to everything else out there.  if you ARE a real dmb fan, give them some credit.  your crappy reviews make people thinks this isn't a solid album.  definitely not true.  everyday is by far one of the best albums produced this year, in spite of the fact it didn't fit what we (yes, myself included) had expected to follow 'before these crowded streets'.  it is absolutely an album worth buying, and anyone who says otherwise only indicates their own ignorance and parochial views.
0451527712|4.0|Overall, this book was great.  It's the type of thriller that would scare you, had we not been desensitized as a society by gore and guts on TV and in movies.  Its not the Frankenstein you see in the media like Eddie Munster with the things sticking out of his neck and the lightning storm and the mad scientist creating the monster.  It is a genuine, old-fashioned horror story.  The best part is, Shelley does not give you a detailed description of the creation of her imagination.  She lets each person's imagination create its own \\"monster.\\"  You can make it as scary or as innocent as you want.  That's the beauty of what Shelley does in this novel.  You can read into the scenes and story as a whole as much as you want to.  You can also argue that the book is not a horror story at all.  There are many different points of view concerning the intent of the novel.  How it is interpreted is left entirely up to each individual reader.  The only downfall I found in the novel was the pace that it held throughout the story.  I had to adjust my thinking towards the time at which it was written.  It does not have the speed that a modern novel has and you have to adjust somewhat to get through the slower parts.  As a whole, I highly recommend this classic for anyone who enjoys letting his or her imagination create the story.
0446608955|4.0|I`m  a German student of the 11th grade, and I`ve read  this novel in class.<BR>I found it easy to understand, and although I usually don`t read lovestories, this one was quite interesting to me. The way Nicholas Sparks writes about the actions and thoughts of  Landon and Jamie (the main characters), makes it really easy to share their emotions.
0375507507|1.0|I remember author and humanist, Chinua Achebe explaining the importance of literature to the world you lived in. He didn't see how it was possible to just write for the sake of writing. I thought of Fuller's book when I went back to that speech Achebe made. If &quot;Don't Let's...&quot; is a journal and for whatever reason, depth or understanding or historical perpsective was not something to aim for, then why such a muddled project? The native Zimbabwean people are completely absent from this book and we get a weak colonial portrait about funny times, mosquitoes and animals. This is old nineteenth century Byronic romance and unforgiveable today in a world where we all now know better. I would reiterate the importance of reading more perceptive and less narcissitic Southern African writers such as Bessie Head and Tsitse. ALexandra Fuller's book does nothing to convince the rest of us that Africans are human beings and that the people of Zimbabwe have something of worth to tell us and to teach us.
0316777722|5.0|Sedaris does it again.  From tales of learning French to some surprisingly poignant pieces, Sedaris's newest book is filled with the same funny, often venomous assaults on the masses.  It's not as good as Barrel Fever, but it's still funnier than anything else out there.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This is one of the worst movies of 2001. A total waste of time and talent. Other than the bombing scenes there is no reason to view this terrible, boring, superficial film.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dyan has been made famous for his original trilogy, the three incredable albums, Bringing It All Back, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde.  these three incredable albums madewithin three years are some of the greatest music to exist on recording.  however, recently Dylan ma be venturing on a similiar mission.  After th absoluty unbelievable Time Out of Mind, he has come out with this second mastrpeice, Love and Theft.  it is incredably different from Time Out o Mind, and actually anything else that hehas released. Mississippi, Summer Days, High Water, and Suger Baby are all absolutly incredable tracks.  this is not only the greatest album of the year but one of the greatest albums of all time.  while i am an incredably new Dylan fan, being only 16, I can't wait till he released the third (if he ever does) i am expcting it to be equal to Time out of Mind and Love and Theft.
B00005U122|1.0|I saw Waters on both the 1999 and 2000 leg of his U.S. tour.  Somehow, on this DVD, he has managed to drain all the joy, excitement, and exhiliaration from his live performances.  What remains is a strangely sterile parody of what I saw.  Even the camera shots are badly chosen.<BR> There is also a choppy, boring documentary on this DVD, which gave me no new insight into Waters or his band.
B00005JKT8|5.0|This is the kind of movie most of us have been waiting for. Hugh Jackman is the quintessial nobleman and proves that being a gentleman is not obsolete in the 21st century. He brings the looks and talent for which women would give up the vote. Meg Ryan would have made the role better if she had a decent haircut. I found her \\"unmade bed\\" look distracting. But with Mr. Jackman as the Duke, he more than made up the difference. The supporting cast was outstanding and for pure enjoyment, I give it a 10.
B00001QEE8|4.0|The Plantinum Edition DVD of this movie will be released in 2006! That means just 4 years of waiting and watching on VHS.  ::grin:: I've rented THIS DVD version, from the library, however and find that it's VERY lacking in bonus features, but that's ok as I assume that the Platinum release will just be great and bursting with special things.  <br />The Jungle Book is one of my favorites...I recommend it to everyone.  There's the ever-lovable Baloo and the hilarious Kaa...the 100 foot python.  And the fun-song soundtrack that will have  you bee-bopping for about 80 minutes...or well after!  It's too bad that Walt died just before this picture was completed.
0792153189|5.0|Deep impact is much more believable than Armageddon.  With months of prep time America and Russia build a makeshift space craft and send out a group of Astronauts to stop the comet from destroying Earth. <br />It is a shame that we had both Deep Impact and Armageddon come out so close together and the one that had more cash to promote there movie won out. I have seen this in the past, one of the best examples is Near Dark and The Lost Boys. Both good movies in there own right. However, Near Dark did not get the promotions that the Lost Boys did. and Near Dark just like Deep Impact was a 1000% better and more believable. The fact is the reason why Armageddon and The Lost Boy did better was mainly do to the fact of who played in each movie.<br />Over all Deep Impact will make you look up in the sky and wonder who is watching, and if they find something will they tell us in time??
078322799X|5.0|THE FRIGHTENERS is a wild, well-made, horror comedy that has alot of good special effects. In the small town of Fairwater, healthy people are dying from 'heart attacks,' but they are actually being murdered by an evil spirit known as The Grim Reaper. The only person in town who could possibly stop The Reaper is Frank Bannister, a psychic investigator who has the ability to see dead spirits. THE FRIGHTENERS is a good movie but it's also very underrated and not that many people have seen it, so I suggest you go out and pick it up now!
6305169187|2.0|This movie is for the person who would buy beach front property in Nevada. The movie starts with the world at the brink of destruction. With a little less than 3 WEEKS before the comet/asteroid his the Earth they pull of a load of miracles. First they are able to round up several people in the US to drill holes on the incoming space object. Second they pull to never before seen redesigned space shuttles, and are able to put special rovers that were going to Mars. Three, able to launch dock with a space station refuel and land on the object in space.<br />The fact is if the government saw this coming with less than <BR>three week before it hit, the only thing they would be thinking <BR>about is tiring to save as many people in the US as possible.<br />Great story if you have a gullible imagination, other wise it is a insult to anybody that thinks. If you want a good movie watch Deep Impact!!
B00005LQ04|2.0|Plain and simple -- I bought this DVD because every review raves about its atmospheric, frightening presence on screen.<BR>  This movie is NOT scary.  It's stupid.  The plot is dumb, the acting poor, and the ending is so weak I sat stunned in my chair.  Way too much dialogue, red herrings throughout the film, and rock music that adds NOTHING to the overall feel of the film.<BR>  I admit the camera work is artistic, but that's the only good thing I can say about this over-rated, simple film.<BR>  If it was that good, it would hold a better place in film history. <BR>  P.S.  Blood isn't orange..it's crimson. Fake, fake, fake. Don't buy this DVD..rent it first.<BR>  Scary to me is disturbing social matter and evil. This film doesn't even come close.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|This is an excellent purchase for those who don't know much about the band Kansas, but would like to get a sampler of some of this excellent band's music.. It has great hard rock staples, as well as longer and elaborate prog-rock epics. To me, that's what makes a best of album spectacular. It has the popular \\"Carry On Wayward Son,\\" the melodious quirk of \\"Point Of Know Return,\\" and the inspirational \\"Hold On,\\" just to name a few. However, my personal favorites are the extended prog numbers, like \\"Song For America\\" and \\"No One Together,\\" which are elaborate and complex in arrangement, with great vocals and melody, and what surprises one is the fact that guitarist Kerry Livgren wrote most of these elaborate pieces by himself. Kerry & company were a talented bunch, and it's nothing to be taken lightly. \\"The Closet Chronicles\\" is performed live, yet sounds as crisp as a studio recording. This is another one of those elaborate epics featuring great vocals, with outstanding musicianship. One should know that, for the time being, this live version can only be found on this collection, as it was omitted from the remastering of their live double CD, _Two For The Show_, in order to keep the disc from being double (which was pretty dumb.) It's a real shame, because I believe the live version of this song leaves the studio version in the dust.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this recording. If you like complex, elaborate, dramatic and sophisticated bands like Queen, you should love Kansas.
0517122707|5.0|I highly, highly recommend this book.  You will undoubtably laugh out loud till you cry.  This book is for the highly intellegent.  If you think you are part of this selective group, read the book.
B000053V9F|5.0|As a student of history (majoring in the latter 20th century), this film provides one of the definative overviews of the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of JFK. The film mostly follows the book by Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins, although there are some times when Stone throws in ideas from other conspiracy theories. <BR>In addition, the film has phenonomal performances by Kevin Costner (an actor whom i normally find mediocre at best) as Jim Garrison, Sissy Spacek as Garrison's long-suffering wife, Joe Pesci as David Ferrie (with Pesci playing one of his trademark annoying characters, but this time it actually serves to advance the plot), and Donald Sutherland, in my favourite role in the movie, as X. In addition to these fine performances are Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, John Lemmon, Walter Matthau and many more: this movie is virtual 'Who's Who' of Hollywood~ and don't forget Jim Garrison himself as Chief Justice Earl Warren!<BR>While this movie does not make everyone's top ten list, the movie portrays exactly what it was meant to: Garrison's exhaustive obsession with the events surrounding Kennedy before, during, and after his murder. Whether or not you agree with his conclusion is beside the point: this is the documentation of Garrison's search for his own personal Holy Grail. (You need to give the man credit on one point at least: how many people can actually slog their way through the Warren Commission Report in its entirety?)<BR>Summary: this film is a very moving story of one man's search for the truth despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. As long as you keep an open mind through the film, it is informative as well. While i am wisely choosing to keep my personal beliefs to myself, as they have no point in the review of a film, it should be remembered that there are several sides to every story, and a wise person will utilize as much information as is available to come to an educated conclusion as to whether Oswald acted alone, or the CIA had a role, or the mafia, or whether JFK is hiding in a log cabin in the mountains, playing cards with Jimmy Hoffa, Elvis, and Jim Morrison (as one tabloid printed several years ago.) This movie helped America to realize that the case of Kennedy's murder still has questions that still need to be answered (Why is the government still holding onto documents that should be viewable to the public under the Freedom of Information Act? Why did the CIA finally admit in 1977 that Clay Shaw *was* an Agent after all?) <BR>All in all, see the film. It does provide an interesting perspective on one of the most defining moments in the 20th century.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|it is very strange in the begining but as it goes on you relize that its very interesting its a very good musical and the casting is great every one in it is like there not them there there charicter. the first time  i saw it i thought i cant watch this then i just sat there for a second and got hooked on it i could watch the ending over and over again it is a great story and great music and a great movie i think it deserves more than 5 stars
B00004XQ83|5.0|I remember first viewing the previews for this movie and thinking to myself what a must-see it was certainly not. I had friends who went to see the movie and, while they never said much about the film itself, they were enchanted with its music. Having never owned a movie soundtrack, I had no interest in music for a movie I would not see. Then, during a trip to my local record store, I walked through the doors to be immediately swept back to my childhood.<br />The music I heard reminded me of a decade or so ago when I would sit on the floor by my grandfather's feet and listen to him strum his guitar and sing backwoods bluegrass songs. Two of the songs he would croon were, to my amazement, actually on the soundtrack. 'I'll Fly Away' and 'Big Rock Candy Mountain' are two songs that I have often found myself humming from time to time throughout the years. Now, they have been compiled with a wonderful arrangement of music to be the 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' soundtrack.<br />I will be the first to admit that this music is not for everyone, but for those of you who prefer the acoustic versions of songs over the original versions or for those who enjoy songs that truly tell a story and are relatable to your own trials and tribulations, this is definitely a cd you should own. The beauty of the human voice and stellar emotional depths are paramount in this collection. I fell in love with this music when I was just a child and to be given the gift of this music in adulthood is truly something I will never forget.
0385505833|1.0|Grisham has wisely decided to return to his roots with his most recent legal thriller, and that's where he ought to stay. While he is gifted in that particular genre, his attempts beyond have been disappointing. Skipping Christmas is the best example of all. If you bought this book because you wanted to contribute to the 9-11 charity it's proceeds go to--I applaud you. If you bought it for a short, fun read, I sympathize with you. I don't say this to be unkind, I believe Mr. Grisham may actually have thought he had a handle on the story. So I will break this to him gently--you didn't. Characters need just that, character. These were so one dimensional, and their actions so predictable, it was painful to read. But I did (shame on me). I kept thinking, surely, a unique twist or two is lurking only a page away. Nope. No unique twists, no revelations, no unexpected chuckles.<br />If you are thinking of reading this book, let me say this. Imagine for a moment, you and your spouse decide to skip Christmas--your only child won't be home--and take a cruise. The vast majority of your neighbors, friends and business associates have not progressed, emotionally, past the age of ten. They don't understand, they take it personally--what motivates them? Who knows, who cares. Throw in your child's sudden decision to return home, very unexpectedly, on Christmas Eve. Imagine all the hilarious mayhem that ensues. Got it? That's about all there is. Save your money, contribute to the charity of your choice, and read something else.
B0000029GA|5.0|It definitely AIN'T HARD TO TELL because it doesn't get any nastier than this.  Nas consistently comes equipped with the rawest, roughest, and toughest rhymes ever.  His flows are so powerful and dynamic that it took another two years before Jigga or should I say &quot;BROOKLYN'S FINEST&quot; could give any &quot;REASON&quot; to his.........&quot;DOUBT?&quot;  Nas keeps his strength, will, and might from beginning to end.  Now that's what true skills are made of.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album is really great because it has sarah's best songs from all of the albums throughout the years. She is able to really experience emotions & be able to sing about it. Sarah's is incredibly gifted person & her album is just wonderful. You can feel it when you listen too it & apply it to your own life. The lyrics are beautiful. I really liked Ice cream , Path of Thorns, Possession, Good enough & Sweet Surrender.I would recommend this--there isn't another album like it & it is just great.

There's never and will never be an album like this one.  Like \\"Big Poppa,\\" it was definitely done with STYLE and GRACE.  Also, it's quite evident how another infamous Brooklyn born MC has taken notice of this lyrical genius.  So much that he had to rob his own ghetto to attain a BLUEPRINT to build a \\"stable\\" foundation off of another one's greatness.  Hmmmmmmmmm, let us listeners be the judge?

B000002WPI|5.0|HANDS DOWN!!!  A true hip-hop head will definitely consider this one of the ultimate classic hip-hop albums ever.  \\"KEEPING IT REAL\\" is exactly what the Wu-Tang Clan did on this powerful debut disc.  It's hard choosing a favorite cut 'cause all are equal by my standards.  Each member sets their own tone in such a unique way that you can't help but to listen to this album over and over again.  Chemistry is the key ingredient as to making magic happen on wax.  If this one is not in your collection, most definitely, you better PROTECT YA NECK!!!!
0140386335|5.0|Die Unendliche Geschichte (The Neverending Story) is the best book ever written and I cherish my two copies as holy relics.<BR>As a child I read the translated version, but now I have also read the German original and it is so much better than the translation. I urge everyone who can't read German to go learn it. The book is definitely worth it.
B000002KCV|4.0|Neil Young has never been a first tier &quot;maga-star&quot; sort of artist.  Although he has an exceedingly large body of work--few rock artists have been as prolific as Young--his work tends not to make it much into the mainstream media unless there's a bona fide &quot;hit' in the lineup.  Comes a Time is entirely devoid of such a song.<br />Moreover, the album was issued in between the highly anticipate and acclaimed Decade retrospective album and Young's Rust Never Sleeps, which had an abundance of \\"hits\\" in it's lineup.  As a result, this is an often overlooked album, which is a shame as it is one of Young's most unique efforts and marks a major fault line in his career.<br />The albums that preceded Comes a Time (decade excepted) were very hard, dark albums like Tonight's the Night, not even remotely mainstream offerings.  Composed and released during a time of great personal stress for Young (deaths of close friends, serious disease among his children) these albums were so dark, so depressing, that even many long time hard core Neil Young fans were put off.<br />Comes a time represents the return of sunshine-the coming through the trough to find that life was still good on many fronts-and is one of the most mellow, positive, good natured of all of Young's albums.<br />While there may be no monster hits there is some very good work here, particularly the title track as well as songs that since release have become standard [parts of Young's live repertoire such as Lotta Love, and Already One.  However, as is often the case with Young's albums, there are some true gems buried among these tracks that aren't as well known, particularly Human Highway and Peace of Mind.<br />This is not your typical Neil Young album, but it well worth a listen. Particularly for the non fan.
6304712936|5.0|This film is extrapolated from half truths about Mozart's life.  It tells the story of Salieri, court composer of Vienna, a mediocre composer and his genius rival Mozart.  Salieri has the ability to recognize divine music, and he longs to create such music himself but he doesn't have enough talent.  Mozart, has the talent but, in Salieri's eyes, is unworthy of the gift.  &quot;Why,&quot; he asks God, &quot;do you give me the urge but not the means?&quot;<br />Mozart's music is for the most part chosen well for the score.  It focuses mainly on his operas, and many of Mozart's more famous pieces will not be heard.  The only thing that I can't forgive are the singers performing opera segments in English.<br />F. Murray Abraham is brilliant as Salieri.  The scenes where he plays an aged Salieri and the scene in which he renounces God are very stirring.  The image of the old composer's face seamlessly flowing from a look of musical rapture to a snarl of envy saturated hatred gives me chills every time I see it.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Not much to say!  BUY IT TODAY!! NOW, pay for overnight shipping!  This is progressive at its best, it is a bit harder then some others and it is wonderful!<br />OK, did I make myself clear?  Its a 10 STARS GOOD!
B000002UZ1|5.0|This collection would be my reccomended starting point for teenagers wanting to discover the Beatles. It has Let It Be, one of ther best songs of all time, on it, plus other great Lennon/McCartney tracks like Come Together, Don't Let Me Down, Get Back and Come Together and well as underrated Harrison classics such as While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Something and Here Comes The Sun. Fantastic, 5 stars.
6302516919|5.0|Stephen King's novels have formed the basis for a great many horror films over the last quarter century.  Some have been superlative (CARRIE, THE SHINING), others just terrible (PET SEMATARY, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE).  CHRISTINE can be counted among the superlative ones.  Under the expert hands of HALLOWEEN director John Carpenter, this film provides the requisite chills and atmosphere minus a lot of unnecessary blood and gore.<br />Keith Gordon stars as a geeky high school student named Arnie Cunningham who is always getting picked upon by the local school bullies (sound familiar?).  But when he eyes a rusted old 1957 Plymouth Fury, his life really turns around.  Over the objections of his best friend (John Stockwell), he fixes it up at a local garage (run by a salty-tongued Robert Prosky) to a point where the car is as good as new.  Gordon even starts up a relationship with the high school dream queen (Alexandra Paul).  There's just one problem, though.  Christine won't let it go that far.<br />For this '57 Fury is definitely possessed, and pretty soon it takes possession of Gordon.  When the school bullies retaliate against Gordon by trashing Christine, the car repairs itself and goes after the perpetrators one by one.  But the car also reacts in a jealous and homicidal way against Paul, who nearly chokes on a hamburger at a drive-in with Gordon.  And when Paul and Stockwell come to realize that Gordon is indeed totally over the edge, they plot to destroy the car, using a bulldozer inside Prosky's garage.  Unfortunately, Gordon dies in the final melee.  And although Christine itself seems to be crushed to a metal cube, in the tag end scene, a metal piece can be seen repairing itself...<br />Although the setting of the film is changed from King's novel (there, it was western Pennsylvania; in the film, it's southern California), CHRISTINE for the most part stays true to the basic essentials of the book in its depiction of high school bullies and teenage life during 1978-79, which is the era depicted.  There is a certain appropriateness to having Christine's radio play nothing but early rock and roll records, like Little Richard's \\"Keep A Knockin'\\", and Thurston Harris' \\"Little Bitty Pretty One\\", while most of the other songs are of the late 70s (\\"Runaway\\" by Bonnie Raitt, \\"Bad To The Bone\\" by George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers).<br />Carpenter makes sure that the emphasis on the movie is on the situations in Gordon's life that lead him to Christine, and how letting his life get totally dominated by that car eventually scares the living daylights out of Stockwell and Paul.  Furthermore, he does this in the same suspenseful fashion that made HALLOWEEN work to such a tee.  His and Alan Howarth's synthesizer-dominated music score lends further atmosphere to the proceedings.  Some may complain about the slight excess of profanity in the screenplay, but it is typical of King's work and appropriate in the way it depicts teenage behavior.<br />CHRISTINE does, as many point out, bear a resemblance to the much underrated (or much maligned) 1977 thriller THE CAR.  But it is unique in its own way.  And for those seeking something more than mad slashers and buckets of blood, CHRISTINE is well worth watching.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this film in the theater just before it went out, and lucky enough to make this one of the first DVDs in my collection.  Upon second viewing, I can only praise this movie more.  The acting by all involved is brilliant, and nothing is added in or left out in the way of plot or dialogue; this movie is absolutely seamless.  This is one you can't miss; Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey give the performances of a lifetime.  Run out and grab this one, it's worth every cent!
B00003CXIY|4.0|Excellent movie: all actors plays an incredible succesfull game, you don't sytop laughing dureing all the movie but it also makes you follow the entire movie.
0553274503|5.0|Whatever scientific bearing it may have, the general gist of the book is this- ignorance is bliss.  The Charlie working at the bakery was much happier than the Charlie at his mental and creative peak.  The book also explores how intelligence and maturity are two very different things.  While Charlie is on Alice Kinnian's intellectual level, he is still an awkward adolescent in his mind.  His rapid growth in intelligence has set what should be a gradual and balanced simulaneous mental maturity akimbo.  An excellent read that no one should miss out on.
B00005MP58|4.0|I have seen the series on VHS tapes and there <BR>were quite a few scenes on the DVD in the wide-<BR>screen format that you were able to see more of.<BR>This only enhanced the fine performance of the<BR>actors involved.

Yes, the <BR>background is a little darker on the DVD than <BR>the VHS tapes but the series, the acting and <BR>not least the improved stereo on my iMac is <BR>still great. I've heard of horror stories from <BR>others that weren't happy with the DVD so I <BR>was afraid to spend my money on the DVD in <BR>case I got one of the 'bad' ones but now, I <BR>am glad I did get the DVD and I don't have<BR>to worry about wearing out my VHS tapes!!

B000001IPM|5.0|This cd is exactly why the Offspring are my all-time favorite band. Dexter Holland has his freat vocals, Greg K is good at bass, and Ron is ok at drums - but what really makes this band is Noodles, with those amazing riffs...<br />As to songs - Time to relax is a pretty cool intro<br />Nitro (youth Energy) 9/10 this song's ok, a good start to the album<br />Bad Habit 9.5/10 This song's awesome! nice bass at the beginning, and the road rage part is good<br />Gotta Get Away 9.5/10 pretty good, at first I didn't like it for some reason but it's pretty good...Ron's not very good in this one though<br />Genocide 9/10 - an all out punk song, pure Offspring...pretty good<br />Something to believe in 9.5/10 more of the classic Offspring punk rock genre<br />Come out and Play 9.5/10 - this song set the example for lots of other punk rock groups...this is a great song, kinda uncharacteristic for the Offspring...sort of like Pretty Fly compared to the rest of Americana<br />Self Esteem 11/10 - My 3rd favorite song by them...this is a great song! Dexter's voice is perfect and Noodles is awesome -<br />It'll be a Long time 8.5/10 - Another song kind of like Genocide, but Dexter's voice isn't that good in this one<br />Killboy powerhead 8.5/10 - not that good...a remake of a song by some other group I can;t remember...<br />What Happened to you 9/10 - They go into skapunk, and come up with a pretty decent song, better than most out there<br />So Alone 9/10 a short explosive song...pretty cool<br />Not the One 11.5/10 - weird rating, but this is my 2nd favorite song...awesome meaning and great guitar...my favorite song is Staring at the Sun on Americana in case you're wondering<br />Smash 10/10 - Nice ending!
B00003CXZ3|2.0|Although it's based on an interesting concept--that of short-term memory loss--I have difficulty understanding why anyone likes this film. It's very violent, plus the nature of the story requires the same scenes to be played over and over.  Enough already! We got the point! The same point could be made in a much more interesting fashion.  The production was fine, but overall I found this film to be a real downer.
B000002U82|5.0|Quite simpley this is the greatest rock album yet to date by the greatest rock band of all time. <BR>There is nothing done by any other band (Beatles included) that even comes close to the innovation of Dark Side of the Moon.<BR>The deep dark moody lyrics that explore the human soul and the search for the meaning of life leave all other songs lightyears behind.<BR>Then there is David Gilmour's awesome guitar work that clearly shows that he is easily one of the greatest and most innovative guitar players of the past 30+ years.
B000002U8G|5.0|pink floyd has always been one of my favorite bands. i have almost all of their albums (from 1967 to 1979 at least), and each one is more stunning than the next. but, 'meddle,' is particularly striking because it's so bizarre, so random. there are sounds here that i never knew instruments could make, and all the songs fit together beautifully.<br />the first song, 'one of these days,' is my favorite. the first three minutes are pretty disturbing noises, and then it goes into one of the loudest songs pink floyd have ever recorded. the next song, 'a pillow of winds,' is just a little acoustic fluff to help the listener recover from how harrowing the previous track is.<br />'fearless,' is a great little folk-rock number, but the next two songs are a little forgettable. they're by no means bad, but they don't have the concentration the previous pieces have. but all the tracks on the album are just openings for, 'echoes,' the most complex, beautiful, and interesting song pink floyd have ever recorded. it opens with a very distant-sounding piano playing a pulse, and the keyboards gradually come in. then drums, and finally guitar. the music is complimented by beautiful singing by david gilmour, but then the song completely changes, and goes into a long, funky instrumental, which has one of gilmours best guitar solo's to date. after that, some some keyboard noodling (as is usually the case on their longer songs), and then goes back to the original theme.<br />i could not rate this album higher. it's an astounding work, that has survived the test of time.
B00005K3O4|4.0|The movie is a must have if you are a fan of funny, poorly produced and poorly acted horror movies. The movie is great in its cornyness! Even though the budget of the movie shows greatly It still has wonderful Fx and makeup. Alien Klowns arrive in a town Via a flying crius tent. A rookie cop and some college kids are the only ones that can stop the blood sucking klown's evilness! A great movie to watch on a sleepy boring day. Pick it up! it rocks!
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya has one of the most angelic voices I have ever heard in music today.  I know whenever I feel stressed out that a spin of Enya will calm my nerves.  It is not the kind of music to clean house by as it will not get your blood pumping.  However, it is the most calming music out there and it is safer than Protzac, with no side effects.  All of the songs are excellent and there are a few that have a little spunk to them.  I rated this a four because my favorite one is &quot;Paint The Sky With Stars.&quot;  Whenever I played this c.d. at work all my customers would come up and ask if they could buy a copy, unfortunately I only sold books.  But there is a quality about Enya's music that captures your soul and takes you away to a gentler place.  Look out &quot;Calgon&quot;  you've been replaced.
B00005YTFG|5.0|While watching this movie, I've found that it is almost impossible to not get drawn into the plot and the amazing characters that drive this movie skyward. The effects are spectacular, the dancing phenomenal, and the music and sets are simply stunning. Hats off to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor for their performances, which are nothing less than oscar-worthy. Baz Luhrmann has taken a genre that has been fading rapidly throughout the past several decades, and has brought the movie musical back in a way that could only be done by him.  <br />This movie redefines what a musical should be with its classic tragic love story, wonderful songs, and exotic setting. Moulin Rouge clearly shows us how love triumphs over all within the exotic arena of one of the most risque nightclubs of the world. The eccentricity of the cast as well as the high-energy pace that this movie moves at is a complement to the director and the cast, who truly developed this movie into one that will not soon be forgotten.<br />As a musician, I applaud the hard work and talent that it takes to make a movie musical, and I have to say that this is one of the best portrayals I have seen in a long time. the glamour of the Moulin Rouge along with the music of today truly makes this a movie worth remembering.;
B00005V0X5|5.0|The whole album sounds great!  It kinda sounds like they just recorded it.  Chosen ones has to be my fav right now, I didnt't care for it before because it was hard to listen to but now it just rocks.  The vocals on the album are so clear you can really tell Mustaine had a different way of singing when he first began and that gives this a really unique feel.  And what more can be said about Gar?  His drumming on this album I feel total outshines the epic peace sells, only because this was a time when speed metal was new and their music was open to his amazing jazz influence!  Buy this record!  Even if you own the old one, this is NOT some cheesy remaster, this is the way Megadeth wanted it!  And be sure to get a kick out of the hilarious \\"These Boots\\" with the beeps, it adds a funny charm to the cover.  All around A+!
B00005R2IS|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the most original and one of the best action movies around.  I first saw it when I was 15 and though I thought it was a little wierd and disturbing at the time, I just couldn't help liking it.  I still like it today, too.  After Mel Gibson's wife is killed, he just goes after her murderers and is total merciless!  The most memorable scene, to me, is the one where Max handcuffs one of the killers to a car, rigs it to explode, and then gives the guy a hacksaw, saying something like &quot;You've got five minutes to live.  You could cut threw the handcuffs in ten.  You could probably cut threw your wrist in 4.&quot;  That is such a cool scene!<BR>Anyway, I wasn't going to write a review of this film until I read the review under mine.  The one written by Mark Dewey from Australia.  At the end of his review he says &quot;USA We're with you Sept. 11 2001&quot;, and, being someone who was deeply affected by the attacks, that just warmed my heart and made me smile with thanks knowing that even someone from the other side of the globe is supporting us.  Thank you, Mark Dewey.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This film is something so new--it basically reinvents the small genre cliche` that is the 'rock musical'. The DVD is spectacular, especially the commentary and the documentary, \\"Whether you like it or not: the story of Hedwig\\". The documentary is captivating, a full 85 minutes long, and you learn all the background history of everyone involved with Hedwig from the time it was a small off-broadway play to now. John Cameron Mitchell is an absolute genius. He is such a talented actor and director. What is more is that he is rather convincing as a female--his androgeny is gorgeous and real. And he has such an ability to convey feelings through a simple facial expression. He has an amazing voice, too. Stephen Trask is brilliant. The music is beautiful and fun, so well-written, etc.. These two work well together, obviously. Unlike many other existing and potential 'cult films', this one is amazing in every sense, fan base aside. Please be open-minded and do not write Hedwig off as a camp glam-rock romp--it is so much more than that. It ia very symbolic and anyone can relate to Hedwig or another character. It is hilarious, fun, poignant, and more. There is great evolution of character and story, and it was shot so well. The costumes and makeup were fabulous too, courtesy of Arianne Philips and Mike Potter. <BR>If Hedwig should be awarded with an Academy Award, then Academy Awards will now mean something.<BR>See this film--purchase the DVD, it is a great investment, not to be regretted.
6301954947|5.0|\\"Waterloo\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" (the original movie) vy for top place in my heart as favorite movie of all time. Needless to say, I LOVE this film!<BR>The battle scene is tremendous. It is a display of colour and cinematography the like of which you will never see again! With all this computer generated stuff, massed battle scenes become easy to manufacture but believe me, NONE of them can match what you see here because it was all done with real people. The expense for the extras and uniforms that must have been spent will leave you in awe!<BR>OK, enough of the battle scene - that and the authenticity of the battle has been covered expertly by another reviewer. Something has to be said about the acting, however - excellent by all who were in it. Steiger plays a believeble Napoleon who is starting to doubt his own military prowess, and Wellington plays a marvellous English aristocrat.<BR>Before the battle scene, all is not just military talk, but there is a hint of love stories between a few of the characters that almost seem out of place. Although they are woven into the story well, a friend explained to me that \\"Waterloo\\" is merely an edited version of a much longer mini-series type of thing that was originally produced in Russia! That explains the extras en masse, and the fact that some of the charaters seem to be dubbed. That's 'cause they are! It also explains why, as another reviewer pointed out, that some of the characters seem underdeveloped. When I first heard this, it left me feeling kind of cheated, especially as that might have meant that some of the battle scene was missed out too. <BR>Something has to be said about the odd avoidable errors that exist within the film. Some of them you may only spot if you are a true aficionado, and if you have seen the film more than 50 times, as I am sure I have. The ballroom scene - someone thought it would be really nice to have the soldiers in dress uniform doing a waltz with the ladies in beautiful white, flowing dresses. The colourful spectacle was wonderful, as was the music (called the \\"Waterloo Waltz\\" just in case you don't have the soundtrack, and used in \\"War and Peace\\", too), but OOPS! Didn't anyone mention that the waltz was not invented until the END of the 19th century? Another obvious anachronism is one scene in the battle with a telegraph pole that I am told is there, but have yet to find myself.<BR>There is one really annoying part of the battle scene that I have to mention. When the French heavy cavalry charge at the British squares, the action is also filmes from the air, so that you are looking directly down on the battle. The cavalry charge in from the top of the scene, but why are there puffs of rifle smoke coming from all the squares on ALL the sides of each square. There is nothing there to shoot at, so it looks as though the squares are firing at each other. ... See \\"Waterloo\\" and be truly amazed! Enjoy!
B0000027RL|3.0|This is not the best Pearl Jam album. Vitalogy and No Code far surpass it. I have always tried being a PJ fan, but the thing that sometimes takes away from my listening experience can be perfectly illustrated with Ten: their albums usually contain 2 (or sometimes 3) outstanding songs, and about 10 other somewhat unimpressive ones. The songs often give an impression of being thrown together with no order or sense of unity to complete an album. Vitalogy and No Code are the only 2 albums that have consistently good songs and a consistent feel to them that make them seem like albums.<br />As for the songs on Ten, Jeremy and Alive are definitely 2 of the best songs of the 90's. But the others?<br />Once- I don't like this song at all. Not sure where it's going, and the melody is mediocre. (2 stars)<BR>Even Flow- a very catchy and energetic song with great music, but that doesn't really go anywhere. So it's good, but not great. (3 stars)<BR>Why Go- same opinion as Even Flow. (3)<BR>Black- a very pretty song, but again, doesn't really go anywhere. With Pearl Jam, you know they can do better because they give you a taste of the better, so a song like Black merits about 4 stars, but not 5.<BR>Oceans- for some reason I find this forgettable (?).<BR>Porch- very brash, very good. (4)<BR>Garden- this is a beautiful song with beautiful lyrics. Just not up there with Jeremy and Alive. (4)<BR>Deep- same as Even Flow. (3)<BR>I somehow just don't have an opinion on 'Release'.<br />So overall, not as great as 95% of Vitalogy and No Code, although I enjoy Ten much better than Vs., another album that throws you a taste of what they are capable of and then chickens out.<br />That said, Eddie Vedder writes some great lyrics and has one of the best voices EVER in rock (too bad this causes hapless people like the Creed dude to shamelessly and irritatingly copy him).
B00005V9QJ|5.0|From the opening notes of Cherish the Day to the ending note of It's a Crime, we are treated to one of the most talented voices around. Live recordings can be tricky and down right just bad. But Ms. Adu shines on this outing. Her voice is just as smooth and enchanting as ever. What is a nice surprise is the band. They are not just simply there to back her up, but are as just as much a driving force behind the music. Top notch tight playing gives each song a new depth that is not heard on the wonderfull studio recordings. Strong solos,tight percussion and ohh so sexy sax take over when she is not singing. One nice addition to your collection.....<br />Thank You Sade may your star shine on
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I hate musicals, when i saw the trailer for Moulin Rouge i thought that it was a stylish drama film, but then i saw it was a musical and i said &quot;Oh, no&quot;&quot;, but i saw it and  it's really good, the acting is fantastic, the visuals are too, the soundtrack is wonderful and tells the story in a very appropiate way, too bad it only maked 57 million bucks at the box office
0385505833|1.0|Like other reviewers, I had great expectations from this book. Not just because it's a Grisham work. The first several chapters set the stage for a fantastic, groundbreaking  story. The very thought that one couple's idea to go out of town for Christmas would cause such a stir is, indeed, hilarious.<br />Once the fantastic stage is set, however, everything goes downhill. Near the beginning of the story -- as the adventure begins -- it's easy to sympathize (and empathize) with the characters. At the end, frankly, I couldn't wait for them to shut up, celebrate the holiday their own way, and tell their lousy neighbors to butt out.<br />You don't need to have your lawn and house aglow to Celebrate the holiday. You don't need a tree in your house. You just need your family. And that's the message I was hoping would be intrinsic to this dog of a book. Oh well. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Ptooey.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is a very faitful adaptation to the book, this is a higly unusual thing that has happened, so far this film, \\"Stand By Me\\", and \\"LOTR\\", truly do keep up to the spirit of the book, the storyline is very good, but it could have been excellent if they shouldn'have cut the Norbert stuff, it felt that they butchered the book there, but is still acceptable, the special FX are really good, though in LOTR are better, this ones are still sharp, the acting is very good, but Daniel Radcliffe needs to express more his feelings,he did a better job on David Copperfield, but otherwise he will improve, but he still is a very good actor, the camerawork is excellent it truly does feel like magic, the music is really good, is almost as good as all the music by John Williams, but it dosen't become one of his top five, but it still works truly to the film, anyways this film ranked number 2 on my 2001 top ten list, if i hadn't seen LOTR it would have been number 1.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Now that this album has been cleaned up, I can finally see how amazing it really is.  I've never heard anything like this in my life, and truly doubt that I ever will again.  If you are a fan of metal, you owe it to yourself to hear this.  BTW, the track listings here aren't correct.  The first 7 are, but then there is a version of \\"These Boots\\" with all the \\"vile and offensive\\" lyrics bleeped out, and then 3 demos of \\"Last Rites/Loved To Death\\", \\"Mechanix\\", and \\"Looking Down The Cross\\".  This cd is worth much more than the asking price!
B000002BPS|4.0|It's true, it's emotional, it can be related to life, and it is straight to the point. \\"Ixnay On The Hombre\\" is not just a simple CD that teenagers can relate their social and emotional problems to, such as many reviewers like to categorize it. This is an album that does what the Offspring did best (before the release of \\"Americana\\" and \\"Conspiracy Of One\\"), and that was take a look at all the screwed up problems in life, socially as well as politically and mental battles and demons that we all must face everyday, regardless of age, sex, or any other characteristics. This is simply the best album the band ever put out, being the most musical and guitar-driven, with some of the hardest-hitting songs they've written as far as lyrics go.<br />I always admired Dexter's lyrics and honesty from \\"Smash\\" and he didn't fail his fans on \\"Ixnay\\". Here he addresses that typical social issues such as conformity (\\"The Meaning Of Life\\", \\"Cool To Hate\\", \\"I Choose\\"), pressures of life (\\"All I Want\\", \\"Amazed\\") and various other common inner demons. The fear of turning out like your parents is addressed in \\"Way Down The Line\\", the loss of loved ones is touched on in \\"Gone Away\\", and avoiding potential bad habits and addictions in \\"Don't Pick It Up\\". \\"Change The World\\" is simple an awesome song as well.<br />It is always interesting to watch Dexter's sarcasm to social classes and stereotyping in action, as he brightly shows us in \\"Cool To Hate\\", not to mention his humorous yet true stoner anthem, \\"Mota\\". \\"Me & My Old Lady\\" is perverse to a degree, but tame in light of some of the more aggressive tunes out there.<br />Offspring fans should obviously dig this as IMO it is their truest effort and the one with the most sweat and work put into it. Anyone looking for some heavy alternative and punk will definitely appreciate this as well.
B00005QFHG|5.0|I just finished watching this film for the 3rd time. Wonderful to have the time to watch it by myself this third time. To put all my emotions into it. Juliette Binoche has the appearance of a perfect flower. The acting, the lives of small town studiously religious inhabitants being interrupted by a chocolate shop. A movie to savour with all your senses.
B00005U2LM|5.0|This is by far the best Wu Tang album in years.  I don't understand how anyone can call themselves a true Wu Tang fan and hate on this album. &quot;Babies&quot; has to be one of the best songs they have ever done.  GZA shows why he is one of the best emcees.  Also, besides there being no sign of the incarcerated ODB, all the true Wu members finally get their chance to shine again.  Unlike &quot;The W&quot;, which was a good album, where there were too many guest stars and too much Cappadonna.  I mean, Cappa is alright, but he is not a true member in my mind.  This album is simply a return to the glory days.
0141180870|4.0|Originally I had intended to compose an essay of sorts, but I no longer wish to devote too much of my time on this endeavor, so I will simply type here extempore.<br />Fitzgerald was, in my subservient opinion, one of the greatest novelists of the last century. I think he holds his own against the mightiest of authors: Joyce, Steinbeck, Faulkner, and even Henry James.<br />The Beautiful and Damned is a tragic and even, dare I say, realistic portrayal of the society so enamored with, and so madly ascetic to, aestheticism and wealth. It's a tale of a young couple: a Harvard graduate who ( spoiler! ) eventually amounts to nothing despite his pedagogical superiority, and a beauteous but fallible woman whose beauty disintegrates like so many mortals before us. It's an account of perfidy and defiance, obstinacy towards time and the havoc that she wrecks upon all lovely and ripe wights, be it organic like Gloria or inanimate like metal.<br />While the story itself is not as captivating as The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald's brilliant pen is ostensibly evident in commanding the text. I would venture to say that the composition is equivalent and even superlative to his most renowned tome - that is, at moments it can be. The problem with this novel is that it's simply too lengthy. Were it one hundred pages shorter, I feel that Fitzgerald could have made a sharper impact on the reader, but too many pages are slathered on repeated episodes of the same events.<br />The Beautiful and Damned is still a fine book and easily considered a &quot;classic&quot; and a definite read for those who enjoyed Gatsby, but it's not the work that catapulted its writer to world notoriety.
B000002GBD|5.0|I'd like to know the ages of some of my fellow reviewers.  I was a teenager in the mid-70's, so I LIVED THIS!  Nazareth's &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; was such a powerful presence, this album was an absolute must in our 8-track players and at our parties, alongside albums by such hard rock staples as Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin.  So, who's calling &quot;Love Hurts&quot; a &quot;power ballad&quot;?  It never occurred to me to attach a label to this song.  I'd rather not attach labels, thank you.  Plain and simple, it's a great song.  The album's title song, however, was hands-down the favorite of my crowd. The band at my boyfriend's prom (he was a year behind me) played it -- despite lyrics that were rather shocking by 1977 standards! -- and we all screamed out the words to the chorus along with the band (undoubtedly to the dismay of the chaperones).  This was a very important album in the 70's.  I'm overjoyed to find it's available on CD now. My vinyl copy is a bit worn out, and I just can't get the 8-track to play at all!
B00005V0X5|5.0|What else can you say about the best heavy metal band on the planet?  To have Megadeth's original album digitally re-mastered with original song demos included as bonus tracks is a dream come true.  Megadeth has done such a great job restoring the original recordings to digital standards that this album sounds as if it was just recorded!  I would recommend this album to any Megadeth fan or anybody that would like to witness first hand the birth of Thrash Metal the way it was meant to be heard.  This recording features the original Megadeth lineup of Dave Mustaine, David Ellefson, Chris Poland, and Gar Samuelson.  Rest in peace Gar.  You are part of a legacy that will never be forgotten.
0684803356|4.0|Laurie Lee told me that he had met Ernest Hemingway. Whether or not it was during the Spanish Civil War or not, I don't recall<BR>. What I remember most is his acidulous critique of the blundering All-American dolt who thinks he is the only one who can sort it out...He remembered great Paul Robeson, who will always be remembered( -I take it that many correspondents already take me as black.) Robeson was a great follower in battle, a great propagandist, and therefore a great warrior.<BR>  Lee railed , in his inimical Gloucestershire, about 'The Big Cowboy' who thought he could lead these tender men to battle. He was kind, to the point of sheer tenderness, about Hemingway as a supporter of the people's great struggle, but he always saw him as impossibly arrogant, (I think), as a forerunner of today's all too cowboyish thickhead, who could I be thinking of?
B00005R2M3|5.0|Before I started hearing Shakira's song, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; all over the radio, I knew nothing about her--I didn't even know she existed! But as soon as that song started playing on the radio, I knew this artist was a winner...I knew she had talent and knew she was going to make it big. Little did I know that she was already making it big...Internationally! Anyway, I continued to listen to the radio to see who that song was sung by, and then I heard the DJ say &quot;...And that was Shakira, the popular Latin singer with her first English debut single, 'Whenever, Wherever', and the album is called LAUNDRY SERVICE.&quot; Well, that's all I needed to hear. Almost instantly, I went out and bought this CD. I listened to it right away and loved it!<br />All of the songs on LAUNDRY SERVICE are original and upbeat, with a mix of Latin and Pop. Shakira's vocals are very strong, and she is not another Britney. Other songs I love on this CD are &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Fool&quot;, and especially her Spanish tracks. But all of the songs are really good. If you are already a Shakira fan, then LAUNDRY SERVICE is a must own. But, if you are not, then you should still buy this album because it is great! One of 2001's best albums.
B00005UEAR|1.0|I am very disappointed in this CD. These guys are some of the best musicians in the world and they recorded this?. Most of it makes no sense at all. There are no songs here. This is a background of sound for guys to play over.Nothing original and nothing impressive like tracks 8 and 9 form Metropolis 2. No melody like was so evident on I&amp;W. Send them back to the studio and do this over!!
B00005QDW1|1.0|I am a very big No Doubt fan--I own their last two albums, TRAGIC KINGDOM and RETURN OF SATURAN and love them both! But ROCK STEADY is a horrible album. The only good song is the first single, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, which happens to be very catchy. Is No Doubt trying to do rap or hip-hop? And sure, the album itself LOOKS cool, but the music on here is not. Gwen Stefani's vocals are better than ever, but the lyrics and music just doesn't live up to their other previous albums. I'll skip ROCK STEADY (I borrowed this CD at my town's library), and I'll just buy the &quot;Hey Baby&quot; CD-Single instead. This album was very disappointing and I think a lot of No Doubt fans were disappointed with it, too. I think No Doubt is getting desparate for more fans so they are trying to get little teenyboppers into them or something. Sorry, but this album was bad. I think I'll go and buy Shakira's new English debut, LAUNDRY SERVICE, instead!
B00005TT77|4.0|First things first, Beb Harper, YES. If there could possibly be an improved version of Strawberry Fields......, this is it. Talk about projecting so much arrogance on a cover that you completely make it yours without totally changing the original concept. The harmony is fabulous. Next, Rufus,Rufus,Rufus. Across The Universe was written for him. He sings it with confidence and power, and includes elements the original didn't need, but could have included,(Bass Guitar, three part harmony, etc. Eddie Vedder sounds great on ....Hide Your Love. And Stereophonics gives Don't Let Me Down a Beautiful Blues feel with it's Laid back vocals and Acoustic Guitars. Aimee and Michael, The two of Them performed Two Of Us like john intended, two people, actually in love singing to each other. Sarah Mclachlan, Wallflowers, The Vines, and Ben Folds do good jobs with their respective classics, not straying to far from the originals. Chocolate Genius, whoever you are, YOU ROCK! Turning a gloomy abstract song to someones Mother,(Julia), into a song that someones mother could actually dance to. If I didn't mention them, I was not impressed by their renditions, except Howie Day. I liked his Laid Back, almost dire approach to needing Help, wheras, John made you help him. Grandaddys' Revolution sounds like The Sex Pistols. Paul Westerbergs' Nowhere Man goes nowhere but you listen because it's a classic like all the other Mediocre attempts. Overall, its the best Beatles tribute album I've ever heard, with the exception of Reloader. If you can find Reloader in your town get it. A bunch of unknown bands rocking classics Like, Norweigen Wood, Ticket to Ride, a great version of Michelle, and All You Need is Love in true stereo. But as for I AM SAM, I AM PLEASED!!!!! Peace from T the Black Lennon.........ChiTown
B000002572|5.0|I have owned this album on vinyl, 8-track, cassette and CD. There is not a clunker on this album from beginning to end. Yes, the standouts are More Than a Feeling, Peace of Mind, Rock N Roll Band, Foreplay/Long Time Let Me Take You Home Tonight, and Smokin---the weaker ones Hitch a Ride, Something About You.<br />With Brad Delp's searing vocals, the sound of multi-tracked screaming Gibson Les Paul and SG Guitars, and nice 12-string acoustic work, this album is about as perfect an album as you can get!<br />This album is incredibly good. Buy it now and play it loud!
B00005TT77|1.0|I love the Beatles. Now with that said, this album sound's like a who's who of todays most popular (not most talented) musicians put together by the same marketing team that brought us NSYNC. If you like the original songs then you have heard this album. The covers are bland uninspired carbon copies off the originals, with no creative interpretation on the part of the artist, no risk taking here.  However, Eddie Vedder does produce the one shinning beam of hope but it is surrounded by mediocrity.  With the exception of Eddie Vedder's track the other artist seemed to be falling over themselves just to not offend anyone on their big chance at mass exposure.  For some reason, the female performers produced eceptionally weak tracks that really grinded on my nerves.  If you like most of the unispired attempts to get money out of you pockets with an &quot;Allstar Cast!&quot; that come out every week, then you just love this one.  Absolutely nothing original or artistically enduring , besides Eddie Vedder's solo work, exists on this CD.
0784011206|5.0|I thought the final speech by Rambo was a classic one.  Bashing Stallone for not articulating well enough is a bunch of bull.  The man was very confused and obviously disturbed.  It does make sense for Rambo not to make sense of what he said!  I know a few vets who have seen this movie and enjoyed it the whole way through.  Some may call a few scenes hard to believe, specifically the jump, but if I am not mistaken, the book has the same situation with little difference.  Rambo is a classic action movie that will be quoted and remembered forever.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I LOVE \\"Kate & Leopold\\".  Oh sure, the story is lightweight, there are some holes and inconsistencies, but with the gorgeous Hugh Jackman around, who cares!  He is perfect as Duke Leopold, handsome, sexy, charming, charisma to spare, and all but steals the film from his co-star.  Since seeing this movie I have rented or purchased Jackman's other films and he has talent to spare....the films are all totally different but the one constant is that Jackman inhabits his characters and is the focal point.  Okay, I'm obsessed with him, but there are worse things than that.

6305268843|5.0|I can't really say anymore than what has already been said after reading all of these reviews. This movie just takes my breath away. The music is so much a part of the film, also. I've been checking these reviews to see if anyone has found it anywhere. I finally said something to my husband and he had some luck. I just received my copy today (an early Valentine's present!) and it is exquisite. [....]
0790729628|5.0|...Anyway, about the movie; Ridley Scott portrays a world where \\"Replicants\\" (extremely human AI intelligence) is unwanted.  They become out of control and lethal.  Blade Runners are sent to \\"retire\\" them.  Harrison Ford's job as a Blade Runner is to round up a team of Replicants known as Nexus 6.<br />  These particular Replicants are stronger, more agile than humans and capable of mass destruction.  But Who is looking for Who?<br />  Ford's character, Deckard is sent to eliminate them, but simultaniously, the Nexus 6 \\"pack\\" (who include Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) are looking for Tyrell...the man and coorporation who made them. He only developed Nexus 6 with a 4 year lifespan and the Nexus 6 are looking for life.  It's a gritty world of who will get who first.  Ridley Scott creates a most fantastical world that feels dirty, futuristic, hard, and it has his signature darkness pierced with beaming lights. It makes the movie \\"the Fifth Element\\" seem child-like.  I watched this movie and I was often reminded of \\"Aliens\\"...with it's eary, dark, pulse- raising feel.<br />  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is hard to review a DVD like this one.  The one that stands out most in my memory is the scene where Deckard finds \\"Zhora\\", played by Daryl Hannah. She disguises herself as a \\"toy\\" in J.F. Sebastian's home (a gentic designer who is lonely enough to create AI toys to keep him company). As Deckard approaches, she sits there, perfectly, like a doll hoping Deckard won't notice her. He does.  The action that ensues from that point on is wild to say the least.  It is pointless for me to go on about the plot. Most of you have seen this movie.<br /> I hope this review has tantalized the newcomer and warned the true fan about a fabulous must-own.  Could this be Ridley Scott's greatest film?  I think so.
0345440900|1.0|If you would like to read a book based on absolutely no research or methodology than this is the book for you.... Do yourself a huge favor and don't bother as it is not worth the paper it is printed on. There are many other books on the market that at least provide information based on research.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I adore \\"Harry Potter\\", the book. But, with a capital B-U-T, The movie was absolutely awesome.  It stuck very close to the original story line, only deleting a few scenes that had no effect on the movie.  I was in awe of the visual effects. I haven't seen anything so alive , real, and \\"wild\\" since \\"Labyrinth\\" or \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchaussen\\".  The characters, some you would not believe COULD be brought to the screen are, with absolute perfection.  Not a single drop of their quirks and funny dialect lost.  I mean, I never expected Hagrid, the sorting hat, or the Quidditch game to be as visual as they were in the book. I was dead wrong.  My husband would look over at me in the theater (which at 2pm, was filled with adults trying to see the movie without the kids) and would tell me to close my mouth.  Apparently I had my mouth hanging wide open through the whole movie.  I have a countdown calender in my house for the movie's release.  I have no children.  This movie only requires a love for the unbelievable.
0807282375|5.0|I was a little nervous about reading this book as it touched religious issues.  The resolution still confuses me somewhat, I can't see how that possibly ends things, and I'd better not say any more.<br />To give you a better idea of what this is about, THE AMBER SPYGLASS is the third book of the intriguing His Dark Materials trilogy.  The beloved characters Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, and Lord Asriel return with many more new creatures and twists in the plot.  Their fate is on play and we all read in fascination to see what becomes of Lyra, who is held captive at the beginning of the novel.  She and Will have been separated, and he struggles to reunite them for their ultimate battle.  The scene is set for a reenactment of Eden and the atmosphere is intense.  <br />Those that have read the preceding books, I don't know how you can wait or avoid this incredible conclusion!  I didn't give this the full rating because of some of the controversy in and out of the text, but that's just me...  I'm going to miss Lyra and Will after this - Philip Pullman is truly a wonderful author, worthy of every bit of praise.  I look forward to more novels from him in the future.
0061053147|5.0|If you love the movie Blade Runner you should be reading this book. It is indispensable. The author shares many insights and personnal experiences on the set of the film as well as never-filmed story lines (some of which would have been incredible) and never before published photo stills. A thorough review of the film in ALL of it's formats and versions comes included-it's a bit dizzying.  The book is packed with detail and interviews with cast and crew members.  The author is a bona-fide BLADE RUNNER nut. <br />NOTE: Wired Magazine recently named 'Blade Runner' the BEST science-fiction film EVER ('Star Wars' was tenth).<br />A must.
B000002TPS|5.0|Ever notice how a lot of metal fans tend to judge music solely by how accessable it is rather than how good it is? This is what happened when Megadeth released Youthanasia back in 1994. While the album met with strong reviews and very strong sales overall, some fans were unnecessarely disappointed when they found out how soft and moody it was compared to earlier releases.<br />But if you listen to Youthanasia side-by-side with Countdown To Extinction, you'll notice Youth really isn't much softer nor more &quot;pop-like.&quot; In fact, Youthanasia (in a lot of ways) has a decidely less commercial sound than Countdown. Probably because the guitars on Youth are decidedly heavier (remember how unusually plain they sometimes sounded on Countdown), and the mood quite a bit darker (don't expect all the sarcastic jokes and humor of Countdown here, ladies and gentlemen).<br />And it isn't as if Megadeth was trying to cash in on what was popular back in late 1994. This album doesn't sound grungey nor alternative. Rather, it seems stuck somewhere between a heavy rock album and a heavy metal album. True, it does have the occasionally pop-like beats of a rock album, but a lot of solos are just as grinding as you would expect from a metal album, riffs just as heavy, and song themes just as disturbing. Disturbing enough that MTV actually refused to play the video for A Tout Le Monde because of what the song was dealing with (suicide). How's that for a sell out?<br />As for the actual songs, I can't really think of any that I didn't like. Train of Consequences is definitely the album's highlight with its excellent drumming, catchy riff, and great solo. Addicted to Chaos has one of the most beautiful solos Megadeth has ever done, and one of the most powerful choruses they'd ever done. Elysian Fields has a catchy (almost hammer-like) beat, and Family Tree is among the darkest and most disturbing songs Megadeth has ever written (no, it's not a love song as its chorus may suggest, butactually a song about incest). <br />In brief, Youthanasia is a great album. Especially if you liked the previous Countdown To Extinction. After all, there's really no major difference in accesability between the two albums.
B000001FI7|5.0|One of the best albums of the 1990's-PERIOD. Inventive, mysterious, haunting. Super deep bass. MMmm.<br />Beth's vocals are ethereal and literally sound empty at times. Her voice seems to embody the spirit of the lyrics. Check out the amazing 'Wandering Stars' and 'Roads'. Gorgeous, yet spooky songs. The dj accompaniment here is superb-thick, lumbering beats with deep, dark bass and sparse scratching with samples.<br />Though others came before Portishead, they probably did the most to thrust the trip-hop genre into the mainstream. This should be in everyone's music collection.<br />ESSENTIAL.
0060987464|5.0|I first read this book about 4 years ago, I remember loving it then and reading it about 3 times back to back, feeling satisfied.  I don't support all his opinions, but that's not what this review is about.  About 3 months ago, I bought one of my friends who is a Marilyn Manson fan this book, and I ended up borrowing it from her and reading it again, to see if I still felt the same way after the initial &quot;manson craze,&quot; had died off.  It was still an excellent read and I read it in the same 2 day period as before, laughing at his childhood antics, sense of humor, and various inner thoughts.  This is still one of the best books I've ever read.  (Not because I don't read either!)  I would recommend this to anyone, who isn't afraid to let go of their tight grip on a supposed reality, relax, and enjoy a unique book.  It's a good one.
B00005J9LY|5.0|I already owned Please on CD, but when it was reissued as a remastered 2-disc set, I didn't hesitate to purchase it again.  The remaster of the original disc (disc 1) sounds great and you can hear great details, such as the clicking heels at the beginning of West End Girls.<br />Disc 2 consists of remixes and b-sides from that era (1984-1986).  Highlights include the two songs released on the Disco EP - In the Night and Paninaro, as well as the dance remix of West End Girls.  The full version of Opportunities is also included here, which includes the infamous spoken word ending (All the love we had/ and the love that we hide/ Who will bury us/ when we die).  Yes, it's pretentious, but typical Pet Shop Boys!<br />Best of all is the 36 page booklet.  It includes numerous pictures from that era, all song lyrics, and comments from the PSB themselves about the CD as a whole as well as each song.  You get all kinds of fascinating tidbits, such as Chris' suggestion that Opportunties (Reprise) is the best track on Please!  This collection is a bit pricey if you already own the original Please, but it is an essential for any PSB fan.
B00005V0X5|5.0|I loved this album before, and I love it now. What a difference, I never knew how much a re-master could change an album. By the way the new re-master includes These Boots so don't listen to the guy who says it doesn't. He should change his review to 5 stars. Last rites/Loved to death is probably the most amazing of all of the songs re-mastered. It sounds almost like a completely different song. All of the songs are great but looking down the cross is just simply speed metal perfection. The 1984 demos are pretty cool too. I love the new artwork it is awesome. If you wan't to hear great speed metal buy the Killing Is My Buisness...And Buisness is Good re-master today. It is simply awesome.
B00005J9LZ|5.0|Although I love PSB, \\"Actually\\" is not one of my favorites PSB CDs.  However, I'm very pleased with this two disc re-issue.  Disc 1 contains the 10 tracks originally found on \\"Actually.\\"  In the US, the CD was certified gold and they released two songs: It's a Sin (#9) and What Have I Done to Deserve This? (#2). The CD did even better in the UK, where they released four songs: It?s a Sin (#1), What Have I Done to Deserve This? (#2), Rent (#8), and Heart (#1).<br /><br />Disc 2 includes 14 remixes and b-sides from that era (1987-1989).  The remixes are terrific.  For example, \\"Heart\\" is represented with several previously unreleased remixes.  In addition, three excellent b-sides are included: You Know Where You Went Wrong, New Life, and Do I Have To? Finally, \\"I Want a Dog\\" and \\"Always on My Mind\\" are here, which were later remixed and appeared on their \\"Introspective? CD.<br /><br />The re-issue also includes an exclusive 36-page booklet, with lyrics for all songs and tons of pictures.  Best of all, the PSB make comments about the CD and each song.  One interesting tidbit: \\"Shopping\\" was inspired by Cameo's \\"Word Up\\"!  PSB fans will love this CD.  Others may want to go for the original, cheaper version of \\"Actually.\\"
0790736039|2.0|I remember seeing Stephen King's It when I was a child.  It scared me so much, I was convinced clowns were the source of all evil.  It's been 12 years since I first saw it, and watching it again I must say I'm not very impressed.  I still do very much appreciate the emphasis on character development, but for over 3 hours, the movie has only two good scares, not nearly enough to buoy it from mediocrity.  Why didn't I find it frightening?  Probably because during the childhood scenes, it was obvious none of them were really going to get killed (due mainly to the fact that it is flashback).  Plus, the child actors aren't exactly the best.  As adults, the actors fare better, in some cases. John Ritter, Tim Reid, and Annette O'Toole are all good, though the others don't really make much of an impression, particularly the guy who plays Eddie Kaspbrak.  Tim Curry tries his best to be a real menace as Pennywise, the villain of the film.  No, he's not scary, just silly.  Good efforts by all, but this movie still fails overall.
B00005J9M0|5.0|The PSB recently remastered and re-issued their first six albums.  \\"Introspective\\" has always been my favorite CD by them and I was only too happy to but it again to get all the extras.  Disc 1 is the original CD remastered.  It sounds great and these dance tracks now thump with extra power.  My all-time favorite PSB song is included, Left to My Own Devices, which accomplishes their goal of putting \\"Debussy to a disco beat.\\"<br />Disc 2 contains various remixes and b-sides from the era (1988-1989).  It has several versions of Domino Dancing, including the lovely, stripped-down \\"alternative version\\" and the demo version which is beautiful in its own right, but a mere skeleton of the song it would eventually become.  They also include two songs that the wrote and produced for others - Liza Minelli (So Sorry, I Said) and Dusty Springfield (Nothing Has Been Proved, which was inspired by the Profumo scandal).<br />Best of all is the extras that have been released with this re-issue.  The 36-page booklet has tons of pictures and all song lyrics.  Plus, the PSB comment on the entire CD and each song.  For example, they reveal that \\"Losing My Mind\\" was their attempt at doing a ZZ Top type song!  Brilliant!
B00001ODHF|5.0|I have seen all three movies in the Evil Dead Trilogy and I must say that Army of Darkness is superior to the first two movies. They are gory B- horror flicks with moments of humor and for entertaintment value on a campy evening, they are just the ticket, but Army of Darkness is something more.<br />Not only is Bruce Campbell a hunk, he has a sense of humor and comedic timing that make this movie great.  Whether he's lecturing the heathens from the past about his ' boom stick' or wooing the heroine with his ' gimme some sugar, baby' line, he's perfect in this movie.  Of course, he's survived the first two, but he shines in this movie.  I don't know if it has to do with the Dino De Laurentis production of this third movie,or the director, but they had the right idea when they put Bruce, his boom stick and Embeth Davidtz together in this movie.<br />I have seen it at least a dozen times and every time I laugh until I cry.  The scene where Ash / Bruce is hiding inside the windmill is hilarious, as is the following scene after the 'seed' he swallowed sprouts!<br />I had heard that this movie had been translated into a video game and wasn't surprised, because after you see the seige and what Ash / Bruce can do with a high school chemistry text book and his battered Joe Friday land cruiser anything is possible!<br />This movie is a must have for anyone who loves the horror genre with a humorous twist.  Everything about it, from the costuming to the way Ash / Bruce wears his chainsaw and rugged mullet are fantastic.  I would suggest getting your video through Amazon, because after the final scene in the movie, I don't know if you'll be able to find it in the video aisle at S-Mart!
B00005R62K|5.0|This is for me the best of the 70's period from the group.<BR>The songs are unique metal gems ahead of their time (1978).<BR>The best ones are \\"Exciter\\", White heat Red hot\\", \\"Saints in Hell\\" and \\" Beyond the realms of death\\"; all classic Priest<BR>material.  The remastered version sounds beautiful; and the <BR>bonus track \\"Fire burns below\\" is a very well crafted song<BR>which fits well in this high class offering.
0790743221|5.0|This movie was superb and it wasn't just be cause Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn were starring in it.<br />Often times it is easy to look back at the 'old days' and fondly wish that we had lived in simpler times when life was easier and the pace was slower.  If you watch this movie it will show you in startling images that life and love in the 1930's was no simpler or easier than it is today.  <br />The underlying story to this movie is as timely today as it was at the time the movie was made, and even though the movie was more a light hearted romantic comedy, the message in it was clear.  This movie showed me clearly that there is nothing new under the sun.  <br />Granted the characters, for the most part, are from the very upper crust of wealthy society and their sophisticated lives are far removed from most of our every day lifestyles, but the movie is so powerful and beautifully made that you get the message loud and clear.<br />Money can't buy you happiness or love.  Time doesn't heal all wounds and never, ever give up hope that you can get a second chance with your frist love.<br />Cary Grant, who plays C.K. Dexter Haven, is a marvel in this movie and he proves, as I have always maintained, that he was terribly underestimated as an actor.  Sometimes being that gorgeous has its drawbacks.<br />Katharine Hepburn shines in her role as Tracy Samantha Lord, a woman born with money and every advantage and yet she doesn't have any better clue than the rest of us when it comes to making the right choices at the right time in her life.<br />The conversations are quick and witty, not the usually speedy dialog that you find in alot of old B&amp;W movies.  The quips and comments are hilarious as are the supporting characters, including Tracy / Katharine's little sister, Dinah.  <br />This was one of the most powerful movies I ever saw because of what it showed me beyond the movie, and it helped me to remove the rose colored glasses I had always worn.  Whether it's 1932 or 2002, matters of the heart are still complicated, our judgement isn't always what it should be and hope is something none of us should relinquish without a long fight.<br />People can change when they truly want to and the reward is high enough, and true love is certainly worth the effort, as we see in this fabulous movie!  Enjoy!
B00005R62K|5.0|For me this is the best album from their 70's period.<BR>The songs were ahead of their time; the bests being:<BR>\\"Exciter\\", \\"White heat red hot\\", \\"Saints in hell\\", and<BR>\\"Beyond the realms of death\\"; all classic Priest.<BR>The remastered version sounds beautiful and the bonus tracks<BR>are good, especially \\"fire burns below\\", which is a very well crafted song.  Forget about the drum machine and listen <BR>carefully to the great voice of Rob Halford and the amazing guitar parts and you'll discover a real sleeping gem.<BR>High creative class!
B00004X01U|5.0|From the funky, furious title cut that opens this perfect 10 song release, we the happy listener are treated some of the most inventive dance music ever recorded. I can't really say anything about &quot;Music&quot; that hasn't been said already, but it certainly bears repeating that Madonna has a true gift for ceasless change and has made being a restless soul into an art. My favorite track here is the simple, straightforward acoustic soul of &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, a song that digs into your brain and plants itself there by being itself, stunning, spare and beautiful. Featuring just Madonna singing plaintively over guitar, synth bass and a funky, rolling beat, &quot;I Deserve It&quot; just demands you hit the &quot;Repeat&quot; button on your disc player time after time. It, like the rest of &quot;Music&quot; is simply brilliant. An instant classic.
1573225517|5.0|I admit, I went to go see the movie because of John Cusack. I found I liked the story and the characters.  I decided to buy the book because I heard that there were huge differences between the book and the movie, like the location. I know it's not the usual reason for buying a book, but sometimes I do things for unusual reasons.  <br />The characters are well written. Even the minor characters are well written. You get the idea that the author had a great time writing this story.  I will definitely check out the rest of Nick Hornby's works.
6305546789|5.0|Their are some people who would say that Friday the 13th was the most influental teen slasher ever, but thats simlply not the case, because Halloween came before Friday the 13th did.<br />I think it is pretty mind blowing to think about how many horror movies have taken segments from Halloween over the years and the 10 Friday the 13th flicks are no different.<br />In my opienion the begining of Halloween is one of the most chilling beginings ever with little Michael Miyers watch his own sister and her boyfriend making out on Halloween night and weighting for her boyfriend to leave so he can kill her for no reason at all, but the facted he is crazy. Thats one thing I like about Halloween is it dose not spend alot of time trying to figuer out why Michael is the way he is. The flim makers just get right to the point, and the horror, and the should leave you speechless.<br />I recomend this very good looking and sounding disk to your collection. Even if you have sceen Halloween before.

B00005QDW1|5.0|I can't believe how people are dogging this album.  This is easily their best album to date, the most consistent and catchy by far.  It's a feel-good party record.  Stop nit-picking and just enjoy it already, and stop whining about how you want their &quot;old&quot; sound back!  Move on already!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Although \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" was a significant album for the band as a whole, it was but a demo for keyboardist Jordan Rudess. This outfit has always been skippered by guitarist John Petrucci, with drummer Mike Portnoy as \\"XO\\". As such, any keyboardist from Kevin Moore through Derek Sherinian has been in part a sideman. Not that either man has been relegated to synth pads, but both tended to use the type of textures that best complemented shred and crunch type guitar work. For some reason, though, Rudess has been encouraged to use sounds not heard from either of his predecessors. Like a rhodes-type electric piano sound in \\"Blind Faith\\" not found much in the current generation of prog--you have to go all the way back to Gentle Giant's Kerry Minnear or Patrick Moraz. Like a cello sound in \\"Misunderstood\\" that beautifully dovetails in with an acoustic guitar not often heard from Petrucci. A conversation about embryo tissue research kind of gets in the way of the actual song in \\"The Great Debate\\", which is otherwise a standard D-T number. The first disc is rounded out by a rarity--a moody, semi-mellow ballad, of all things!<br />When I reviewed \\"Scenes\\", I mentioned that it might not be a good idea to get too much into the concept album thing and forsake the song album format. It looks like they compromised, making it half-and-half with the 40-minute title suite. Rudess shows that he not only has some superb orchestral patches in his axes, but he knows how to arrange for the symphonic. He gave us a foretaste of grand piano in \\"Scenes\\" and it also shows up here. There are stretches that are reminiscent of Kansas at their best--but that's no surprise. They include Kansas material in the live cover material they include in the studio \\"A Change Of Seasons\\". Petrucci shows he's equal to the the challenge by a stretch of some very Holst \\"Planets\\" guitar arrangements in \\"War Inside My Head\\". Which he follows up with a Steve Hackett-style section in the pastorale \\"Goodnight Kiss\\". Not content with that, he touches on some Steve Howe timbres in \\"Solitary Shell\\", which Rudess conters with a Wakemanesque minimoog lead. I get the feeling the heaviest influence in this song is the middle part of Yes' \\"And You and I\\". I'm getting the sense here that Rudess is not only a great player, but he's a catalyst to his bandmates' excellence. The only fly in the ointment I can find in this album is Portnoy's overuse of \\"Tour De France\\" kick drum patterns in the heavy rock parts of some of the songs--which is to say he rides his double pedals like a carbon-fiber racing bike. Maybe that trick works on the road when you're supposed to shake the arena floor under the audience's feet, but it's a bit much in the studio. You will notice up above, though, that this minor thing doesn't cost this band any stars in what I consider their best album ever.Kiss\\".

B00003CXXS|2.0|Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be just as good as the first two. I could'nt have been more wrong. Jurassic Park 3 isn't half as good as the first two. Director Joe Johnston tries to match a Steven Spielberg movie, but fails terribly. Gone is the suspense and adventure that made Spielberg's first two classics so popular. Also gone is the T-Rex from the first two. Instead, he's replaced with a stupid Spinosaurus.And the velociraptors don't seem as vicious as in the first two either. Joe Johnston comes up with stupid characters that get so annoying you wish they got eaten, and some dumb shots. Jurassic Park 3 isn't totally terrible, but it needs work. I don't even want to think about how bad this movie would have been without Steven Spielberg as the executive producer. He breathes some life into this movie. If you're expecting a Jurassic Park as good as the first two, step away now. If you're a die hard Jurassic Park fan, you might want to step away anyway.
014100018X|5.0|It was like a tempting box Milk chocolates. I picked the book up on holiday and read a couple of pages - the first chocolate slowly popped into the mouth. Next day and two sittings later it was finished. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br />Vianne Rocher dances across the pages - a mysterious outsider, always on the move, always on the run. From what? 'Are we staying here?' asks her daughter Anouk as they arrive in the quiet French village where life is quiet, predictable and dominated by the local church.<br />She opens a chocolate shop in Lent, immediately invoking the wrath of Reynaud, the Priest whose insecurites about his faith and influence eat him away as much as his lenten fasting.<br />The confrontation is inevitable as Vianne plans a chocolat festival at Easter. The conclusion mixes comedy and tragedy as Reynaud's 'weakness' brings his downfall. The story line is intersting but it is the characters who shine. Vianne herself is the light which shows the true character of those she meets. The hypocritical Caro, the evil Muskat, the downtrodden Josephine, the wonderful Armande. <br />The book carries a thread of the supernatural. How much does Vianne really know? What powers did her mother have? There is even the slightest hint of Mary Poppins - 'I'll stay until the wind changes'. The wind does change. A 'must read'.<br />By the way there is a very good movie of the same name.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is great!!!! I saw it 2 times in the theater and Bought the DVD the day it came out.  You will cry laughing.  I litterally fell out of my seat the first time I saw this.

B00003CXXS|5.0|Although the talking dinosaur was uncalled for, Jurassic Park III adds an all-too abandoned theory that animals do have intelligence, as seen with the overgrown Velociraptors.  The dinosaurs are more colorful than ever, which I think is a better visual than the other two Jurassic Parks, the animals now have colorful stripes and distinctive markings.  Jurassic Park III is only a preface to a better yet Jurassic Park IV (hopefully).  This is one set of sequels that are acutally getting better, not worse!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Yes, I know the movie's old, but when it first came out and I was a preteen, it scared me!  And even back then it was hard to scare me.  The dinosaurs were nearly real, and I believe that this is the first of many movies that are better than any other animatronic animals you'll ever see.  The plot is crystal clear and it's a sure thriller!!
B00005OB0A|5.0|Most everybody will buy this cd on the strength of 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head'. Indeed, that is the reason I bought this pricey import. But let me tell you, I am pleased with my purchase. The aformentioned single isn't even my favorite - those would have to be track # 7 'Come Into My World' and track #13 'Tightrope'.<br />This is definitely a 'dance' album - all the songs are fast with the synthesized beats and drum machines, but surprisingly, the songs are actually good...imagine that.<BR>Our own American pop music counterparts would do well to take some hints from this Australian diva. The last time I heard Kylie was when I was in high school doing the 'Locomotion' - I'm glad to see she is still around and sounding much much better.
B000060OYV|5.0|FINALLY a new Blind Guardian album,it's been so looooong but the wait was WELL worth it.. For all you fans of \\"old BG\\" this album is thier hardest album by far, but you fans of the more melodic BG dont fret it's all good they still have those melodies that will take you to a endless ocean of pleasure!<BR>Now I know the US version wont be released untill March 19th but I couldnt wait so I bought this version. and the extra track is a musical version of HOS.. Was it worth the money??!!! Well thats a stupied question YES, with out a single doubt in my head it was worth it. The songs are to die for. and the length is perfect around 65 give or take a minute. Now I just cant wait untill they tour the USA and Hansi said they are almost positive that they would ^_^, but that wont be untill the end of this year. so do your self a favor BUY BUY BUY it dont matter whitch one you buy(import or wait untill the domestic release) I relise not everyone is as insane as me and willing to dish out this much.
B00005R2M3|5.0|In a music industry where everything looks and sounds exactly the same, Shakira is exactly what music fans need. I was just blown away by the talent found in Laundry Service. I can't believe that there is an pop star out there that actually has looks, talent, and personality.
B00004Z459|5.0|Alot of people probably havent looked at this CD, Hybrid Theory as a concept album, but it is. It deals with the struggles of being a youth, and dealing with the good and bad times while growning up. Here is a run down of the songs.<br />1. PAPERCUT 10/10- This song is truely great, with great rapping from Shinoda and excellent, low, crunching guitar. The lyrics deal with a young man's paronoia, leading to his eventual insanity, something that I have had to deal with alot in my young life (paronoia, not insanity)<br />2. ONE STEP CLOSER 9/10-The first single, overplayed and overrated, but simply a rush to experiance. It focus's on a person who is letting out their emotions at an authority figure, screaming \\"SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!!!!\\" Good song, but not the best.<br />3. WITH YOU 7/10- A good song about a hard relationship that came close to ending, but heads toward a promising future. Apparantly this will be the next single- That honour should belong to PUSHING ME AWAY...<br />4. POINTS OF AUTHORITY 8/10- This one involves a person confronting an abusinve friend \\"You love the things I say I'll do, but I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you...\\" powerul, and it works.<br />5. CRAWLING 9/10- A worthy second single, and quite a powerful song. It deals with drug abuse \\"Crawling in my skin, these wounds, they will not heal, fear is how i go, confusing what is real...\\" and how it can destroy a person from the inside. Very Moving.<br />6.RUNAWAY 7/10- My least favourit track on the CD, is concerns a teen who, after so much pain and anguish, decides to quit it all and runaway, physically or mentally, I'm not sure.<br />7. BY MYSELF 9/10- Self doubt is the focus here, and it provides great raps for Shinoda, who dominates hear as in the next song...<br />8. IN THE END-100/10- THIS SONG IS AWE INSPIRING!!! Seriously, after I listened to it the first time, I was amazed at the power in the lyrics. It sounds to me like a suicide note, and the writer jotting downhis reasons for killing himself and his final state of mind, that he \\"Tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter...\\". I can do all the raps from memory (OK, I can do the WHOLE DSISK from memory, but its still cool!) Great song, an instant classic<br />9. A PLACE FOR MY HEAD 7/10- Good, Not Great. It's a philosophical song, about the search of a young man as he tries to discover his meaning in life \\"I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy: a place for my head...\\". Meh.<br />10. FORGOTTEN 9/10- Pretty good, it's about a relationship between parents and a teen that has been neglected and isn't good anyomore, and according to the song, can NEVER be perfect again.<br />11. CURE FOR THE ITCH 8/10- A cool little instrumental, amazing DJing by Hahn. In terms of concept, it could represent all the little dark thoughts in the minds by the way it plays, or (my favourite) could represent a person with too much power, who has been corrupted by it. With it's dark mood, it is a good track to kick to.<br />12. PUSHING ME AWAY 11/10-The epic closer, not alot of rapping, but great singing by Chester and great Guitar by Phoenix, plus Hahn does his bit... It all works, and very well! The plot concerns a man who, after giving in to his girlfriend for so long, decides to put his foot down and leave if she isnt OK with his new found esteem.<br />All in all, a great CD, as good as, if not better, than Follow the Leader by KoRn, and right up there with the likes of Smashing Pumpkins, The Offspring and Metallica for melding Electronic, Rap, and hardcore metal intoa perfect, seamless package. Buy this disk, you shall NOT regret it.
B000002LEE|5.0|There's no 'Three Days' here, but overall, this is not only Jane's best album, but one of the best hard rock albums of the 80s. Nevermind the funk/metal/punk labels, Nothing's Shocking twists, turns, and cooks from start to finish as one song segues into the next. The album is loaded with guitar cuts, rolling basslines (esp. 'Mountain Song), frequent shrieks from Perry, and Of Course Steve Perkins' fantastic thrasy/jazzy/tribal drumming technique. Flea, and Chris Dowd & Angelo Moore of Fishbone help the band on 'Idiot's Rule.' Every song wails except maybe the one minute interlude \\"Okay Boys\\" toward the end of the album- which only serves as a chance for listeners to take a breath before the final bomb drops. Into Led Zeppelin? Guns/Roses? Pumpkins? You'd better own this record.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|What can you say about 'Lara Croft - Tomb Raider?' It's a video game posing as a movie, and it shows. The plot is cheesy and far-fetched, while the many action sequences are so fast-fast-fast that they are nearly impossible to follow. The movie finds Lara Croft, the buxom tomb raider of video game fame, caught in the middle of a cosmic plot with nothing short of the future of the world hanging in the balance. Croft, played by the gorgeous Angelina Jolie, travels to Cambodia, Russia and other places, while disposing of lots of assorted bad guys... Still, Jolie sparkles as the movie's heroine in multiple tight-fitting outfits. (It's not her fault that the script is full of holes...) Aside from the movie, the extras on this DVD are pretty good. The disc includes deleted scenes, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, a U2 music video and other neat stuff. The quality of the movie itself, particularly on a high-end home theater, is top-notch. Here's a suggestion for next time: How about including a full version of the actual 'Tomb Raider' video game?
B00003CXRM|4.0|This was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen lately. Funny, original, and delighful. I loved the &quot;old timey&quot; music, and the bleached out color of the film was perfect for this era. This was probably the best role (so far) that George Clooney has ever had, and Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were the best! Charles Durning did his usual great acting job. Kudos to the &quot;bit part&quot; actors...John Goodman as the con man and Michael Badalucco in the role of Pretty Boy Floyd were terrific. Who ever did the casting for this pix was right on the money! I received the DVD of this movie for my birthday and have watched it several times. I never get tired of the story, the music or just the pure fun! Bravo to the Coen brothers...lets have more of your efforts.
B00003CXI1|3.0|OK, I have see the movie, but I must say that it's very much a kids movie, very entertaining & I did enjoy it, but I really like the books better.  They did change a few things, from the book, but I can't really compare the two, that's not fair!  But I do have to pick at 1 thing & that was, did they even name his owl?  Because I can't even remember Harry calling her Hedwig!!!!<BR>   I am more a LOTR fan, But I did enjoy both (LOTR more) & won't compare them too each other :)<BR>   All I have to say is, I hope the DVD version is much more longer!!!! <BR>   Still all the best to the kids :)
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is a film that you will either really love or realy hate; there is no in between. I really hated it, and like a fool, I bought it based on the critics enthusiam for it without viewing it first. I truly cannot understand why the critics raved about it. I lost interest in the film in the first 20 minutes, but stuck with it to the very last to see if there was anything redeeming about this \\"musical.\\"  There was not. From the first surreal, frenzied, overpowering production number to the last breath of the heroine, it was a mish-mash of nothing more than whirling colors, music that drowned out the vocals, and pathetic acting. This director should stick to MTV music videos. Some critics have said that this film is the \\"new musical genre for the 21st century\\"....I sincerely hope not!! What a waste of time and money!
B00005A1PR|4.0|She is a breath of fresh air when the worl;d of R & B needs it most. With all the fake groups like Destiny's child and the other man haters India Arie has made an album that deserves all the acclaim that it has recieved. Her voice is so soulful it makes me shudder to hear it cause it is so good. The songs are all well written and produced. India Arie is here and is not going anywhere.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Consider this collection a torch we must pass to the benighted in our midst who haven't heard The Word.<br />Indisputably wonderful, like ice cream and inevitable, like fat, here's the GREATEST greatest hits collection, the soundtrack of our lives, the sing-along to beat all sing-alongs. What the heck took them so long to think of this? Not the best Beatles songs, necessarily, but the ones deemed buck-worthy by the privileged First Generation of Beatlemaniacs, in those heady days when the music was brand new. To analyze, pontificate and otherwise act like Mr. Know-It-All Beatlehead would be inane: These are Beatle songs, duh, you know them all, and they reached Number One. What else do you need to know? Not having this CD in your collection is a monumental Beatlefan sacrilege on the order of suggesting, oh, I don't know, that Yoko Ono is anything other than a shrill, conniving, no-talent harpy.<br />Music's fab, booklet's gear, and poor Ringo needs a new pair of drumsticks. The End.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|This is got to be one the best work of music that has been released in quite some time. Poses is loaded full of lush warm melodies with beautiful intelligent lyrics to date. There is not one bad song on this album!!! Normally people recommened a couple of tracks from CD's. I will not do that, each song is equally great from one the most underated artist today. Do yourself a favor, and add \\"Poses\\" to your CD collection!!!
1563894696|2.0|After reading just about every other review of \\"The Long Halloween\\" one could be forgiven for thinking it was the greatest literary work of the late twentieth century. It's not. It's not even a pretty good literary work. Of course, it's hard for it to be considered a literary work at all when one considers just how little writing there is in \\"The Long Halloween\\". Loeb's chief problem is that he wants so desperately to tell a grand sweeping saga in the style of the Godfather (so much so that he blatantly rips it off at every point and turn) and yet leaves us with precious little to actually \\"read\\" much less think about. In any good mystery there must be an emotional resonance between the reader and the characters but that's just not possible here. Loeb feels compelled to include as many members of the Rogues' Gallery as he can fit, including a few ludicrous scenes with the Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter in which both seem to be competing for the Most Annoying Villain in a Comic Book or Drama category. What we're left with is a whirlwind tour through Arkham Asylum with little to no time left for even the most basic character development as the \\"mystery\\" of who the serial killer Holiday is is drawn out far longer than is required. Do not be fooled! If you're tempted to read this because of lofty comparisons to the works of Frank Miller or Alan Moore please note that this series has none of the emotional depth of their characterisations or intricate strands of their plots. Oh, and the art's not much good either.
B000002U82|5.0|Hey everyone, if your reading this you're crazy, but this is a great album and I couldn't put it any more simply than that. Sure it's old but its a classic and you are nobody if you don't have this one. So Buy It!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This CD is perfect to revisit the great movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I can listen to the music and vividly remember the movie in my mind. Music creates the tone and atmosphere of the movie, and with all the places that Frodo goes in the movie, this score does its job to take you there too.<br />THEMES:  This soundtrack has a heavy repetition of the Frodo/Hobbit theme but it is beautiful, and the repeating theme is justified because Frodo is the main character. The variation of the theme is best represented in Many Meetings. This appoximately takes place when Frodo awakens in Rivendell and reunites with Gandalf, Samwise, Pippin, and Merry. The theme is at its purest and simplest form, but is strong at the point when Frodo sees and happily embraces Bilbo. Another highly repetetive theme is the Fellowship's theme. The Ring Goes South and The Bridge Of Khazad Dum definitely showcase this theme. This strong theme brings solid familiarity to the soundtrack and great admiration for the fellowship. There are also \\"themes\\" recognizable by the scenes they represent. For example, the incredible metallic percussive theme present in tracks 7 and 16 are in the Orc and Uruk-Hai scenes. The full choir, which heavily appears in the beginning of the soundtrack, represents the Ring Wraiths. There are different styles of choirs. Most often appearing is the forceful singing of a full choir [featuring male and female voices]. In a short phrase from The Bridge Of Khazad Dum, a male choir chants in a style nearly Polynesian or tribal. Lothlorian features women singing in Elvish. And in The Breaking Of The Fellowship, a children's choir sings In Dreams.<br />HEART-BREAKING MUSIC, HEARTBREAKING THAT THERE ISN'T MORE:  After receiving this CD in the mail, I immediately wanted to find a particular musical phrase from the beginning of the movie. During the narration, the theme plays repeatedly while Galadriel gives her prophecy. That dispairing and haunting phrase ispresent in The Great River. Most of the music is in chronological order of the movie, but there is no denying that there is music missing from the CD. The beginning narration along with its accompanying music should've have been the first track.<br />Enya's involvement in this project is essential. Her importance can all be wrapped up in one song, track 10, Aniron, from The Council Of Elrond. Besides the obvious beauty of the flowing melody, you can find tremendous beauty in the lyrics as well. [This version of the CD DOES contain the lyrics.] The music and lyrics successfully capture the love and emotions between Arwen and Aragorn.<br />THIS VERSION:  The CD cover has a picture Frodo holding the Sting. Smaller images of Saruman, Gandalf, and Arwen wrap around the Lord of the Rings title logo.  THIS CD DOES CONTAIN the Elvish lyrics and the link to bonus materials.<br />OVERALL:  This soundtrack is absolutely essential if you want to experience the movie at home or in your car. It is holding me off until its future release of the DVD later this year. This soundtrack would have been absolutely perfect if they included the narration at the beginning of the movie as the first track. However, I still give great praise to Howard Shore, Enya and others who wrote lyrics and contributed to this amazing musical masterpiece. It has renewed my interest in film scores. I look forward to more music from The Two Towers and The Return of the King.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|If you are looking for music to make you want to dance and move your hips the Latin way... This is the ONE! YOU have no time to loose because everyone is singing to the Enrique #1 video.. Escape! Everyone knows the lyrics and of coarse you don't want to be left out. <BR>I love all the songs because they all have an intimate touch to them. They are entertaining and they have such a unique wonderful message. <BR>What can I say? I've been his #1 fan since I was 10yrs. old. It has been eight years since I fell in love with Enrique's voice! He is my HERO! I can wake up listening to this CD anyday! Even my mother liked the music and she's not an Enrique Iglesias fan what-so-ever. <BR>This album really resembles the kind of effort that a young talented man can be capable of accomplishing. I really admire this kind of work from him. I have always known his talent that is why his popularity with this album does not surprise me.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is a Guy Ritchie masterpiece that shows of hiw new age still of directing.  He is the director to follow for the next few years to come.<BR>This movie incorporates the lately popular still of movie making which is to have one main goal or plot, and then numerous sub plots and stories that all center around the main point in this case the diamond.  This is a well done film and leaves nothing to be desired.  The use of talent in this movie is also something that makes it what it is.<BR>The action is non-stop and the transition between scene is something really to admire about this film.  The movie always keeps you inticed to know whats going to happen next from beginning to end.  The DVD sound quality is good enough to please anybody, even those audiophiles.  The picture, visuals and cinematics are stunning and extremely pleasing.<BR>The extras I cannot comment on because I have not yet watched through them, but I am sure there great.  If not the movie was awsome and definitely worth buying, or renting if you are not a collector.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is like no other CD out there. You couldn't copy their style if you tried. I had the pleasure of seeing them live last night and it was incredible. I even got to go to a meet &amp; greet afterwards and the guys were really friendly. If you don't own this CD, you are a minority, go buy it now. No matter what genre you listen to, rap, rock, punk, you'll like it.
0783225903|5.0|This is an outstanding film, smart and funny, and probably Gilliam's best work, a director justly renowned for his wildly imaginative visual style.  The story, about an Everyman struggling to free his soul and find love within a meddling, maddening, bureaucratic society run amok, is indebted to _1984_ in many ways, but substitutes black humor and a non-stop barrage of the absurd for the grim and determined pessimism of the novel.  Fellow _Python_ alum Michael Palin turns in a commendable performance, a mixture of subtle mischief and state-licensed sadism.  I wish moviemakers would cast him more often, as he was, in my opinion, the best actor in the classic comedy troupe.  At the time _Brave_New_World_ was published, Huxley said he feared modern civilization offered man the choice of either going insane or being a lunatic.  _Brazil_ can't hold out hopes for anything better, but lets you know that at least it's okay to laugh.  If you're a movie collector with a taste for cult classics and the bizarre, odds are you already know this movie; if not, check it out, it belongs in your library.  Warning:  count on the theme song to stick in your head for the rest of your life.  (Good thing to hum while waiting in some insanely long line to get a form signed.)
B00005V0X5|5.0|The remaster = sound quality. Each song boast's it's new improved power. The drums are clearly heard, the solo's scream, <BR>and you can understand the lyrics to near perfection. <br />However, if you already have it, and are expecting something new...don't. It's the same stuff with a better sound. There are occasional parts I liked better on the original version, but on the whole it's is a gem.  The main downside on this album are the annoying bleeps covering half the lyrics on &quot;These Boots.&quot; The cd booklet covers that. The 3 extra demo's lack in sound quality, but make up the difference with their commanding speed and Dave's intense vocals.<br />However, one thing stands....Dave Mustaine sounds so fierce and aggressive on this album, if you don't have this or the original....you'd better get it. This is classic thrash.
6304504012|5.0|The first time I saw Evita, I hated it.  Then, I decided to watch it once more, and I found myself consumed.  Not only is a wonderful and interesting story told, but the songs and the music is wonderful.  The movie is so powerful!  I had chills during the &quot;Santa Evita&quot; scene, in which Eva is at church being serinaded as a saint, while Che is running from being beaten by the police.  All the actors gave a great performance, and Alan Parker did a great job.  I would most definately recommend the musical...Evita!
B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's &quot;Moondance&quot; is (as anyone with a pulse already knows) a classic.  Great melodies, good lyrics, and superb playing.  As with most of Morrison's efforts, it does lean toward jazz (good!), but this one rocks as well.  A quick listen to any of the first five memorable tracks will have you moondancing the night away.  On the other hand, I once spent a night in the pokey for a little moondance I did at Daytona Beach.  But that's another story ...
B00005R2M3|2.0|Although Shakira's english is perfect, the music loses something<br />in english (like watching a foreign-language DVD with a english voice-overs).  I'd go for her earlier albums, songs like &quot;ojos asi&quot; in english don't cut it.  Her earlier albums are highly recommended.
B000002KBH|5.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; is just that: A beautiful American album.  No jams, just concise folk/country/rock classics of ethereal beauty played with a passion and restraint rarely equaled.  Considered by many the watershed of studio Dead, this is a soothing album with some of the most beautiful tracks ever recorded.  One listen to 'Studio Magnolia' or the mandolin-tinged, brillian 'Ripple' should be all it takes for a sensate human to fall in love with this album.  If you're still not convinced (see a doctor), listen to the rest of the album.  Quite simply, an all-time classic.  Not to be missed or sipped, but embraced and guzzled.  Enjoy.
630179513X|5.0|I purchase I, II and III for my son.  He has watched them over and over.
B000002UAR|5.0|It's hard to see where Oasis, REM, the Smiths, and countless other acts would be toady if it weren't for the Beatles and, in particular, this album. Flawless in every which way, \\"Revolver\\" is the \\"experimental\\" album that would set the tone for the groups next three classics: \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"The Beatles,\\" and \\"Abbey Road.\\" The best thing about this album is that we get to absorb the vastly different somgwriting styles of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. \\"Taxman\\" is a Ginsu-sharp commentary on, well, taxation in the UK; McCartney belts out silly (but great) love songs on \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" and \\"Got to Get You into My Life,\\" while Lennon continues to push the envelope with the still-fresh-sounding \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and the dynamite \\"And Your Bird Can Sing.\\" Although, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is still a favorite among many, I think \\"Revolver\\" is their best and boldest album ever.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This DVD set should be issued to every man, woman and child in America. Maybe it would help our country loosen up a little and have fun again. I know I can't watch this classic British TV show and keep a scowl on my face for long.<br />I'm not going to spend a lot of time describing what Fawlty Towers is all about. Others have already done that. I just want to add my two cents worth regarding my enjoyment of them.<br />There aren't many shows I can watch repeatedly that still manage to make me laugh. Fawlty Towers is one of them. (In case you're interested, The Andy Griffith Show is another. I can watch that show literally daily and still laugh out loud. I never seem to tire of it.) John Cleese is a brilliant comedian with impeccable timing and hilarious facial expressions.<br />The entire show takes place inside Fawlty Towers, a fictitious hotel somewhere in England. Cleese is Basil Fawlty, the proprieter...a man whose distaste for his guests is barely disguised...and whose wife (Sybil, played by Prunella Scales) could win an award for nagging any day of the year.<br />The humor, although resorting at times to blatant slapstick, can at times be as keen and witty as any you'll find anywhere. It's a pity so few of these shows were made. The DVD set collects all 12 episodes (six from 1975 and six from 1979) and offers them up in pristine digital quality, with commentary by John Cleese, et al.<br />Fawlty Towers was a very funny show and I heartily recommend this DVD collector's set -- especially if you're already a fan of John Cleese's Monty Python humor. He's amazing as Basil Fawlty.
B00004SVID|5.0|The Wall on album is very good. The Wall film is rubbish. However The Wall Live is the ultimate version. <br />All the tracks are played at a slightly different pace and a couple of previously unreleased tracks are on here too.<br />Still to be found are the horrible Vera Lynn and Bring The Boys Back Home tracks but I suppose they ARE essential to the storyline. Comfortably Numb is good but suprisingly not as good as it's studio counterpart. However all the other tracks knock the original studio version for six (Run Like Hell and Nobody Home are excellent).<br />Also despite not being on video/DVD you still get a really good idea of visual set up of the shows with the booklet that comes with it and the atmosphere pours off it.<br />Floyd's best Live album next to P.U.L.S.E. and if you DON'T already have The Wall studio album then forget it. Get this version instead it's superior.
B000002L7G|5.0|You know of the songs that made this CD so huge - \\"So Far Away, Money For Nothing,\\" and \\"Walk of Life\\" are the first three songs on this CD. That's like sending Ruth, Gherig and Aaron at you 1,2,3 - they're all worthy of the praise they receive. But what makes this CD so outstanding is the little known nuggets of gold that many a trivialist skipped over - who bought this CD merely for the aforementioned hit singles. In my opinion, if you go even only 2 songs deeper you get the 2 best songs on the CD. The jazzy, mood setting \\"Your Latest Trick\\" and my favorite Dire Straits song, indeed, one of my favorite songs of all time, period, \\"Why Worry\\", which offers some of the most beautiful guitar work of Knopfler's career and is one of the most beautiful love songs ever penned, it all its simplicity. I'd buy this CD for that song alone. But rest assured, the rest of the effort makes this a must have piece of music. \\"Ride Across the River\\" and \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" continue the non-stop assault of well written songs with music and images that only an autonomous band can deliver. There's nothing like this in today's music environment. This CD is full of character, style and diversity - much of what today's coroporate crap is stripped of (well, a lot of it anyway - there certainly are always exceptions). Those who wouldn't buy this CD based on the first three songs alone, for whatever reasons, are denying themselves one of the most completely gratifying, most well rounded pieces of music ever made. Those who wouldn't buy it because of preconceived notions of what all Dire Straits CDs MUST sound like, are missing what all this band's previous CDs led up to - a mature, confident, colorful recording. This isn't \\"Sultans of Swing, Part IV\\". Those who wouldn't buy it because they don't like the sound of Knopfler's voice and/or guitar are missing the perfect role for both. That would be like denying yourself of watching, say, \\"The Godfather\\" because you don't like Brando's methodacting body of work that preceded it. Like Brando's performance in \\"The Godfather\\", Knopfler's voice and guitar were made for this CD. It even sounds better now with improved technology in both sound systems and the remastering of this CD. The best example I can give of such an epiphany in my own case is George Michael's \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" (was there ever a more appropriately titled CD?). I couldn't stand (and to some degree still can't) George Michael but found that CD to be one of my favorite CDs by any performer once I gave it a fair listen. And believe me, it took a lot for me to admit that. I'll bet there are a lot that will have that same reaction to this one. I know of many who don't like Dire Straits - they do have a sort of an either you love them or you hate them aura. But this CD solidified my appreciation for all of Dire Straits music, pre and post \\"Brothers In Arms\\". Seeing them during this tour didn't hurt my appreciation for them either. This CD, like the venue I saw them perform in were both made for the appreciation of the music itself, unlike many of today's CDs and venues which are made to squeeze as many bucks out of a musical entity as one of the corporate schmoes can get.
B00000263T|4.0|Heavy metal may have reached its peak around 1985, and so did Accept.  More polished than its predecesors (\\"Restless & Wild\\" and \\"Balls to the Wall) with more energy than the follow-up \\"Russian Roulette,\\" \\"Metal Heart showcases everything that was right with Not-Quite-Mainstream-Because-No-Radio-Station-Would-Play-It '80s metal.<BR>     The work here presents some hich-octane burners (\\"Midnight Mover,\\" \\"Up to the Limit,\\" \\"Too High to Get It Right,\\" and \\"Living for Tonight\\"), as well some smoldering selections (\\"Screaming for a Love-Bite,\\" \\"Dogs on Leads\\").  There are also a couple of songs that move a bit beyond the ordinary fare with the title track and \\"Bound to Fail.\\"<BR>     Some listeners may be turned off by the less accesible \\"Wrong is Right\\" and \\"Teach Us to Survive\\" and the adolescent nature of some of the lyrics, but if your looking for an album to propel you back to a time when music (and the fans) had more raw energy, this album is a sure bet.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|What do I like so much about this CD? For starters, Madonna unleashed what (very) little apprehension she may have had left in her from her first CD and just let it fly. The \\"Like A Virgin\\" CD is a non-stop assault of great music, great singing, and loads of attitude, the latter of which really is Madonna's strength. The title song and \\"Material Girl\\" are testimonials to that fact. Madonna let the world know she made no pretense of where she was coming from and gave us some outstanding dance club staples in the process. \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dress You Up\\" are of the same vein - confident songs of desire dressed up in irresistable rythmns and beats. This is real \\"loud as you can bear it\\" music, be it at home or in your car, as long as those around you can stand it. \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\" give us as much vocal range, as much passion, with a simpler pace and approach and is emblematic of future Madonna songs. But while all the aforementioned songs are outstanding Madonna staples, my favorites on this CD (which is still my favorite CD by Madonna), and probably two of my favorite Madonna songs overall are \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"Over and Over\\" - two almost diametrically opposing tunes. \\"Love\\" is a song of heartbreak and \\"now what do I do-ism\\", while \\"Over\\" is an inspirational tune that goes right next to, say, Joe Jackson's \\"Go For It\\" in that \\"pick yourself up by your bootstraps\\" category. There's very little wasted space on this CD. \\"Like A Virgin\\" gave us a more well rounded Madonna. It was also a time when Madonna still relied more on an actual band. You remember those - bass, guitar, drums, things her more current music pushes aside for more electonically programmed sounds, not that I'm averse to her more current sounds. But to me this was Madonna at her purest, her most creative, her sexiest - when she was more tantalizing and suggestive than the in your face raunchiness of her \\"Erotica\\" days. To be fair though, in her \\"Virgin\\" years, she was still considered quite provocative. She would continue to push the envelope in future albums - more with each release, perhaps setting the standard for the pathetic luridness of say the J-LOs and Brittany's of their own time. But, hey, evolution exists in all aspects of life. One other reason I like this particular CD is that it was her first major tour and I was fortunate to see her, along with a very little known opening act named The Beastie Boys, who would conveniently get booed off the stage as well as incite chants from puzzled Madonna look-a-likes such as, \\"White rappers? You gotta be kidding me!\\". Get this CD and see how it's done by self determined talent, not assembly lined products.
0684135051|2.0|I had heard so much about EZ that I rushed out to buy this book.  I was really disappointed by this book.  I expected to find information as a beginning knitter, but this book seemed to be geared towards knitters who are more experienced.<br />I do like the homey style and the fact that Elizabeth Zimmermann was a knitting enthusiast, but this is a book that should be added to the knitter's library later on, once technique and method has been established.
B0000203YT|3.0|My favorite kinds of movies are ones that are based on true (or what could be true) events, legends, and myths, which is why I really enjoyed this movie. It is very interesting to see these types of movies and think \\"Hey, what if this is how it really happened!\\". I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks. This movie had plenty of that. There's just something about hearing jokes in the kind of accent they used that makes them so funny. It kept me wanting to watch more, even when the mushy stuff was going on.<br />I've never really been a fan of romantic/love based movies. I don't like seeing other peoples relationships that go so well, when it's never like that in real-life, for most of us anyway. It wasn't too bad though.<br />Besides that part of it, the acting was really great. You can almost imagine this coming out of a history book. They took the roles, actions, and the look of the people of that time and played them out so well, I couldn't believe it. I also enjoyed the actors using the Old English. Normally it would be hard for me to understand, but after my English teacher had us watch and read \\"Macbeth\\", I actually understood what they were saying. It was quite scary.<br />All in all, this was an excellent movie. In my personal opinion, any of the characters from Monty Python would have made perfect roles for Philip Henslowe and the actors in Will's play. They have experience in impersonating women. So, if you like stupid humor, great Old English acting, and you don't mind a whole lot of kissing (when the woman is occasionally dressed like a man...), you should see this movie.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Before seeing Sade on her first American tour in 1985'ish I didn't think that the band would translate very well live. Shocking all of my senses, they were BETTER than their studio recordings. Sade Adu then personified grace, dignity, sweetness and sensuality. 3,500 people were rapt under her spell.<br />Flash forward almost 20 years and several tours later, Sade comes back after an 8 year absence and proves her success was no 80's thing by releasing one of the best albums of her career, \\"Lovers Rock.\\" The supporting tour this time plays arenas of 20,000 plus. Sade pulls if off and documents the astounding success of the \\"Lovers Rock\\" tour here. To fill the arena's,Sde's sound is bigger, looser and funkier. The production is breathtaking -- lights,  digital graphics brought about a reception here in Atlanta that is usually reserved for rock stars. All the excitment is here on Lover's Live.<br />Sade is approaching icon status. She has timelessly endured almost two decades and has never compromised her integrity for the sake of trends. She has the grace of an angel and exudes pure class. Let's hope we don't wait another 8 years for another CD and tour.
B00004XQ83|5.0|That is what my granny called this, her generation's music.  I remember being sung to sleep to &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; by both she and my mom.  Descended as I am from the sturdy stock of poor Southern dirt farmers, this music is deeply nostalgic and personal for me.  Listen and see if you can keep from tappin' your toes!  It's impossible!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|We saw Sade in Columbus, OH on September 10, 2001 (evening before 911).  It was a magical evening that melted everyone there into a blissful state.  Her voice and backing group were excellent.  Can't wait to run out and get this one!  Thanks Sade!
B00005RYKU|2.0|Normally I like movies that star Leelee Sobieski, but the Glass House was disappointing.  It was a very slow moving movie.  The previews made the movie look very suspenceful, but when I watched the movie, I found myself waiting for the suspenceful parts that never happened.  I would not recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to choose from.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is good.<BR>Very good. <BR>System of a down did a fantastic first album and this is even better. <BR>Listen and learn how to play rock n roll...
B00005UEAR|5.0|well, it usually takes a pretty good album for me to write a review and this album would fit that category for me. i listened to glass prison on the way back from where i bought the cd and i gotta say that is my kinda stuff right there. that song took me the whole way home from quite a distance away and was pretty mind blowing all 13 some minutes of it. i havent been into dream theater for more than a month or so yet but i have to say ive been missin out for some time on these guys. im not the biggest fan of the lead singer but he's not that bad. they come together very well though. im a fan of progressive rock, i mean how can one not be? songs that just change shape and form throughout are just so much more interesting and pleasurable to listen too. the keyboards are great, although i think they've been used better on other albums. the album is tight and well constructed and sounds about right to my ears. as a whole it will probably be the best album of 2002 for most of the year. if you like dream theater you might like tool as well i have to add. it would be sweet to see those two go on tour. anyhow, this is a great album and will be listened to on many occassions.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I will be glad to see this on DVD. Can't wait to see all the extras. This is by far the best FANTASY(not SCI-FI)movie created to date. LOTR is good too but, lacks action. It is refreshing to see someone take the book and transform it to the screen. Although there were too many \\"jumps\\" in the story for my taste; I understood the reasons for them. I saw the movie twice in the theatre(lack of money for more times). What more can I say??? BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00005JKT8|5.0|This movie, is one of the most refreshing films I have seen in years. Hugh Jackman, steals every scene he is in. Meg Ryan is adorable. If you love the old fashioned, romantic comedies of yesterday, I highly recommend this film to you. A+++  Anita H. Wisconsin.
B000002NJS|5.0|I first bought this album the day it was released and since that day this album has helped me deal with personal issues, such as a relationship that i couldn't sustain and the death of my mother.<BR>With this album Madonna truly emerges as an artist.  Yes indeed, she did find her artistic integrity in \\"Like A Prayer\\"(which also is a great album), but this one stated that Madonna is a human like the rest of us. <BR>Whenever i get asked what my favorite album of all time is, i don't hesitate to say \\"Ray of Light\\".  As an audience we should feel privileged that Madonna did some soul searching and gave us a wonderful album.  True that!!!<BR>If you haven't bought it, get off your [butt]... and experience the true genius of Madonna!
B000002J20|3.0|Hmmm. I so wanted this to be the masterpiece I imagined it to be when I was at school. Well I didn't get round to buying it until last year, and it came as a huge disappointment. If you consider the masterpieces that preceded it (`Close to the Edge' - 1972) and followed it (`Relayer' - 1974) then TFTO is a failure. Not that it's a bad album, just not as good as any of Yes's 70s output, with the exception of `Tormato'.<br />`Tales...' consists of 4 `interlocking' pieces of music, all around 20 minutes long. Not one of them can stand up next to `Close to the Edge' or `The Gates of Delirium'. While there are obviously good moments in each song, the overall effect is rather bland, and it feels to me that the band are not committed to the relatively weak material. <br />The first two songs, `The Revealing Science of God', and `The Remembering' (the first CD) are pleasant enough, but can't sustain their 20 minute lengths, being too much in the same mood. Songs of this length require much more going on to be truly effective. Saying this, there are some nice touches - the main keyboard/bass riff in `Revealing...' is great, and the `relayer' sections of `Remembering' are wonderful. <br />`The Ancient', and `Ritual' make up the second CD, and `The Ancient' suffers from the same problems as the first CD. The percussive-heavy King Crimsonesque intro is interesting and unlike anything Yes have previously done, and similar passages are repeated throughout the song. `Ritual' is the strongest composition here, and parts of it show Yes at their best, if perhaps suffering slightly from the lack of dynamism that pervades the album. But as the longest song here, it's also the most inventive and clearly defined as a piece of music. If you want the definitive version of this song then get hold of ' Yesshows', and ignore `Tales...'.<br />Chris Squire is virtually anonymous throughout, Alan White only comes alive on `The Ancient' and no wonder Rick Wakeman left afterwards. Steve Howe doesn't impress much either. They must rue the day that Jon Anderson started reading `Autobiography of a Yogi'.<br />Now you may think I dislike this album, but that isn't true. I quite like listening to it, and I find the first CD very relaxing, almost easy listening. But what I love about Yes is their stimulating, emotional and passionate music, and so most of `Tales' is atypical in this respect, taking one element of what Yes does and making almost an entire double CD of it. I think this would have been far better served as a single album, with the first 3 songs reduced in length by at least half. For once Eddie Offord was not the right producer.<br />I can't think of any band that could have pulled it off. A heroic failure.
B00000K31V|3.0|If you enjoy wondering how you know if your really awake or dreaming, this movie will really rev your engines. Cronenberg plays with layers upon layers of being inside virtual worlds. I enjoyed it. My wife thought it was weird. My teenage son started badmouthing it with her, but about 1/3 of the way in, told her to \\"please shut up.\\" <br />It is intriguing and well conceptualized. It lacks the Gee-whiz FX of Matrix, the painstaking attention to detail of Thirteenth Floor, and the sympathetic character bonding of Jim Carey in The Truman Show (I won't say it lacks acting talent, a la Arnold Schwartzenegger in Total Recall, however). Perhaps this is part of the point? It's a video game, a toy. MS Flight simulator doesn't have the realism of the military flight simulators developed by LockMart & others. <br />What left me feeling flat was that the movie never really grabbed me. I found it much more entertaining than Dungeons and Dragons (for instance), but I didn't really jack in. It never provided me with the virtual reality so necessary for a great movie experience. Video games lock me in. Addict me. Far too often I say \\"Oh [impolite word for excrement]!!! The sun's rising and I have to go to work!!!\\" before I turn a game off.<br />While this movie had a game-like quality, it didn't have the hook, and that was disappointing. Matrix, The Truman Show, Thirteenth Floor, and even Total Recall--these are movies I watch again and again. eXistenZ ... once was probably enough. <br />I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It had some creative ideas. It dropped some good hints early on, hints that were subtle enough not to give anything away. It ended ambiguously. I like that. But it really failed to dig deep, to stir anything in my soul or my shadow, to make me recoil or cheer. If you enjoyed eXistenZ, you'll probably really enjoy Jack Chalker's excellent Wonderland Gambit trilogy (books, not videos!). It's well written and it plays with reality levels in some creative and intriguing ways.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this movie or review with me, click on the \\"about me\\" link above & drop me an email. Thanks!)
B00005AFMT|5.0|After a seven-year gap, Crimson return with a new line-up, and what is for me their greatest album. And of course, being Crimson, they totally reinvent themselves, moving away from the heaviosity of 'Red' to a sound that, while still guitar-based, bears some influence from the New Wave scene.<br />In Adrian Belew, they have perhaps their most talented vocalist. His powerful singing on 'Frame by Frame, and 'Matte Kudasai' never fails to move me, and after 20 years I never get tired of listening to his commentary on 'Elephant Talk', 'Indiscipline', and 'Thela Hun Ginjeet', which is one of the most dynamic and exciting tracks in the Crimson canon.<br />Crimson show us reflective moods on the gorgeous ballad 'Matte Kudasai', the plaintive main refrain of 'Frame by Frame', and the beautiful desert landscape of 'The Sheltering Sky'. The former 2 tracks also show us some of Belew's pop sensibilities, but this does not prevent them from being essential Crimson.<br />'Red' showed us that Fripp has never needed a second guitar player to produce a heavier sound, and the addition of Belew works in an entirely different way. On tracks like the gloriously chaotic 'Indiscipline', Belew's torturted virtuosity provides a contrast to Fripp's deranged, lumbering riffing, whilst on 'Discipline' their playing is more homogenous, interlocking perfectly.<br />Tony Levin's excellent stick work is notable throughout, and Bill Bruford is as superb as ever, especially on 'Indiscipline'.<br />This line-up would last for 3 years and 3 albums, after which Crimson would again go into hibernation for a decade, and I think these long periods of inactivity which have punctured Crimson's career have kept them fresh and exciting. No album highlights this as well as 'Discipline'.
B000005RST|5.0|I lost my import copy because my ex-girlfriend loved it. My girlfriend and I have since parted, but I just can't forget about this CD. I just have to get another one. Girlfriends come and go. Good music is here to stay. Needless to say, I will not give out my import copy any time soon.
B00005N9CV|5.0|If you want laid-back, breezy, jazzy, romantic, this is your album.  If you like only highly upbeat things, you should probably forget it.  The orchestrations are beautiful, the choice of songs impeccable.  Had a bad day at the office?  Put this on, grab a glass of wine, sit in your bubble bath, and just float on Diana Krall's gossamer wings.
B00005RZV4|5.0|THE SOUND QUALITY...<BR>is incredible.  It sounds as good as a studio recording.  And the audience is there in the mix, but ever so subtley... the cheering doesn't overpower the music.  And the volume is so wonderful... i usually keep my headphones on level #9... with this CD, i have to keep it down on 6 or 7 as to not deafen myself.  I've never heard such a good live recording... even other  licensed ones put out by the artists themselves.<br />THE VARIATIONS ON THE MUSIC...<BR>is wonderful.  His inflections, his emotions, are clearly visible.  It doesn't sound like a live version of the studio albums, but rather has an improvised feel - it sounds raw... but perfect.<br />THE ENERGY...<BR>is out of this world.  The crowd, the music, the vocals... everything is just so powerful.  That's really the only way to describe this.<br />This is so far my favorite CD of 2002... and i don't see another one surpassing it for a while.  Any NIN fan must have this... or it would be an awesome way to discover the band.
0140288503|5.0|I am a fan of military history and decided to read this book recently. I have yet to watch the movie, but plan on doing so. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Bowden is skilled at describing imagery in a manner that allows you to picture it in your mind. His style of writing, going back and forth between the battle in Mogadishu and backgrounds of participants, took some time to get used to. Also, I would point out that Bowden's lack of military expereince or in-depth knowledge is an asset. He writes in a manner that a layman can understand, and an enthusiast can enjoy. Very well written and superbly researched!
B00000DCHI|4.0|This is definitely one of the best greatest hits collection I've come across.  Too often, these collections get finished off with too many previously released songs- this one is near perfect.<br />I started out liking the second CD better than the first one.  I guess being a child of the late 70s, I was more familiar with songs from &quot;Innocent Man.&quot;  However, I have made it past &quot;Piano Man&quot; and have found my way to some new favorite Joel songs- &quot;Scenes from and Italian Restaurant,&quot; &quot;New York State of Mind,&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood.&quot;  The only song I'm not too keen on is &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; from the second CD.  <br />I'm a big Joel fan, but not a diehard one, so this is the perfect way to have the best of the Piano Man.  Also, if you can catch him in concert- go.  It's definitely worth it!<br />Not only is this a great CD set, it's also a long set.  This is definitely one that you can find in my car at almost any time!
B00005Q66T|5.0|What Madonna has put together here is most likely a collection of her favorite hit songs of the last decade. The songs are terrific, but they aren't really what I think the public considers her &quot;greatest hits.&quot; Notably missing is &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;You Must Love Me,&quot; among others. I also find it curious that she chose not to include any new songs in the set. This would have been a great selling point to existing fans who already have all her music, plus she had great success with the two new tracks that she added on to her first GH set (&quot;Rescue Me&quot; and &quot;Justify My Love&quot;).  Alas, I still gave this set 5 stars... not because I wasn't a bit miffed about songs that were not there, but because the songs that ARE there are terrific. And, having all the music on one disc is convenient.
0446677450|4.0|Being a novice to \\"financial intelligence\\" as Kiyosaki calls it, I was intrigued- by Sharon Lechter's introduction and Kiyosaki's childhood anecdotes of his second family.  The rest of the book dwells on driving you to insanity with his cliches, and bragging of his ability to generate millions in ripping off citizens who are in desolate situations.  <br />Nevertheless, the information in this book conveys the simplicities of finance that can keep you from spending your life in debt and allow you to get out of the &quot;rat race&quot;.  What Kiyosaki says will keep you out of this rat race is your \\"financial genius\\", or however close you come to attaining it.  <br />The diagrams in the book take a while to understand, but are useful in that they are the most direct Kiyosaki will ever get in conveying information.  Lastly, Kiyosaki needs to hold back on his egotism and give more credit to Mike's father, then work on his grammar.  <br />If you intend to read this book as an introduction to investing, this will be a great start; but if you're past that stage, you can afford to pass this one by.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie takes you from laughter to crying and back again in a way that somehow makes you less cynical about life despite the horrific backdrop of the story.
B000009QO6|5.0|This is the first album from one of my favorite bands.  I think it's just about the very best Glenn put out though I must admit I like all of them.  I remember being 17 and wearing alot of black and hanging out with my friends blaring Danzig out the windows.  Now, I'm turning thirty and when I listen to this cd it brings me back.  This is one that stands the test of time.  Back then, this was a very different style than what most bands were putting out. Still, its some of the best music of that era.  Glenn has one of the more unique and distinct voices in music.  His singing voice is good on both the ballads and the faster songs.  There's not a bad one on this so its easily played all the way through.<br />My favorites are &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;She Rides&quot;, &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; and &quot;Soul on Fire.&quot;  Danzig is a great band.  A stellar first album!
0345350499|5.0|This is by far the best book i have ever read. It is captivating and extreamly realistic, with indepth charcters. I am a great fan of the arthurian legend, and of history in general. The first books i read that got me into king arthur was the warlord chronicles by bernard cornwell. I then went searching for king arthur books. i found mzb's avalon trilogy in a bookshop, all priced the same, and i chose the mists of avalon as it was the biggest and best value for money. after the first chapter i fell completely in love with the book. it enthralled me from the start. the story of igraine and utgur was fasci8nating, and i could not stop reading it. as i was at school at the time, i even read it during lessons, and whenever i could. i stayed up nearly all nights trying to read more and more of it. I found it difficult to find places to stop and put the book down for a while because interesting things kept of happening, it had my complete attention at all times. I loved the way the characters were described, they were not only different and interesting people but their characterisation by mzb went deeper than that. she made it possible for you to understand every character and why they did things. after the first time i read it i did not like some characters, but i understood them completely. One of the most important parts of the book is the fact that Morgaines fall is described so fully and with such sympathy. you can see it coming but it still takes you by surprise when it happens, her downfall is also completed by her son who tried to love his parents. Morgaine is the best character in a book i have ever come across she is the only one who truelly seemed real, and that anyone can connect with her and understand what she is going through. another thing i find fascinating is the religious issues involved in the story, in a way it seems biased, but its not really, both religions are spoken for by two main characters, and morgaine even says there is nothing wrong with christianity, it is a complete way of telling facts that were happening. I have read many other king arthur books, and never have i come across one so epic in its storytelling, and so magnificant. Mzb's other books are also amazing but they never quite live up to this, i dont think that anything ever will be able to.
B00005LOUP|3.0|Ok, I was one of those who had been very excited to see a live action Grinch.  Now I usually have a very open mind to all movies so I expected to adore this film.  I had heard how everyone for the most part loved it.  So I buy it and for some reason it just falls flat.  I can't place my finger on exactly why I found this movie unappealing but all the same I did.  Of course, its a beautiful film full of Christmas sights and I love Christmas movies in general.<br />I have always loved Dr. Seuss and the Grinch in particular and I'm a huge Jim Carrey fan as well.  So I watched this again recently and tried to decipher this feeling.  The portrayal of the Grinch is done well by Carrey but I just found the Grinch to be a totally unsympathetic character.  Wait, I know, I know, he's a Grinch but during this film I found this the most unlikable representation ever.  And for some reason, I wasn't too keen on the little girl.  She smirked alot during the film especially in parts where that wasn't necessary.  Ok so now maybe I'm being a Grinch but this Grinch might have stole Christmas but it sure didn't steal my heart!<br />However, it is a Christmas classic and its reasonably enjoyable for the most part.  Beautiful scenery, good music and I loved Max.
0446525537|5.0|Sparks sure was sure right about this book. It made me laugh and cry. Although i did see the movie first, the book was even better. A great read for young teens who dont appreciate what they have in life!
6304711875|5.0|This film has redefined the horror genre. Call it post-modern perhaps. Scream is not making any serious comments about life or the human condition, it just sends up American teen horror flicks. And it does it with style, humour and intelligence. This is a must-see film - scary, witty and sharp. It's a shame it is responsible for a number of truly appalling imitations. This is the original, so see it!
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie was definately the best movie I have ever seen. Their were somethings left out but it was still excellent. The cast was amazing and everything from the quidditch scene to the size of Hagrid was excellent. This is definately a movie worth seeing and I will definately see the second installment to it. I highly recommend seeing this movie it is awesome!
B00004U2A1|1.0|What's it all about? Perhaps I'm just stupid, but to me it tries to fit into the category 'so bad it's good.' It's just bad. If you enjoy intelligent or well-made films avoid this one. However, if you enjoy bad acting, inane scripting, dreadful make-up and haphazard direction it's your film.
185984054X|5.0|people, follow the money! Here Hitchens slices to the quick of populist well-wishing and banality. He illustrates again how self-appointed 'conduits to deity' often practice the opposite of what they preach. But the best reason to read this book is to firmly underline the broader fact of the correlation between population and poverty, which the Catholic Church hopelessly ignores.
1559409002|4.0|Creepy and atmospheric, brooding and frightening. The pace is slow at times but the overall effect is hypnotic. The plot has been borrowed by a couple of very successful films recently - better not say which ones! Shows what you can do on a shoestring budget.
B00005U11Z|5.0|This has got to be the best ever.  The superb voice of Steve Augeri and musical talents of the band take this concert to the top of all entertainment.  Steve Augeri cranks it out with such Steve Perry style.  It's amazing how their voices are so similar.<BR>Listening to old Journey tapes it is apparent the new Journey's music is more intense.  &quot;KEEP THE JOURNEY GOING&quot;!
B00005ASHM|5.0|So much ink has been spilled on the subject of Pet Sounds there's almost nothing more to say, but I felt compelled to add a special note about the stereo mix first created for the Pet Sounds box and now available on this single disk. More than anything the stereo mix justifies this album's reputation. Wilson's primary genius is to be found in his harmonic sense and audacious orchestration. In it's original mono mix, Pet Sounds buried these virtues so deeply that listeners had to listen past the Spectorish wall of sound to hear the brilliance of the music. No longer. Although I tend to be a historical purist and am certainly glad that the original mono mix is available, the stereo mix is so dramatically better that it should bascially be considered a replacement...once you've gone stereo, you'll never go back!

B0000024JN|4.0|License to Ill is a decent effort by the Beastie Boys. We all like songs like no sleep til brookly and fight for your right to party. It definetely was a groundbreaking rap album. .... However, it seems like looking at the groups later material that they album could have been a lot better. If you listen to paul's boutique or ill communication you'll see that. However licensed to ill is still a really great album if you're at a party even after all these years which shows that the band was up to something good when the wrote the album.

B000000H57|2.0|After a bad joke--a song that isn't really a song--and some goof intros by the band, somehow one knows one's in for self-parody. Love You To Death isn't half bad, with some impassioned cliches being slung around, though it is of preposterous length. Be My Druidess (wonder if he tries that in bars) is a buzzy chomp-at-the-bit, complete with hokey voice distortions and fribulating effects. The song is virtually destroyed as soon as the singer starts promising that he'll \\"do anything to make you come\\". Green Man follows and it is alright; the guy can sing, it's just a matter of what he's wrapping his mouth around, which is nothing but half-baked imagery. The next song Red Water is some invoking atmospherics wasted on a tale of terror during the holiday season. But hey, it manages to work a jingly christmas classic into the mix, so who's not having fun?<BR>     <BR>Another song of epic length and I could go on and on. However, when you start hearing lyrics more and more in the vein of \\"My girlfriend's girlfriend, she's my girl too\\" or \\"now like a bird she flew away\\" alongside stock guitar solos and interconnecting said-same keyboarding, it gets trying. To be fair, these guys do have a scary earnestness to their lampoon craft. This results in some bursts of honest music--flowing keyboard shadings or guitar grit--that unfortunately, only serves to make the laughable all the more laughable.<BR>     <BR>Josh, Kenny, Johnny and Peter (no last names here) make up Type O Negative, with a guest appearance by the Bensonhoist Lesbian Choir.
B000000WZ4|5.0|After a long four year gap, depeche mode comes out with violator. The album sounds great showing that the band can still play well. There are great tracks like it's no good, uselink and useless. Violator really shows how well the band has matured to this date.

0783235607|5.0|Terror landmark that retains its impact where hundreds of crude imitations fail. The foreboding dialogue is sharp and rhythmic, Hitchcock's precision clutching, the score classic fright fuel, and Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates endearingly wacko.

6303566448|4.0|Ghoulish and morally defunct, this finely acted and directed wonder revels in its testing of taste limits.

There really is nothing else like it. It really shows how talented the band is. The previous work is good but Roots shows how far they can take their music.
B00003CXAQ|3.0|After his colossal success in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" Stephen Spielburg himself seemed to get a bit lost in the making of the prequel, \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\\" Gone is the romance and the adventure of the first movie; instead we are treated with loads of violence and a plot that's hard to buy into. While it's easy to watch Indy off the bad guys when they're Nazis trying to conquer the world, it is extremely disconcerting to watch Jones spiral into the bloodlust of a cult engaged in human sacrifice.<br />No Indiana Jones movie will ever be worth avoiding, and the opening scene of \\"Temple of Doom\\" is memorable. Still, if you're looking for the magic of the first movie, you'll catch more of it in \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\\"
B000002LGW|5.0|101 is really good album for people just starting to get into Depeche Mode. The first disc is live and really captures the sound that Depeche Mode has as a live band. The second disc is a greatest hits collection of the material from the 80s so it gives some of their history.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This film is a Masterpiece. I have been a Kubrick fan since I first saw the Old Dave Bowman point to the Monolith and then turn into the StarChild. I get goose bumps when I watch A Clockwork Orange, and I shuttered when I saw Eyes Wide Shut, but not in a good way. So it was with mixed emotions I entered the theater to see this film. The room darkened and the movie started. I sat enthralled for 2 and a half hours. Here was a Vision I didn't think possible, and a film that restored my faith in Kubrick, and gave me new respect for Spielburg ((hey I liked Hook sue me)) The casting in this film is right on, and you identify with David ((Haley Joel Osmant)) from the first frame he enters the screen.  <BR>    I have to say the defining moment of the Movie is the last half hour-45 minutes. It is such a shift that people started to get up to leave, and even I thought the film was over. But then the real message of the film comes across. ((Sorry to say guys the creatured at the end of the film are machines. David's Great great great... grandchildren... figuratively speaking)) <BR>  This film gave me goose bumps. It restored my faith in two great film makers, that had made some, ((in my opinion)) clinkers. Open your mind, and be ready for the possibility. This is a true Science Fiction film. It asks questions and leaves some of them for you to answer. It was wonderful, it was horrific, it was full of messy human emotions trying to be understood by a boy who didn't have any of his own. Everyone should see this film, if nothing else then to appriciate all the feelings we can feel.
B000002LK1|5.0|Violatar goes down as one of depeche mode's greatest albums for good reasons. THe album is really well written. There isn't a dull momenet on this entire album. Even after all these years in release, violatar still sounds like something new. Songs like policy of truth and world in my eyes stand as a testemant to how well the band plays toghether.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'll try not to be too wordy, although its difficult given how I feel about this film.  My fiancee and I bought the DVD based on positive reviews.  We sat down to watch it expecting some harmless, escapist fun.  Instead we were stunned by the beauty and sincerity of the story and the performances, which left us in tears.  As a former actor who has performed in musicals in the past, I know how difficult it is to communicate real moments and emotions rather than broad portrayals.  The cast did this wonderfully, lead by the brilliant performances of Nicole and Ewan.  Their abiltiy to convey emotional intensity through a simple look, facial expression or movement was awe inspiring.<br />In addition, Baz is a visual genious of a director and the DVD is loaded with enough entertaining and enlightening extras to keep you busy for weeks.  In short, BUY THIS DVD!
B000002MJC|5.0|Songs of Faith and Devotion is a really interesting depeche mode album because there are more rock songs like I feel you to more soft intro-spective songs like I feel you. The album is very dynamic which gives it its strenghth.
1878424319|2.0|This book has some good advice.  However, I found the narrative style to be aggravating.  The style is didactic and somewhat childish.  I finished the book only because a friend encouraged me to try to put the writing style aside.  I think it was a good message, just bad packaging.
B000009RNM|5.0|This greatest hits collection from david bowie stands is a great collection of his early material such as ziggy stardust and velvet goldmine. It really is quite amazing to see how much David Bowie has done in his career. This CD really gives you a picture of what his earliest years were like.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|This album is one of the most refreshing I have bought in years. Besides using sound and rhythm in her own highly individual way, I feel that in this album Bjork has integrated the sounds of modern-day life into constructive musical ideas more successfully than anyone I've heard to date. [Considering I've spent a tremendous amount of time playing for and attending contemporary music concerts, I mean that as a compliment, from one musician to another.] The tunes have a magical quality and though I have not seen the movie I can imagine great musical numbers could come from them. One thing I have noticed though is that, except for the movie theme, the CD sounds best on a boombox, as opposed to when I listened with better speakers. I think that's intentional, but not sure...another small annoyance is that with the other files included on the CD, I've been unable to play it while at work on my PC because once I put it in, it immediately hooked me up to the Internet!
B000000H4V|5.0|Chaos A.D. was my first Sepultura album. It really helped me to see a really great band. Rarely have I heard a heavy metal band like sepultura. The album is fast and aggressive and doesn't take a rest. The band mixes its heavy sound with its strong political beliefs with is a great combination.
B000001EAQ|1.0|Si nunca has oido un disco de U2 y jam&aacute;s has oido una canci&oacute;n de ellos no te compres este disco.<br />Aqu&iacute; no estan los U2 &quot;epicos&quot; del Joshua y los innovadores del &quot;Atchung Baby&quot;.<br />Una vez U2 quisieron pasarse a lo tecno y la pifiar&oacute;n.<br />Este &quot;POP&quot; de U2 equivale al en su d&iacute;a &quot;Hot Space&quot; de Queen.<br />Pasarse del pop al techno s&oacute;lo esta al alcance de unos pocos.<br />Sir ir m&aacute;s lejos Madonna ya lleva 3 discos,pero es que a U2 este POP le sento tan mal que ya no lo han vuelto a intentar.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I did not realize that John Williams had written the score for this movie until I saw it.  I bought the recording for my grandchildren for Christmas.  Truly great music.
B000002UAU|3.0|Not one of us can avoid \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" infiltration into the fabric of American cultural life, whether we like it or not. Nonetheless, there is nothing about it that can compare to \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Abbey Road.\\" It is an entirely unchallenging piece of music. Yes, the album is enjoyable as second-hand listening. As such, it is a soundtrack, a mood-piece, the embodiment, in fact, of the late 20th century version of happiness and joy: pure, dreamy pop.
6304618344|3.0|John Woo's action spectacular is one of those things that has an equal mixture of the excellent and the terrible.  It revolves around cop Sean Archer (Travolta) switching faces and identities with the man who killed his son, Castor Troy (Cage), whilst his enemy is stuck in a coma.  After Troy miraculously awakes from his coma (he is described as brain dead) he swaps faces with Archer and kills all of the people that know that the real Archer is stuck in prison trying to find out about a huge bomb explosion that Troy has planned.  If this sounds complicated, that's because it is, but the director manages to kepp it going effortlessly.  There's also a little delving into the psyches of the characters, with Archer beginning to enjoy the high-jetting lifestyle of Troy whilst still being sickened by looking at the face of a killer in the killer.  The movie also doesn't shy away from the awkward subject of Troy's sexual feelings for Archer's daughter Jamie as sweet-talks her in her father's body.<br />The cast is well-picked, with Travolta especially enjoying his role as the bad guy on the inside.  Cage is good as always and Joan Allen manages to steal just about every scene that she's in.  The acting in itself is an unusual slant on the thriller and it should be applauded by the fact that melodrama is often placed alongside the big set pieces and slow motion gunshots.<br />However, 'Face/Off' is a little overlong (the subplot involving with Gina Gershon could have been cut entirely, save the humour that she brings to the proceedings) and begins to get ahead of itself near the finale.  In particular the religious imagery used in a 'Reservoir Dogs'-style shootout will make most people cringe as doves fly across the screen whilst the two male protaganists face off.  This innocence juxtaposed alongside blood and guts isn't handled well, with 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' being played for one shoot-out.  This movie is most fun when we get to see Travolta acting the bad guy, worming his way into his families affections with his bad boy attitude.  To sum up, 'Face/Off' is a thoroughly superiour thriller until about half an hour before the end where it tails off.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Even if only because this movie has David Bowie in it, it is a must see - it is definitely one of my favourite movies of all times.  From the first time I saw it,  I could only be thankful that it had brought to the screen images that my imagination had been showing me all my life.  And David Bowie.  Ahem.  Anyway, from the puppetry to the sets, the fantasy is complete.  The plot may be a little weak, but it is a fairytale, and generally speaking, fairytales are not required to have strong plotlines, just a good story (which Labyrinth provides).  The music is groovy (especially the Fieries.  And David Bowie), and the Bog of Eternal Stench is something to threaten young children with (not that I would do such a thing, but it might appeal to certain people).
B00005RZV4|5.0|I always wanted Trent to release a live album, after all, you can only fill up on remixes for so long. \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" delivers everything a NIN fan would want.  The live tracks are of extremely high quality, performed very well and the audience is into every minute of it. All of the usual suspects are included on this 16-track disc (Closer, Hurt, Head Like a Hole, Terrible Lie, Sin, March of the Pigs, Starf***ers Inc., The Day The World Went Away, etc.). There are a few tracks I would have liked to have seen included, such as Something I Can Never Have and Ruiner, but I'm not complaining. The best live versions on here would definetly have to be Hurt and The Day The World Went Away. I've had this CD for two weeks and I've been listening to it all the way through at least twice a day. If you call yourself a NIN fan, you must, I repeat MUST own this album!
0451169514|5.0|I'll tell you, Stephen King novels usually take awhile before they really get into the story, but not this one.  &quot;IT&quot; will grab you within the first ten pages of the book and make it very difficult to put this one down.  I have also never believe that a book could leave you terrified until I read this one.  My advice would be to read this book in a well-lit room and not at night if at all possible.  There are several nights that I had to sleep with the light on after reading this.  &quot;IT&quot; is just an overall outstanding book!
B00005A46T|3.0|Any Slipknot fan will tell you that these guys are awesome live. Their music comprises primarilly of loud noise and screaming, intended to induce headbanging and moshing at their shows. While this makes for a great concert-going experience, it does not necessarily make for a great music album. Ultimately, the listening experience becomes tiresome and repetitive; fans will love it, but if you're not a fan, this album won't make you one. <br />Slipknot's combination of destructive instrumentals, harsh screaming mixed with singing and death-heavy lyrics sounds a lot like a much better (though lesser-known) band, Nothingface. If you like Slipknot, or like their kind of music, then you should probably check out Nothingface as well.
0920668372|1.0|I agree with the other sentiments that this book is creepy.  Yes, the mother loves her son and her love is touching.  However, there are other ways she could express her love to her son as he ages without sneaking in and out of his room and house.  I think her passive love is creepy.
0451160916|5.0|One of the scariest books King has ever written, The Shining is a must read. Ive read this book three times, and always find something new and exciting. The Overlook Hotel holds some of the most sinister forces youve ever encountered. As usual, King takes on the job of not only opening new doors to the supernatural, but depicting the mental demons that chase the everyday citizen. Jack Torrance is an alchoholic father who takes his family to Overlook for a nice peaceful getaway. Little does he know, this will be the setting for the final confrontation against the evil that lurks behind every corner and every suite. Read this book and you get the whole King package: magic powers, evils of the human mind, bloody twin girls, moving shrubs, and ghosts popping up everywhere. REDRUM!! Read with the lights on.
B00005MNP7|5.0|The re-issue of &quot;EAT TO THE BEAT&quot; is great!<BR>I still remember back in the 80's when I bought the album and cassette. Unlike the album with the pops, scratches, and skips, and the cassette with the hissing sound, this cd is very clear and the sound is awsome.<BR>Anyone who wants to get the songs of Blondie: &quot;Union City Blue&quot;, &quot;Dreaming&quot;, and &quot;Shayla&quot; should consider this cd. If you like your music crisp, clear and full of pure quality, &quot;EAT TO THE BEAT&quot; is the Blondie cd to get.<BR>I'm excited about this cd. IT'S GREAT!
0689835604|5.0|My daughter absolutley loves this book.  She now runs around, showing everyone her belly button.  It a great peak-a-boo style book I'm sure your children will love.
0452282152|5.0|I like the simplicity of this book.  The story is well paced and and not bogged down with minute details that sometimes make other wonderful books difficult to get through.  I love the descriptions about making the paint and how Vermeer used these colors in his painting.  Wonderful setting.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is epitome of hatred, with loud distorted guitars and rage/depression induced lyrics, not to mention the even infamous Broken Movie.  While most bands that would attempt to put out an album like this would seem like a joke, Trent makes every scream sound sincere.  <br />Broken only has 6 real songs, and two short instrumentals.  But I can't imagine a disc full of songs like these.  It's short and sweet and stays with you.  Highlights include the Grammy winning Wish, Gave Up, and Last.
B000002URV|5.0|This one's a masterpiece. Outstanding tracks like Principles Of Lust (Sadeness Pt 1/Find Love/Sadeness Reprise), Mea Culpa and Rivers Of Belief... what more do you want? The more you listen to it, the more you dream away... And there's no single time the songs annoy you (well, not in my case, anyway). Absolutely love 'em!
B00005J6SZ|4.0|Many people have made speculations that an artist's second album is the album that will make or break that artist's career. I don't believe that statement, but it would appear here that Like A Virgin made Madonna's career. I think the reason for this would probably be because Madonna did more than just dance music for this album. She expanded her horizons to music further than the simple dance songs on Madonna. Here, Madonna moved on to pop, ballads, but still stayed with dance here and there.<br />The album starts with Material Girl, though it would just seem to be pop, it was really controversially speaking out about the materialistic mentality that our world holds. Angel was a dancy pop song with sweet lyrics and a very addictive hook. Like A Virgin, one of Madonna's better remembered songs, was pure mid to up-tempo pop, with dance synth thrown in. Over And Over, one of the more fast paced songs on the album was too fast for dance, but suitable to just be called pop. Love Don't Live Here Anymore was a less than mediocre ballad in my opinion because it held extremely underpowered acoustics and beats, however, it was sung with too much of an overstatement: bottom line, it mis-matched. Dress You Up is a fun song with dance synth and a rising pop sound to it. Shoo-Bee-Doo is a semi-ballad and I hated it because the lyrics are cheesy and it sounds like Madonna was confused as to whether she was singing a ballad or a pop song. Pretender is my favorite track on the album because it's dance beat was so perfect for its time. Stay had the perfect beat and lyrics for the closing track, not too slow, but meaningful.<br />I consider Like A Virgin to be a good album, however, I felt hesitant to give it five stars because the sounds were too mixed for me to say whether I like everything or nothing on the album, but it was good overall.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is by far the most ambitious offering from what I consider the last great progressive rock band on earth. From a musical stand point, I think it is the best stuff since Images and Words. The guitar and drum work is mind blowing!!<br />This album is a must-have for any Dream Theater fan!!
B00004X0ER|3.0|.....in the great hype machine.  Actually, that may be a little unfair as these cats have been around for a while.  With professional critics falling all over themselves to praise The Strokes it's hard not to be cynical when any band that rips off The Stooges, MC5, and Iggy Pop with a little VU thrown in the mix is hailed as rock &amp; roll saviors.  The Hives are a fine rock and roll band, but it's unfair and unwarranted to call them rock's savior.  'Die, All Right' is a fantastic song, especially on the drive to work, and overall the album rocks.  But this is 'punk' rock from Sweden, not that there is anything wrong with that, that wears its influences on their sleeves, backs, and all points in between.  There is nothing new here, it's a basic rock record with basic chords and basic arrangements and basic themes.  Is the state of music so bad that a very average band that breaks no new ground is fawned over?
0784011206|4.0|\\"First Blood\\" was the film that rejuvenated Sylvester Stallone's then floundering career. After the successes of \\"Rocky\\" and \\"Rocky 2\\", Stallone found himself in some movies that, while good, failed to do any business at the box office. \\"First Blood\\" broke that streak, would go on to gross $120 million worldwide, and helped make Stallone one of the top action icons of the 1980's.<br />\\"First Blood\\" is the story of John Rambo, a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who returns to America after escaping from a POW camp in 'Nam, only to find that it's a different America than the one he left. When he arrives, he gets called a \\"baby-killer\\" and spat upon by protestors who view the United States' and his involvement in the war as less than honorable. With nowhere to go, he becomes a drifter, a \\"forgotten hero\\".<br />The film starts with Rambo hiking in the Pacific Northwest, looking for his only surviving buddy from 'Nam. When he arrives at his friend's place, he is saddened to learn that he has passed away from cancer due to exposure to Agent Orange in the war. An upset Rambo then finds himself in a small town where the local sheriff tells him that the town doesn't want someone like him there, and drives him to the city limits. Defiant, Rambo heads toward the town again, only to be arrested and charged with vagrancy. As he is being processed, harassment by the police officers triggers flashbacks of the brutal torture he suffered in Vietnam, and he escapes. He commandeers a motor bike and heads to the mountains, where he takes on the sheriff's posse, and ultimately 200 National Guardsmen. A trained Green Beret, he escapes his pursuers, setting up the climactic showdown between Rambo and the sheriff.<br />Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rambo, and his speech at the end of the film , where he bares his soul and relates to his commanding officer (and in essence, us as well) the suffering he has endured, both during and after the war, is chilling. Character actorBrian Dennehy also turns in a great peformance as Sheriff Will Teasle, the man who pushes Rambo and draws \\"first blood\\" in this war. Also appearing is Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's C.O. in 'Nam, who gets one of the best bits of dialogue when he describes Rambo and his elite training, with almost father-like pride (\\"Rambo's been trained to ignore pain... to ignore the weather... to live off the land... to eat things that would make a billy goat puke\\") to a defiant Teasle. All 3 men give strong performances throughout.<br />The DVD has some pretty good features, among them a trivia game (with some true bafflers!), a trailer, production notes, a featurette on the film (which plays more like an expanded trailer), and commentary by \\"First Blood\\" author David Morrell. It certainly is interesting to hear him compare the film version with the book that he wrote (one of the main differences in the film script being that Rambo lives; in the novel, he dies on the last page). All this is held together by some neat motion menus. <br />The film is in a widescreen anamorphic format, although the picture leaves a bit to be desired, with some color fading and scratches throughout. The soundtrack is in Dolby Stereo, and sounds dated. It's not necessarily that bad, though, as most of the film is dialogue-driven throughout, with the exception being the last 1/3 of the film, when Rambo returns to the town.<br />I give the DVD 4 stars, because this is one of those films that would have been served well with a better digital re-mastering of the print, and a 5.1 soundtrack. I give the actual film 5 stars, because this is one of those films that strikes a chord with everyone. Far from the outrageous action-oriented and almost cartoonishly violent sequels that would follow, \\"First Blood\\" is basically a psychological story about a man who is trained as a killing machine for war, yet finds out that when he comes back from that war, he can't just \\"turn it off\\". Rambo leaves his wide-eyed innocence back in 'Nam, and when pushed around by Teasle and his posse, he reverts back to that which he knows best: Defeating the enemy by any means necessary. It's certainly well worth it to sit down and watch Stallone in his 1st portrayal of Rambo, playing him as the haunted man who can't escape his past, as opposed to the later films where he would become an unstoppable killing machine who would grunt and yell his way to almost implausible victory. Highly recommended.
B00000DLVA|4.0|I have been a fan of the Cardigans for a while, and I've always been a little annoyed that people listen to Lovefool and assume that the rest of their music is a clone of the ultimate happy-pop of their biggest hit. In much the same way that Brick, Ben Folds Five's biggest commercial success, was unlike anything else that they did, Lovefool was not at all what The Cardigans were about. True, the music was similar, but if you listen the words, you'll realize that there's much more going on than the music lets on. Their music has always been a little disturbing to most of their fans, and with this offering they finally figure that out themselves. This CD is amazing. I gave it 4 stars because I rarely give anything 5. This CD is usually what I turn to on miserable days.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Madonna was only in her mid-twenties when she released this debut album. Being classified as just a post-disco dolly does not do her justice because Madonna was just a brilliant album. The sound of the album doesn't make many reaches farther than dance music. Overall, the album is simplistic. However, simplicity was beneficial because it started off her career without making a large statement that could have steered her career off course.<br />The album kicks off with the classic Lucky Star, the fun dance classic that made for one of the biggest songs of Madonna's career. Borderline, the second track, is mid-tempo and the slowest of all the tracks on this album. Burning Up threw a few drops of punk rock into the musical equation and made for a dance-rock song. I Know It, the second slowest of tracks here, had a dull and cheap dance beat. Holiday is probably the most renowned of songs on the album and it has a great fun pop/dance beat to it. Think Of Me combined simplistic dance beats with a touch of house in the beginning. Physical Attraction could have been a good track if it wasn't so long, but it's hook was pretty decent compared to some of the songs here. Finally, Madonna's first single, Everybody, closed the album and I love that song because its beat is so vintage, but it's a ton of fun as well. Then there are the two bonus tracks, which I wasn't too crazy about, but they were decent.<br />This album has eighties written all over it. If you hate eighties music, I wouldn't even consider buying it. The album held hardly any classics. Lucky Star, Borderline, and Holiday were probably the only three known songs, while others like Everybody and Burning Up have gotten hardly any recognition in the media.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Even though one of my favorite Madonna songs is \\"You Must Love Me\\" isn't included in this greatest hits collection, GHV2 is no doubt a GREAT buy!  How often Madonna changes her image is also how often she creates tremendous HITS after HITS!
B0000004V2|5.0|There is not much more to say about this album than what others have already said. Music can't change the world, but great music can change people's emotions and alter their expectations of what is possible. The Stone Roses' debut was one of those albums that came along in late 1988 and through word of mouth and a lot of hype began to turn the tide ever so slightly in the US in terms of what people liked and were ready for. It was not a smash, multiplatinum disc that led to years of ... follow-ups and overblown tours (that would be Oasis) but it was a stealth attack that was like some kind of sweet, vague wind that swept over a few hundred thousand listeners.<br />No one wrote melodies or guitar leads as strong as John Squire, and no one else but mad 'King Monkey\\" Ian Brown could whisper over them so seductively. This never gets old. It stands up, irregardless of the decade or fads.  The band burned bright, died young, and left a beautiful corpse.
0140149295|5.0|Hi I have never wanted a book as bad as I want this one.  The first time i have ever hear of the\\"HURRICANE\\" was the movie.  I saw this movie and it grabbed me, pulled me in i couldn't spot watching it. I even put up a punching bag because of it.  After I saw the movie I did a little research on Rubin and learned AMAZING things.  So I came on amazon looking for the book I put in an order for it and can't wait to get.  And once I read other peoples reviews I knew I wanted it. So now I sit and wait, butg if it is as intresting as every one says it will be worth it. I hope you find this review helpful and inspire you to read this book.
0800129806|4.0|Not so magic, not so spectacular....BUT the first knight shows a mos human view of Arthur, Gwynevere and lancelot....A MUST SEE.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Simply put this movie will have you thinking about reality as you think you know it to be.  Waking Life does what few movies have ever done, or ever will do for that matter; weave thought-provoking ideas/conversations with cinematically awe inspiring technology, whereby the viewer is forced to concentrate to comprehend.  Once comprehension is attained, even more questions abound.  After all, was it not Voltaire who said \\"judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.\\"<br />Suffice it to say, I for one will be in line to get mine when it's released.<br />Bring it on!!!
B00005T30L|5.0|I've alway been of the opinion that American Beauty was terrific due to a great screenplay, terrific direction and fair acting.<br />Thora Birch seemed to have terrific range in that movie as an actress, but that could have been editting and direction.<br />In Ghost World, she makes me wonder if she was what made AB great.<br />This terrific movie boasts some remarkable dialogue, excellent cinematography and very tight directing.<br />More importantly it boasts a living heart that is often imitated in film but very infrequently to success.  These girls make you care about them.  They're terrific, funny, a little cruel but definitely very human.<br />If I have a critique, its that the plotline was a little weak.  But in truth, the nature of its living heart means that the plot is like that of life, vague, mostly not-there and intriguing.<br />Go see this flick.  You'll be happy you did.<br />By the way, among the unknown cast members, the shirtless fellow with the nunchucks was a wierd little standout...who in heck was that?<br />Oh, and last, why wasn't Terry Garr's name (she's nearly unrecognizable in this film) in the credits?  Its not even that she did this film incognito...Maxine, her character in the movie, isn't even listed in the credits.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I will mainly reiterate what's already been worded quite well by others here. the first track which had radio play &quot;no such thing&quot; trx #1 was the freshest and most melodic song i've heard on radio for ages. when my radio station star 98.7 (LA) played it, a slew of callers asked &quot;who was that?&quot; john captured the interest of many many listeners. he's a new talent that may not be innovative, but his sound is refreshing and has great pop hooks.<br />i think he focuses on the joy of childhood/boyhood. at this point, i'm more impressed by his songwriting abilities than in his lyrics, which are sophisticated sometimes, but also a bit immature at times. but hell, this is a young man who obviously has a tremendous future ahead of him as he experiences more life and puts his pen to paper and guitar to fingers!<br />Yeah for fresh new real talent!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|This is another example of the great talent of this artist.  Just as she did during the Lover's Live tour she gives her all on this recording.  Although one does not get the thrill of being present, this is a great effort!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I was actually living in Nash's bizarre world with him before I realized it was not reality. John Nash proved there is a very fine line between genious and madness. Working in the mental health field, I would like to say this disorder was looked at by the filmakers well.  Needless to say, Crowe's interpretation of the externally tics, shyness and hyper-intellect, but internally troubled John Nash was superior.  To be able to project on the screen the internal distress of the schizophrenic and his attempt and ability to function in everyday life was amazing.  Bravo to all involved in getting this material to the screen!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Although I really like the song &quot;Last Nite&quot; with its simplicity and somewhat dedication to a mod, retro style of music, I think The Strokes are just...decent.  The classic rock feel is presented well by the unique vintage production style, but it just doesn't fit.  They need an edge.  They can't be too suggestive to Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground.  The vocalist for this group is way too close to achieving Iggy's voice.  I love Iggy Pop.  &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is one of my favorite albums.  But this album is just a lot of simple beats with a rusty sound to it.  I like their music though.  It's a different kind of musical pleasure to me.  Maybe it just has to grow on me.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Unlike the other reviews on this page, I'm not rating the quality<BR>of the remaster (which I think is fine anyway; yes it could've<BR>had more photos or bonus tracks, but what is there is fine and<BR>the sound quality is superb) so much as the album itself.  And<BR>&quot;Benefit&quot; is one monster of an album from when Ian Anderson was<BR>operating at the very peak of his abilities.  Having made<BR>what remains their greatest work &quot;Stand Up&quot; and just a few<BR>months away from their acknowledged 'big one' &quot;Aqualung&quot;, it<BR>should be no surprise that &quot;Benefit&quot; is magical from beginning<BR>to end.  And with the advantage of the CD format, one can<BR>program the bonus track &quot;Teacher&quot; (which was on the US version<BR>of the album anyway) to replace the only weak track here, &quot;Son&quot; <BR>(try it--it flows seamlessly with the other tracks on side one).<BR>Otherwise, the album is very similar to &quot;Stand Up&quot; in that<BR>it presents a winning combination of blues-based hard rock with<BR>progressive touches; nowhere is this better demonstrated than<BR>on the opening &quot;With You There To Help Me&quot;, which closes with<BR>a stunning tradeoff jam between flute and guitar that just might<BR>be my all-time favorite Tull moment.  Songs like &quot;Inside&quot;, &quot;Alive<BR>And Well And Living In&quot; and &quot;For Michael Collins, Jeffrey And<BR>Me&quot; display the same kind of affecting warmth in the vocals <BR>and lyrics that made &quot;Stand Up&quot; such a joy, a warmth that would<BR>disappear in the midst of the grandiose concept ambition of<BR>the next album.  <br />Although out of all Tull albums &quot;Benefit&quot; is most similar to<BR>its predecessor &quot;Stand Up&quot; (and a great thing that it is!),<BR>there are differences which foreshadow what was to come. The<BR>album has darker themes and a heavier guitar sound than anything<BR>on &quot;Stand Up&quot;, the addition of John Evan on keyboards and the mix is a little rougher (although the remaster makes it sound more polished than it has ever been, which is another reason why I give it a thumbs up).  For example, there is nothing on &quot;Stand Up&quot; like the heavy backwards interlude in &quot;To Play In Time&quot;.  Anderson also forgoes the flute on &quot;Nothing To Say&quot;, &quot;For Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;To Cry You A Song&quot; and the closing beauty &quot;Sossity&quot;.  The songs on what used to be side two (tracks 6-10) also seem to have a kind of thematic connection, making for a mini-concept which again foreshadows the increasing ambitions of &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; and &quot;Passion Play&quot;.  However, on those later albums Anderson would never again sound as personal and human as he does here.  Taken together, &quot;Benefit&quot;<BR>along with &quot;Stand Up&quot; remains the peak of Tull's career, although<BR>that's not to say that one should ignore their 70s work.  <BR>One last note--the bonus tracks &quot;Singing All Day&quot;, &quot;Witch's <BR>Promise&quot; and &quot;Just Trying To Be&quot; (as well as &quot;Teacher&quot;, but I always program that one with the album) are equally<BR>terrific and masterpieces in their own right.
B0000524E5|1.0|I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.<br />It starts off like another &quot;Flashdance,&quot; which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.<br />Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T &amp; A for the teeny bopper crowd.
0671886231|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. It is also by far the best evidence of the life after death experience. It has literally saved my life when I felt there was nothing worth living for. Betty Eadie show me there was much more to life and living than we can see with our limited vision here on earth. I now feel that even on those really bad days God has something for me that is even more wonderful than I can even imagine. I thank God for this book that opened up a whole new view on death and most of all on LIVING.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is by far my most favorite movie. The acting was way beyond great and so was the singing. Nicole Kidman did a great job as Satine and Ewen McGregor also played his part of Christian extremely well. Both of their voices were wonderful and they have a great chemistry together on-screen. <BR>        The DVD of this movie is greatly put together. The extras are SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR. The deleted scenes are hysterical. You can also watch dance rehearsals, interviews with the actors, music video of Come What May, behind-the-scenes footage, and much much more fantastic stuff. Also the picture quality is 5 out of 5 stars and the same with the sound.<BR>        The movie is about a lonely young man you goes to Paris in 1899. when he arrives he gets a room with a view of the Moulin Rouge. Then a \\"unconcious Argentienian\\" fell through his roof and the fun starts there. When Christian arrives at the Moulin rouge he falls in love with Satine. As the story goes on it gets a lot more serious. The whole end part is a tear-jerker but I don't want to say anymore. I think you should just go out and buy the DVD without even seeing the movie first because I know you will be please like I was. SO IF YOU CAN HUNK HUNKADOLA WITH ME!!!
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Since I was extremely young, Ghostbusters has remained one of my fave movies. The cast is pure genius - Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Akroyd, Sigourney Weaver and the hilarious Rick Moranis. Set in the great New York City, the public are terrifyed by ghostly occurances and the Ghostbusters are there to help. A building, so strange yet bewitching becomes the gateway for the spirits and before long the city faces a fate worse than death....who ya gonna call?...GHOSTBUSTERS!! The story is great and the humour created by the cast is beyond hilarious...well done!! A movie that will go down in history as one of the funniest most well produced movie ever!<BR>Only one bad thing about this dvd edition is that it only plays half of the movie - this is probably due to the RCE feature, it was disapointing to get so into the movie and then have it stop. But great movie!!
B00005QJDG|1.0|Wow.  I had heard this was a good CD.  If you like straight guitar, this stuff is for you.  If not, I wouldn't bother.  Metallica is a better alternative.  You get a little of everything with Metallica.    Metallica is fun.  Dream theater makes wacked out predictions.  Check out their next live CD cover, but don't listen to the music.
6301978587|4.0|I agree this is a great movie and I have been looking for it for a very long time but what is the deal with you guys!  Last night I was trying to log on and couldn't remember my password, this movie was going for $... for a \\"USED\\" copy last night...now it is $... for a \\"USED\\" VHS copy!!  <BR>Give me a break folks!!  I wouldn't pay that much for a brand new copy of any movie!  No matter how much I liked it.<br />Kay Singletary
B00000JGHM|5.0|I had bought this dvd some time ago but never had a chance to watch the movie. OK so with heavy hitting stars like De Niro, Pacino, Val Kilmer and Jon Voigt, I should expect no less than perfection and that is exactly what I got.<br />This fast paced action thriller was so intense that I even had to use the pause button to get a cold beer, something I usually do not do with a lot of the other movie fare around today ....<br />With so many great and concise reviews on this site theres no sense in being repetitive but,  the presentation of the LA cop, Pacino and his wife and stepdaughter was, hands down, the absolute best depiction of that conflict that always exists with cops that are married to their jobs. All cop and robber movies usually touch on the subject but usually fail to display the gut wrenching emotions and conflicts as this movie does.<br />One thing that BUMMED me out completely..... I mean the wide screen aspect comes out as a letterbox in wide screen on this DVD. Hey, cmon guys couldn't you have cut the DVD to cover the full screen I though that when I bought my big screen TV I would not have to suffed through those darned letterbox movies any more.... On the same note the sound tracks, dolby digital sounded a little on the lame side as well ....<br />Normally I would have knocked some stars off my reveiw because of the quality of the DVD but this action packed thirller is worth every buck.
6305903182|4.0|As with most horror series, after part 2 you expect it to go down hill from then on but Scream 3 proved that whole theory wrong. This time it takes the whole Sidney/ghostface scenerio to Hollywood. With most of the cast remaining there are some new additions to the trilogy. There are some clever elements in the movie which make it more chilling and different from the 1st and 2nd movie. Flashback is used quite a lot and makes the link between this movie and the others strong - The story is on going. A great beginning and an even more shocking ending!<BR>A clever, fun and highly entertaining finale to a killer trilogy!!
6301797906|5.0|This is one of the truly great American films that depict a devastating time in the lives of the farmers that inhabited Oklahoma when over farming had created the &quot;dust bowl&quot;.  These people moved west in overwhelming numbers.  A sort of history lesson by viewing Americans making necessary and courageous moves to survive and live......if you've never seen this movie, make it a &quot;must see&quot;......
6303477259|5.0|If there was ever a music video that should be produced in DVD this one is it. Why in the world hasn't this been released as a DVD. This is classic Pink Floyd with most of their best work featured and dazzling light shows to back them up. Pink Floyd fans around the world would line up to own this one on DVD!
B00005JKQX|5.0|If you only see one movie this year, i recommend \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".  It is basically a true story about one of America's most brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner.  Mr. Nash's struggle with mental illness is both sad and courageous....the movie portrayal of Mrs. Nash, a role meant for Jennifer Connelly, was one that shows her strength both as a wife and woman....the progression of time from 1941 to present was believable and accurate....and, of course, the director Ron Howard gave us a clear and uncluttered movie as is his style.
B0000041TD|5.0|YES. <BR>Finally a great performance with great sound quality. This DECCA recording has it all. Perfect sound and amazing cast.<br />And what a cast!!<br />Pavarotti makes here (with some other Donizetti operas on record) one of his BEST performances ever. The voice shines! It is clear with beautiful ringing and healthy high notes. <br />I loved Freni. She delivers here a very wonderful sick and vulnerable mimi. Along with De Los Angeles, she made history of her performance here as mimi.<br />I cannot forget the very precious performance of Ghiaurov! Bravo.<br />And Karajan's recording...amazing (But I think comes second place after Beecham).<br />Well...nothing goes bad in this performance...on the contrary...it is just Perfect!
B000000OU0|5.0|The music of The Eagles mainly defined the California sound of the 70's. For them to reunite was like a dream come true, according to many of their fans.<br />That dream came alive in 1994. With the release of Hell Freezes Over, The Eagles signature sound was revived on mainstream radio. The album contains live material from all of their classic hits, including their version of Don Henley's solo hit, New York Minute, and four newly recorded songs: Get Over It, The Girl From Yesterday, Love Will Keep Us Alive, and Learn To Be Still.<br />While most of the 90's music remained as Hip Hop, Rap, and Teen Idols, it was so nice to see one of the most legendary bands of music history come back to the top. I'm so glad that The Eagles did just that.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Altman's funny black comedy set during Korean War is a metaphor for Vietnam war.Innovative style of filmmaking especially with use of sound. DVD version has restored the film's original R-rating and claims to be ucut yet I don't understand what was put back in. Can someone please help me out here?DVD version includes a lot of bonuses. there are at least 3 documentaries including one about real MASH surgeons.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|If you are a Sade fan. You need this album. If you are not, may you be forgiven.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I haven't seen this DVD, but I have seen the movie twice and I love it.  So my review of 1 star relates to the DVD only and here is my gripe: the producers of this DVD should have thought to include a special feature whereby the movie could be watched backwards, that is, in chronological order.  The format of the movie is such that it would &quot;work&quot; that way as well- sure the scenes would overlap slightly, but that would make it all the more fun.  If I am mentioning what others have in other reviews here, my apologies- it seems like such an obvious use of the<BR>opportunities and possibilities of DVD that I am sure I am not the only one who has thought of it (but if so, remember you saw it here first!).  I have two theories why this omission was made:<BR>(a), putting the scenes in chronological order may show up plot holes or inconsistencies, or (b)- the theory I HOPE is correct-<BR>there is a &quot;Memento Collector's Edition&quot; DVD planned, in which this option will be included.  And that is why I am not buying this DVD!  But, hey, the film is fantastic and once again- AUSSIES RULE!
6302787564|5.0|This is definatly Michael Douglas at his best!  With co-star Robert Duvall you can't go wrong!  Summery: A man who finally snaps after he loses his job.  A divorced man trying to make it \\"home\\" to see his wife and kid, only he is not supposed to go near them.  Robert Duvall plays the cop retiring to only end up not retiring as he gets involved in the case of the clean-cut white man in a shirt and tie who is terrozing the neighborhood.  Extreme violence in parts, use of guns, bad langauge, etc.  A great drama/suspense movie for anyone who once in awhile could just \\"snap\\", but then again couldn't we all!  One man who brings true justice (in his mind anyway) to all those in his way.
0380789019|5.0|I recently read _Neverwhere_ for the 2nd time and I liked it even better than I did the first.  The story is fairly simple with a common device:  a \\"normal\\" protagonist gets sucked into decidedly \\"abnormal\\" circumstances.  In this case, the abnormal circumstance is an alternate London known as the Underside.<br />I found the existence of the Underside completely believable and an insightful comment on a society that most often ignores unpleasantness, or perceived unpleasantness, that it doesn't want to acknowledge, as well as the numerous persons who do not fit the accepted societal norm.  Richard Mayhew's journey is both through an unknown physical realm and one of self-discovery.  This is most evident in a powerful scene where he undergoes an ordeal that forces him to see how society views the denizens of the Underside - when society sees them at all -- while struggling to retain a true sense of self and purpose.  After this ordeal, he is inevitably changed, as all people are changed when their narrow view of reality is challenged.<br />Gaiman is a master of alternate reality, pun, and dream language, and he makes full use of it here.  The Underside is loosely associated with the London Underground system, but in this hidden realm station names are no mere arbitrary designations.  There are really Friars and Blackfriars and an Earl does hold sway over Earl's Court.  This makes for both humour and an awful kind of suspense.  I wouldn't call _Neverwhere_ true horror, except inasmuch as accepting a wider view of reality, with all its terrors as well as its wonders, can be horrible as well as exhilerating.  _Neverwhere_ can be an uncomfortable book and I don't think it would appeal to anyone who values comfort above thought.<br />AS always, Gaiman's writing is beautiful and concise.  HE is very matter of fact about the more gruesome bits, but that makes them all the more chilling.  He does not judge, he merely presents and lets actions speak for themselves.  I  find this admirable and affecting.  When he does feel the need to make a particular point, he does it very subtly.  One of my favourite examples of this occurs when the main characters are passing by a river.  Gaiman says, \\"This was not the kind of river you could fall into and get out of again.  It was the other kind.\\"  We all know what that means, or can imagine it.  There's no need to go into it further.<br />Occasionally character does come second to atmosphere.  We do not get much of a glimpse into the minds of the people who inhabit London Below, but it's not really an issue.  For them, this is just the world.  It is Richard, in his transitional state, who is able to make comparisons and suffer regrets.  I think it shows incredible sensitivity on Gaiman's part to be able to point out that, however odd something may be, for someone, for the people who live that life, it's just normal.  It's the outsiders who question and judge.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely and recommend it highly.his admirable and affecting.

B00005NW02|5.0|I am normaly aginst selling out, but I think this is just what the mainstream needed.(Same gose with POD.) At last MTV is playing and promoting some real metal and not that gay Limp Bizket stuff or Kid Rock stuff. <br />In my mind the most catchy and best songs on the albem are X, Chop Suey, Jet pilot, Toxicity, and the lyricily important Prison Song. Won thing I thought was cool was how System of a Down used bible lines in the lyrics of their single Chop Suey.<br />I think their Self titeld CD is slighty better, but this to is a must and like so many others have said one of the years best CDs.
0689835604|5.0|Just as with \\"Where is Baby's Mommy\\", my 7 month old daughter loves this book.  She sits with me while I read the whole book, unlike other books that don't quite hold her attention.  I think the illustrations are one of the main reason, they captivate the attention of little babies and it is not too long either.  She always laughs and giggles with this book, I definitely recommend it for other babies to enjoy!
B00000JH09|5.0|Like so many others have said before. System of a Down have a complete different style and sound than any other metal band out thier now. This is the edition of their self titled CD to get, because you get music videos with it and it costs the same as the first virsion. Stand out tracks for me are War?, Spiders, Ddevil, and Suger wich as a great music video to it.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Me being a diehard fan of Sade,I nearly was estatic when I found put that she was going to release a live album of her seamless<BR>'Lovers Rock' tour(in case,you didn't know,the best tour of 2001).Unfourtnaly Sade didn't come to my town BUT after listening to this sublime 70-minute live collection,I feel like<BR>I actually played catch-up.Only Sade can sing her rich catolgue<BR>in front of a packed arena and make it feel as intimate and <BR>passionaite as if she's singing just for you.<br />&quot;LOVERS LIVE&quot; opens up with a bang with a sultry rendition of<BR>&quot;Cherish The Day&quot;.Not only does &quot;Cherish&quot; sound better live but<BR>Sade seems to dig deeper without losing her poise,class,and<BR>sophiscation.Altough every single minute of this album is <BR>worthful,I must admit I there are some moments that will always<BR>stand out.An even-more dub-by take of &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;'s &quot;Slave Song&quot;,a sultrier-than-ever version of &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot;,<BR>a groovy take on &quot;Paradise&quot;,and the 8-minute finale of &quot;Is It<BR>A Crime&quot;.This song ends this heartful experience with a very high<BR>note.Sade ends this song with a acrobatic vocal that I have never heard her do on a recorded record.<br />For anyone who missed Sade's tour,&quot;Lovers Live&quot; will be a perfect<BR>CD for you to have.Even if you saw the concert and you're a mega-fan of Sade(like your faithful reviewer),you can't do without this one.<br />But,hold up a minute,there are still are songs that I'm kind of let down that Ms. Adu &amp; Co. didn't include on &quot;Lovers Live&quot;.<BR>I would've loved to see Sade work out 1984's sultry &quot;Cherry Pie&quot;<BR>or 1992's &quot;Couldn't Love You More&quot; live.Not to mention 1985's<BR>smoky &quot;Maureen&quot; or for that matter,1988's uplifting &quot;Keep Looking&quot;,or how about &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;'s powerful &quot;Every Word&quot;.<BR>As you can see,I'm mad about Sade's music.<BR>And if you already haven't been seduced with Sade's rare,beautiful gift,this CD will defintly make you a convert
B00005NZBN|5.0|There is not a bad song on this album, but Po' Boy is my personal favorite; Bob should've been nominated for a grammy for best vocal for this song.  The bonus tracks (which have been available on various boots for years) also add to the greatness of this package.

B00003W8NM|5.0|''There is too much violence in Fight Club!&quot; remark the cowardly reviewers who mock this brilliant piece of fiction. If this is so, they clearly have a weak knowledge of film, as there are MANY MANY more films out there that are 10 times as violent. <br />I'm not going to bother to write a pretentious, opressive review, and instead tell it to ya straight.<br />Fight club is the tale of an unnamed office worker (played by Norton)- a slave to money and merchandise, living in somewhat of a shrine to IKEA. Bored, disillusioned, and suffering from insomnia, he attends cancer support groups to wallow in sympathy and self pity with others, to alleviate the turmoil of his sad lonley exsistence. <br />His life changes, however, when he meets Tyler Durden- a hedonistic soap salesman- who is literally everything that Norton's character isn't. <br />the rest of the story documents the growth of 'Fight Club'- an underground bare knuckle fighting network that Tyler and the narrator create, and riddled with Tylers twisted anarchic philosophy, the film compels due to its slick direction and sublimely satisfying visceral content.<br />yes, it is violent, but life is violent, and you cant spend your days sheltered from the facts of life.
B000002KE2|5.0|Vol. 4 is in my opinion the pinnacle of Sabbath's total achievement, their greatest album and one of the greatest heavy rock albums ever. I love all of the Ozzy era albums, especially the first 6, but 4 does it for me best. This record proved that Sabbath were exceptional musicians as well as THE heaviest band of their time. The opener \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" is an absolute monster! Geezer's lyrics and Ozzy's voice never sounded better and Iommi lays down another sledgehammer assault on our senses, easily one of their triumphs!. \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Tommorrow's Dream\\" and \\"Under the Sun\\" continue the aural onslaught, but \\"Supernaut\\" deserves special recognition along with \\"Confusion\\" as the best song from 4. Easily Bill Ward's finest hour as a drummer, he never sounded so good. Showing a softer side and a new complection to their sound are the classic ballad \\"Changes\\" and Tony's acoustic piece \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" which was a tribute to sunny L.A. where this beast was germninated. The band's notorious cocaine intake was also indulged upon during these heady times. Fortunately like many great bands of their era, chemically intake had yet to interfere with creative genius, although strains were beginning to show in the band's interealationship. Just as their fellow countrymen Led Zeppelin created their momument to Rock on their 4 album, so the Messieurs Butler, Iommi, Osbourne and Ward acheived immortality with theirs. As great as \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Master of Reality\\" are, Vol. 4 is Black Sabbath's magnum opus.
0385501560|5.0|If you can stand some graphic detail of strange sex including rectal foreign objects, then you should love this book.  Palahniuk has a tremendous imagination and he takes on such diverse territory.  One minute he is skewering organized religion, the next minute he is taking on historical re-enactors.  The plot is utterly ridiculous (like Catch 22) yet there is a gritty realism under the absurdities.  The reader comes away with a little bit of insight about sexual addiction (maybe even all addictions); a little knowledge about the horrid storage spaces that we call nursing homes; and maybe some understanding how unromantic it is to live at minimum wage.  I was fascinated by the realism that underlay the farce.  To top it off there is a plot twist at the end that totally sucker punched me--I thought it was great.
B00003CX5P|5.0|After 16 years of waiting impatiently, George Lucas finally releases the forth Star Wars film which is actually the first Episode of a six part story. The original Star Wars film was Episode Four, Empire: Episode Five and Jedi: Episode Six which concludes the epic saga.<BR>The hype prior to release of the Phantom Menace was bigger than the Death Star and significantly, bigger than Marlon Brando. It was ridiculously hyped beyond belief and only the media was to blame. LFL actually asked for the hype to be contained, but by that time it had gotten out of control.<BR>Those of you who bought into that hype and were seriously let down by the film are brainwashed, weak-minded fools who will only like something when it is in vogue.<BR>Phantom Menace was getting embarrassingly poor reviews even before it's release. Which is hardly fair to any film.<BR>Even as the poor reviews came flooding out, Phantom Menace was making a killing at the box office. It has held its place as the second highest grossing film at the global box office underneath James Cameron's blockbuster, Titanic.<br />The Film;<BR>The movie failed to meet expectations of the fans because they were expecting to see the excitement and enthusiasm of the original trilogy. There were complaints by some who wanted a \\"Han Solo\\" type character. Why would you want that when Han appears in the last three films? Other complaints were things like \\"Why are the two Jedi acting so wooden\\". Well one of the most important Jedi traits is to show NO EMOTION. But I guess an epic scope storyline like this one is way above and beyond that of the armchair critics of our \\"seen it all before and can't impress me\\" world.<BR>If this film was released in 1977 instead of the original, people would have accepted it more openly. But the sad fact is now that the people consider Star Wars as their own. Just because the audience of 1977 grew up it does not mean that the films also have to grow up as well. If they did would they fit in with the old series and come together as one 12 hour movie? I don't think so.<BR> Lucas himself said way before this movie was released that \\"The first one starts off very slow, it's a very innocent kind of film. As the series progresses it gets darker and finally we will see how and why he (Anakin Skywalker) gets into the mask and becomes Darth Vader\\"<BR>That statement was the key to understanding how the first episode was going to be played out.<BR>Nothing much really happens in this film. It merely sets up the next two and does it beautifully.<BR>We get to see a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) meet for the first time. It also introduces Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.<BR>We also get to see a younger Palpatine (Ian Mcdiarmid) as a Senator on the magnificent planet capital, Coruscant. His political machinations seem to have gone unnoticed by so many. Palpatine who is the Senator of Naboo is also the sith lord, Darth Sidious. As Sidious, he uses the hugely rich and resourceful Trade Federation to blockade his own planet. As Palpatine he uses Amidala, Queen of Naboo to further his own political ambitions, which by the end of the film he has succeeded in. <BR>A glorious spectacle epic in scope, which has been unsurpassed by no other film. Phantom Menace is beautifully designed with spectacular results. It serves as an appetiser for the upcoming sequels and has secured its place in film history.<BR>Hollywood seems to be scared of Lucas. After all, he's the most successful independant filmmaker today. He seems to have a bad reputation just because he is a sucsess story and he accomplished it all on his own terms. <BR>They told him it couldn't be done way back in the 70s. They are still telling him the same thing today. Wake up Hollywood, Lucas' way is the way of the future.
B00000HYSN|5.0|This is my first review of a Will Oldham/Bonnie 'Prince' Billy album.  I chose to review this album first because I think it's simply my favorite in his catalog that I've heard.<br />I would say that 90 percent of this album sounds exactly like my thoughts throughout a normal day.  It's sadly beautiful and hopeful simultaneously.  \\"I See A Darkness\\" is the type of song that makes you want to reflect on life and your inner thoughts.  It's an ode to life.  <br />These songs are sung with such heartfelt beauty and passion that's almost immeasurable to compare this with any other artist.  Will shares a lot of his thoughts and feelings with us in his music.  He has a \\"no-holds barred\\" approach that is sure to catch any listener's attention.<br />All the songs on this album are part of something bigger.  One listen and you'll know that you've found an album with integrity and purity.  It will probably get you through a lot of times in your life if you allow it to.  Either way, this will be an album that you will not soon forget. <br />\\"Death To Everyone\\" is one of the most powerful tracks on this album.  It also happens to be one of my favorites as well.  If it absolutely doesn't pierce your soul, you may not have even been listening and don't deserve to go any further with this album.  I would assume that most fans have heard Will's other work and most put this at very least towards the top.  Oldham has really paved a path for what he wants to get across in his music.  I would venture to say that people will study this work for many years to come.<br />If you've heard of Bonnie 'Prince' Billy/Will Oldham or are intrigued by what you've heard about him in general, this is definitely an album you should check out.  Of course, he's got so many I guess you could start anywhere.  Are any of them bad? No.  My opinion would be to start here.  If you don't become instantly fond of this work, you may not need to get anything else by him.
B000060OFT|5.0|I must say that Baz Lurhmann is a gifted person. His ways of telling the story, the choreography, the music, everything. He truly deserves every award he is nominated for. <BR>I can't stand Leo DiCaprio, but he & Claire Daines did beautifully in their roles as the Star-Crossed Lovers. The language of Shakespeare is spoken wonderfully.<BR>For those who will be seeing this for the first time: prepare yourselves. I can guarantee you that at 1st, it will be too much to handle. But the more you see it, the more you'll love it. That's how it was w/ me.<BR>The movie first starts out w/ the prologue (\\"Two households...\\")and all these fly-by viewings and zoomings of Verona Beach (filmed in Mexico City).<BR>If you don't like stylized movies, then this is definitely not the type of movie to see. The \\"swords\\" in this movie are guns and since the movie was filmed in Mexico, you'll see many icons & paintings of the Virgin Mary & Jesus Christ. But nothing blasphemous.<BR>I could go on for hours about this, but I shan't. People who have not seen this: SEE IT!! It is the most beautifully-told version of Shakespeare's masterpiece I have ever seen.<br />For fellow Baz Lurhmann fans:<BR>With the success of \\"Moulin Rouge\\", Baz has finished this trilogy he has worked on for years. It is called the \\"Red Curtain Trilogy\\". \\"Strictly Ballroom\\", \\"R+J\\", & \\"Moulin Rouge\\" are the trilogy. In each movie, Baz tells the story through 1 subject:<BR>\\"Strictly Ballroom\\":  dance<BR>\\"R+J\\":                language<BR>\\"Moulin Rouge\\":       song
0790729725|3.0|If you havent yet seen this movie your missing out on one of the best movies ever made. I too was disapointed with the DVD though. This was one of the first DVDs to come out so its understandable that it doesnt have a lot of extras. It's not enhanced for 16:9 and you have to flip the disc. buy the newer version where all this is fixed
B00004SCX6|1.0|well thankfully i didnt buy this it was a gift from my friend and this is the worst i mean i cant stand her, she cant sing and her voice is fake like her body. anywyaz why do they call her the Queen of pop first of all she hasnt been around long enough to be called that, she dont deserve that. she needs more work. she go's from inocent little girl next door look and then she go's to slut trying to use her body for money. she represents herself like she wants to sell her body. dont buy her albums it poor work and a waste of money.
B00005LMBK|5.0|If you are sick of the hype and the bulls**t in so much of today's popular music, buy this album.  Gorillaz is the most unique and mind blowing album of 2001.  They have a wide range of songs; from unique instrumentals like Double bass, to funky rap songs like Rock the House, to trippy techno tracks like Starshine, to eclectic latin mixes like Latin Simone, this album has it all, without a single overused pop cliche.  However, if you are only considering buying this because you like their single Clint Eastwood, be warned that none of the rest of that album is really like that song at all.  If you can't handle overly experimental stuff, this is not for you.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I've not enjoyed a guitar/rock album in quite some time, but this is it.  I was skeptical as usual, when I heard the hype about the new Strokes album.  Their Ep was just a teaser and a good one at that. What does this music evoke, both the 70's and the 90's.  Yeah, all the usual comparisons are here... the CBGB era bands, television, the voidoids, etc. My goodnes its good to hear a \\"fresh\\" guitar instead of the usual aggro-angst-metal.  This is both punk and transcendent(sp?), kind of like the way a guitar sound carries you. Not droning like a Bob MOuld but more like a Robert quine sound in a way. The songs aren't terribly deep either they come and they go ... they're quick throwaway pleasures.As for the 90's part, it reminds me a little of Elastica... great guitar band.... lots of punk era influences on their sleeves... great short songs about love, but when the songs over and your quit dancing around your room... you think, is this it?  What I mean is the songs lyrics don't replay in my head all day like good dylan or eminem or clash or whatever... But, man this CD rocks, and it will be a long while til it gets bumped off my CD player.<br />Finally, a good original guitar band. Now whatever happened to Elastica?
B00005O5JV|4.0|Reese Witherspoon is Elle Woods, a blonde and beautiful if slightly ditzy college senior whose life is turned upside-down when her rich boyfriend Warner Kensington the Third (Matt Davis) dumps her.  With her daddy's plastic, a bottomless wardrobe and a college career based on \\"Fashion History\\" Elle is something of a Barbie Doll come to cruel life.  Getting into Harvard Law School, and having a promising future ahead of him, Warner sees himself as a future JFK, and JFK isn't supposed to choose Marilyn over Jackie O.  Convinced that she still has a chance, Elle pulls out all the stops and manages to crack into the freshman class at school where she sticks out like a sore (and poorly accessorized thumb).  Making no friends, and confirming every dumb blonde stereotype ever conceived, Elle is ruthlessly victimized by her seemingly smarter and insecure classmates.  Elle wouldn't make it past her first day if not for her inexplicable capacity to dig out the common sense buried under the heady legal theory.  Instead, she sort of prospers becoming a success story and more mature person while still being the same cute Elle that only Reese Witherspoon can create.<br />It's a thin plot, and the tacked criminal trial added at the end seems an excuse to keep a lame idea going, but it works because, like Elle, the script has an endless reservoir of pluck and manages some cute tricks of its own.  The dim homilies guiding Elle's sorority lifestyle are bound by a fierce sense of loyalty (people who exercise can't kill people - the endorphins make them too happy), one that the script remains true to.  In the end, Elle wins her case because of her loyalty to an accused killer and former sorority sister, one that you'd never think twice about doubting.  Neither seem to deserve the attention or loyalty, but manage to win the case anyway.  See it if only for Reese Witherspoon.
0140177396|5.0|The author paints a story of two unlikely friends, Lenny who is very much like a child but huge and as strong as a bare and often runs into trouble with out knowing it. Bad tempered but somewhat kind George has to get Lenny out of trouble sometimes losing his job. They both share a dream together of having their own farm and just when it seems close to coming true things go absolutely wrong. I read this book and it left me breathless at the end and touched me deeply because of how it reflected the harsh times then and now and of how society deals with different minded people. The writing is beautiful filled with heavy metaphors. I think if you've read John Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; you should read this too, or if you are interested in something heavy and thought provoking or if you want to read a good book that's bin banned before :)
6304696515|5.0|This is an excellent film.  The book is even better.  This brings me to my second point, which that it was written by Choderlos de Laclos, who never seems to be mentioned in connection with this movie.  Get the book - you won't regret it.
0375805613|5.0|I remember this book vividly from my childhood and I'm so glad to see that it's still available for me to share with my little one. Buy this book. It's silly and you'll all love it!
B00005OLAS|4.0|I can't believe how well this sci-fi movie has aged.  Imho it plays as well today as it did when it first came out.  The plot is compelling, the interactions between the cast members enjoyable to watch, and the &quot;special effects intensity&quot; kept at just the right level.  The movie score truly is memorable also, if you ask me.
0792106989|5.0|Director John Ford and John Wayne teamed up in \\"Stagecoach\\" and \\"The Searchers\\" with western classics resulting in each case.  Not only did Ford and Wayne team up in \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\"; gigantic film talent Jimmy Stewart joined the team as well.<br />Stewart is the new man in town, and as such he is called \\"Pilgrim\\" by Wayne.  Despite teasing the city slicker newcomer trying to blend into a tough western town, Wayne obviously admires Stewart for his book learning and ambition.  After one teasing session prompts Stewart to sock his new friend, Wayne gets up off the ground, rubs his jaw, and compliments \\"Pilgrim\\" for possessing a good punch.  When it comes time to hold a local election Wayne has the newcomer preside.  Hard-drinking localite Ken Murray grumbles over the bar being closed for the election process, but endures it nonetheless as Wayne announces the bar's close for civic duties, then its reopening afterwards.<br />Eventually Stewart will go on to obtain a law degree and become a United States Senator, but one event sticks in his mind, causing him grief.  Stewart believes that he killed town bully Lee Marvin in a duel, a culmination of a longstanding grudge Marvin has for the well educated city man, someone he taunts until Stewart agrees to meet him in a duel.  Wayne, Stewart's faithful friend, while lauding Pilgrim's courage in attempting to learn quickly how to use a gun, realizes he is at a tragic disadvantage going up against a veteran gunslinger like Marvin.  As a result Wayne, standing in the distance, actually kills Marvin before he can get a clear shot at Stewart.<br />Andy Devine is hilarious in the role of the sheriff, someone who seeks to placate Marvin through gentle persuasion.  Ken Murray is also hilarious as a serious bar patron whose thirst is prodigious.  This film blends the dramatic with the comedic in successful fashion.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I had never (as far as I know) heard a single P!nk song before, when I got an mp3.com email with the title song from this album.  I went to ... check it out and was blown away by the clips and bought it on the spot.<br />The songs are a wonderful set of r&b/rock/urban toons of a style way different (thank gawd) from the same-ole-same-ole pop ...P>My favorites are Misery and Don't Let Me Get Me, but most of the songs are excellent.<br />Just to put a plug in -- check out Big House for another excellent set of hard-to-categorize albums.
B00005UEAR|3.0|It's too nu-metal influenced. The lead guitarist in my band, who does like Dream Theater, decribed it as a complex Sevendust.I can see where he's coming from. I thought the same thing! The fisrt song is OK, i hate it when they have turntables scratching. Other than that, it's a good album. This is mostly for fans of Dream Theater, not for fisrt-timers. Images and Words kicks the s**t outta this one.
0446525537|5.0|I hate books, and I hate to read, but when I got this book, I had to read it! Then when I started to read it I loved it. It's the best book I have ever read! It's abut a boy and  a girl. The boy is Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan, the boy is pretty popular and always makes fun of Jamie because she is different and he would make fun of her father the community minister!  I was in my room reading and I fell asleep reading it. If you read this book I promise you you will not want to stop! I got into trouble reading it so much! Later on in the book he takes her to the dance because he doesn't have any one to go with, my favorite comment from Jamie was, \\"I'll go under one condition! as long as you don't fall in love with me!\\" Later on you'll see if he does or doesn't and then something happens that they can't control! She has a Bible with her and you'll find out what she does with it! This book is funny, romantic, exciting and thrilling ! I'll definately read it again! You better get this book, A Walk To Remember!!
B000003T9B|5.0|This album does not have a polished quality sound like the many others to follow this but man, it's one bad mother. I would love to see this band re-record this album with todays technology. Not remaster.. RE-RECORD. Not saying that it really needs it.. I'm just curious to hear what it would sound like.
B0000039LE|5.0|If you have yet to see this you must!I first saw this in 1978 and have been hooked ever sense.This is the father of slasher flims and John Carpenter at his best!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Just hearing a movie is three hours inspires gasps in most of world.  How can anyone stay in a seat for three hours?  Well, just try.  Magnolia is such a detailed and fragile tale that seems like it will explode at any moment.  Each character is so delicate that you feel like they might get cruched under their own emotions.  Then, when the emotions are highest, that happens.  It's so random and frightening it just works.  Jon Brion's haunting score just adds to the atmosphere.
B000002HPT|5.0|This is THE most underrated metal band bar none. When I bought this album, I kept an open mind since DT doesnt make the same album twice. \\"Millenium\\" just kicks from beginning to end and the sound was kinna stripped down a notch still had the aura that I expect from this band. If they stop by for a show be sure to see them..
B00003CXXS|3.0|The dinosairs looked more real this time.  The story was a little thinner this time.  It seems natural to capitalize on what the audience wants, big thrills.  If thrills are what you're looking for, you'll find one or two here.  For the most part, it provided what a summer movie should, high action, minimal story, but Tea Leoni was so annoying I hoped a dinosaur would just bite her freaking head off.
0064407667|2.0|Well, here's another installment from the \\"doesn't matter what's in it, as long as it gets kids to read!\\" club.  The abuse in the book and suggestive nature of Count Olaf's plan for Violet are very disturbing.  And it's another \\"adults are either nasty or bumbling and confused, while kids are sharp as tacks\\" theme, which is getting so common in kids' books and television (especially Disney).  Sigh.
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  It just seems so honest and well great.  So many complex relationships that all tie together in that they all end up unraveling.  I think I'm just rambling now. It's great, beautifully (done).

The chainsaw film is epic even though some people can't hack it! The final seen in the mansion is one of the best seens ever...Meet my little friend....what a classic..if you don't own this buy it...and it is a high quality DVD don't listen to some person who says it isn't.

B00005U122|5.0|I Had seen roger in Denver in 1987,during his RADIO K.A.O.S. Tour<BR>at that time i was not sure who he was. then a friend told me before the show who roger was. boy, was i taken back for not knowing who he was.I had seen the other band,(so called\\"pink floyd\\") in 1988&1994.very good show.But,i went and seen ROGER <BR>again in 2000.MOST EXCELLENT SHOW.I bought the dvd \\"IN THE FLESH\\"<BR>i can honestly say he(roger) IS\\"pink floyd\\". NO MORE TO BE SAID.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I had not rented this DVD because I am not a fan of prison movies, but decided to rent it.<BR>I now own the DVD, I now own the CD soundtrack, I now own the DVD that was made celebrating the music of this movie, &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot; and the CD &quot;Down from the Mountain.&quot;<br />It is a great movie.  Lots of fun and outstanding music.  Very wholesome movie and fun to view all the events and situations that Po' ol' George Clooney gets himself into at every turn.
B00005KFUM|5.0|This is the best album I've heard all year. Elements of Radiohead, pre-KID A. I'd have to say every song on &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; blows me away. Hyper Music, New Born, Space Dementia, faves. I can't believe I had the opportunity to see Muse live while in the UK last summer but declined as I hadn't heard of them yet at that point and didn't feel up to slending money on a ticket to see a band I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy or not. I should have taken the chance!! Muse rock. Buy this record. 'Nuff said.
B00005V0X5|5.0|KILLING IS MY BUSINESS now that it has been remastered is a truly great album. I bought the tape and couldnt really get into it so i just forgot about the album. When I found out it was being rereleased and remastered I decided to give it another try and I am glad I did. The piano intro to LAST RITES/LOVED TO DETH is great and the song is just plain awesome. THE SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN, RATTLEHEAD, MECHANIX are just plain ...awesome songs that any metal fan will truly get into. MEGADETH was one of the big four of speed metal along with METALLICA, SLAYER and ANTHRAX, and these bands still make music that will blow away anything today. Song for song, this is a great album and any fan of metal will love this and I highly recommend it for all
B00003CXXJ|5.0|There are sooo many parodies in this film, and the humor is cleverly written for both young and old viewers. You AND your kids will love this one!
0800141601|1.0|.....I can not believe what I just saw.  I think the research for this movie came from Disney.  The lack of understanding for the legends of Arthur could not be greater.  The costumes? (Must agree with the reviewer who compared them to Star Trek uniforms for the medieval guy.)  Oh, and then there's the music.  The \\"composer\\" blatantly lifted from Wagner and Orff.  (Or maybe he thought he could rewrite the 'Excalibur' soundtrack and didn't realize that it came from Wagner and Orff.)   <br />.....So what was this movie trying to accomplish?  Strip away all the myth and legend and give the characters human characteristics?  Somehow they all came off as one-dimensional saplings in plotless environs.  If you are looking for a perspective on the Arthur legends, without the sorcery, there's an interesting trilogy by 'Bernard Cornwell', called \\"The Warlord Chronicles\\".  <BR>.....In defence of this disaster, just one thing: I know people were upset about about Gere's accent, but keep in mind that Arthur would have spoken Latin, Breton and probably an ealry form of Welsh.  English (which came from the invading Angles) wasn't spoken by the local tribes, so Sean Connery was equally out of place.
9626340037|4.0|I bought this recording so that I could introduce my seniors to the Romantics and I really am pleased.  The actors who portray the main characters all do an excellent job bringing to life a book that could very well be hampered by the limitations of audio.<br />Also, it was nice to show my students that their concept of Frankenstein is decidedly not the real story.  The recording does a wonderful job of reflecting the major philosophical statements that Mary Shelley wanted to express to the reader.<br />If you are going to share this with a class, it would be a good idea to connect the ideas of education, as well as the Promethian connection.  Not only does the story make a connection between Frankenstein and the daemon's education, it provides a connection between Shelley's education and that of the daemon's.  I feel that one of the strong points of the book is the feminine interpretation of education (not necessarily a feminist viewpoint of education). It is important to expose high school students to women writers who express strong ideas and transcend diaries and letters to their daughters.<br />That said, I have two minor complaints:<br />1:  The audio level is not evenly balanced.  I found myself turning up the volume to allow my students to hear the important dialogue and turning it down because the voices were instantly too loud.  Alone this would not be a problem, but in groups it certainly was.<br />2.  While the music fit the mood of the story, there wasn't enough of it for my taste.  I would have liked a bit more to punctuate some important moments.<br />If you want to listen to this alone, while sitting quietly, this is a wonderful experience.  However, if you want to have a group to listen, be prepared for volume problems.  Essentially this is a really good abridgment and reading, but the sound is a bit troublesome.
0671024256|5.0|His approach to writing fiction is unusual and unique, as is his way of explaining it.  As uncomfortable as he claimed to be about writing this non-fiction book, it is a enjoyable.  For would-be authors of fiction, it turns out as inspirational as it is informative.  I also highly recommend it to Stephen King fans.
B00005O3VC|1.0|Well, I've just spent the better part of two hours reading up on this disc from many different sources.<br />BELIEVE what you have heard.  This disc is DEFECTIVE.  Subtitles do appear on the screen, even when they are turned off.<br />My copy is going back.<br />The company has yet to recall the defective discs.  So the only logical thing to do is not purchase the movie.<br />A wonderful film, but this edition is UNACCEPTABLE!
B000000OF6|5.0|Even though this CD is good, that's not what I'm writing about. I'm writing about the best song ever, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.<br />This song is a masterpiece. I mean think about it...I'm an average teenage kid who likes to listen to metal and punk than anything from the 70's. So that's why I was so shocked when I heard this for the first time.<br />It's got everything. It starts as a (better than average) regular rock song. Then, all of a sudden, it goes opera on you! Which then transforms into a hard rock song. Then it turns into a ballad.<br />So what genre is this song? There is no genre for this song.<br />Go download the song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Even better, download the video, it's even better.
B000001ELF|4.0|Ace languished in the shadows for far too long, until this album that is.  Ace shocked fans, critics and his bandmates by becoming the top selling member on their solo album projects.  He also had the only hit in the great &quot;New York Groove&quot;.  While Peter put out an average R&amp;B album, Paul released a mediocre KISS album, and Gene released a strange &quot;All Star&quot; album, Ace released a hard rock album that showed that while he didn't have the voice of Gene or Paul, he had the songwriting talent.  Anybody reading Gene's biography should give this disc and Ace's true solo stuff a listen before deciding Ace was a guy that never reached his potential.  BTW, Ace's bass lines on this are stronger than a certain long tongued player.
B00005U8EM|1.0|The only reason I bought this is the DTS sound.  It says it in the back and its not.  I'm going to take it back to the store and get my money back.  Trying to trick the consumer to buy their products isn't going to work.
B000002UAR|5.0|I've heard that line about 2000 times, and I wish people would just stop saying it over, and over, and over, and over. It gets tiring after a while, and frankly, I disagree with that comment anyway. Look at pretty much any top albums list, VH1, Virgin, or just at any of the reviews on this product, and you'll see that this album gets more respect than any other album out there. But the thing that really bugs me, is people comparing the Beatles albums to one another, and some people actually seem to get emotional over it! The Beatles, in my opinion, are the greatest band in history, and that Beatles fans should stop squabbling over which is overrated and underrated, fine post your review and say that you love it, but quit saying that other Beatles albums, *cough*Sgt. Pepper*cough* are overrated. Are you a Beatles fan or not? Or are you just a Revolver, Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, etc. type fan? <br />I know I'll come back in a couple of weeks and see that 2 out of 60 people saw this review as being helpful, but oh well.<br />Now to the actual review of the album:<br />Revolver is definitely the biggest maturity in the Beatles career, even bigger than the jump to Pepper. Listening to Rubber Soul, and then to this, shows how much they matured over those 6 months. Mainly, in part, to drugs. Lennon had fimally hit the point in his career, where every song was psychadelic. I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, and Tomorrow Never Knows clearly forshadow I Am The Walrus, Lucy In The Sky..., Strawberry Fields, etc. And Your Bird... and Dr. Robert are two of the weaker ones, but still very enjoyable. George (bless his soul) finally showcases his best, with Taxman, and I Want To Tell You. Love You To is also great, I really enjoy his Indian songs. Paul always said that 1966, 1967 was when he was at his best, and he's right! Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Yellow Submarine, Good Day Sunshine, and Got To Get You..., are some of his best. Overall, a shining moment in the Beatles catalouge, IMO, it's not quite as good as White Album, Pepper, or Abbey Road, but all the Beatles albums are great, and this is no exception. Long live the Beatles!
0440224764|1.0|I can't believe that any self-respecting publisher would allow this to be printed.  It's obviously meant to be turned into a movie.  The writing is insipid - Grishom has a habit of not using full sentences and writing like he talks, which is bad writing technique.  The characters are flat, and all the loose ends are too conveniently taken care of.  I can't believe I wasted a few precious hours on this, and I am warning others who read this review not to make the same mistake.

George (bless his soul) finally showcases his best, with Taxman, and I Want To Tell You. Love You To is also great, I really enjoy his Indian songs. Paul always said that 1966, 1967 was when he was at his best, and he's right! Eleanor Rigby, For No One, Yellow Submarine, Good Day Sunshine, and Got To Get You..., are some of his best. Overall, a shining moment in the Beatles catalouge, IMO, it's not quite as good as White Album, Pepper, or Abbey Road, but all the Beatles albums are great, and this is no exception. Long live the Beatles!
0553260111|5.0|Arguably one of Ludlum's 3 best.  I'm looking forward to the movie, though I wonder. . .with Illyich Ramirez Sanchez a.k.a. Carlos The Jackal rotting in a French prison, how will they modify the story to fit the current era, that is supposing of course that the story will be told in the present.

0385474547|5.0|Achebes novel of life in an Igbo village is very enjoyable and interesting as it depicts characters with human qualites and flaws that are very recognizable. Especially memorable are scenes of a witch(who lives outside the tribe but is seen to be an integral part of it), the yam festival, and the way the tribe deals with imbalance within. The organic structure of the tribe is especially appealing and apparent as its self-regulating laws and beliefs are a built-in way of maintaining continuity with the past and maintaining a balanced way of life .  What the tribe cannot portend is the arrival of the colonist.<br />Achebe said he wrote this, his first, book because he did not recognize his country in the way that white authors like Conrad and Joyce Cary depicted it. In fact in addition to being a novelist Achebe has achieved much notoriety as an essayist and spokesman for postcolonial peoples. One particular essay is often cited as a seminal text in the field,&quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness&quot;.<br />Also by Achebe: Man of the People, Arrow of God(these two, both written in the sixties, complete the trilogy begun with Things Fall Apart,1958). And the excellent, Anthills of the Savannah(1988)about a modern African leader who slowly becomes a despot and his group of friends which include a reporter.

0345451325|5.0|This book is the best book I've every read!! it is 340pages and I finished it in 2 days. You have to play the game to know the ending of this story, but I don't care this is a really good book. I hope Eric Nylund writes a second book.<BR>I can't wait! <br />BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!
6305878323|5.0|I have loved this movie for as long as I remember. My mom had bought it for me when I was really young, and I  loved it ever since. If you love magic, fantasy, a great laugh and old movies this is the movie for you. I definetly think that this is a movie worth keeping in your collection. Little kids will love it, but so does adults. The cast is great, the songs are great, you'll be hooked on!!! Also great to get is the Sound of Music.
0771021771|3.0|While Cohen has never been a very abstract poet, Death Of A Lady's Man (a sly re-titling of his album of the previous year) was perhaps his first foray into more unique poetics. The vast majority of the book, indeed, is not poetry at all (really), but a sort of very loose type of prose. Rather than being the straight up poetry that his earlier volumes mostly were, this is a collection of rants and raves, almost all of them followed by a commentary on the poem, or a type of analyzation. Highly sarcastic. Cohen seems to be analyzing the deconstruction of his former persona (the \\"Lady's Man\\") through a failed relationship with his \\"wife.\\" Pretty heavy stuff. It can be difficult to penetrate at times; and, indeed, you will probably be asking yourself at times if there is any meaning to it at all. Overall, I'd have to say it's not Cohen's best book of poetry (try The Energy of Slaves for that), it is an interesting one. If you're not a fan of him already, this book certainly won't convince you. However, a fan will want it.
0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden does a tremendous job bringing the the delta force and army rangers to life. He makes you feel for the solidiers under fire. He explains in great detail the events that occurred. You feel as though you actually are a member of the army ranger fighting the Somalians. This is the best nonfiction book I've ever read. A must have in your book collection.
B00005QDW1|3.0|No Doubt has always been a good band for me. Listenable pop with  brains. Talented songwriter and vocalist Gwen Stefani is the main highlight. After bitching her way to platinum statuhhsss<BR>on Tragic Kingdom, No SDoubt used the ''If It's Not Broke,Don't Fix it'' approach on therir next album Return of Saturn, a vwowonderful album with the best lyrics Gwen came up with but the album was a downer for teens and was a failure so now we're back with rock steady. A highly listenable disc with the occasional overproduced song in between(Start The Fire, Hey Baby) No Doubt has started anew. Lyrically, it's their sloppiest record. Only tracks like ''Runingf'' and ''underneath it all'' have glimmers that show Gwen still is a good songwriter. No Doubt realizedv realized tehy needed to become poppy again and they did with damn good results. It has rich beats and sweet rythyms all bouncing off Gwen's toungue. The real gem is ''Waiting Rioom''; a beautiful song where the guys of no doubt have absolutely nothing to do. On that note, Adrian Young I do feel for you. yOUR DRUM PLAYING WAS JUST NOT NEEDED ON THIS RECORD.. Oh well, what remains is that No Doubt can do anything good. And they came up with damn good pop.
0451167716|5.0|The book that spun off the classic movies of our generation. This is the greatest book I've ever read, I couldn't put it down. All I can say about it is that it's a must have in your book collections. Anyone who hasn't read it is truly missing a classic of our generation.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I still think that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, and it's even greater on DVD! The picture and sound quality are superb. All the extras are great, too! Now we can talk about the film:<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give wonderful performances, and boy can they sing! Everyone else in the cast is perfect, too. The writing and direction are great, also. This has to be the best musical ever made. The visuals are wonderful, and they highten the viewing experience. Everything about this film is PERFECT. <br />Nicole Kidman plays Satine, a performer at the Moulin Rouge in France, and Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a travellor who goes to France to be a part of the Bohemian Revolution, and to write about the four things that he belives in the most - truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Each of these things tie into the movie at one point or another. Ewan visits the Moulin Rouge and eventually falls in love with Satine, who suffers from a fatal illness. They have to fight off the Duke, who is financing a play at the Moulin Rouge, and who is also madly in love with Satine. It's just a wonderful story about holding on to the one you love, no matter what the costs. IT BETTER WIN SOME OSCARS THIS YEAR! <br />All in all, if you have not seen this movie, do so immediatly, and if you have seen it and you do not own it, BUY IT TODAY! Don't deprive yourself of this wonderful movie!<br />*You will not be able to get the songs out of your head, either! They are all great!
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is a great album with an almost unbelievably acheived combination of reggae, rock, pop and new wave, those of which have been anything but delicately intermingled. Thrown at you with a take-it-or-leave-it defiant attitude (reflective of lead singer Gwen Stefani's stage presence when performing live), this album is a very brave regressive progression on their part: what i mean is, No Doubt has redeemed themselves, in my eyes, by going back to their roots and coming up with something new and refreshing. They've never stop reinventing themselves and renewing their sound; but this is by far their best work yet. If you want to hear something alive and different, daring and eccentric, BUY THIS ALBUM. I garauntee after at least the second listen, you'll drop your jaded visage and really hear and feel this album for what it is, and how *good* it is.
079073639X|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch late at night. It is freaky and suspensful, and filled with good performances from the entire cast.<br />It's about this group of people who go to investigate what seems to be an abandoned spacecraft, which is under the sea. They find this spherical alien object in the spacecraft, and they are all curious as to what it is. They sure do find that out during the course of the film, as strange things start to happen aboard the craft. It all leads up to psychological terror, and paranoia between everyone in the crew. <br />This is a great movie (the book was good too) and if you are looking for an underwater adventure, or something that will keep you on the edge of your seat, than this film is the ticket!<br />Watch and enjoy!

I just love them and this album so much! The lyrics are deep, the music is wonderful and gwen's voice is simply great! For me, all the songs here get 5 stars all the way!!! So, if I liked it you'll like it. Come on, millions of fans can't be wrong! Buy this special treat for yourself!

0345413377|4.0|This is the third and the final installment of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy.  First of all, I have to warn you that this is no ordinary children's book.  If your idea of children's fantasy is Harry Potter (no offence), this book sits at far end of your bookshelf.  This is immensely complex, imaginative and most of all DARK story.<br />Many worlds and stories collide and interweave toward unforgettable ending.  I will not spoil the would-be readers with anymore.  <br />Number of readers rated this book very negatively.  I believe that is partly because of somewhat mature content (violence, emotion, complexity, etc.), but most of all, due to the story's anti-church authority, if not anti-Christ underlying theme.  I was not least bothered by it.  In fact I think the trilogy will live to stand with classics such as Narnia and Rings.  They why didn't I give 5 stars?  Well, it is because of the leading character, Lyla   .  For the same reasons what makes this book unusual, she is a character you love to hate.<br />By the way, can someone do something about the paperback covers?  They are degrading for the book of this class.
020161622X|4.0|I have gifted this book to two aspirant programmers. One inhaled the contents and found several nuggets of truth that were worth the reading. It's written in short blocks of text for the commuting reader, and the flow is up to the reader. Find what interests you and dig in. There is one obvious plug for Ruby--and the definitive work when this book was published was written by the authors.
B00005RY7X|3.0|My first reaction was this guy likes to party.<br />My second reaction was this guy loves gang vocals.  He must have a good collection of Def Lepard and Y & T albums.<br />I'm tempted to say that the songs sound one-dimensional; the many songs with screaming,layered vocals, the 2:2 drum beats, and the blaring riffs all run together.  But as I listen to more songs, I realize this guy is a serious student of the metal genre, mixing the styles of pop-metal (Bon Jovi, Europe, etc). with some of the harder bands like Judas Priest and Motley Crue.<br />The senseless lyrics, the catchy melodies, and the passing reference to death accompanied by a minor chord are on par with most bands in the 80's. However this guy sounds pretty tongue and cheek, which is more than most metal acts could claim.  Is this guy is serious, he must be from Germany or at least a Scorpions fan.<br />Listening to this album makes me want to down a twelve-pack of light beer and watch porno movies.<br />I like it.
6302814359|1.0|This movie is supposed to be a sequel to Return of the Living Dead (one of the best zombie movies ever made, IMHO), yet it bears no real relation other than some poorly executed rip-offs from it.<br />This review contains some spoilers, but trust me-- you'll be doing yourself a favor if you read this instead and skip the movie. .<br />I might have been able to tolerate ROTLD 2 if they hadn't blown it and made their biggest mistake by having James Karen and Thom Mathews return for this movie. In the first one, they played co-workers who started the whole chain of events. As you will recall, neither survived the movie, either dead or undead. In this one, they play co-workers who are grave robbers, though they did such a bad job establishing what the hell they were doing in a mortuary and why that I didn't figure it out till one of them stole a diamond ring from a corpse. If this is supposed to be the same fictional world as the first one, that breaks all believability immediately. At the very least, they could have stuck in some line about their twin brothers disappearing 3 years ago. But no. It goes from confusing to insulting (do they think the people who saw the first movie aren't going to remember?) to embarrassing, to...to...arrrgh! I can't find the words (printable ones, anyway).<br /><br />This movie lost me about 75% when they repeated their exchange from the first movie: \\"Do you like this job?\\" \\"Like this JOB???\\" never mind that it was said completely out of context for the scene. From there, it had lost me 98 percent, but then when I was horrified to hear the younger one say (after, of course, they turned out to have died like in the first one) \\"I don't know, I get this feeling like this has... somehow happened before... deja vu...\\" That did it. I watched the remainder of the movie for the sole purpose of writing a review later in which I could rip it to shreds.<br />First, the positive points of the movie:<br />1.. Uhhh....I'm thinking....<br />2. Some lead characters I was rooting for them to die, did die.<br />3. The movie is only 89 minutes long.<br />Here's some questions- -and these are just the ones that immediately came to mind while watching-- a short list compared to what I could write:<br />Why did the two actors from the first movie appear as other characters in the sequel (looking identical to how they looked in first one with no explanation as to why they are dead ringers for the co-workers in the original? Why do the Zombies lurch slowly and stupidly along, when in the first movie, they got around fine, even if they were missing key body parts? Why does it take two characters at least 15 seconds to decide to run when a rotten corpse comes back to life and only looks irritated when they bury a weapon in it's head? When a house full of about 25 of zombies attacking, when the TV is accidental turned on, why do they (the zombies) instantly freeze and become fascinated by an aerobics show? (please God, I prayed, don't let them start doing the aerobics along with the instructor).<br />And here's just the tip of the iceberg on continuity errors: One attacking zombie is wearing a suit that looks so clean and neat it may as well be right off the rack (after he clawed his way out of his grave) which is bad enough, but in later shots there's graveyard mud on one of his lapels. A rotted severed head, with no lips I might add, yells--enunciating clearly- 'get that damn screwdriver out mah head!\\" with its mouth barely moving. I thought the dubbed voice was supposed to be coming from one of the characters at first.<br />The acting and screenplay is not just inconsistent and sloppy, it's so horrendous that you can't even get a laugh out of it being unintentionally amusing. It's hard to tell if certain atrocious scenes are that way because of the bad scripting, bad editing, or bad acting-- probably a mix of all three. Poor James Karen, he tries his best, but it's a lost cause. Remember the first movie, where the zombieswere consistent (and original)? Here some lumber slowly, some run, some managed to hot-wire a jeep and drive it around. In one scene, a zombie walks in and out of frame so casually that I'm convinced it was an extra who didn't think they were shooting, looking for craft services, maybe. Also, this thing is guilty of many counts of characters who act amazingly stupid, even for a horror movie<br />.<br />But wait! There's more (I told you I was going to rip this to shreds) ROTLD2 contains stupendously, embarrassingly bad dialogue. The guy that turns out to be the hero actually says the following seriously: \\"Ya did good, kid.\\" and \\"That's one for the GOOD GUYS!!\\"<br />Also, they break one of the major rules for any self-respecting zombie movie: main characters turned into zombies never show up again. I could break down examples of where they tried to imitate the first movie, but failed wretchedly, contrasting them, but this already long review would turn into a book-length essay.<br />Just pretend this movie was never made, OK? Thank you.were consistent (and original)? Here some lumber slowly, some run, some managed to hot-wire a jeep and drive it around.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I saw this movie the second day it came out. I had read the books (like almost everyone else in the world). *Haha* I knew it was going to be a hit as soon as I sat down in the theatre. It was captivating. <BR> (I mean there (or course) were kids all over the place. They were regular kids, noisey, loud, full of energy but, as soon as the movie started it went dead silence. I've never seen a theatre go so quiet so soon. There was one little 6 year old boy that was sitting in front of me. He was really wild. But, I noticed that when the movie started he stopped almost imediatly. I glanced at him a couple times through the movie...he never moved. I'd never seen a 6 year old sit still so long.)<BR> The special effect in this movie were great. Chris Columbus did an awesome job. <BR> (Thank you, J.K. Rowlings for finally agreeing to make \\"Harry Potter\\" into a movie.)

B00004Z459|5.0|A great friend of mine (my now ex) was constantly raving about how great LP was, this type of music wasn't really my cup of tea at all.  I stayed away from all music like this, ex. Limp Bizkit &amp; KoRn . . .so I of course wouldn't listen to the CD.  Well one day I was looking for something new to listen too and I ran across the LP CD Hybrid Theory that he had left at my house.  I popped it into my DVD Player and instantly fell in love with it.  LP was so much better than KoRn and Limp Bizkit put together.  I played it everyday until he realized he left it at my house.  I fell in love with the lead singer's voice and the rapper's voice . . . and then I saw a music video for &quot;Crawling&quot; and fell even more in love with the group LP.<br />I even incorporated the song &quot;With You&quot; into my morning mix . . . I love LP.  :)
B000000W6X|4.0|This is a really cool cd.  Very mellowed-out, seductive, chilled-out, whatever you want to call the style.  A great example of trip-hop/downtempo tunes, especially the title track and &quot;Heat Miser&quot; which are my favorites.  Recommended.

B000001DTM|5.0|U2's best work, an amazing tapestry of sounds, textures, moods, and emotions. Essential to every record collection.  This expanse of ground covered by this album is almost unchartable.  While there were plenty of big hits, it's the lesser-known songs that make this album for me.  \\"Until The End of the World\\", \\"Ultraviolet\\", and \\"Acrobat\\" are three of the most amazing songs I have ever heard, and they make this disc a classic.  \\"Zoo Station\\" is also a great song, and what a shock to hear it after four years of THE JOSHUA TREE.  This band underwent what was nothing less than a revolution.  I'm just glad they brought us along for the ride.<br />Essential.

B000000WHX|4.0|This cd revolutionized the sound that would eventually come to be known as 'trip-hop' or 'downtempo'.  A wonderful mix of styles and influences.  &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; is the immediate favorite, but many others grow on you and soon you are playing the disc non-stop.  Recommended
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album is awful. I could play better guitar riffs than borland. Fred Durst should be in a sitcom. The old dude on the decks needs to realise that the eighties were a while ago. Limp BIzkit is POP music.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Every song here is good! I'm not sure why more people didn't embrace this album. All the talk of U2 doing a 'dance' album was ridiculous. You'd think this was the Bee Gees or Roni Size after the nutty press it got. Anyway, it's REALLY solid-a few tracks wear thin after a while but it's mostly compelling stuff.  Dance music or not, I find the mood of this album to be rather dark, and I like that.  Recommended.
B000002UAF|2.0|I just can't imagine why the company released this in HIFI Monophonic???? The first early Beatle CD's are all in that format. What a waste. At least they could have released the CD in real monophonic (mono). Songs like \\"And I love Her\\" without the overdub would sound much better in the original mono like the United Artist version of this album. Also \\"If I fell\\" without Paul's voice break in the last verse would sound much better. All in all a stereo version of this cd would be satisfying, not this junk.
B000005DQR|5.0|I usually don't agree with much that Rolling Stone has to say, but they did include this in their &quot;100 best albums of the 90's&quot; issue.  So I took a chance and bought it.  I was not disappointed.  This is awesome late night, sample-heavy, bass-prominent music.  It's a great 'chill-out' album.  Half the fun is figuring out where all the samples come from!  Essential.

B000002C1V|5.0|The last installment in the \\"true\\" Floyd catalogue, The Final Cut works both as a grand finale of Pink Floyd's golden era, as well as a stepping stone for Roger Waters' solo career.  Just like The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking, The Final Cut elaborates on some of the themes first presented in The Wall, in this case the death of Waters' father and its subsequent effect on his view of the world and his marraige.  The lyrics are extremely personal and often bitter, while the music, as usual, sets the perfect backdrop for the storyline.  In fact, David Gilmour's guitar work is so good, it tells just as much of the story as the lyrics do.  Like just about every Floyd album, The Final Cut has it maximum effect when heard start to finish, as each song is an important part of the overall theme.  If you enjoyed The Wall as a whole (as opposed to just liking some of the songs on it), The Final Cut will not dissapoint.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I loved this film. I am a film maker myself and for the entire time Mullholand drive flashed before me I did not think of the processes of film making, I was utterly enthralled by what was going on, and the world that was created. There is nothing I can say here that someone has not already said, but I do have just one problem with this film.  Indeed it's not the film itself, it's some of the people who have gone to see it, or reviewed it. So many reviews here on Amazon or in Magazines, newpapers etc use big words, or incredibly long sentences that effectively mean nothing.  Is this to make you seem as compelling, complex and enthralling as the film? Look closely, you'll notice lynch tells his story without all this drivel, so just get to the damn point!  Lynch just does it his way and this is why he's so brilliant. Love or hate this film just watch it, discuss it, but don't try to emulate it's complexities by being so mysterious and pseudo intellectual. It's a movie, watch it and keep your muddled thesis to yourself.  Big sentences rarely solve a mystery or make you more mysterious. LOL
B00005Q66T|5.0|Reading through these reviews, I've come across some misguided gripes about Madge's most recent compilation.  In my honest opinion, it is a pretty strong release.  <br />In compiling this set, Madonna herself said that her intention was not to stuff together every single she put out between 92-00, but to choose songs that a)were representative of her &quot;journey&quot;, b)whose songwriting was strong lyrically, musically, and from a production stand-point, and c)songs that she could listen to five times in a row without cringing.  The songs she chose, I think give the casual as well as dedicated audience a pretty through snapshot of the last 10 years.  Also, for those more acquainted with the background of the albums, etc., you'll notice that each of these tracks were making a statement in their own right.<br />Some people have griped about choices such as &quot;Drowned World/Substitute...&quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; making it onto this CD without being &quot;hits.&quot;  In actuality, while not charting well in the US, all three of these songs were pretty big  in Europe, Japan, and Australia...not to mention HUGE club hits in the case of the later two.  Keep in mind that this is a world-wide release.  <br />Some songs never made it on to this because they already appeared on &quot;Something to Remember&quot; in 1995...and there was no point in being redundant.  While the running order of the tracks on GHV2 is a bit awkward at times, I think the CD as a whole gives a solid representation of this phase of Madonna's career.  It's a way to not only tie up the &quot;90's&quot; phase of her career, but also to prepare us for the next stage.  She's ready to move on.  I eagerly await what she has in store in the coming years.<br />And as an added note...(again to misguided people)...the liner notes to the CD are not meant to be taken seriously or literally by any stretch.  It is very tongue-in-cheek and is meant to reflect how easily the public has misinterpreted or misunderstood so much of what Madonna has done.  It's meant to poke fun.
B00005214X|4.0|It's too bad George Harrison let Phil Spector bury this album's incredible selection of songs under such suffocating production. What might work for lightweight stuff like \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\" (or whatever it's called), does not work for serious, introspective music like this. Too often, the sound makes me look for a button to push, thinking I'm in an elevator. You have to wonder what-if he had produced the album himself, and made it sound nice and clean like the work he did with Badfinger. Didn't George learn anything from Spector's rape of Let It Be?
B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day was my favorite movie of last year. It won't get the respect it should when the oscars come around but it still stand's out to me. All of the performances are top notch even the breif one's from Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. When walking out of the theater I was scared from Denzels acting job. The movie was that convincing to me. For a breif summary of the story,Hawke is a rookie cop trying to make detective when first having to be on the narcotics team, he meats up with denzel and soon relizes that the man is twisted on power and the corruption builds. Not only was the performance of Denzels the best of his career but Ethan Hawke shows that he should get an oscar for the great performance of the scared rookie cop. <BR>     This movie proves that even if special effects are cool that the acting is the soul of the movie. My personal awards thoughts should be nominated for best picture,best actor(Denzel), and best supporting actor (Hawke). The Best of 2001
B00005ARDC|4.0|Okay, so the songs are quite as good as you'll find on the first albums by either The Jesus and Mary Chain or The Velvet Underground. That doesn't matter. The BRMC has its heart in the right place and they've got the sound down pat. The best songs don't quite acheive greatness, but they are quite good. The next album will tell us if they're a keeper or a flash in the pan. In the meantime, these guys rock!
B000001IPL|5.0|Back in 1994 when Smash came out, I heard the first songs from the album like keep em separated. It was really the first time that I had listened to punk rock. Soon Smash became my first punk. The album really helped me to introduce me to the genre of punk rock. Each song is great. The Offspring put a really great effort into writing smash. It made everyone stand up and take a look at the Offsping for a good reason.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona'a music changed my life. If you want to know what good music is buy this album and her first one &quot;Tidal&quot;. After listening to her music I couldn't listen to the music I liked before anymore because it couldn't reach the quality of her lyrics and melodies.<BR>I can't wait for a new album!
B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan's career is long so it's obviously hard to try to make a greatest hits collection out of his career. The Essential Bob Dylan attempts to do this task and does a pretty good job. It contains a lot of his most famous songs from the 1960s and 1970s like hurrican, tangled up in blue and along the watchtower. It contains somer newer material like things have changed of the wonder boys soundtrack. Considering the length of his career, this is probably the best collection one can find.
B000002OMN|5.0|I think Meat Lofe has a fantastic voice if not the best.I love the way he can just change it, the way it gose deep then nice and low and I think it is fab. I think the words in bat out of hell are fab, in facked I am listening to it at the moment. I like it a lot.
B000001F5F|5.0|I have never seen U2 perform live before but Under a Blood Red Sky gives a good feal of what it must be like to see the band play toghether. The album is filled with energy. It really makes me wish I had the oppurtunity to see U2 perform live.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore is one of the best writers working in comics today (to me, he's right up there with Neil Gaiman and J. Michael Straczynski), and Watchmen is some of his best work. It's a fascinating exploration of the nature of superheroes, their weaknesses and human foibles -- told in an epic story that should hook even those (like me) who don't usually like superhero comics.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Hot Rocks really shows you what the Rolling Stones were like in their peak. It's amazing to see how well the band plays together on these songs which have become classics over time. In many aspects, they were ahead of their time and hot rocks shows why.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Despite a friend's hatred for the movie, I rented it.  I went into it thinking I was going to hate this movie and through the first 30 minutes I did.  After that, I was hooked.  This movie was just amazing and I couldn't help but watch it over and over again.  Ewan and Nicole were spectactular and the chemistry between the two is what did it for me.  For you hopeless romantic types, this is the movie for you.  This will definately be one of my all time favorites.
B000001F3C|5.0|War is one of U2's first albums and it really shows the band's potential. THe songs are all really well done like two hearts beat as one, refugee, and sunday bloody sunday. It really is a sign that the band will continue to be great for years to come.
B00005V9QJ|3.0|...it's nothing special. All the songs are good, of course, however there isn't anything special about them. Pretty much just a bunch of songs played live, by the numbers. This is odd because having seen Sade live a couple of times, neither she nor her band is like this. <br />I don't know if something was lost here because the songs come from a pair of shows rather than a complete show. Or maybe it's because this is really just half a concert....It just doesn't have the energy or the free-flowing performance I've seen live from Sade in the past.<br />Bottom line? If you like songs on live recordings to sound like the studio version of these songs, with just the slightest bit of alteration, you'll be very happy with this CD.<br />On the other hand, if you like live recordings to vary in tempo, instrumentation and even the delivery of the vocals, then this disc may disappoint you. A couple of songs do sound varied, such as Slave Song, Is it a Crime and By Your Side, but that's about it.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction definetely has stood the test of time. After all these years and changes in the musical scene, this album still stands out as a great hard rock album. No one really knew what to expect when Appetite came up, but over the years it has remained a popopular and important album. Hopefully Guns N Roses will get is act toghether and release another album. We've been waiting for a long time now.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham is to be congratulated. He has made a successful sortie into light sitire. What's even better, as his mind is so fertile and creative, I sense that he didn't spend years figuring out how to do so without risking his reputation. What a simple and interesting weave of a question (has Christmas become a pain?) that can run the entire spectrum of peoples' philosophies on character and life in America. Speaking of character and life in America, I (Norman Thomas Remick) am humbled to learn that many John Grisham readers have made a sortie into light philosophical nonfiction and have read my book, &quot;West Point&quot;, Norman Thomas Remick. As &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; should become a perennial best seller, &quot;West Point&quot; is becoming a standard for all those who care about character and life in America -- and perhaps philosophize about skipping Christmas.
B000001FRY|4.0|Boy is U2's debut. It may not be the band's best album but it still has great songs on it like I will follow and out of control. Boy really gives you an understanding of where U2 really began.
B00005RHGK|1.0|\\"dumb and dumber\\", \\"there's something about mary\\".... eat your hearts out!  \\"jeepers\\" has your number.  this is one of the funniest movies ever made, hands down.  this has \\"scary movie\\" part 3 written all over it.  the first thing that grabs you is the \\"B-movie\\" atmosphere which the director creates flawlessly which has you taking nothing seriously and expecting anything from a goofy one-liner with every conversation, to a poorly costumed monster-humanoid-thing to jump out of nowhere at every bush and at every silent pause.  all the typicals are evident and plain as day and are exploited and made fun of in the most comical of ways.  i swear, this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing with tears gushing from your eyes.  the part when the brother is sliding down.... wait... what?... what do you mean... NOT a comedy????.... you have to be kidding.... huh???.... A HORROR MOVIE????!!!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!  NOW THAT'S FUNNY!!!!!
B000001FTQ|5.0|Wide Awake in America stands out as because it contains live songs from Live Aid which helped to propel the band into stardom. The EP contains only four songs but stands as how powerful the band can be as a group
B000002JNN|3.0|The first 3 tracks on this album are sensational: THUNDERSTRUCK, FIRE YOUR GUNS & one of the greatest ever AC/DC songs MONEYTALKS.<BR>The rest of the album falls away somewhat, but ROCK YOUR HEART OUT is rather good.
B000008H1U|4.0|An excellent return to form for Ian and the boys here. Some consider this a comeback album of sorts, since Ian had battled throat problems, and the 3 year layoff between this and Under Wraps. Ians vocals on this one always remind me of Mark Knopfler on this release. There is a mix of new Tull sounds like &quot;Steel Monkey&quot; which is an upbeat heavy number and allows Martin Barre to rip it up on guitar. This recieved a fair amount of airplay in my area upon its release. The old Tull sound is present as well,  &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot; with its extended solos and atmospherics. This is one of Ians best songs of all time in my opinion. And the flute rears its ugly head, getting its most use of any 80s Tull release. Other songs of note are &quot;Budapest&quot; which clocks in at 10:00 +, it has a great instrumental break, acoustic guitar, along with flute and some violin as well. The CD has a great feel to it all the way through. These songs were meant to be together. It really works, and restored my faith in Tull after the experimentation of early 80s Tull. They also shocked alot of folks beating out Metallica for a Grammy in the Hard Rock category I believe. Rock On Tull!! This is the best 80s release for the band, and they may not have achieved this consistency since.
B000002JS0|5.0|There is not one bad song on HIGH VOLTAGE. It starts with IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP (IF YOU WANNA ROCK 'N' ROLL) - one of their best. Bon is great on this album and really lets rip on other songs such as LIVE WIRE &amp; T.N.T.. This album slows down on a few tracks like the THE JACK, SHE'S GOT BALLS &amp; the excellent LITTLE LOVER. A must have album.
B00000DFSK|5.0|About this time last year, I was not a really big U2 fan.  Cool music, but I can't say I was really passionate about it.  About a week ago, though, my mind was changed by their performance at halftime for the 2002 Super Bowl.  I got out this CD and listened to it again, especially the song \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\"  I revised my opinion of U2 because of that.  Now I think they are the coolest band ever!!!!!!!!!<br />This album is one of the greatest \\"Best of. . .\\" collections ever.  (And I am a big fan of \\"Best of. . . \\" collections!)  In my opinion, this album is seamless-all the songs fit together-if you pay careful attention to the lyrics.  Besides, I just LOVE the guitar riffs!
B000008COG|4.0|This is a really good AC/DC album with great tracks like HEATSEEKER, SOME SIN FOR NUTHIN', RUFF STUFF &amp; TWO'S UP. It also contains one of the worst AC/DC songs in GO ZONE. The rest is okay to good.
B00000DFSK|5.0|U2 was the second band of the `80's, after the Police exploded.  Oddly enough they both have similar roots in punk, but Sting has since abandoned his edgy rage, while U2 has managed to keep the energy going.<br />This CD is a long time in coming.  U2 is one of those bands that doesn't have the hits, but everyone follows and respects what they do.  And their causes are the icing on the cake.  This CD captures the essence of the band, from its early punk hits like \\"I Will Follow,\\" and \\"New Year's Day,\\" to the more reflective tracks from the Joshua Tree, \\"Where The Streets have NO Name,\\" and \\"With or Without You.\\"<br />Everything you would want in an overview is here, with tracks from every album.  SPOILER: \\"October\\" is a hidden track!  Sure, I would have like to have had more representation from \\"October,\\" and the live version of \\"Bad\\" is the perfect, definitive version, but for the long commute, or background music, this CD works!<br />It is the perfect survey of the band's early career, and it makes the logical break off point between Rattle and Hum and Actung, Baby!  The Joshua Tree Era was the culmination of an idea and the realization of what they had been doing musically.  It was a long road form Boy to Rattle and Hum, and I think the group had found its center buy the time the movie was made.  So this is not so much a survey of a band as the process of a musical idea.<br />The only question I have is, \\"When will `the Best of 1990-2000' come out?\\"  \\"Can't Leave Behind\\" is doing well, and I imagine there was a spike after the 2002 Superbowl, but I love these Best of CDs.  And make sure it has a B-side disc, too!
B000002JST|4.0|This is another top ac/dc album. It features 2 of AC/DC'S greatest songs in LET THERE BE ROCK - a bone crunching track with great guitar work from Angus. The other one is WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE. Another decent song is OVERDOSE which is very raw. The rest of the album is very good also.
B00003CXE7|1.0|It was way too long of a movie to have such a stupid ending. One minute, he was going to get his army, the next, he was fighting the emporer in hand to hand combat. I didn't get it. It was like they ran out of money and couldn't pay the army, so they had to slap together a quick ending. And Russell Crowe's acting? Please. He plays every single role the same: the self-proclaimed inner hero, but with a hard outer shell. So now all of a sudden he's this artist? I personally enjoyed the death scene: picking up his head, gasping, then falling down. My ten-year-old sister could do better then that.
0738203335|5.0|A detailed, accurate story of the open source revolution, the best of the bunch.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I bought this thinking it was going to be more of &quot;whenever,wherever&quot; and was VERY dissappointed. A total of maybe three good songs, but someone told her that an electric guitar was the way to go, bad mistake. It sounds like a bad eighties meets Miami street type of album, with only a couple of good fast songs. I'm already selling my copy after 3 days.If you like Gloria Estefan music, you might like this.
B000002J2F|4.0|In 1980 Genesis released DUKE.  It went to number 1 in the UK and had numerous hit singles.  I'd bet at this time many thought Genesis had took a turn for the worst, again...being that Peter and Steve had already left.  This is far from true though.  If anything DUKE is a classic album, showing what the 80s would end up like and did.  The 80s were the times to have fun again with music, and on DUKE Genesis did that.  &quot;Whatever happend to you it's too late to change now&quot; from  &quot;Behind the lines&quot; sums up the situation Gensis was in, there would be no turning back to the long and sometimes annoying arrangements of the Gabriel years, the music would now be straight foward and totally entertaining.  The album starts on a high note, &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; and slowly moves into &quot;Duchess&quot;, a song about &quot;when times were good&quot; and &quot;she never thought about the future&quot;.  Through both tracks the energy is flowing smoothly and finally comes to rest at &quot;Guide Vocal&quot;.  After this we are treated to one of the best album tracks, &quot;Man Of Our Times&quot;, a Mike Rutherford piece which again picks up the albums pace.  &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; follows, a classic, and then goes into &quot;HeatHaze&quot;.  After this we are on &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, another classic track from this album, DUKE.  &quot;Alone Tonight&quot; follows, a personal favorite featuring some nifty guitars at the chorus.  The end of the album, &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and  &quot;Duke's End&quot; close out the album on a high note again.  Loaded with standout tracks and classics, many memorable riffs and lyrics, DUKE is a cd worthy of looking into.
0805062971|5.0|&quot;All a gun does is focus the explosion in one direction.&quot; <br />How can a book be so crazy and yet be so right in so many places. Chris Palahniuk certainly hit a masterpiece with this one. THis is his treatise on how to live or waste one's life.

B00005R2M3|3.0|i am a HUGE fan of this woman.  I've been crazy about her since i listened to &quot;pies descalzos&quot; back in 95'.  Then &quot;donde estan los ladrones?&quot; came out, and it blew my mind away.  so i've been waiting like crazy these past few years so i could get shakira's follow-up to &quot;ladrones&quot;...conscious that it would be hard to surpass its excellence.<BR>and evidently it was......... WAY too hard...<br />maybe it's just me, but her voice just sounds so much richer and beautiful in spanish.  and having all these songs in english is kind of frustrating.  i personally don't mind crossovers at all, and kudos to her for getting all the recognition she has now. <BR>but compared to her previous albums, it just makes me wonder if she was more interested this time in making an acceptable record by American standards than writing those gorgeous songs she's known for by everyone outside the U.S.<br />in any case, you've got about half of the songs on the album being memorable. the rest just seem a bit forced.<br />the thing people should know is this: if you really like this album, go get &quot;donde estan los ladrones?&quot;.... you will love it.
B00005NWM3|1.0|horrid ...Creed imitators(who imitated Pearl Jam-who imitated bad classic rock) sung by a guy who looks a little too much like my sister's poodle.
B00001ZTFZ|1.0|I've been a Megadeth fan since I can remember, but this album was just not worth it. The band was playing good, but Dave Mustane just didn't seem to hear the music. I think it's gotto be the worst Megadeth album out there. Not worth the cd it's burned on.
B000000WA4|5.0|Make no mistake, Mr. Corgan was truly at his songwriting peak during the making of this album.  Over 60! songs were written and recorded...and only 28 made the final cut...so not only is there NO filler on this album, but even many of the other songs which were not included are incredible songs (they ended being released as The Aeroplane Flies High).  Don't be fooled by reviews using the adjectives pretentious or self-indulgent.  In this case it's just a lazy, truth-stretching way of saying that Billy was fearless in the face of an enromous undertaking, and introspective.  If you think those things are inherently bad, then don't buy the album...you don't deserve to hear it.  Be forwarned; this album will challenge you.  Easily accessible rock and pop like BulletWBW and 1979 are the exception rather than the rule.  Only a year or so down the road when you find that some of the wierder songs that you originally assumed to be filler are actually some of the album's best songs, will you appreciate the degree to which Mellon Collie has broadened your horizons (Cupid de Locke and XYU are good examples.  ...two completely opposite songs and two of the best songs on the album).  The album ranges from happy to sad, loud/angry to soft, serious/poetic to just plain fun and silly, etc.  Let me address Billy's vocals this way:  Billy is not Robert Plant (my all-time favorite rock singer).  His voice is VERY alternative (in the true sense of the word), and he cannot do what Robert Plant can do.  But neither can Plant do many of the things that Corgan does.  When your voice is as unique as Billy's, you have to be creative and make up a lot of the rules as you go.  Luckily, those are two of Billy's strong points...along with being able to use his voice to full effect in many different singng styles.  It shouldn't go unmentioned that this album also features a man often mentioned as one of the best drummers in rock, Jimmy Chaimberlin.  Anyway, I don't wanna ruin all the surprise foryou.  Go out and buy it!  Unless you're awarding brownie points for being first (in which case bands like the Beatles and Zeppelin would have strong arguements), then there may not be a double album in rock history better than Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
B00004Z459|5.0|I just wanted to say this is one of the best album ever released. I bought it in early 2001 because my friend said it was good. And boy is it good. Also i wanted to correct the guy that said Scott is their road bassist because a while ago Pheonix joined the group to be the full time bassist. And they are working on a remix album. It should be out in late March early April. Aaron Lewis, Jay Gordon, and many others are supposed to be on it. It's should be really good just like Hybrid Theory. Be sure to pick that up to.
B000002B35|4.0|Unfortunately, official recordings of Pink Floyd live performances are few. Live recordings of material from 'Dark Side Of The Moon', 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Animals' is practically unobtainable, and until recently the same went for 'The Wall' (until the release of 'Is There Anybody Out There' last year). Therefore, 'Pulse' is essential for Floyd fans, despite its several flaws. Personally, I have a big problem with Pink Floyd singing Roger Waters songs without Waters around. True, performance-wise he was never a major contributor, having been more of a creator; but it's a simple matter of principle. It feels wrong to me. Plus, the few songs which he sang on the original version sound problemetically different here. Mind that this recording still sounds much more powerful than Roger's own recent live show, 'In The Flesh', because of Gilmour's voice and the Floyds' undeniable instrumental prowess.<br />As for he material played, the choices are for the most part excellent. A good choice was made to play mostly songs on which Gilmour sang originally (although I'm a bit bothered by his voice here. He still sings them wonderfuly but they lack something of the soul of his original performances.) One song from Syd Barrett, the superb 'Astronomy Domine', which was also sang by David in live shows after Syd's departure, makes an excellent choice. Several choice picks from 'Wish You Were Here' and 'The Wall' - 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' (performed well, but Roger's vocals are terribly missing to me), 'Wish You Were Here' (Wonderful version, one of the highlights of the show), 'Comfortably Numb' (another problem, this song was written as a duet between Roger and David. David's part - 'Pink' - sounds great, Roger's - 'The Doctor' - weak), 'Hey You' (Also fantastic - David does a splendid job as Roger on the last verse). The best of the two Rogerless albums - 'Learning To Fly', 'Keep Talking', 'What Do You Want From Me', 'High Hopes', 'Sorrow', all excellent songs. Now, three major problems: 'Run Like Hell', 'Another Brick In The Wall (part 2)', 'One Of These Days'. 'Run Like Hell' - just sounds bad. 'Another Brick In The Wall' - That song is all Roger's. They had no right playing it. It sounds terrible without him, anyway. 'On Of These Days' - It apperead in the video, but it's missing here. Why is that?<br />Then there's the main attraction - Dark Side Of The Moon. Complete. Brilliant, wonderful. 'Time', 'Money', 'Breathe', all sound great. 'Brain Damage' and 'Great Gig In The Sky' are weaker. Overall, performed beautifuly. I'd like to point out that no song here is better than the original version, but as a live performance it's excellent, an essential in a complete Floyd collection. The sound quality is very good, the whole thing is much better than 'Delicate Sounds Of Thunder', their previous live release. Very good album.
B000002L75|5.0|This is one of my favorite DM albums.  The other reviewers cover it pretty well, but I have to put my 2¢ in about one thing.  &quot;If You Want&quot; is not a filler song.  In fact, it is my favorite off this album.  The vocals, the lyrics, the synth...it captured me from the first time i listened to it.  Granted that was 15 years ago, but I still love it.  The band remixed just about every other song they ever made, why they passed this one by is a mystery to me.  I'd be curious to see if other DM fans feel the same way.  I have all their albums and 99% of everything else, including their 3 boxed sets of singles so i think I know what I'm talking about.<br />If you are new to Depeche Mode, start of with the single collections or greatest hits CD.  If you are a fan and don't own this album, get it.  It is one of their best.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This album is one of the best put out by \\"Megadeth.\\" In 1983, it woke up the metal world with it's violent riffs and kick [butt] sound. Dave Mustaine after leaving \\"Metallica\\", proved that he could do it on his own. \\"Megadeth was formed to be the heaviest band in the world, at the time, they succeeded. Songs like \\"Mechanix\\" and \\"Rattlehead\\" proved that they weren't afraid of what people thought about them. And they were damn sure not afraid to say anything they freakin' wanted! So my advice to you metal fans out there is to buy this cd. You'll be glad you did! \\"Rattle your damn head!!<br />*Note* The band had to edit \\"These Boots.\\" They did a good job explaining why in the booklet. The bleeping just makes the song more violent.
B00001W9G0|4.0|First lets talk the movie.  Pauline Kael, when talking about Barbra Streisand, said something to the effect that, Streisand doesnt really employ an \\"actors\\" trade in her performance, she never really becomes a different character in the way Faye Dunaway BECOMES Joan Crawford for example.  But thats OK.  What makes Barbra so compelling as an actress is the way she throws herself with reckles abandon into the role.  Perhaps thats why her best movie roles are when she plays characters who's emotional world is larger than life.  Katie Morosky is exactly such a character.  Katies passion for blind social causes is touching in the same way that Fanny in Funny Girls faithfulness to Nick was touching.  Consequently, Katies profuse sexual passion for Redford thrills you the way hearing Barbra going full throttle into the climax of a song thrills you.<br />Unfortunately also like Funny Girl there is not much to like about this film outside of Barbra's performance.  Once Barbra and Hubbel get married the movie really well...lags.  Why do Hubbel and Katie even break up, who decided to have Redford cheat on Katie and why does he do it?  It is a bit baffling, but when you're being hypnotized by Barbras performance it is easy to overlook such things.  <br />NOW the DVD transfer: I hate to admit this, but unlike in othe rmovies, the widescreen version looks almost EXACTLY the same as the VHS transfer.  I guess when you do a movie that is mostly close ups you dont see very many new things once that movie is restored to widescreen. Nor is the picture quality any better than the video version, which was fine anyway.  The commentary by Sydney Pollock however is great, AND the documentary provides wonderful incites into some of the decisions(however questionable) about which scenes were cut, etc.  Also you get to SEE alot of the cut scenes, though it might be better to have those set aside in a seperate section.  All in all a triumph for barbra and her fans.
B00005OB0A|5.0|If you like fun pop dance music this is the cd for you. All 12 tracks are great! Buy this cd its lots of fun. It is probably her best one. Im glad to see Kylie finally has a USA record contract after 13 years.
B000002IHU|3.0|Believe it or not, there was a time when Ratt represented the cutting edge of music. Quite simply, nothing like this had ever been heard before - those biting chugging riffs, plodding bass and Beau Hill's production was the definition of 'Metal' at that time.<br />While the image owed a lot (everything) to the masters Van Halen, Ratt certainly managed to create a flavour all of their own and in stuff like 'You're in Love', 'Dangerous but Worth the Risk' and of course the brilliant 'Lay it Down' Ratt left their mark and enjoyed their brief spell at the top of the tree.<br />Of course it all went pear shaped after Invasion of Your Privacy and Ratt never managed to escape the box they had created for themselves, but if you wanna taste the cutting edge of music in 1985, this is where you gotta be.<br />No bonus tracks, but an awesome bird on the cover.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade has a LIVE compilation out that shows how her career has gone full circle.<br />This CD just wraps around your CD player like a candy wrapper around a Snickers bar.<br />The music is tight, well produced, no nonsense music that just plays for many years to come.<br />With all her hits &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, &quot;Cherish the Day&quot;, my fave &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Life&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot; and the list goes on.<br />Sade sounds just as good live as in a studio. This CD is definitely for the Sade enthusiast.<br />No more to say but just a sure delight that just shows that Sade is the queen of R&amp;B jazz.
B00000J7I3|3.0|If you're looking for polish, look away now. Too Fast for Love is one of the dodgiest recordings ever to make it into legend. It's got it all, bad production, grotesque reverb washing over everything and even out of tune guitars.<br />The good news? It's a legendary piece of work from the LA bad boys. Da Crue made a fine opening statement with Too Fast... and the overall feeling is one of discovery, like you've just stumbled across something ugly but which you still find strangely fascinating. Enjoy, but be aware of what you're getting.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha never remains content. Once \\"comfortable,\\" he remains open to dissatisfaction. He never allows the orthodoxy of his experience to cement. As dissatisfaction creeps in, he pays attention. New wine bursts his old wineskins and he repeatedly walks away from everything he has \\"achieved\\" into the void.<br />Siddhartha braves emptiness, daring asceticism, pleasure, nature; he wonders, he denies, he accepts. In the end ... well, if the secret could be distilled in 1000 words or less, Hesse wouldn't have needed 152 pages ... but in the end, Siddhartha has journeyed yet gone nowhere, he has abandoned everything and discovered the illusion that is the secret ... or has he?<br />This translation by Rosner flows smoothly enough that I didn't even stop to think that Hesse didn't write in English. Hesse's language is concise. This is a tight novel without a lot of scene description. Hesse wrote from the third person without stream-of-consciousness; even from this detached perspective, he draws us into Siddhartha's mind.<br />An excellent and classic work. If you already know just what spirituality is all about, if you have all the answers, then don't waste your time on this book. If you still have room for questions and growth, then I'll bet you'll revel in Siddhartha.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this book or review further, please click on the \\"about me\\" link above & drop me an email.

B000002AH7|5.0|This must be among the most unique recordings ever, and it transcends labels. Rodrigo's famous Spanish style guitar piece was relatively new in the late 50's. (If you don't have the standard orchestral version you're really missing something. BTW, Senor Rodrigo passed on a short time back at around age 98). A jazzified trumpet based version was a real experiment,confusing jazz and classical people, but Mr Davis and Co. showed their real genius here with this flamengo oriented piece, and a couple of other similar short pieces. As always, the music is bright and crisp, never missing a note or a beat. This is my personal Miles Davis favorite, and is the best non-classical version of the Rodrigo out there. Give this one a try, and you'll find it never gets old, the true measure of a classic!
B00005QGAX|5.0|One phrase describes this album. \\"The best album of all time<BR>\\". Every song on this album is worthy of being a #1 hit.<BR>Including the bonus tracks \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\".<BR>All of Michael Jacksons best music was when he was working<BR>with Quincy Jones. While all his new material is still very<BR>good, his work with Quincy has always been the best. This <BR>album is better than most artists greatest hits albums. It's <BR>like a greatest hits album within itself, just like \\"Thriller\\"<BR>and \\"Off The Wall\\" was. If you haven't bought this album you<BR>are really missing out on something special. Trust me.
6305126062|5.0|The Horse Whisperer is one of my favorite movies.  I have my own horses and can really get into this movie.  You know how the young girl feels.  And her feelings towards Pilgram after the accident.  It is a very sad story. I loved the book, but I loved the movie even more!
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller not only directs but stars as the dim-witted male model Derek Zoolander. Derek has been top of the fashion world for years with his trademark `Blue Steel' look. However, there's a new guy on the block called Hansel (Owen Wilson) who starts to steal his thunder. To add to his troubles his friends are all killed in an unfortunate playful gasoline pump incident and he returns to his coal mining family, where he receives a distinctly frosty reception. Chastened he returns to the fashion world where he becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. BUT can dim-witted Derek foil the dastardly bad guys? Will he succeed in building a new school for children who have difficulty reading and writing and other stuff like that? And more importantly can he come up with a new look?<br /> Its pretty tough to satirise a business that is already so clearly loony as the fashion world but Ben Stiller's Zoolander is a pretty successful ninety minute wonderfully stupid chucklefest. Ably supported by Owen Wilson, real-life wife Christine Taylor and real-life Dad Jerry Stiller, Zoolander is implausibly good fun, which is perfectly suited to the DVD format. It's full of excellent set-pieces and comic timing, such as the Walk-Off, Listen To Billy Zane and \\"What is this a centre for ants?\\".  What's more it boasts some excellent cameos from the likes of Jon Voight (as Derek's coal miner Dad), David Bowie and Billy Zane. All in all this pretty much lives up to being `The Spinal Tap' of the fashion world. It's really good fun and you may even find yourself trying to perfect your own Blue Steel or Magnum in the mirror afterwards. If you don't like it, probably \\"you think you're too cool for school. Well here's a newsflash, Walter Kronkite...(extremely long pause)...you're aren't!\\"
0553583182|5.0|writen originally in 1963 this is one of the, if not the, most powerful books on &quot;the search for meaning&quot; I have ever read, and I have read most of them.<br />Excellent tie in with ancient writings including the Bible. Murphy lays out a simple yet extremely effective process to follow. This book will be one of the best investments you have ever made.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|July 7, 1988. This was the year when the great lord of corruption known as Akira, unleashed an unspeakable destruction by creating a huge explosion onto Tokyo with his own evil psychic abilities. Now Akira is dead after the end of the destruction. His insides are now preserved and kept inside individual canisters. Akira may be dead, but the memories of the great destruction of Tokyo, will never die. And to remember the great destruction caused by Akira, you can see that, from the helicopter view, Tokyo has a carved hole at the same place where Akira caused destruction in July 7, 1988. It resembled the shape of one of Akira's insides, and it's still there in the year A.D. 2019, 31 years after World War III (yeah...like that ever happened in our time). Now Tokyo is known as Neo Tokyo. Everything has changed since then. No corruption and definently no wars have occured. But it was soon discovered that 3 kids, who possesses the same power as Akira, still exist. But these kids were not evil like Akira. Unlike Akira, they know how to manage their powers without anger, but still, they considered Akira as their friend. When Neo Tokyo thought the corruption is over, they were wrong. A motorcycle gang of youths battle it out with rival gangs, known as the clowns. An over-tempered teenage boy named Tetsuo Shima soon harnessed the same power as the great Akira, after a few scientists gave him the ability to use psychic powers. Now that Tetsuo is totally out of control with his new psychic powers, will his friend, Kaneda, be able to stop Tetsuo from causing destruction ? Finally after four years of ignoring the hype of the movie, I finally came to my senses and started to purchase the movie \\"Akira\\". At first, I thought the animation was going to be crappy like in some old series, but I was dead wrong ! The animation stunned me with it's extremely high detail and cel animated motion. Though some characters look a bit unstylish with their striped panty hoses, over-curled hair, tight pants, leather jackets, and head bands (this movie was made in 1988, so what more do you expect), but the character detail looks great. Heck ! The motorcycles look cool, including Kaneda's bike ! It's almost like watching an anime from our generation. The voice acting is brilliant. Barely any flaws over here. The only irritating voice that seems to annoy me, is Kai's screechy voice. The guys who did Kaneda and Tetsuo's voice really sounded great. What do you expect ? They're the same guys who played as Vash and young Knives from Trigun ! The action is great. Do not expect any martial arts action coming from this anime. Just pure gang and military style action with lots of shooting, gang fights, and police brutality. This movie is extremely violent, so I wouldn't reccomend it to younger audiences to view this movie. Geez ! No wonder Ebert & Roper gave Akira \\"Thumbs Up\\". I didn't know that an anime movie like Akira would be this popular. I didn't think that a famous movie critic like Roger Ebert would actually give this movie a good rating. If you're looking for an anime with comedy, violence, and pulse pounding animation, look no further than Akira ! This is no doubt the best anime movie of its time !
B00005IBGQ|4.0|Love his father (Loudon Wainwright III) but was skeptical about the prodigal son's work. I'm glad a friend turned me on to this album because it really displays a surprising range of vocal abilities and diversitity in subject matter. One cannot assert that Rufus has cornered himself into a singular style- instead, each track is fresh with a renewed sense of challenge. I like it a lot. It's infinitely listenable without being boring. The ONLY cristicism I harbor is that no one should think about re-doing &quot;Hallelujah&quot; after Jeff Buckley mastered it so artfully. It belongs to Buckley and should not have been renamed and altered by Wainwright. Excellent work overall.
B00005QATY|5.0|I 100% reccomend this movie to anyone and everyone.  It was funny with a great plot and amazing music! i had to buy the soundtrack on the way home from the theater!
B00005UEAR|5.0|If you are a musician and enjoy progressive rock, metal, jazz or complex music then you must have this album.  If you are open-minded about new music then you may be in for a pleasant surprise.This album is ambitious, large and complex and requires several listenings before one is oriented to the intricate time signatures, melodies and tonalites of this work.  Once it hits you, though, you cannot stop listening.  In every respect this is moving music and covers the entire spectrum of emotions, from soft, heartbreaking ballads to thrash metal which will rip you in half. I have been a fan since the band's inception in 1989 with &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; and have watched them grow over the past 13 years.  This album represents the summit of their quest to push the boundaries of modern music, and their talent as individual musicians and their ability to work cohesively as a group have resulted in one of the greatest masterworks in modern rock, an album the likes of which haven't been seen since The Wall, and earlier with Close to the Edge, 2112 and Hemispheres.  This album is better than Metropolis 2, and I loved that album.  You must get this album and see for yourself.  I think the reviewers who have been negative have likely not listened enough times to get hooked.  Keep listening and it will pay off.  There are few, if any, bands out there doing anything close to what Dream Theater are doing right now, and I hope there is a renewed interest in progressive rock, because then the band will finally get the widespread recognition they deserve.
B00000IQMT|4.0|Well,to begin this review I have to say that this was the first <BR>SW soundtrack Id ever bought,and I immidiatley thought it was excellent. But when I later compared it with the scores for the three first SW films,I realized it was not that great. <BR>For the first,the music comes in non-chronological order,which is rather annoying (although it would have been quite chaothic if it did,because the music was so splitted up in the movie). And for the second,the themes are not as memorable and great as the old themes - the new theme for the Trade Federation only appears one time,and Darth Maul is not given a real motif,although he`s the main villain of the film. May be that`s because I was a little disappointed on the movie itself (it felt too much like a children`s movie). The score on itself is a splendid treasure of film music,and in fact, I think that this music should be enjoyed on it`s own,not as a part of the film,if you didn`t liked the film. My favorite tracks are &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;,&quot;Captain Panaka &amp; The Queen`s Protectors&quot;,&quot;The Droid Invasion &amp; Appearance of Darth Maul&quot;,&quot;He is the Chosen One&quot;,&quot;Qui-Gon`s Funeral&quot;,and &quot;Passage Through the Planets Core&quot;. They are the best ones,featuring what sounds pretty new to Star Wars Episode I. For example,the use of choir is much bigger than in the old films - take the well-known &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;,which is actually the final battle music,as the best example. And the track &quot;Qui-Gon`s Funeral&quot; also sounds better than the sad music from the first films - the use of a deep choir and strings sometimes makes me feel I want to cry!&quot;He is the Chosen One&quot; features Anakins theme,which,if you listen carefully,is actually an early and light version of what is going to be the Imperial March. This track is both happy and serious at the same time. &quot;Passage Through the Planets Core&quot; is a mysterious choral track,which ends upquite dramatic as the giant sea monsters appears. The baddest tracks come at the middle of the score,so listen to the first three tracks,then jump to track 10,and you won`t be disappointed.<BR>Over all,this score is quite good on its own,but I think that Williams could have done it even better than he did. Anyway,now when the second movie is just behind the hill,we could always hope that Williams will make a better score for that one. Even the master doesn`t hit the marks all the time!
B00003XACV|5.0|'American Beauty' has the most involving, original and moving score of the year! Thomas Newman, the composer of scores for such films as 'The Horse Whisperer', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'In the Bedroom', 'Little Women' and 'The Green Mile' does it again with this score; the likes of which you've never heard before! When was the last time you heard instruments such as tablas, detuned mandolins, bird calls, dulcimers, ukuleles, banjos, etc all blended together flawlessly to form some breathtaking pieces of music?  Even if you have not seen the film 'American Beauty', you will appreciate the subtle beauty of this score.  The themes are haunting and memorable.  I find myself unable to choose favorites on this score, all of the pieces are so amazing!  &quot;Dead Already&quot; (the main theme) is often reused in later pieces, soemtimes in subtle ways, sometimes  in apparent ways.  Many of these pieces are rather dream like, almost as if they came from a dream.
0425107469|4.0|REPOST of an earlier review I did accidentally under my wife's name/account...she didn't enjoy it as much as I did because it was TOO suspenseful for her (can't cover your eyes like when watching a movie). :-)<br />Now that there is about 250 reviews already with an average rating of 5 stars I hesitate to even leave a review because so much has already been said. Plain and simple...one of the best, most exciting, page-turning books I've ever read. The suspense at times was too much to bear and I had to put it down, relax, then come back too it. One of my all time favorite books!!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I recently re-read this short review and got excited. so I went back and re-read the book.<br />I didn't like it as much for the relational interaction between the male and female protagonists, but the suspense still held it's own years later. It was a good read but no longer my favorite Koontz book, so I knocked it down from 5-star to 4-star.<br />Still worth a read though!!
B00005UV96|4.0|I too got suckered into the ltd edition packaging. I figured with the average selling price of 5-8 dollars more for the ltd edition packaging I was getting some bonus tracks or a bonus CD. Nope. .... I agree with everyone else..get the jewel case edition, it'd hold up better if you take it around places, it wont bend unlike the cardboard and the CD wont scratch up as easily as it will rubbing against that cardboard sleeve that the ltd edt packaging has. Is it ME or would this paper sleeve cost less to make than the jewel case?<BR>Guess they just knew people who always buy the limited release would get suckered into buying it. Guess they taught me one thing....never again will I buy anything limitted edition from the Chem. Bros....they can block rock MY beat...
B000002J1S|5.0|If there were a list in the universe of actual merit that named the Top 25 albums of all-time, Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway would certainly land a spot on that roster. As with many progressive rock albums there is a tendency for self-indulgence and triteness that undermines its efforts. Not the case with this one. For a double album (2 CD's) The Lamb is solid from the title tracks opening arpeggios to the wonderfully optimistic fade out of 'It'. I first heard this album in 1976 and it immediately became my favorite record period. Genesis spans the broad spectrum of genres in this recording that at first listen is hard to digest. There are hard-rock inflections even ambient influences thanks to Brian Eno as well as jazz oriented movements (thanks Phil) that defy comprehension for the average listener, which you won't be after a listen or two to this outstanding record. There aren't enough stars in the galaxy to rate this masterpiece!
B00005UKKF|4.0|I don't like Britney because I think she's a great singer.  (I prefer Christina Aguilera's voice over hers by far.)  I like to watch Britney because has a great body and terrific dance moves.  Admit it, you're captivated when she shakes her thang.
B000005HO0|5.0|This is what black metal is all about, primitive, raw, brutal &amp; ugly music. If you like Dimmu borgir (New) &amp; Cradle of filth i don't recommend this for you. But if you like Darkthrone, Emperor (Old) &amp; Burzum and bands from the underground, you will injoy the ugly, nihilistic nature of this album. The songs are not played as fast like they are on the new'er live albums. The recordings are ugly and bad, sounds like a cassett player with built in mic. for kids (If you remember them). So if you like pretty sound, and pro. rec. sound albums like Dimmu, Cradle, Emperor (New) &amp; The new Gayhem, you will not like this album. But if you're into raw, brutal &amp; ugly music, this is a must buy... ...order today
B00005QCVT|3.0|This was a very interesting film.  Ellen Burstyn is superb as a sweet and lonely widow who simply wants to lose a few pounds and gets addicted to (doctor prescribed) amphetamines.  Her son (Jared Leto) is a serious heroin junkie, along with his best friend (Marlon Wayans, in an excellent role), and girlfriend (Jennifer Connolly).  At the end, all their lives have been destroyed, to a larger or lesser degree, by their involvement with drugs.  They lost their freedom, their mind, their dignity, and quite literally, even more.  The very end of the movie is quite brutal, but the story had been building up to it, so it did not come as a complete shock.  Some parts were too heavy, like the evil and quasi-maniacal attendants in the psychiatric ward.  I thought that was pushing it.  I did like the message, perfectly conveyed by the title.  Drugs will kill whatever dreams you had.  There was no doubt in my mind after seeing this film.<br />The film was slightly amateurish on the hyperreality effects: the chewing, slurping sounds, the mega-visuals, the repetitive sequences.  They look like just taken from the assignment of your first year of film school.<br />Regarding the DVD features: the documentary disappointed me.  I wish it had more structure.  For example, they could have strengthen their explanation of how they filmed some scenes by following up with the finished scene.  The documentary looks like it was put together quickly.  The director's commentary also leaves much to be desired.  Even directors would benefit from rehearsing what they have to say beforehand.  On the other hand, the Independent Film Channel documentary is far better because it is more structured.  Also, the segment with Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby is awesome.  He cries, he laughs, he is honest about his life and shortcomings, and comes through as such a humble person.
6302759110|4.0|A sumptuous, intricately detailed, eyeball filling spectacle of a movie; this not only uses as much of the original story as possible but adds another possible shade to the fictional Dracula by suggesting he was the true Dracula--Vlad the Impaler. Remarkable special effects (including the use of rudimentary cameras and the filming of scenes backwards replayed forward to achieve off-kilter feelings in the audience) overwhelm the soggy acting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. Gary Oldman imbues Dracula with a particular otherworldly touch, Lucy (Sadie Frost) is purity gone wonderfully lusty, and Winona Ryder is alternatively goofy and suitable as Mina. Extreme gothic that will creep you out somehow.
0618001905|3.0|The 19th Century was the high point of colonalism. This book is the retelling of one of the scandals of the period. King Leopold of Belgium used his own rescources to gain the Congo not as a colony of his own country but as his own bit of real estate. <br />The Congo at the time consisted of a huge area. It was largely tropical forest and not that thickly inhabited. To make money from his enterprise Leopold had the local natives collect rubber. Naturally they were not paid for this and had to be forced to do it at gun point. The main import of the Congo colony was firearms. The soldiers employed by Leopold could not waste bullets and had to provide evidence that any used had been used for good purpose. They thus had to cut off the hands of those they shot. <br />Roger Casement was a British official who noticed what was going on. He had a colourful career and was later hanged as a spy. He helped to show the truth behind what was at that point one of the greatest crimes against humanity carried out. (Of course over the next hundred years it would be dwarfed by events in Europe)<br />The scandal at the time was considerable and led to novels like \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Conrad. This book is an interesting retelling of the tail and if you are interested it is a good read.
6304286961|4.0|The life of misunderstood rock star/poet Jim Morrison is delivered through a hazy 1960's filter and the remaining Doors given the sketchiest of treatment. A movie worth seeing if only to hear the timeless music and feel traces of the the free tumultuous time. Though little insight is given into Morrison (he is lightly shaded as an obnoxious drunk, musing poet, charming wit and lost soul) there is a mystical shine to the film. Val Kilmer is an astonishing doppelganger of Morrison.
B00001OH1S|5.0|While this review is belated, the movie and music are by far a class act sorely lacking from today's traditional movie fodder.  Those of us over 13 years of age have been waiting a long time for such a classy, sexy, intelligent, well made film.  Bravo! to Brosnan/Russo on the acting, and Bravo!! to whomever selected the music - a true Cinderella slipper fit.  I do have to agree with others that the icing would have been to get lyrics and a complete soundtrack in the CD offering, but don't let that stop you from buying it (and the VHS/DVD). Pure class never goes out of style!
6303327974|2.0|A flamboyant mess of a movie with moments of smirking depravity and vile intent. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are the lionized mass murderers who escape their half-parodied white trash backgrounds to eventually be captured, only to escape from prison. Stylized grandeur overwhelms the watcher; effective scenes like the killers' brief awakening to humanity with an Indian mystic is lost in a tirade of foul collages and flashing memories. Here the director is indulging his talent but missing the point in doing so.

B00005RYQO|2.0|I viewed this film expecting spectacular motor stunts and a great Days of Thunder type plotline involving cops and robbers. What I got was the unexpected. The plot basically drags out Paul Walker's character wrestling with the fact of whether or not he wants to turn Vin Diesel in. The action sequences themselves are reminiscent of something you would see in one of those B movies you see coming on late night HBO and are released direct-to-video. Walker himself has potential (he stole the show in 1999's She's All That) but he was woefully miscast in this role. I see potential in Vin Diesel, too, but the movie relied on viisual spectacle more than characters and plot development. The soundtrack is pretty decent, if you're a fan of air guitar nonsense. The female leads aren't as appealing as you would expect then to be in this type of film.
0688152023|5.0|I was in ballet for nine years and had to drop out. I loved the feeling of being flexable and in shape. Three years later I was so out of shape I hated it. I found this book and loved it from the moment I opened it. It is so easy to use anyone can use it, and it works. I am feeling better about myself and along with my spirits being lifted my soul is lifted.
0767819594|4.0|It is a well-known fact that actors who start off in television or start off young don't have a chance of making it (case in point, Macaulay Culkin).  There are a few exceptions though, (George Clooney, Will Smith).  With this film, you see the showcase of three great young actors, Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Reese Witherspoon. Phillippe is the stand out, though. It would seem that this film should have established him as a super star but critics and fans were not buying it. Sarah Michelle Gellar, TV's Buffy, showed an evolution of her campy and teen savvy style- arrogance, seductiveness (not sure if that's even a word), manipulative, and the list goes on and on. Of course, this is not the type of person she is in real life but it is not everyday that an actress from a younger generation showcases her versatility. If people stop looking at her as Buffy and as an accomplished actress, then she would be successful. I have not read the book with which this film is based, nor have I seen the blockbuster Dangerous Liasons (there should be a law) but I can understand where the producers were going with this reimagining of the classic story. This film was made to introduce this story to a younger generation and I can understand that. The plot does not drag at all and it showcases the power of love and the power of the human conscience. Sebastian (Phillippe) loves to manipulate and seduce young girls with the help of his estranged and demonic stepsister Kathryn (Gellar). In the process of manipulating a young woman named Cecile (an excellent Selma Blair), Sebastian sets his sights on Annette Hargrove (Witherspoon) in hopes of manipulating and seducing her and boosting his ego and reputation as a womanizer. What he doesn't expect is to actually fall in love with her. The Hargrove character is a psychological case study. She sees right through Sebastian from the get-go but eventually falls in love with him. How is it that we tend to favor that which is seemingly bad for us? Love is a funny thing, isn't it? Think of Eleanor Roosevelt falling in love with Hitler. Anyway, the soundtrack to this film does not disappoint either.  It's a colorful mix of alternative rock, love songs, and that feel good music that almost everyone listens to. This film is excellent in presenting teenage characters that are not the classical interpretation of a teenager. This isn't your run-of-the-mill \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" farce with heavy drug usage, crappy one-liners, dumb parties, and skipping class for a day or night on the town, and an underdog acquiring some kind of supernatural edge to win over his bullies and getting his dream girl. This film explores the dark side of the teenager, proving that you do not have to be a certain age to be evil and that evil wears many faces. Though it explores evil, this also isn't a good versus evil story either. It is a story of how the power of love can overcome our own self-loathing and how it can melt even the coldest heart. This magnificent case study in mainpulation and love's dominance in the most unusal circumstances was one of the most underrated films of 1999. I guess everybody was too excited about Star Wars Episode I to truly notice a good film.y bad for us? Love is a funny thing, isn't it? Think of Eleanor Roosevelt falling in love with Hitler.

0446677450|3.0|I first began to like this book when I realized the authors share my philosophy of overcoming 'stalled' thinking. There is an excellent chapter on stalls related to fears of losing money, behaving differently than others, and so forth that most people have about money. The stallbusting advice is sound. In fact, this is probably the best chapter in the book. I also highly recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold.
B00005OB0A|5.0|The musical trends of the American public truly never cease to amaze me.  Kylie Minogue has been recording CDs of the caliber of \\"Fever\\" for nearly 10 years now; yet, the American music industry (and its listening audience) hasn't given Kylie the time of day for at least a decade.  Why it has taken America so long to acknowledge her talent is beyond my capacity.  I guess Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera--and all the other young teeny boppers who wear next-to-nothing, have held America's attention to the point that they haven't been able to see anything else.  I strongly believe that the primary reason Kylie has FINALLY managed to get America's attention, is because of her extremely revealing video for \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\".  <br />I am very proud to say that I recognized Kylie's talent at least a decade ago--and have regularly purchased the CDs she has released over that timeframe (most of which I've had to get as imports).  Well, whatever it was that finally got Kylie's music into mainstream America, thank goodness!!!  What a refreshing break we are now getting from the likes of Britney, Mariah, and company.....

B000002UJQ|5.0|I feel the need to express that this album should not be approached with any trepidation whatsoever by anyone who enjoys a good pop or rock album. Far from being a spiritual zenith, OK Computer, in its essence, is the culmination of the 20th Century in Pop. It isn't groundbreaking in any sense of the word. Every element you'll hear on this album has been done before. Not only that, but the tunes are quite conservative from a melodic and structural perspective. Yet, Radiohead has the ability that few have (I can think of Cream, U2, Portishead & the Beatles, for instance) in that they integrate seemingly disparate worlds of ideas and sounds into multi-dimensionally satisfying pop tunes. And the band has such a positive vibe that even when they express darker emotions they still don't sound that upset! Kind of like Munch's \\"Scream\\" in pastel colors. The lighter stuff reminds me of Judy Collins singing \\"Both Sides Now\\" and the Velvet Underground. I don't know what's going on in their heads of course, but aspects of this album remind me of practically everything I've ever heard, from Miles Davis's \\"In a Silent Way\\" to Oasis. Yet, it's all distinctly Radiohead, and it is brilliant. With all the albums out there these days, this is one that's worth every penny.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Kerrang reviewed this band and gave them nothing. Any singer who throws a strop at a gig because a guy in the front row is giving him the birdie does not not deserve a f^ckin thing. worse still the band stopped playing until the offending member of the public was thrown out. As kerrang quite eloquently put it..&quot;Nickelback are sh!t&quot;. Buy Zakk Wylde's new cd Eternal if you want real metal. FOAD
B000002JSR|3.0|OK, OK, so \\"Coda\\" is just a bunch of outtakes released by the<BR>group after Bonham's death.  There is no unity to the tracks<BR>and a lot of fans soon realized after hearing it that almost<BR>all of the good stuff had made it onto the albums.  However,<BR>\\"Coda\\" has just enough of interest on it to keep it from being<BR>a throwaway, and that's why I'm writing this review.  <br />\\"We're Gonna Groove\\"--a fine soundcheck jam, with a funk edge<BR>and a lot of bottom.  This would've made a fine cut on any<BR>of the early albums. Perhaps more of these soundchecks should've<BR>made it on here. <br />\\"Poor Tom\\"--the real classic here.  This has \\"III\\" written all<BR>over it, and is actually better than one or two cuts from side<BR>two of that album.  For me, this and \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" are<BR>the only reasons \\"Coda\\" exists.<br />\\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\"--another soundcheck track.  This is<BR>Zep live from their best days, better than anything on \\"Song<BR>Remains The Same\\".  Still, one can't help but think that an<BR>even better performance could've been culled from that <BR>soundcheck.<br />\\"Walter's Walk\\"--\\"Houses\\" outtake.  It sounds like that period,<BR>which was their best, but also definitely like an outtake, with<BR>a muffled sound and no polish at all.  Sounds like it might've<BR>been a great track after about ten more takes. <br />\\"Ozone Baby\\"--side two of the original album was the iffier<BR>side, but nothing here is actually bad.  This track gives one<BR>a taste of what the group sounded like in their last days,<BR>but with a rougher edge than anything on \\"In Through The Out<BR>Door\\".  Nothing great, but its riff is passable.<br />\\"Darlene\\"--never liked this one.  Too much blustery posturing<BR>on the vocals, although the slide and piano work redeems it slightly.  But there's really no melody here!<br />\\"Bonzo's Montreux\\"--ok after one or two listens, but like almost<BR>all drum solos on record--even from someone like Bonham--you never care to hear it again.  Still, it does give you a taste<BR>of the man's thunderous style. <br />\\"Wearing And Tearing\\"--this one seems to be the most popular cut<BR>on the album, but I prefer \\"Groove\\" or \\"Tom\\".  They actually<BR>sound a bit like The Police on this one, during the chorus!<BR>In spite of my reservations, it should've been on \\"In Through<BR>The Out Door\\". <br />The version of this album in the \\"complete studio\\" box set<BR>contains the four bonus cuts \\"Baby Come On Home\\" (a good but<BR>atypical outtake from the first album), two BBC cuts \\"Travelling<BR>Riverside Blues\\" and \\"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\\" (both<BR>superb) and the b-side \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do\\" that should<BR>probably have been on the original \\"Coda\\".  So, in all, while<BR>this album is not recommended to those just getting in to Led<BR>Zeppelin, it is aptly named as a \\"coda\\" to their work.
B00005ATQM|5.0|Metallia, for all my moaning about their stance on MP3s, has redeemed themselves with this DVD-Audio version of the \\"Black\\" album.<br />With the additional Mz and the 24bit audio (vs 16 bit CD audio) the bass and midrange just rumbles.  Enter Sandman and Unforgiven realy have alot more body to them, no other way to really describe it.<br />Remember the first time you heard a CD?  Back when the only stuff that was released was ... classical collections, and boasted that they were DDD vs AAD?  But the quality was so good, it didn't really matter.<br />If you have a good home theater, and are looking to try out some DVD-audio titles... Start here.  Imagine bringing the power of an IMAX theater into your home.<br />It really is an experience, I can't wait for this format to expand.
B00005RYQO|1.0|I saw this movie last summer with a friend to kill an afternoon. After the credits rolled we left the theater with two different thoughts in our heads. My friend was thinking \\"Man, I want to get a Honda and upgrades and a five inch muffler and participate in illegal street races (He says this despite that fact that we reside in a dull, suburban town nestled along the Hudson river where the maximum speed limit is thirty miles an hour)!\\" I was thinking \\"Why did I see this?\\" This movie is terrible, one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is horrible--so horrible that the fungus lurking under my kitchen sink could write better stuff. The acting is laughable. It is laughable for two reasons, 1) Being that the person in charge of casting is a dog or a toddler or a rock (I'd say all three, but that would be giving too much credit), and 2) The horrible script gives these \\"actors\\" the worst lines imaginable. The plot is far-fetched and corny. It involves street racers who hijack trucks full of electronics and showboat while they do it. A young cop who drives around in a reved-up, neon Honda (Oh, so that's the new police squad car...) comes to investigate the hijackings and gets involved in the secret world of illegal street racing and meets the \\"Big Man\\", Torreto. Then he falls in love with Torettos sister. So to sum it up, the cop needs to stop the truck hijackers, marry Toretto's sister, and earn Toretto's respect in the process. Of course there are the predictable plot twists (the cop goes in only to bust Toretto, but then befriends him and feels guilty when he arrests him) and to accompany the predictable twists, there is the predictable ending (Toretto forgives the cop and everyone's happy). The cast is filled with the most simple and campy characters. We have the young, blonde, rebellious cop, the cold-but-misunderstood street racer, the comedic Spanish racer, and the cold, heartless, well groomed Chinese racer. Oh yes, we also have the brainy genious with the sad story (who in the end gets shot to make the people feel even more remorse for him), and the \\"independent\\" sister/lover. Basically, the cast stunk. The soundtrack was garbage too, using wannabe hardcore rockers such as the crap-tastical Limp Bizkit. One may suspect that since the movie's about cars, then at least the automoblies should be good, but the movie is incapable of delivering even that. Most of the cars are inexpensive little Hondas. No reved-up Porches or Mustangs here (I could imagine that since the main characters were poor, they wouldn't be able to afford such nice cars, so they hooked them up with cheap ones. But then answer me this: If they can't afford cars like that, then how can they afford the upgrades on their cars?). I strongly suggest this to anyone who is considering renting this movie: Don't do it. This is a terrible movie. You will killing your day and torturing yourself. Go out and rent Pulp Fiction or Saving Private Ryan--you'll be glad you did.
B00004XONN|5.0|A dark, haunting keyboard melody floats out of your stereo. A frantic robotic voice mutters &quot;Kid A... Kkkkkid A....&quot; You stare at your stereo system, feeling an overwhelming depression, and thinking &quot;What planet is this from, and who just died?&quot; That's probably what your first listen to Kid A will be like. And it will most likely leave you very depressed and very confused. This is not the easiest album to get into, but is very rewarding once you do. The most enjoyable (or should I say depressing and scary) moments include the crazed jazz band on &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and the incredible vocal performance on &quot;Idioteque,&quot; but really, every second of Kid A is good. You've got give Radiohead credit for going from the guitar based sound of their first three albums to their newer, synth based sound with no real transitory period. With most other bands, you can kinda tell what direction their sound is headed, but Radiohead (and Mr. Bungle, for that matter) keep changing their sound and leaving listeners unaware.<br />If you enjoy watching sunsets with your Special Someone and gossiping happily with your best friend on the phone, I cannot guarentee that you'll enjoy this album. You might want to get The Bends or Amnesiac, which are more song based and upbeat. But if you're a fan of concept albums and progressive rock (Pink Floyd, Tool), and are depressed a lot, this could be your new favorite CD.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|The wonderful thing about \\"1\\" is that it has served to welcome members of a new listening generation to Beatles music.  It's an affordable way to own a cursory sampling of tunes by rock's most influential foursome.<br />Unfortunately, those are the only accolades I can give this disc.  As many other reviewers have stated, they were quite liberal--and inconsistent--with their definition of a number one single when compiling this track list.  The result is a shallow collection lacking too many essential Fab Four classics.<br />If you want a more representative greatest hits package, it's definitely in your best interest to purchase the red & blue albums (\\"1962-1966\\" and \\"1967-1970,\\" respectively).  They're a bit pricier, but worth every dollar for their more comprehensive coverage of such a legendary musical career.<br />Then, if you're feeling more ambitious (or simply hooked!), run out and pick up any of the five albums generally considered their best (listed here in chronological order of release):  Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles [The White Album], & Abbey Road.
B00003CXI1|4.0|i love this movie the reason though i give it 4 stars is because <BR> they left two main parts at the ending and the middle but it was great ps read the books their also great. First when Harry didnt know he was a wizard he had a horrible life but soon he was in the spell of magic AS always expected Harry was so magical. Youngest wizard soccer player and other things make Harry great if the added one part at the end that they took off i could gladly give it a 100 stars (5 stars now!) but from two left out sceans i must give it four but it should be 5 a wonderful movie you can't not miss it if you do your missing a year a wizardry!
0060922583|5.0|This book really gets you thinking.  You need to have a few days to ponder over it and then accept the fact that the theory presented here will change the way you look at the world.
0783219172|4.0|Michael J. Fox stars in this film as Frank Bannister, a ghostbusting con who actually can see ghosts. He is aided in his job by three ghosts who also happen to be his roommates in his unfinished house. Things go start to go terribly wrong for Frank when a mysterious evil spirit shows up dressed as death and starts killing people. Not only can Frank see the spirit, but he also sees numbers on the foreheads of those about to be killed and he always happens to be around right at the time of the victims death. You know Frank isn't a killer. Or is he?<br />This is an often over-looked film that was released in the summer of 1996. It has a lot of things going for it: it stars Michael J. Fox, is directed by Peter Jackson (of LORD OF THE RINGS fame), has some awesome special effects, and is a really well written movie. However, THE FRIGHTENERS is not easly categorized. It is a cross between romantic comedy/horror thriller. A lot of people don't like it when \\"genres\\" are mixed, even if it is done well. THE FRIGHTENERS is done well, but it is a strange hybrid and not all mixtures are for everyone. Still, Michael J. Fox is great and if anyone is interesting in seeing why Peter Jackson was so good at making LORD OF THE RINGS, this film illustrates why.
B000000H5J|5.0|I'm not the biggest fan of metal, prefering agressive indie rock (aka. \\"emocore\\") bands like Glassjaw and At the Drive In for headbanging. However, this is one of those few \\"real metal\\" CD's I can listen to, and enjoy. Every song features great drumming and simple, yet catchy and heavy riffs. Dino has a great strumming style that any guitarist would appreciate. The vocalist, Burton, is also good, because he can scream his butt off in songs like \\"Self Bias Resistor,\\" only to sing very melodicly in the chorus. Matt Holt from Nothingface is the only other vocalist who can do that. The lyrics are also good, considering this is heavy metal. Very few cuss words, and intellegent remarks about our computerized society. If you like metal, or want to get into it, this is the CD for you. It's better than anything else Fear Factory has done, and really broke new ground in its time.
0783240503|4.0|Having not watched any production of the show, I was glad when I learned that video format of the show has been released.  I initially learned of the show when a cast recording featuring Jason Donovan was released some years ago.  With the video format, I was also interested in the performance of Donnie Osmond as Joseph.<br />However, when I watched the video, I realized that it was not a recorded live performance.  The production design has also been changed for cinematic effect.  While the production concept was good, it seemed like I was watching a long music video.  The video would have been better if a live performance was recorded so that the viewer would have a feeling of 'theater' while watching it (just like the video of 'Jekkyl &amp; Hyde', which unfortunately featured David Hasselhoff, but that's another story).  It would have been great if you know that the performers are really singing, not just lip-synching their lines.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Anatomy of a Murder tells the story of an unusual murder trial in Michigan's upper penninsula. It's a terrific movie - well acted, well directed, and with a wonderful score by Duke Ellington.<br />It's also based on a true case, which was related in a book by the trial's judge. I once discussed the case with a man from the town where it occurred. He summed it up as follows: \\"Barney never took anything that wasn't offered to him.\\" If you've seen the movie, you'll understand what he meant.
0446608955|1.0|If there is a more sappy story out there, I would be surprised. This is definitely not a book for adult readers. Mr. Sparks obviously read that 70's tear-jerker, Love Story, added a dose of the South, sprinkled in a little nostalgia for the 50's and came up with pablum in book form. Yuk!
6305089957|5.0|With 'Scream' being such an unexpected hit, managing to reinvent the horror genre, a sequel was almost inevitable.  However, 'Scream 2' transcends all horror sequels before it to become every bit as good as its predecessor.  Two years on from the original killings at Woodsboro, Sidney (Campbell) is trying to settle down at college with a new boyfriend (O'Connell) and geeky friend Randy.  Yet when two gruesome killings of her fellow college classmates coincide with the opening of 'Stab', the movie based on the first 'Scream' movie, it's business as usual with a ghostfaced killer stalking our heroine and her friends.  This calls for the return of old favourites Gail Weathers (Cox) and drippy Deputy Riley (Arquette).<br />First off, this sequel is good because it has a new location and shows that it's characters have moved on from the first set of murders.  For instance, Sidney is still jumpy around boys whilst there's some well-realised sexual tension between Dewy and Gail.  This is helped by a self-knowing script by Kevin Williamson, which even has a discussion of how sequels are generally worse that their predecessors thrown in!  Once again he manages to subvert the whole genre by pointing out the clichés through a cast that are well-versed in how to survive a horror movie.<br />The acting is key, with Campbell in particular proving beyond doubt that she can imbue the 'scream queen' persona with a human quality.  The supporting cast are all good, and there are some interesting cameos too - Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joshua Jackson and Jada Pinkett to name a few.<br />This is not only clever with its idea of a movie within a movie with a cast that know their role, but exciting and scary.  There are some particularly impressive set pieces and original ideas that add up to make this one hell of a ride.  The only possible thing that it is possible to discredit is the fact that as a sequel it can't possibly revolutionise the genre in the way that 'Scream' did.  However, this is every bit as good as the first movie and a definite improvement on a lot of the horror garbage that is on offer at the moment.
B00004T9UF|1.0|Eminem thinks he is such hot..., but all I can think of when I hear this music is just how crude Eminem is. Pac and all the other great rappers may have talked with crudity, but Eminem brings it to an all-time low. Is it just music? I think not.
1567184855|5.0|What?  This book is about people, not animals! Is there a horse or dog you can hypnotise and get a transcript about a past life from??  I don't personally know any that I could communicate on that level with!  Also, just because a book doesn't mention animals doesn't mean that they don't have souls.  The author doesn't work w/ animals, he works w/ people.  So, I question the validity of your review.  I think it was unfair and has little to no basis for your criticisms.  Your arguments about some other issues are overshadowed by the animal thing.  <br />I think another issue, is that you are focusing too much on what Dr. Newton should have put in his book. It was a study of hypnotism of people and what they experienced.  It doesn't neccisarily fit into a neat explanation!  Which means it may not mention some of the beliefs we have today.  These are case studies... which means you report what happens.  You don't try to make it conform to anything... which to me, makes his findings more believable!<br />The book is very informative...compelling and hard to put down!  Even if you don't believe in reincarnation or past lives, you may have some doubts!  It's interesting if nothing else.  The author is not only a great doctor, but a very talented author!  I would highly recommend this book, if for nothing else but to expand your horizons!
B00005QDW1|4.0|This is the first No Doubt cd that I've purchased and I love it. I've enjoyed some of their other singles such as &quot;Don't Speak&quot; and &quot;Just a Girl&quot; but I never really checked out any of their cds. With &quot;Hey Baby&quot; in heavy rotation on the radio, I couldn't get the catchy tune out of my head so I bought the cd to give the band a try. I really like this cd. The music is fun and immediately likeable. I think there should be a good deal of hits from this effort. My favorite songs are at the beginning of the cd---Hella Good, Hey Baby, Making Out and Detective. The rest of the cd is good though. The Prince produced song, &quot;Waiting Room&quot; is interesting but not as appealing as I hoped it would be. Overall, this is a great cd and I look forward to hearing any of No Doubt's new singles on the radio.
B000002LCD|3.0|Madonna's first semi-soundtrack to Who's That Girl was nothing more than decent. I honestly think that Madonna should have done the entire elbum rather than just four of the nine tracks. But no, that honor has to go to Dick Tracy with the god-awful I'm Breathless album, but that's a different story. <br />Who's That Girl, the openning track was latin flavored with a few latin lyrics in there with it's dark pop; I'd say it was appropriate for the title track. Causing A Commotion was, once again, dance by Madonna. The Look Of Love is a semi-ballad; it's dark and has a very, very slight latin sound in it. Can't Stop is a fun, uptempo pop song.<br />As far as the other tracks, I really could care less. I would have liked to have given the album five stars, but I really don't feel that the entire album deserves it considering Madonna had the only good tracks. Her four tracks are fun, dark, and overall well produced.
B00003CXS4|5.0|as stated in the title, i dub this movie, fun.  the movie has 3 different stories that meet up every now and then.  the action sequences are spectacular.  i insist that you watch this movie.  with the themes of diamond theft and unlicensed boxing, it is a wonderful film
B000002J1U|5.0|I am a die hard fan of early Zep so I & II are my personal favorite albums but it was III that showed that they were a lot more than a hard rock band.<BR>Diversity is why The Beatles were the greatest and why Led Zeppelin was right up there with them.<BR>This album showed that they could play any type of music and play it as good or even better than anybody.<BR>On this album there is a lot of folk and these guys show they can play folk just as good or even better than most folk groups of the 60s.<BR>Led Zeppelin is the most influential rock group of all time next to The Beatles and this album is a great example why.<BR>This is their most underated album ever and I would put it in their top 3 of best albums. Even though this was not a popular album with the critics and stupud fans who didnt know what music was outside of heavy metal it did not hurt the groups popularity but made a turning point for future albums in the 70s.
B00003CXE7|5.0|If you are looking for an epic film with a great actor, beautiful direction and gorgeous cinematography, this movie by Ridley Scott is for you. Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of the Oscar he received as the honorable general Maximus, who is betrayed by the scheming and evil, Commodus, son of the dead emperor of Rome, played perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. Scott takes us from the low point of Maximus' existence in slavery and shows us how he battles his way back to confront the man who took his family and life away from him. Through honor, his strength brings him the respect of the citizens of Rome, who eagerly watch the bloody sport in which he is forced to participate. Connie Nielson is also good as the sister of Commodus, and former love of Maximus, who has to deal with the incestuous advances of her brother and his maniacal treatment of the citizens of Rome. This 2 disc dvd contains the movie as well as lots of interesting extras such as \\"The Making of Gladiator for HBO\\" and tons of deleted scenes. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves movies.
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue ended the trio of Madonna's early career of long players. Whilst still trying pop, Madonna still can't seem to shake off her love for dance music either. True Blue stood for many things: anti-abortion, love, dance, definitely alot more than True Blue's two ancestors: Madonna and Like A Virgin. True Blue was the time that Madonna entered the real world of music and she was no longer given special treatment like the new kid at school. <br />The first track, Papa Don't Preach, made the ultimate anti-abortion statement through it's dark pop/dance sound. The album lightens up with Open Your Heart, pure pop with a dance beat. White Heat was a more mature dance song from Madonna with a cool dance hook, along with references to Jimmy Cagney. Live To Tell, rendered as Madonna's greatest ballad of all time, has an extremely powerful slow beat along with powerful vocals and smart lyrics. Where's The Party is an extremely babyish dance party song and was obviously not intended to be anything more than that. True Blue is a mellow pop song, with sweet vocals, but immature lyrics. La Isla Bonita is Madonna's first ever stab at latin music and with it's latin guitar and drums, I can't say she did half bad. Jimmy Jimmy is a very fast paced song, not intended to be a dance song whatsoever. Love Makes The World Go Round is another party song, though not as immature as track 5, it holds a more fun beat and better lyrics. The last two tracks are bonus track remixes of True Blue and La Isla Bonita and I honestly don't care too much for them. <br />True Blue is an album that is often overlooked by people because it is so old. However, this album contains some of Madonna's most memorable songs like Live To Tell and Open Your Heart. It deserves four stars for it's effort, but does not deserve a fifth because it is too diverse.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade's Lovers Rock tour was one of the best concerts I have ever been to. The band's timing was superb. The staging and visual effects rocked! Give yourself and/or significant other this capsule of unadultered love.
B000006MV8|5.0|I WAS HAPPY TO DICOVER THE SONG &quot;PERFECTION&quot; ON &quot;WSLS'S 96.5 IN ASHEVILLE, NC. IT WAS A TRUE TREASURE TO FIND AN OLDER SONG WITH A MESSAGE WRITTEN YEARS AGO THAT IS SO TRUE TODAY. A TRUE GEM OF A CD, THAT WILL BE PLAYED FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.<br />                             CARMEN L. SKEPARNIS
B000002BBY|5.0|The story is a great CD.  The songs transcend a genre, capable of reaching out to all kinds of music lovers.  Dont bother deciphering the meaning of the lyrics.  Just listen to the flow: It will draw you in.  Three phenomenal songs build the foundation upon which this great album was built, dont judge the band until you've heard em': 3. Wonderwall, 4. Dont Look Back in Anger, and 12. Champagne Supernova.  The only thing that left me wondering was how Oasis was able to attract such a legendary peice of Rock History(Jay Maas) to lend his Bass talents to Untitled track 6, and a two other supporting rolls in track 3,and 8.
B00003CXTG|4.0|The Pearl Harbor DVD (60th Anneversary Collector's Edition) stands out as one of the best DVD presentations I've seen in some time. <br />Before I continue with my review, I should note 2 facts:<br />1) I did not like any of the previous films I've seen by the duo.<br />2) I visited Hawaii for two weeks in August, including Pearl Harbor.<br />The Movie: When I first watched the movie on my television (without surround sound), it was EXTREMELY hard to hear. The dialouge was soft to begin with, and then these theatrical geniuses took the \\"Tennesse\\" theme and blasted it 100 decibles louder than the dialouge. However, I'm told with surround sound it is excellent in terms of sound. The sound quality is impressive however. The movie itself does drag quite severally in the beginning. I was expecting it, from reading other reviews of the movie when it came out, so it wasn't as bad. But still, it was like throwing an hour and a half of \\"Casablanca\\" in front of \\"Die Hard\\". Think about it.<br />Then Dec 7th rolls around. The tension leading up to the bombing is magnificent. The huge numbers of warnings both noticed and unnoticed lets you understand why \\"military intellegence\\" is an oxymoron. The battle scene itself is everything you've heard about it, and more. It's absolutly the best single battle I've seen in a movie. It's about 45 minutes long too. <br />The rest of the movie is actually intresting, they shy away from the love story finally (Which even is in the battle near the end), and get into a very intresting military documentary type of movie. I enjoyed this segment almost as much as the battle.<br />The end, is predictable to say the least. I was cracking up near the end as the infamous \\"I'll do this to save you but I'm going to end up getting killed\\" motion was played about 20 times back and forth between the two main characters in the matter of about 30 seconds.<br />The historical inaccuracies in this movie are not only bad, but extremely noticable. FDR's Sept 8thJoint Session speech, for the most part, is Wrong. He simply did not say some of the things that were put in the speech in the movie. My grandparents who were around during WWII nitpicked for the first hour and half all the innacuracies. This shouldn't be used as a teaching material about the WWII era in the least. Not to mention there were no Hawaiins in the movie. You'd think with a movie named \\"Pearl Harbor\\" you might see some. THREE STARS<br />The DVD: (Menus) The menus are well done. Simplistic, yet they have beautiful pictures of WWII aircraft and Hawaii running in the backround, along with the nice musical theme. <br />(Chapter Selection) There are about 45 chapters in the movie, which makes it easy to switch the battle scenes to watch again.<br />(Making Of) The making of segment is nice, and long, its intresting to see how they made all the ships tip over and stuff. I didn't know that the movie actually was taped in Pearl Harbor which was intresting.<br />(Music Video) There's a Faith Hill music video of \\"I'll Be There\\" on the DVD. I'm not particullary a fan of her music, but it has excellent video and sound quality.<br />(History Channel Documentary) This is another 45 minute feature about the Heroes of Pearl Harbor. In other words: \\"How The Characters in the Movie Were Ripped From The Headlines\\". After seeing this, it's like watching an episode of \\"Law and Order\\". You know it really happened. The expand quite a bit on how the real life people the characters were based in. I enjoyed it. Again, this was difficult to hear with soft dialouge.<br />(Nat'l Geographic Preview) I don't know what this was supposed to be, but it was basically a \\"Buy the Pearl Harbor 4-DVD set coming out soon\\".<br />(Trailers) I left the trailers to last because quite frankly, they are some of my favorite trailers to date. They were not only well done but emotional and have high replay value.<br />The Teaser Trailer is about 2 minutes long, and features various shots of planes flying around and bombing Pearl Harbor, with the REAL FDR SPEECH in the backround (You know the one: \\"December 7th, 1941, a date which will live... in infamy.\\") this is my favorite of the two.<br />The Theatrical Trailer is as well done as the teaser, and is a bit longer. This trailer also incorperates FDR speech, but it's done by the actor who plays him. This one actually uses some of his Fireside chats. Most of his lines come from his meetings with advisors such as \\"How long can we pretend that we're not at war?\\" and \\"Does anyone really think we can win a war without losing life?\\". It shows some of the more upbeat pre-war scenes of the movie, but leaves a good portion to the battle itself.

B00003CY3W|4.0|I haven't read the graphic novel \\"Ghost World,\\" and didn't have any preconceived ideas about this movie before I saw it (that I know of).<br />\\"Ghost World\\" is the story of a slightly odd girl, Enid (played transparently by Thora Birch), and her obsession with the unloved things of this world, starting with her encounter with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a fried-chicken company administrator by day, geekish collector of 78s and other miscellanea by night. It's also the story of the changes in the relationship between Enid and her not-so-odd friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), who after high school, is rapidly transforming into a fairly mainstream adult.<br />The movie has an offbeat sensibility that is both funny and slightly jarring at times, but that delivers a very true-feeling story of post-high school \\"what do I do now?\\" syndrome. The thing I love about this movie is that, as opposed to the fake silicone slickness of most \\"teen\\" movies, this has a funny-sad real feel that represents the not often glorified underbelly of society.  The film is populated with entertaining characters, from the pseudo-artistic art teacher (Illeana Douglas), to the bumbling soft-spoken father (Bob Balaban), to cameo characters such as \\"Weird Al\\" the fifties diner waiter, and Doug, the white-trash mini-mart loiterer.  As Enid says, \\"these are our people!\\"<br />\\"Ghost World\\" is kinder than a John Waters movie, truer than a teen movie, and better than most similarly-true independent movies.
B000002B7Y|4.0|This is the first/debut with guitarist Zakk Wylde. The great thing, and the pointer is that this album blows away the<BR>\\"glam\\" period Ozzy did with Jake. This is somewhat a<BR>party cd, but there are some great songs here. \\"Breaking all the Rules,\\" is heavy and rocks, along with \\"Miracle Man,\\"<BR>and in particular, \\"Fire in the Sky.\\" This song is one of Ozzy's<BR>best, and the guitar solo{OH MY GOSH!!!} is one of the best <BR>solo's I've ever heard. This is a great CD. The reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the production could have been better, {especially since it's remastered!} The drums seem drained out in some places, and the \\"talk voice\\" on \\"Miracle Man\\" is way too loud. Other than that, this album is part of Ozzy's History, so get it.
B0000009OU|5.0|Listening to This Years Model after 22 years (gasp!), one is struck by how current and urgent it all still sounds. The lyrics are so sharp and the songs are so well structured that I am reminded of Cole Porter. I don't think Elvis Costello ever topped this, even though he came close so many times. Insight, anger and humor are combined into his unique style that cuts through all the hypocrisy in the world like acid poured on metal.
0142000663|2.0|Although Steinbeck is an accomplished writer I can't stand many of his books. The Grapes of Wrath might of had a powerful message but there were many things about it I didn't like. I have often heard The Grapes of Wrath called an analogy with Christ's life and the preacher portrayed as Christ. I think this is a ludacris analogy because the preacher was an immoral hypocrite. The sexual content and such took away the power of the message that Steinbeck was attempting to convey to his readers. So while The Grapes of Wrath is considered a classic I would personally choose to never pick it up again.
6300214435|4.0|Decidedly darker and more violent prequel to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" leans more towards horror. Set in 1935, archeologist-adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), his young Chinese partner (Ke Huy Quan), and a spoiled nightclub singer (Kate Capshaw) find themselves stranded in India after fleeing from gangsters in Shanghai. There they agree to help a cursed Hindu village find their kidnapped children and the sacred Sankara Stones, uncovering a secret Thuggee cult along the way. \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" isn't as good as \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", but better than most sequels and deserves credit for not simply being a retread of the original. Scenes of human sacrifice, child slavery, torture, and the occult make the film unsuitable for children and the faint of heart, but those able to stomach the darker elements will find an exotic adventure filled with action and humor. Ford is great again as Indy, Quan is a nice addition as Indy's kid sidekick, and Amrish Puri is the epitome of evil as the Thuggee cult's high priest. Capshaw's whiny heroine, however, is more annoying than amusing and fails equally as a love interest.

630157401X|3.0|After the dark and violent \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple Doom\\", the second sequel to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" is an amiable adventure lark. Set in 1938, archeologist-adventurer Indiana Jones is informed by a wealthy patron (Julian Glover) that his estranged historian father (Sean Connery) has disappeared while on the trail of the legendary Holy Grail. Joined by his father's sultry Austrian assistant (Alison Doody) and his colleague Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), Indy searches for his father and the Grail and once again finds himself battling the Nazis. John Rhys-Davies also returns as Indy's Arab friend Sallah, and the late River Phoenix plays a young Indy in a clever opening sequence. Definitely the least intense of the series, \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" leans more towards comedy and sentimentality. Ford has great chemistry with the ideally cast Connery, and its fun seeing Elliot and Rhys-Davies from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" again. But in many ways \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" seems like a watered down version of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". With the exception of a terrific tank chase, the action sequences are less elaborate than the those from the first two films. \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" is not as emotionally stirring as those films either, but is still a pleasant, entertaining romp.
B00005221L|5.0|From the first frame you know that this film is going to produce the goods.John Mc Tierman must be the most unrecognised director around.Here's my advice.Watch the film, forget about the cheesy acting at the start between Dutch (Arnie) and Dillan (Carl Weathers aka. Rocky's mate), and pay attention to the rest of the film.<BR>Superbly staged action with some of the coolest scenes you will ever see on film, this is not one to be missed.<BR>i am not going to tell you the plot like other reviewers, I want you to watch if and find out what happens yourself.<BR>PS.The Pedator's cackle is by far the best sound ever captured on screen/sound, judge for yourself, anytime.
630575067X|4.0|Writer/director/producer George Lucas' long awaited prequel to his blockbuster sci-fi saga is a flawed but fun family film. Set three decades before the original \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The Phantom Menace\\" has the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) coming to the aid of the teenaged Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) when her planet is invaded by the greedy alien Trade Federation's robot army. While fleeing from the bad guys, our heroes meet friendly nine year old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a boy who may be the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy, although we know he'll grow up to become the villainous Darth Vader instead. Complicating the plot is that the Trade Federation is a pawn in the evil Sith Lords Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and Darth Maul's (Ray Park) unfolding scheme to gain control of the Galactic Republic and destroy the Jedi Knights. Old favorites like R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, and Jabba the Hutt also have small roles, and we meet new all-CGI characters like Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy, cartoonish amphibian alien whose goofy antics and pidgin English dialogue is at first annoying, but grows on you. \\"The Phantom Menace\\" actually surpasses the original \\"Star Wars\\" when it comes to special effects, production design, and epic scope. ILM has effectively blended live action with computer animation to create believable alien worlds, the intense light sabre battles make the old fights look like child's play, and the plot's political machinations are surprisingly complex. However the acting is mixed, the dialogue is occasionally cheesey, there is too much slapstick and not enough true wit, and the characters lack the appealing dynamics of the original films. You also have to be very familiar with the \\"Star Wars\\" universe to keep track of where the story is going.
B0000025JT|5.0|Just when you thought, please God no more Bee Gee's, Barbra Striesand gave them the kind of class they never had. If there are five essential Streisand albums this has to be one of them: THE WAY WERE WERE being the greatest in her long career. But this time out she's travelling in useful company. Whatever one thinks of them, and I find it easy not thinking about them, the Gibbs can not be ignored here. This was Drama meets Disco and it never sounded better for Barbra, or us; the comsumers. <br />In London this album caused a sensation in 1980-2 and it is still much loved. Here is the meeting of two stylists Barbra the Diva and Barry the camp loverboy to melt the hearts of teendream girls, even my sister fancied him. Anyway, rather than competing with Barbra he paid her the greatest compliment by wrting, arranging and composing this 'glamourpuss' of an album that matched style with content, if not meaning. <br />Clearly Larry Hart will rest easy, and so will Cole, George and Ira, because Gibb does not have their wit, passion or sophistication. What Barry did have was the know how! WOMAN IN LOVE is without a doubt as important to Barbra's career, along with THE WAY WE WERE and PEOPLE as RESPECT, and all the others greats, was to Aretha Franklin: the other great voice of the Rock and Soul era. <br />The production sheen on the CD GUILTY sends the vocials through the stratosphere and Barbra seems to be in such great spirits throughout the set. RUN WILD, PROMISES, and LOVE LOVE INSIDE shimmer with confidence. The tempo of the songs also provide Streisand a ricer vocal range because the songs are not theatrical, they are confessional in a pop sensibility.<BR> <BR>As one of her greatest fans I really dislike her choice of material over the past 10 years but from 1963-1983 she proved herself to be a vocal stylist bar none! And GUILTY was the pinical of her pop aspirations. The opening title track combines the kind of pop devotional love song that Carol King and her hubby wrote for so many girl groups in the 1960s and then later turned into her own vocal confession on TAPESTRY. <br />GUITLY sits right up there with the best because it's the kind of glamourous romanticism that is seldom done today. <br />I WILL NEVER GIVE UP is so ironic I just love it to pieces! Not only is there the sinuous beauty of Barbra's voice overlaying  the rhythm, there is a promise fulfilled on the album but never continued later on in her career; and I miss that. Which is why I have never stopped playing this perfect pop album. Buy it and spoil yourself. The finale MAKE IT LIKE A MEMORY will tell the listener just why Streisand is the most enduring famale vocalist of her era. Not only does this play at night, with a loved one over dinner, it plays in the summer when all that techno buzzes through the air. Then you cut the (stuff) with her vocal that's so dazzling it forces people to look in your direction because through your window, or in your car, the humane voice of Barbra Streisand can stop traffic; and you'll be such a star yourself because you have her voice in your space.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is probably the greatest of all time, albeit I admit that opinions like this are purely subjective.  Nobody can definitively say, \\"this is officially the greatest album ever made, whether you like it or not!\\"<br />If there were a vote for greatest album of all time, however, would this album get the most votes?  It probably would.  Granted, there are other brilliant albums out there.  Nobody is denying that (those who do are very foolish).  <br />Keeping all this in mind, are subjective opinions important?  Of course they are.  This is how we deem what is important as a society.  As I said earlier, there is no \\"official\\" opinion.  I am sure there are people who hate this album, just as I am sure there are people who hate Beethoven's 5th, the Mona Lisa, and Citizen Kane.  I am sure there are plenty of people who will read this and think I am crazy for using those examples to make my point.  \\"You dare compare Sgt. Pepper to the Mona Lisa?  What an idiot!\\"  Still others will read the above and think \\"why would you compare Citizen Kane to Sgt. Pepper and Beethoven's 5th?  I hated that movie.\\"<br />Everybody has his or her own opinion about art, politics, etc.  Do not get too wrapped up in whether this is the greatest album of all time.  Why not look at the facts and just live with it?  Simply put, this album is meaningful to a lot of people, possibly more than any other single album, regardless of the people who hate it.  This album seems to have influenced more notable musicians than most others (going by interviews, etc.).  People who make their living by reviewing other people's music generally agree that Sgt. Pepper was a milestone.  Many reviewers in here call it the greatest album of all time (and there are only a handful of albums that get those kind of reviews at Amazon).<br />What does all this mean?  Absolutely nothing, except that a lot of people seem to like it.  Therefore, there is a good chance that those of you who have not yet heard Sgt. Pepper will also like it.  I like it.  It is one of my favorite albums.  When I listen to it, though, the last thing I am thinking is, \\"this is the greatest album ever!  This is better than anything Pink Floyd, Michael Jackson, The Temptations, Elvis, and The Stones ever made!  All hail Sgt. Pepper!\\"  Rather, I am thinking, \\"I like that lyric...I really like that riff...that note is perfect....\\"  <br />My opinion is that Sgt. Pepper is the greatest album of all time, but who cares, unless you are in the market to buy a new album and value other people's opinions?
0142800031|5.0|Ken Follett is a master storyteller. Jackdaws is his tale of Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet, an officer in the British Special Operations Executive\\" with a plan to cripple Germany communications before D-Day. When her plan to destroy a German telephone exchange goes awry, she recruits an unusual six member team drawn from SOE rejects, an aristocrat who can shoot, and a couple of prisoners. These odd balls and misfits (including two lesbians and a German transvestite) infiltrate the exchange as cleaning women, and must dismantle it in just six hours. Unfortunately, the Germans are waiting for them. Jackdaws is a ripping good thriller in classic Ken Follett style. This 15 hour long, complete and unabridged audiobook edition from Books On Tape is superbly narrated by Kate Reading. Very highly recommended for all Ken Follett fans and an ideal acquisition for community library audiobook collections.
0385505833|5.0|I think it's always a lot of fun and very interesting when an author tries something different from his/her norm.  This book was a Christmas gift from my daughter, I read it after a hectic Christmas and really enjoyed it.  The main characters were snooty but not so much that you'd want to slap them.  They really had heart, too.  Being of their age myself, I can sympathize with their need to break from tradition.  Their last minute solution to their &quot;problem&quot; of no Christmas and no party was the funny part.  It was a fast, easy read, perfect for sitting by the cozy fire in the fireplace watching the needles drop from the tree you're heartily sick and tired of looking at!
B00004YB9Y|4.0|To start I just want to point out that when hearing this CD, one should not judge it as opera because it just isn't. Some reviewers talked about slow tempis. Hello! christmas songs! This is not Otello! Its magic relies on beautiful songs sung by three of the most beautiful voices ever.<br />And honestly...it is a great CD with great songs. The only bad thing about it is that sometimes Pavarotti forgets himself and starts siging with enormous power forgetting that he is in a church singing what is supposed to be very soft and light music.<br />Otherwise...great! Worth to have it.
B000007MVM|5.0|Syd Barrett was easily one of the greatest lyricists of his generation. While I don't necessarily think this album a great introduction to his work (heard often: &quot;Is this him warming up?&quot;), I do find it to be a sort of magnum opus for the man. It's not a terribly happy album. It's a kind of direct snapshot of a person going completely off the rails in front of your eyes. But that's what makes it so fascinating. What do the lyrics signify to the person writing them? Or is Syd not even there at all, as he seemed to say in his last song with Pink Floyd, &quot;Jugband Blues.&quot;:&quot;I'm wondering who could be writing this song?&quot; As for the songs, they are cracked and beautiful things. &quot;Dark Globe&quot; is easily one of the most tragic but mysterious songs ever penned for recording, and the feeling of finality and wandering strings the album together. It's a complete piece of music, not a few great ones pasted together with a lot of filler. In order to love this album, you need to appreciate Barrett as a person, and appreciate his latent insanity. This is the key to growing on the crazed artist. Experience Syd Barrett, do not listen.
B00005UOKM|5.0|This CD, long out of print, is among the best avant-garde CDs put out by Blue Note records in the mid-60s -- right up there with Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch and Andrew Hill's Point of Departure.  All 3 albums have the same exploratory, progressive attitude without forsaking swing or the blues.  Things kick off with the demented mambo \\"Catta\\".  Composer Andrew Hill splashes dissonant piano chords over the dance rhythms, Sam Rivers blows fiery lines on the tenor sax, Freddie Hubbard shows off his avant-garde trumpet credentials, and then Bobby Hutcherson provides his spacy, cerebral vibraphone musings.  Hill gets the same twisted, off-kilter feel on the blues \\"Ghetto Lights\\".  \\"Idle While\\" is an eerie Joe Chambers ballad.  The two collective improvisations \\"Les Noirs Marchent\\" (set to a marching rhythm) and \\"Dialogue\\" are among the finest of their kind -- instead of getting into a blowing cacophony, all six musicians listen carefully to each other and the music has a natural ebb and flow.  Bassist Richard Davis's playing holds the enterprise together, stretching and contracting as the music demand.<br />  Dialogue is an essential listen for most fans of adventurous 60s jazz.  If you like Dialogue, there are other Blue Note albums that should tickle your fancy: Out to Lunch (with Hutcherson, Davis, and Hubbard), Point of Departure (with Hill and Davis), Jackie McLean's Let Freedom Ring, and Tony Williams's Life Time (with Rivers, Davis and Hutcherson).  Be sure to pick up Hutcherson's Components (with Chambers and Hubbard) and Stick-Up as well.
B000002OZY|2.0|Were it not for the incredible effort and uncharted waters that Tommy represented, this would be one of the Who's weakest recordings.  The two biggest strikes against it are its terrible production and the contrived narrative.  Keith Moon's drumming sounds like it was recorded in the basement next door, and Roger Daltrey's vocals - so powerful on Who's Next and Quadrophenia - sound weak and thin.  As for the storyline, it's ruined by its best song - Pinball Wizard.  This should have been released as a single (like other Who gems The Seeker, Long Live Rock, or Join Together).  Instead, Townshend bends all over himself to incorporate the idea of a deaf dumb and blind pinball messiah (huh?) into the whole narrative, staining otherwise good songs like \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and distracting the listener from considering the few worthy themes taken on by Townshend.  Live, this material was phenomenal, particularly Wizard, Sparks, and See Me Feel Me.  To be honest, The Kids Are Alright provides a better Tommy listening experience - live versions of the three tracks mentioned above - than the studio album as a whole.  Too many Who fans sit thru schlock like Cousin Kevin, Fiddle About and Tommy's Holiday camp feeling some responsibility to actually like it; deep down inside we know that most of it's crap.
B000021YQV|4.0|this is all i've ever heard from this band.  very fast, very complex, very heavy, and the vocal style is a great departure from the norm.  only 4 stars bcuz its not incredibly deep and mind twisting,  and its incredibly hard to play along w/ the bass lines, but, for a nice rugburn on the old eardrums, pick this one up and u'll be singen along with SOAD in no time
B00005JKGI|5.0|This film is perfect! You'd be wasting your time trying to \\"improve\\" on it, or bringing it \\"up-to-date\\" with Julia Roberts or Lou Diamond Phillips. You've already tried that sillyness with far too many films of lesser caliber. STOP IT! AT ONCE!<BR> There's plenty to learn about movie-making in \\"The Italian Job\\", but, try being creative for a change!
0060392886|5.0|I'm not a fan of Motley Crue (the people or their music) but this book came to my attention through all of the stories I have heard over the years.  As far as rock biographies go, it's a fast paced read.  Motley Crue epitomizes the message of \\"Sex, Drugs, and Rock N' Roll!\\"  So since there are so many other reviews I think I'll just share what I have learned about the band members through their 430 page opus.<br />Vince Neil has the most penultimate tear-jerker in the chapter that deals with the death of his daughter.  In a book made to shock and astonish, this was as touching a moment as anything I have read.  Beyond his love and loss, he comes off like a stand-up guy who enjoys the life style and isn't making excuses.<br />Nikki Sixx had a rough childhood and has so many father-son issues it's not even funny.  While I respect the fact that he's been through more turmoil than I'll ever know...get over it.  There's nothing more pathetic than listening to rock star millionaires pining away about how sad they are.  I guess money can't buy happiness.<br />Mick Mars has the least to say in this book and this left me the most intrigued.  He has battled rough times from personal illness to divorce to just plain being the victim of emotional abuse.  I'm amazed he stayed with the band as long as he has.  His is the true sad story in The Dirt.<br />Tommy Lee...moron.  Here is the epitome of a millionaire jerk who just never learns.  How a guy like this managed to bag babes like Heather Locklear, Pamela Anderson, and Carmen Electra...is beyond me.  Don't expect to learn anything from his chapters except to see a spoiled baby who is used to getting anything he wants, and if he doesn't then the tantrums start...then and now.<br />It's a testament to this book that I enjoyed reading it.  The chapters flow quickly telling each band member's story and author Neil Strauss never slows down.  And unlike biographies by other rock groups, these characters actually have some bizarre stories to tell...and how they survived is beyond me.  While I may not be racing out to buy any Crue music, I'm very happy that I read this biography.ries to tell...and how they survived is beyond me.  While I may not be racing out to buy any Crue music, I'm very happy that I read this biography.
B00000099Y|2.0|I find Tool to be massively overrated both in the talent and music content arena.  As an open minded individual with over 2,200 CD's from all genres, and a musician, I tried very hard to get into this CD, and after repeated listens, came to the conclusion that rock fans simply fall for anything these days!  This disc is nothing but annoying disjointed grunts and blurbs amidst angst ridden chords that are very unstructured and boring.  The vocals are also very weak and mediocre, with no range.  If we were rating garage bands, perhaps I would have given them 3 stars, but given that many fans regard this as rock nirvana, I must conclude that they, and Tool are musically stunted bigtime!
B00001QEE8|5.0|I was watching TJB with friends last night and we all noticed how ORANGE Shere Khan was for the first time...just wanted to add how sharp this DVD is--even if lacking bonus features. This movie really polished up well!
B00005LC6Z|5.0|Halloween 1 was the best in the series, but this is just as good. Sure, it may not have the same suspenseful atmosphere as the first, but it's that kind of movie that never has a dull moment. I was surprised at how good this movie lived up to the original. The body count was a little high, but it doesn't really get in the way of the plot, which most high body count movies have a problem with.<BR>This movie continues the original. Michael escaped from being shot 6 times and has tracked his sister down to the hospital and the doctor's and nurses become Michael's newest victims.<BR>I stongly encourage anyone who loves a good horror movie to see this one!
B0000057C5|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. When I'm going out I usually play it and get in a great mood! Rammstein have to be considered one of the best bands today and WOW they are great live as well!If you don't allready own it, buy it!
6305878323|5.0|For the past four months or so Mary Poppins has been a life-saver.  If I need a moment alone or my daughter needs a break I just pop in &quot;P. Poppins&quot; (as it is called in my house) and all is good.  My daughter turned 2 in Dec 2001.  Even at her age she can understand the mystical presence of Mary Poppins.  She loves to see her come out of the sky.  As for my husband and I, we could listen to this movie all day long and not feel the need to convince our daughter of a new movie.  We love &quot;P. Poppins&quot;.  It is a classic the entire family can enjoy.
B0000508U6|5.0|this album is the best new thing.  i got it a while back and i am still not sick of one song:<br />1) Don't Panic - probably my favorite song on the album.  has such a sweet sound.  it's short, but it's great.<br />2) Shiver - an excellent, more upbeat sounding, track.<br />3) Spies - a very emotional sounding track.  excellent!<br />4) Sparks - great track, nothing more, nothing less.<br />5) Yellow - the song that probably made Coldplay famous.  i heard this song had lots of radio time, but to tell you the truth i never heard it on the radio.  regardless, it is an amazing song, with amazing lyrics, and when that opening guitar riff kicks in, you can't help but be sucked in.<br />6) Trouble - Coldplay's other big hit.  i just heard this on the radio for the first time yesterday.  it is such a great song, but the piano is what does it for me.<br />7) Parachutes - just a short introduction to<br />8) High Speed - another upbeat sounding track.  it's great!<br />9) We Never Change - great song.  very mellow.<br />10) Everything's Not Lost - great song as well!<br />11) *Life is For Living(hidden track) - this is a short hidden track to close the album, but the lyrics are amazing.  and it's got a great sound to boot.<br />get this album pronto, it's unbelievable.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie totally surprised me and blew me away!  When I saw this movie, I had no idea what it was about and after 20 minutes, I thought it wasn't for me and was about to give up, but I'm glad I didn't.  The story became clearer and the singing and the visual were tremendous!  This movie is one-of-a-kind and one of the most spectacular movies I'd ever seen.  I was astonished of the singing ability of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  This movie is simply a great love story, and probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B00005T30L|5.0|This is the most realistic view of life as a teenager in a nowhere place.  I enjoyed this movie greatly and I found it to be like my own town and it also remined me of my high school days.  One of my favorite characters was the flakey art teacher that tormented Enid about her work.  It reminded me of my own art teacher.  I also liked the guy in the mullet the hung around the local convience store.  It is a funny yet sad movie at the same time.  It shows that even after you graduate high school the world is a cold and cruel place at times and that you can't act the same way you did in high school.  I also liked how they showed that friends can drift apart even when they still hang out at time to time.  I think anybody that hated every high school cliche' should watch this movie.  It is one of the best.
B00005OM4N|5.0|i bought britney's 3rd cd.  First i thought...oh, this is just another \\"oops...i did it again\\" kinda thing...but then i realized it was really original.  here's how i graded the songs.<br />1) i'm a slave 4 u- i think...in my opinion, this is the absolute worst song on this album, which is saying a lot cause it's an okay song.  B-<br />2) overprotected- u'll like this song, then hate it, then like it again.  A/B/A+<br />3) lonely- an interesting song...i like the bridge.  A<br />4) i'm not a girl, not yet a woman- a great song, the longest on here only at 3:51.  A<br />5) boys- this is an improvement over \\"...slave...\\" but it's still not the best.  A-<br />6) anticipating- a cool song...it reminds me of jessica simpson's \\"what's it gonna be\\" and mandy mooore's \\"split chick.\\" A+<br />7) i love rock n'roll- a just OK remake is kinda boring and overproduced.

B00000ICD9|4.0|Sure, this is no Star Wars or Sound of Music, but the questionably overly-fantastic visuals are a necessary and fun way to convey a robust and intellectually intriguing view on the afterlife. I'm withholding a star for it's SciFi-Channel-esque seperation between audiance and characters. This movie was well placed for production style on the SciFi channel, but the content of the message and the effective portrayal of heaven, hell, and the unusual and fantastically beautiful bond between the characters was quite effective, if once in a while a little dry. For me, the moderate dryness of some of the near-monologue descriptive style of the script was made up for by the creativity of the message. While this might have been done better in a \\"version 2\\" with a more \\"blockbuster\\" attitude and a less \\"pristine clean\\" look we're seeing from the boomers trying to appeal to the Gen-Y's, I was positively thrilled to see someone writing down and acting out this version of the afterlife. For me the story of the characters' struggle was no more or less a tearjerker than the theological views being described. The theology alone makes the movie well worth watching. Robin Williams' brilliance shines in this venue, even though the combination threatens to be too lighthearted or a little too SciFi-Channel-shallow.<br /><br />This very sweet story of transcendental love is well worth watching, but by doing so you will run the risk of positively adoring it!<br /><br />I have a second perspective, however, which must be emphasized. The hair! This movie has some seriously top-of-the-line Bob Haircut content! Whoever chose and styled Annabella Sciorra's hair truly knows the beauty of the Bob, and in this case the Pageboy! (my apologies for not being able to give credit by name here) For appearance (and acting) this role couldn't have been better cast! If ever I were to recommend movies based on hairstyles to someone with an affinity for the Bob, this would be one of my top choices. Lots of Bob content, excellently done. If the story and theology themselves weren't enough, anyone wishing to add to the Bob Haircut movie collection could do far worse than to add this one to their library! If you liked Drop Dead Fred, Real Genius, The Professional, The Amateur, or anything with Louise Brooks because of the hair, add this one to your wish list ASAP!<br /><br />+ Five stars for vision and casting,<br />- minus one for SciFi-channel-esque-ness in direction and production,<br />- minus one for some scripting style,<br />+ plus one for the hair!ellently done.

B00004Z459|3.0|The best thing about LP is their sincerity. I've sensed this in every song on 'Hybrid Theory', and it somewhat compensates for the actual lyrics, which definitely need working on. Also, there's a melodiousness not all-too-common in the rock-rap genre that seems to be enjoying great popularity these days. My favourite songs are &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot;. Chester's voice is rather good-- sensitive and vulnerable one moment, angry and screaming the next, as in &quot;In the End&quot;. I think LP will go a long way.
B000062TU1|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a kid that discovers he has magical powers.  He is given an opportunity to go to a school where he can train his powers and make new friends.  Harry encounters many perils along the way and must defeat them with his new friends and his magical powers.  From dragon eggs to flying brooms this is a very exiting movie.  The DVD can only make it better. This is a great movie for all ages.  DEFINENTLY RECCOMENDED!
B00004XONN|5.0|'Kid A' is the first Radiohead album I bought, although I had heard many of their songs already. I have heard that their music grows on you, and it takes time; in my case, it grows more beautiful every time I listen to. These are all fantastic songs, and since buying, I've filled my diary with interpretations of every song. This is music that works on both my emotions and intellect-- and it's a powerful feeling. The songs that stand out in my mind are the haunting &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; and &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot;, and &quot;Morning Bell&quot;. I spent a whole Chemistry class pondering the lyrics, and finally decided that yes, Thom Yorke is saying &quot;cut the kids in half&quot;.<BR>This is a complex, thought-provoking, haunting album. It will always be one of my greatest favourites. In one very inadequate word: fantastic. May Radiohead live on and continue to make amazing music.
B00005UEAR|5.0|this kind of albums, can´t be understood by guys who like the same music all the time, cause this double album, has everything but the same, dream theater has proved through the years how music has to be played, and so they do it their way, giving us always new stuff to listen to, and 6DOIT, isn´t the exception is simply outstanding: the 5 guys are incredible, and i have to say that listen to labrie´s melodies is very difficult to me, cause for the first time he sings different, its seems very relaxed and that´s something i´m starting to like, he´s always singing over the top, ans so in this album, but its sound different and thats something that only the bests could do. the music is mind blowing,there are no words to decribe the feelings the give me with every song, but most of all with solitary shell, goodnight kiss, overture, and blind faith, these songs are breath taking.<br />so if you want to have a new experience with dream theater go get this album, and i can say its great to know these guys will never let you down, they´re the best band out there, and maybe ever; and i cannot wait to see the live here in mexico.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Like I said simply the best solo WU LP out there to date.  Gza provides you with a movie like album that super exceeds it's self.Best song on the album is defintely Liguid Swords.  It's got an amazing intro thats make want keep listening, it sets you up for the whole album.  A fantsy created by Gza.

B00005U2LM|4.0|Wu-Tang Clan has yet to release a true Wu album since Forever. Iron Flag does not have the feel of old school WU but still is a great album. The beats and lyrics are there but it feels like a random collection of songs, the story is not there. Nevertheless Wu-Tang still has the ability to create thought provoking and blood pumping songs i.e. Babies and Rules. The WU record most all of it in New York which made it more of a significant LP for the team of Shaolin. All in all Iron Flag is an assortment of songs which will make your heads bump!
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is an amazing movie, with an amazing cast and an amazing story.
B000003TA4|5.0|In my teens, I tried and failed to resist the Nirvana attack (since liking Nirvana was the &quot;cool&quot; thing to do, it created a bit of a stigma around the band). This album was loathed by baby boomers, who didn't 'get' it (nor understand the words), and today I can see how the youngest generations, being unfamiliar with the basis, inevitably and unfortunately won't see a big deal in a record like Nevermind, but between 1991-93 we were all a bit too lucky to have such a fresh-sounding, unbelievably energetic, and downright GOOD album to relate to (Milli Vanilli, Vanilla Ice, Paula Abdul, New Kids on the Block, Extreme, anyone??).<br />Kurt Cobain had terrible diction, some of it probably on purpose just to screw with people, but his songs were simple, melodious, unpretentious, right-to-the point, and always filled with emotion. Oh and he wrote great lyrics and had a gorgeous, varied voice.<br />I am writing a review of this because I find it my duty to recommend this album to others. Every now and then I decide to pop Nevermind in the CD player and when I do, I feel like a screeching, crying, girly Beatle-mania-type fan. And I can still remember where and when I first heard each of the album's 12 songs (allow me to not count the &quot;hidden&quot; track, I didn't get it until way later). <br />Sure, there are standouts among these 12 songs, mostly opinion-related: Smells Like Teen Spirit-- duh! This is one of the best songs ever written, and Kurt probably just pretended he didn't like it; Lithium-- my personal favourite; Come as you are-- another classic; In Bloom-- the first song I heard; Breed-- which blew my ears off the first time I heard it; On a Plain, etc., but whatever your taste not a single one of these songs is poor. <br />I am trying very hard to be objective and not to diss today's bands. There are quite a few good bands out there today. But looking and listening to them, I can tell many of them were more than obviously influenced by Nirvana, and Nevermind deserves the biggest credit for that.<br />PS: While I'm here I might as well recommend Unplugged in New York and In Utero too. They are both very different from Nevermind, and both are VERY good. Likewise, check out the bands that influenced Nirvana, Pixies probably being the best one.
B00005U122|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I was one of those who thought it arrogant of Waters to try and unilaterally disband Pink Floyd.  And I was (and still am) glad they went on without him.  But I must say that after watching this DVD it becomes clear that Waters was the one with the creative vision for the band.  This concert has a certain vitality that seems to be lacking in the glossier Thunder and Pulse videos.  I even liked the concert's emphasis on the music rather than the light show.   And the cuts from his post Floyd era come across surprisingly well.  I say this as someone who never cared much for Roger Waters' solo efforts.  Of course it's always been apparent that Pink Floyd never had the same lyrical depth after Roger left the band.  However the contrast seems greater in light of this video.<br />If Roger Waters was trying to make a point - Okay, I've got it.  Point taken!
0345350499|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I didn't enjoy myself entirely while reading Mists because there are times when the language was too much for me.  But then something would grab me.  Something about the humanistic traits of the characters.  Every one of them has some demon that they have to deal with, either emotional, religious, or in dealings with other people.  <BR>Morgaine became a real person to me, and I wish that I could have a real conversation with her, just to get her insight on what life is like.  Her tale is one of love, vengeance, anger, happiness (though it is few and far between), and prophecy.  Who could ask for more, eh?  But in all seriousness, if Marion Zimmer Bradley was still alive, I would be the first one in line to have a simple conversation about the magic that this book is.
B000002JS8|5.0|This album is a true classic. HIGHWAY TO HELL is the last AC/DC album to feature Bon Scott on vocals before his death a few months after its release. The album starts off with the classic title track that is full of energy and great riffs. After that, the album is full of energy that the listener will enjoy listening to. Standout tunes on this album are GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, WALK ALL OVER YOU, TOUCH TO MUCH, SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES, and NIGHT PROLWER which is a great blues/metal song. I think 2 underrated songs from this album are GET IT HOT and IF YOU WANT BLOOD. I think this album and BACK IN BLACK are right up there as two of the greatest albums ever to be made, one being the end of an era, the other the beginning of one. I dont think any rock fan will be disappointed in owning this album. Highly recommended
0440211727|5.0|The story of the book is amazing, the people doesn't judge a person, judges a human race, and that you can see at the end of the book, is one of the best ends I ever read.
B000002JS6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK is a classic rock album that is a must for all music fans to own. The band introduces a new lead singer following the death of a legend, and not only do they came back, they make a killer album that forever will stand the test of time.  Song for song, from HELLS BELLS to ROCK AND ROLL AINT NOISE POLLUTION, there isnt any filler material or throw away tracks. Every band wanting to play hard rock needs to sit down and listen to this disc and see how it should be done. My favorite songs from this album are HELLS BELLS, BACK IN BLACK, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG and HAVE A DRINK ON ME. I suggest that everyone reading this review go out and buy this disc now
6305426651|5.0|Often you will go to the theater and watch a movie and be entertained for 90 minutes, only to forget most of what you have seen within a week. Love it or hate it you will remember \\"Life is Beautiful.\\" This is a masterpiece. The writing is superb. Every element of the story is connected masterfully. Think of the key, the horse, the hat, the riddle and the fact that Joshua does not like to take baths; each of these is used by Benigni to move the plot along.     As for those who say the movie sugarcoats the Holocaust, I think they may have some merit to their argument in that there is truly nothing funny about the Holocaust, but I do not think Benigi overlooks the horrors of Holocaust life entirely. Guido's main intent was to protect his wife and son. He was going to do anything to accomplish this goal, even the outrageous and the humorous. Yes, it is true that most children were killed immediately upon reaching the concentration camps, but if we remember that Benigni called the movie a fable, we should try to overlook this one discrepancy. A fable has at its core a moral or a lesson to convey to us. What was Benigni trying to say? Was the movie about the Holocaust? Yes it was, but it was also about sacrifice and what one man can and will do in the face of cruel and inhuman conditions. He wanted to shield Joshua from the horror around him. Guido thought that by making everything a game, Joshua had the best chance for survival. Remember the look on Guido's face when he first walked in the barracks? It was the face of horror. I felt he [Benigni] knew and understood the Holocaust. For example, Benigni depicted scenes consistent with the Holocaust. There was a \\"selection\\" when the prisoners first got off the train. Also, he showed women, children and the elderly being sent to the gas chambers. The scene with the doctor was another example of a \\"selection.\\" The doctor, who was a man he shared riddles with in the first half of the movie, is another casualty of the Holocaust.He appears so overwhelmed by what he has experienced in the camp that when Guido finally sees him he has gone mad, reduced to a shell of a man babbling about unsolvable riddles.    Guido's only goal was to make sure his family survived. I have two daughters, and if I am one-half the father that Guido was to Joshua, I will think of myself as a successful parent. Guido, to me, was a hero, not a buffoon as some reviewers are apt to state.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|The best collection of songs I've heard in at least twenty years.  It's about time that people realized that Bob Dylan is the best songwriter of the last fifty years (that list includes Lennon/McCartney).  And how many lyrics make you laugh out loud?  When I first heard Juliet tell Romeo (in Floater)...&quot;Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much...&quot; I'm rolling on the floor.  Dylan has the lyrical dexterity of Cole Porter at his best (In fact, when &quot;Bye and Bye&quot; started the first thing I thought was, &quot;Isn't this Cole Porter?&quot;).  His timing puts the best hip-hopper to shame.  This collection of songs ranges from funny to sad, poignant to mad, and even a great love song that my wife and I enjoy dancing to in the living room (Moonlight).  Throw in one of the great, steam-locomotive rockers of all time (Lonesome Day Blues) and also &quot;Mississippi&quot; (which still gives me chicken skin on the breaks).  I've listened to this damned CD about a hundred times and I still can't force myself to put on something else!  People have always enjoyed disparaging Dylan's voice.  Well, now he sounds like the finest oak-barrel bourbon from the deepest southern woods... like Louis Armstrong at his best.  Ain't no music teacher would like it, but the character of that voice goes to the heart.  If Faulkner became music, this is how he'd sound.  Quit readin' and buy it!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I wanted to say that i loved this cd... i was intoduced to it by my friend and ive loved it ever since! the first time i heard it, i did think it was david grey and his song babylon but it wasn't and u can certainly tell the difference once u get into it. as for the whole dave mathews bit... i am a 100% fan of DMB and i love john soo i think that if u like dave ull love this cd. it is more mellow but its nice to relax to and his lyrics r great...i like to listen to it while i fall asleep...
B00003CXTG|1.0|First,the special FX are indeed spectacular.Tucked inside this 3-hour movie is about an hour's worth of special Fx bonza.These scenes are quite literally jaw-dropping.It almost takes the other two hours of sappy love story worth the trouble.With a 135 million dollar budget and great topic,you would've thought Disney had a gauranteed hit on its hands.Unfortunately,all they had was a huge 135 million dollar blunder.The script is atrocias--it's hard to believe this form the same writer as Braveheart.Not even the trio of hot young hollywood stars can make you overlook the horrendous dialogue and the one dimensional cardboard out out characters in this movie you'll find some of the most cringe-worthy lines you could possibly image.It's hard to image how these actors were able to keep a straight face while reciting great lines.Needless to say,you'll get to hear more of these little gems during the movies 3-hour run.At one point the paralized FDR stands up from his wheelchair and utters&quot;Don't tell me what I can't or cannot do.&quot;Its moments like these where you just laugh.
0792835700|5.0|This one was released in 1954 relatively near the end of Arthur Freed's reign as producer of most of MGM's top musicals of the 1940s and 1950s, and towards the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  At the same time, it holds up pretty well, and in many regards is a stellar example of musical moviemaking.  Although it was transformed into a dance- rather than a song-based musical to capitalize on the wonderful talent of Gene Kelly (and, for that matter, Cyd Charisse), the beautiful score survived, for the most part anyway.  \\"Heather on the Hill\\" gets the full Freed/MGM/Minelli treatment, as does \\"I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean,\\" and, of course, \\"Almost Like Being in Love.\\"  But several songs from the original stage musical didn't make the cut.  This is really a shame because, judging from the soundtrack album released on Rhino Records, they are very nicely sung and orchestrated, and probably would have added a lot to the movie.  But you can always check out the soundtrack album to see -- well, actually, to hear -- what you're missing, and imagine \\"what might have been . . .\\"
B00003CXTG|5.0|After seeing this movie two times,I believe it's one of the greatest movies of the year.The action,special effects,and musical score are top-notch.The love story was captivating,and the casting was teriffic.The director did a great job of republicating Pearl Harbor circa 1941.I brought the DVD,and plan to watch it again and again.Whether or not it's historically accurate is not critical.The theme of the story does an excellent job of conveying Japan's surprise attack on Dec 7th,1941.Few movies compare to the impact and quality of this film.A high recommendation for only for any movie goer.My whole family loved this movie.
B00005221L|5.0|From the director of Die Hard comes one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies.  Predator is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.  The scene where the predator is chasing Arnold and he covers himself with mud and clay so that the predators infrared vision doesn't see him is probably the scene that I find most memorable, but the whole movie is filled with great parts.  Look for Governer Jesse Ventura as a big, gun-toting part of Arnold's team.  The predator is a really cool villain, too.  He's got cool weapons, and he can walk around in \\"stealth\\" mode so that he's nearly invicible.  <BR>The DVD however, is sorely lacking any special features, unless you count some theatrical trailers (which are pretty cool, I have to give them that).  The good thing about the DVD is that it IS in widescreen (all you people who hate widescreen don't know what you're talking about-watch the Why Letterbox? featurette on the Die Hard (Five Star Collectio) if you want to know more about it), and it is in DTS Surround Sound.  You haven't seen it this good since it was in theaters!  <BR>In response to the reveiwer from SF, the Predator technically was not played by Jean Claude Van Damme.  He was supposed to play the \\"invisible\\" Predator scenes, but quit after two days of filming because he didn't want to play an uncredited special effect.  Kevin Peter Hall played the predator.<BR>A must buy for anyone into Arnold or action movies.  (Check out Predator II with Danny Glover).
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a great movie.I know Pearl Harbor has received bad comments from the critscs,but I don't care what they say.This movie had everything.Good acting,gorgeous actors,cool Fx's.I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.
B00005UEAR|5.0|As with other DT fans, I was anxiously awaiting their latest offering. Especially after the &quot;Scenes&quot; overload we had with the DVD and then the doubledisk live DVD. I was ready for something new. And did I get something new!<br />Disk one is vintage DT at their best. I sensed something however, a strange presence that I had not felt since..........anyway, back to the review. Full fledged attack with the first disk and I played it atleast 5 times before ever getting to the second disk.<br />Now for the second disk. Remember that presence I felt on disk one? Well, I started feeling that presence again on disk two, this time much stronger and more prevalent. Then it struck me. DT had incorporated melody. Not just fanciful melody, but very strong and absorbing melody in their songs on disk two. I was totally blown away. If the first disk gave me what I expected, disk two helped to cement that DT is my favorite band. <br />I can not rave enough about how well DT has grown since 1988. To think that the group I discovered so long ago has matured to this point is mind blowing. Their music has stayed powerful and constant, yet always encorporates a sense of freshness to each recording.<br />With &quot;Six Degrees&quot; DT touches on political topics, not preaching one side or another, but presenting an argument from both sides. They are not here to preach to us, but act as witnesses and surveyers of the land. Once again we are given depth of lyric. This time around the lyric and music writing is not limited to one or two members, but the whole band has contributed individually to the creation of each song, further solidifying their growth. <br />Fantastic job gentlemen.
B00005R2M3|5.0|i've been hearing and seeing clips about Shakira for the past two years and I've always thought she was interesting.  Would have wanted to buy her albums sooner, but her CDs  weren't available locally. Then comes Laundry Service, her first U.S. released album, and therefore, first globally released album...WOW! Makes me wanna scream, \\"What took those U.S. record execs so long to realize that Shakira is one talented rock star that the world would be nuts about?!\\" <br />There's a great variety of music here.  People like to dump her in the Latin music catgory, but her talent touches other influences such as Arabic, punk rock and techno.  All the tunes are catchy, most of them danceable, and everything definitely unforgettable.  She makes  music albums by other artist seem boring and plain. <br />My favorite tracks are \\"Ojos Asi\\", \\"Suerte\\", \\"Te Aviso Te Anuncio\\" and  \\"Rules.\\"  What I love about this girl is that when you've just about figured out what genre she belongs to, her next track blows you away with a new style and arrangement that you think you're listening to another singer.  Simply amazing.   <br />Don't be fooled with her new blonde locks and apron blouses...that's just a marketing ploy so she can be easily introduced to a mainstream public that is used to Britney crap.
6305263248|3.0|You'd think the combination of Robert DeNiro and action/thriller director John Frankenheimer (\\"Grand Prix,\\" \\"Seven Days in May,\\" \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\") would give audiences a thrill ride to remember. Unfortunately, that's not the case. <br />A potentially intriguing idea falls short of real satisfaction. In the post Cold War era, former agents, smugglers, spies, mercenaries and the like stay in business by selling their services to anyone who needs a job done discreetly and quietly-with no questions asked. Like the masterless samurai of old (hence the title), these individuals are men and women without a country, with no ties and often no loyalties. A loose group of mercenaries--American, Irish, French, etc--is offered substantial money to transport a briefcase--contents unknown--to a client. But other seek to capture the briefcase, and there may be treachery in the group's midst. <br />There's really no character development, mostly short snippets of personal information that's supposed to pass for substance and motivation (although money motivates them all), and there's not much story to fill the spaces between some truly hair-raising and dynamic car chases (a Frankenheimer specialty; see &quot;Grand Prix&quot;). The performances aren't bad, with DeNiro making his character moderately interesting. The always welcome (and often underused and underrated) French actor Jean Reno provides the best performance, giving his character a certain cocky confidence. A few other action segments may hold a viewer's interest, and there are a couple of twists near the end. (Sharp observors may see them coming, though.) But there's so little else to hold the film together that one may become bored waiting for the next chase or shootout. <br />Ultimately, \\"Ronin\\" disappoints, though there's enough<BR>action and intrigue to provide decent entertainment. The chases alone--especially the one on the narrow mountain road--are worth the price of the movie--some stunt coordinator certainly earned his pay! See also Luc Besson's &quot;The Professional,&quot; and fans of &quot;Ronin&quot; may also like &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;The French Connection,&quot; both known for action, intrigue, and fantastic chases.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Though this was a slow paced movie, in my opinion, it was very well written and all of the characters combined made this film receive a 4/5. <br />Billy Bob Thornton plays a depressed married man who is second-chair in a Barber shop. Quite content at cutting the hair off people without the 'razzle-dazzle' in which his brother-in-law Frank does superbly ( played by Michael Badalucco ), he suddenly is pushed into a surreal situation. A bald buy walks into the shop wanting a trim and there begins his story of an unparalleled series of mishaps. <br />It is heavily narrated by Ed Krane ( played by Billy Bob Thornton ) and it is obvious as to why it is so at the end of the movie. Without giving anything away, it will make perfect sense why this is the case. <br />Set in the 1940's and filmed in Black and White, it is uniquely filmed and has a great character base. Everyone has a roll to play in this movie which helps it unwind and unravel as time goes along and each putting in a performance which generates a true interest in the movie. <br />Some people may not like this movie and I probably wouldn't blame them. It starts off very slowly and doesn't really pick up the pace, however, given that the script is written to perfection it does compensate itself well. <br />Finally, it is one of those movies you either love or loathe. I liked it and I'm sure many will - but comsumer beware. If you're after some type of black 'n' white gangster movie with guns and cars then think again. In fact, don't bother with this movie if your thinking is like that. It is well written with a dark insight to a man who just was in the wrong spot at the wrong time - so it would seem. <br />Overall, it didn't really have the climax I was after at any time during the movie, however, I'll definately give it 4/5. Absolutely fantastic..!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|i think this is great album it has a variety of styles of music and a unique sound.  i really don't think they are selling out, if they've changed they're music and more people happen to like it i do not say that is selling out.  anyway i liked every song on this album and it is deffinetly worth buying.
1558908846|3.0|I have to admit that this wasn't the best movie I've seen - nor the worst. A nice and round 3/5 is the best I can do for this movie.<br />Having said that it really wasn't my \\"cup of tea\\". You either enjoyed the futuristic set or you didn't. Funnily enough there were some great moments in this movie and Sly Stallone rips off a few good one liners like: \\" I am the law..!!\\".  Then again, that may well be showing my sense of humour but nonetheless this adaptation of a comic book strip back in the 70's probably done it a fair amount of justice.<br />It seemed like Judge Dredd was the be all and end all of the law in this futuristic metropolis. Although a little far fetched for my liking the fact that Judge Dredd had the power to decide what punishment was deemed approprate at the time made it a somewhat amusing to watch. Maybe, for me, it was a typical Stallone performance ???<br />Anyway, I didn't really like the movie but I did enjoy parts of it which bumped up the rating. I can relate to anyone who'd give this a thumbs-up for it and can definately understand anyone giving it a thumbs-down. <br />Overall, it wasn't all that interesting but, then again, I've seen worse. 3/5.

Macy) and his wife (Actress Tea Leoni) on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, InGen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures.  But when they are terrifyingly stranded, Dr. Grant discovers that his hosts are not what they seem, and the island's prehistoric inhabitants are smarter, faster, fiercer, and more vicious than what he has imagined.
B00005U1YO|2.0|The Chemical Brothers have always been adept at repeating themselves. &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; was a masterpiece of the big-beat style, and &quot;Surrender&quot; repeated its style. This year's &quot;Come With Us&quot; does the same thing, but while &quot;Surrender&quot; was derivative in an endearing way, &quot;Come With Us&quot; is just boring.<BR>To be fair, the Chemicals did basically invent this style and thus should be given credit for their countless attempts to perfect it. However, &quot;Come With Us&quot; could easily be switched with any of the Chemicals' other CDs, and could even pass as a less excellent rough cut of &quot;Dig Your Own Hole.&quot;<BR>The tracks on the record range from the excellent (&quot;Star Guitar,&quot; &quot;The Test,&quot; the title track) to the fair (&quot;It Began in Afrika,&quot; &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;) to the just poor (&quot;Pioneer Skies,&quot; 'My Elastic Eye). It seems almost as though the Chemicals' decided to sit down in the studio and throw together a slapdash collection of their favorite samples, and add &quot;mesmerizing&quot; keyboard riffs.<BR>After two masterpieces, it is excusable for the Chemicals' to make a blunder. Let's just hope that they've got back up for their next record.

B000006045|5.0|When listening to Massive Attack's Mezzanine, \\"disturbing\\" is the first word to come to mind. \\"Dark\\" does not do justice to its surreal, vibrantly psychotic sound. I think of Mezzanine as the soundtrack to a nightmare-one of those really scary life-changing ones that you only have once or twice in your life. This album is literally disturbing on every level, but there is something mesmerizing about its ability to consistently scare the hell out of you. It buries itself in your subconsciousness and doesn't let go. It's not just the slow, thumping beats and ambient noises that make this so odd-the eerie voicework and lyrics are the other half of the dark journey that is Mezzanine. The album kicks off with the surreal, mind-bending \\"Angel\\", which features Horace Andy's disturbing voice (which, I must admit, gives the song a huge impact). Next up is my favorite, \\"Risingson\\", the lyrics of which get more and more incoherent as it goes on, (and even when you do understand them, they're so bizarre you think you heard them wrong-\\"see you go down / to the men's room sink / strange that we talk / how the madmen think\\") yet at the same time being probably the most memorable of any of the songs on Mezzanine. \\"Teardrop\\" features Liz Frazer of Cocyteau Twins fame, whose voice, though beautiful, holds a very dark energy all its own. Perhaps the most breathtakingly surreal (and definitely one of the best done) of all of the songs is the title track, Mezzanine, which never quite builds to a satisfying crescendo, instead thumping and swirling around your mind for what seems like forever. Its sterile, liquid sound fills in the world around you in a way you never notice until it's EVERYWHERE.<br />Mezzanine is not for the faint of heart. It will most likely scare you far more than you think it will, but it's so amazingly enticing that it's hard to let go once the dark roar of \\"Angel\\" fills your head. By the time you get to \\"(Exchange)\\", the last track, you'll wonder where you are. . .turn off the lights, put on a good pair of headphones (which are required for the most part, as Mezzanine just doesn't feel right coming out of ordinary speakers), and relax. Let Massive Attack's psychosis become your own for an hour. When you wake up from this nightmare, you'll want to go through it all over again. . .
0783227272|5.0|The movie \\"Amistad\\" is based on a true story that chronicles the long journey of a group of enslaved Africans who overtake their captor's ship, La Amistad, and attempt to return to their native homeland. When the La Amistad was seized, these captives are brought to the United States where they are charged with murder and await their sentance. The legal battle ensues and captures the attention of the entire nation, challenging the very foundation of the American justice system as these enslaved Africans fight for their freedom.
B00004W510|5.0|My French Girlfriend has just spent a summer holiday with me in Cape Town. She taught me a new word in Italian - Farniente - which basically means &quot; to do nothing &quot;, just kicking back as the Americans say. Although we both grew up with the same music she didn't know the Band. One day we were feeling particularly lazy so I decided to put on the Band by the Band. As soon as those first notes of Across the Great divide sounded she said, this is Farniente music. I hadn't listened to the disc for a long time but floods of memories came back. There is a stack of great music these days but when you listen to the Band you just know that this is a bunch of old pros showing the youngsters how to do it.

B000021Y77|4.0|If you are a fan of sappy, uninspiring Hollywood crap like Titanic or The Wedding Planner or anything starring Freddie Prinze Jr., you shouldn't see Run Lola Run. Or maybe you should see it. Maybe it will straighten some of you morons out. Look, I am not a big fan of indie movies or European films. I don't even really like Europeans. But Lola is a movie that everyone should see. I was hesitant to see it myself at first, but don't worry.  It isn't a girl power movie and it's not some sick German sex fetish movie. The film is essentially simple in plot and in message, yet it is nonetheless riviting and thought provoking. It is a pleasant change of pace from the run-of-the-mill American film. By straying from convention, the film is able to explore many different elements of life, most notably time. Time is the real protaganist in the film and is always in the forefront. Time is made more evident by the ostinato German techno-house soundtrack. This is one of the few drawbacks to the movie. I may start liking that techno crap if I watch the movie enough. Then I'll start going to techno clubs and raves and develop an addiction to ecstasy. But back to the movie. I can't say much for the acting since I watched the English dubbed version. But the voice over actors were quite good. Just do yourself a favor. Next time you feel compelled to see the latest Travolta disaster, stop yourself, think of my review, and go watch Run Lola Run.

0451196716|5.0|I've grown bored of Stephen King. I believe his creativity diminished as his guaranteed sales numbers increased. As a lark, I read two of his Bachman books to see if the creative juices had returned for these stories. I was not disappointed. The story here involves children walking across America as a national contest, with the winner being set for life, and the losers having their lives ended. A bizarre and disturbing story, but well-written with fascinating characters. Anyone above the age of 10 will know who the winner will be after the first page, but all of the characters grab your attention and the way the boys interact will keep you reading. I strongly recommend this story.
6303617719|5.0|This move, along with While You Were Sleeping and Green Card, is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Although I was never a big Meg Ryan fan, she never looked better than she does in this film. And her ditzy blonde in Paris routine is delightful.  Kevin Kline is marvelous, as always, in the role of the jewel thief with a heart of gold. Great scenery, witty dialogue, lots of humor and the predictable happy ending add up to a enjiyable tour de force. Fans of romantic comedy will really enjoy this flick. This is one that can be enjoyed again and again. Highly recommended.
B00005U18E|4.0|I took the trouble of reading the novel when I first saw the trailer for the movie. After reading the book, I was quite disappointed and had no intention of seeing the movie. Several months later I have finally watched the film and I must admit I was really surprised. Very seldom does a film work better than the literary counterpart than it is based upon. Usually a film either matches the spirit of the original work or falls way short and does a discredit to the text it was based upon. BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is a film that surpasses the book it is based upon. The movie flows much better than the novel and the characters are much more vivid and lifelike (well, Bridget's friends are toned down to a two-dimensionality, but most of them are worse scoundrels than Bridget).<br />Renee Zellweger pulls off a wonderful performance as the title character. It's hard to believe that the actress portraying this British singleton is actually an American, and not only that but a Texan to boot. Zellweger gives an emotional attachment to the character of Bridget Jones that is lacking in the novel. The character from the book is someone that is just as cruel and careless as most of the people she meets and encounters. However, the character in the film is someone that forms an attachment with the audience, someone that is likeable, someone that we cares what happens to.<br />Hugh Grant is perfect as the slimy boss, Daniel Cleever, and Colin Firth is perfect as Marc Darcy.<br />The language in the film isn't as vulgar as would be expected and the sexuality isn't as bad as it could have been either. I found myself laughing more than I expected and was surprised to find that after the final credits had roled that I actually enjoyed the picture quite a bit. A delightful film that makes a great \\"date movie\\".
B00001QEE9|5.0|I saw this movie for the second time last night after a 30-or-so-year gap -- I first saw it when I was a real boy.  When you're a kid you are affected strongly by a movie, and when you're an adult you see why.  \\"Pinocchio\\" is not only touching and scary but a technical achievement on the order of the development of the A-bomb.  Such amazingly detailed draftsmanship, such wit in the character movements!  Like all the great pre-war Disney cartoons it's impressively -- impossibly -- executed but still looks \\"drawn,\\" unlike the HAL-generated 3-D roboscopic video games the studio does now.  You still get the sense of the magic of moving drawings.<br />Only one bonus feature included though -- the 1940 trailer.  Worse, some Pleasure-Island jackass has tried to conceal this by giving it its own page:  \\"Bonus Features.\\"  There are three of these.  One is the trailer.<br />One is a promo for other Disney releases.<br />One is a \\"back\\" button.<br />There's a hypocrisy in a movie about honesty being packaged so sleazily that may not be suitable for younger children.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Perhaps those new to &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, will listen to this and then buy the individual albums that these tracks were culled from. However, it's not a truly inspirational package, apart from the cover art. This band is simply too big for a 2-disc set, and much of this release is marred by the inevitable disjointedness and lack of continuity when individual tracks are removed from the albums. Furthermore, &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Marooned&quot; are edited, and that irritates me. For those who grew up with much of this music, and have or had the albums, this issue is an annoying waste of time, and will be one for completists.
B000002G7G|5.0|After the sonic assault on the ears that was White Light/White Heat, this album was hardly expected. But there it is, 44 minutes of... well, quietness. Every single song on here (even The Murder Mystery) is relaxed. Of course, that's not to say that's a bad thing. Like the two albums that came before this one, all of the 10 tracks are quite excellent (yes, even That's The Story Of My Life and The Murder Mystery). The ones that pop out in my mind are What Goes On, Jesus, Beginning to See the Light, and After Hours. This album also marks the debut vocals of Doug Yule (John Cale's replacement) and Maureen Tucker; both of them sing well, but drummer Tucker has quite a beautiful voice, and even when she's off-key in The Murder Mystery, she still has that charm and cuteness to her that makes up for it.<br />So far, I've bought the first three VU albums in chronological order, so Loaded is the last stop. Hopefully I won't be let down with that album; if not, it looks like I have a real winner on my hands.
B00005UEAR|5.0|The cover art is grimy and enigmatic, intimating a sense of violence and aggression. The album's name is bold and maybe somewhat pretentious. What have we here? It seems to be an open invitation for rock critics to assault a haughty progressive rock band. This album seems to fit every critic's definition of \\"indulgent\\": a double album, the progressive disposition, and a 42-minute song. And it's Dream Theater.<br />Direct your derision elsewhere, critics. This may be a strong statement, but I have to venture to say that Dream Theater's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is the most dynamic afflatus of progressive music since Yes' Close to the Edge. The band mines a rich vein of influences and amalgamates them into something utterly intense and inventive. The music in this 2CD set possesses the devastating technical chops we expect from the band, this time directed towards a more experimental release than was Scenes from a Memory. At the same time, Six Degrees encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty and depth, with an assertive and clear artistic vision that defies any standard the genre has ever set.<br />\\"The Glass Prison\\" will probably surprise a few people. It opens the album with a metal fury of frightening velocity. No doubt the heaviest thing the band has ever done, it is dark, heavy, punishing, and despairingly intense. Because of its pulverizing heaviness and its lyrics (which deal with fighting alcoholism), comparisons may be drawn to \\"The Mirror\\". But this song is far more brutal and poignant (and at 14 minutes, it's twice as long). The song's speed is forcefully carried by Portnoy's alien-hummingbird double-bass, as well as Myung's chiming bass arpeggios. Vocals by both Portnoy and Labrie are fierce, and Petrucci's solo is desperate, shattering, schizophrenic, and shred-intensive.<br />Petrucci also proves he is adept with the pen as well as the guitar. His lyrics on \\"The Great Debate\\" (dealing with stem cell research) are great -- his use of metaphor and cleverly ambiguous phraseology makes him, I think, progressive metal's best lyricist. (Consider the double-meaning of the \\"turn to the light\\" lines). The music accompanying his poetry is equally sophisticated. Samples from news broadcasts flesh out the subject matter. This evolves into fiercely heavy grooves, delicious rhythmic phases and accents (at once evoking Tool and Rush), and slaughtering furies of guitar/keyboard leads. A clever mix puts right- and left-wing arguments on the appropriate side in stereo (cool!).<br />It's been proven that the band is capable of bone-crushing technical wizardry, but they also command restraint and concisely developed melodic progressions. \\"Disappear\\" is the album's shortest song, not quite reaching seven minutes. This one is presented with an avant-garde, Radiohead-like production. It is a frigid requiem frail vocals and the sad, seductive susurration of longing melodies, built around gorgeous acoustic guitar and exquisite pianos. Labrie's lyrics and performance are masterful; I believe the fugitive poetry is perhaps attempting to mask emotions the delicate vocals betray.<br />\\"Blind Faith\\" is an outstanding work of songwriting, musicianship, and vocals. It's one of those \\"perfect songs.\\" The melodies are so liquidy during the verses (with great synth inflections), but it kicks into high gear for an awesome, rocking chorus with a big hook that doesn't let go. There's hooks everywhere, even in the instrumental interlude, which is technical DT at its best. Petrucci plays a simmering, catchy riff which (I think) is on baritone guitar...it's the best! Buy the album to hear this riff. The keyboard/guitar unison part here is the most difficult they've done. Before this, though, Rudess plays an elegant piano solo...he's so talented, and his touch his beautiful.<br />\\"Misunderstood\\" is a very difficult song to classify...it almost passes as a killer rock ballad but it also sports some trippy jamming that reminds me a bit of King Crimson's weirder moments. Petrucci's lyrics about feeling isolated are great in rhythm and metaphors. After the last imploring chorus, the final few minutes of this track are a crazy, dissonant blend of sounds that mess with the head.<br />A full review should be devoted solely to the phantasmagoric and discursive 42-minute title track on the second disc. \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is the band's exploration of mental illness. Each section is devoted to a different person's struggles, gracefully enriching the lyrics with character-specific leitmotifs. This is possibly the band's finest moment, countervailing thrashy metal riffage (\\"The Test that Stumped Them All\\") with more melodic, pop-influenced movements (\\"Solitary Shell\\"). Individual sections show more effort and detail than the sum total of entire albums, but Dream Theater manages to keep everything very concise and coherent. \\"Overture\\" is an exhilarating prelude, formed by a grandiose orchestral section, heated interplay, and stormy guitars; \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" is an achingly sorrowful elegy where Labrie's vocals are at their emotional best (beautiful guitar work too); \\"Solitary Shell\\" is a major-key, hook-laden piece that evokes Peter Gabriel, while Labrie's vocals soar on the power chorus; \\"About to Crash (reprise)\\" is an awesomely infectious anthemic rock piece. \\"Six Degrees...\\" is so intense in music and pathos that it virtually blows me away note after note for 42-minutes, leaving me physically weak at the end. Yes, it is long...but it is not a song (or album, for that matter) of nimiety. I don't think there is one immaterial note or second. Heck, to some Dream Theater fans it might even be considered exiguous -- there is considerable restraint here.<br />All throughout, Jordan Rudess proves he is the most inventive keyboardist in progressive metal. He goes through so many different patches rather than sticking to the same tired strings, organs, and pianos. No one can compare.<br />When a band releases an album so adventurous, it's always a risk that they will create something so self-indulgent that no one will enjoy it. Just remember: Whenever a work of art attempts to transcend the boundaries of its style, it'll likely alienate those looking for the same old, same old. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is not for those who just want another good \\"prog\\" metal album. It is not for those who want another Images and Words. It is for listeners who want to experience the artistic challenge with the band, to celebrate the meaning of  \\"progressive music.\\" There are those who fear that \\"progress\\" makes good songwriting null. Have no worries -- Dream Theater's prime songcraft has been polished to an impossible gleam for this album.<br />Yet again Dream Theater pushes ahead of the pack in terms of creativity and resourcefulness, without ever losing touch with their ability to communicate their sophisticated music to their audience with emotion and sincerity. The kings of progressive metal yet again prove why they are the genre's best band. This release adds another jewel to Dream Theater's crown.s weirder moments.

B00005T30L|2.0|Based on the hype that surrounded this movie, I decided to buy it having never seen it before. I was never a big fan of the comic, but it did have it's moments. Unfortunately I feel the same way about the Movie. It was just sort of... there. I was expecting more wit less dryness.<br />The biggest problem I had with the flick was an inability to connect with any of the characters. With the exception of Steve Buscemi's character and the dude who goes nuts in the convenience store, I found all the main characters completely unlikeable. Now, maybe that's the \\"point\\" and maybe I don't \\"get it\\" and more power to you if you do, but if I want to sit through two hours watching the misadventures of characters I could care less about I'd buy a Freddy Prinze movie or something. <br />I usually go for this kind of schtick, but I just couldn't get into Ghost World. The main reason I bought it was Terry Zwigoff. I loved Crumb, and even though Ghost World wasn't a documentary, I was hoping it would have at least some of it's charm. While it did have it's shining moments, eventually I just wanted it to end. There were very few laughs and the ones I did muster up were pretty strained. <br />No doubt many of you art-house lovers will be praising this one for years to come. Don't let me stop you. But to me it's not enough for a movie to go against the grain. It has to entertain as well. Ghost World gets high marks for creativity, but it sags early.
B00004X01U|5.0|La M continues on a roll.  After her incredible transformation to electronic diva in &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna returns with more electronic grooves, this time with the input of French DJ, Mirwais.  &quot;Music&quot;, the lead off single and title track is a great pop song as well are &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;.  I think this cd is as good as &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, which won Madonna the Grammy for Pop album.  While this one did garner the critical praise that &quot;Ray&quot; did, its still great listening and a good Madonna cd.  I've been a fan since the 80s when I first heard Madonna and I think she just gets better and better.
0385495323|5.0|Singh has put together a wonderful history of cryptography in this book. It includes examples and stories of the earliest, most primitive cryptography, to a discussion on what the future holds (e.g., the effect of quantam computers on code-making and -breaking).<br />Most importantly, however, Singh has made this book very easy to read. Singh is a very effective teacher, breaking down the complicated aspects of cryptography into step by step processes, requiring a very limited background in mathematics to be understandable.<br />Anyone curious about cryptography or espionage, or any other subject of that sort should make this book their starting point, from which they will develop a very good background for cryptography and cryptanalysis.
B00000K19E|5.0|Keanu Reeves never ceases to amaze.  He'll make a huge hit movie, follow up with a couple of bombs and then step into another role and make it a smash hit.  He does this with &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  After starring in a couple of films that were box office duds, he returned to the screen in a movie where most people are comfortable seeing him---action.  This sci-fi treat is filled with incredible action sequences, GREAT special effects and an interesting story that you need to see more that once to catch all its hidden secrets.  The story revolves around Neo (Reeves), a computer hacker, who finds out that the world he lives in is an illusion and has been constructed in the actual REAL world, which is controlled by computers.  A great sci-fi story with interesting biblical references (the character named Trinity, Neo being the &quot;One&quot; chosen to save mankind, as examples) draws you in and keeps you wanting more.  Luckily we have two more sequels to look forward to!  The dvd has some special extras, such as the &quot;HBO Making of&quot;, behind the scene featurettes and more.  I've watched this dvd several times and find something new each time.  It also has a really good supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan or a Keanu Reeves fan to enjoy this film.  I highly recommend it.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I bought this dvd simply by word of mouth and I have to tell you that I was not disappointed.  People seem to view musicals as boring and don't often give one a chance.  This one is worth your time.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both give wonderful performances as well as revealing to us that they both have beautiful singing voices.  The direction of the movie is brilliant and the vivid colors along with the fast pace of the musical numbers give the movie a MTV feel (but better than anything you see on that channel).  The dvd is full of extras (including the dismal \\"Lady Marmalade\\" video, which I won't hold against them) so I highly recommend this 2 disc dvd to anyone.  I hope that we will see a return of good musicals thanks to this excellent piece of work.

B00000DGUG|1.0|I liked her first album a lot better.  I can still listen to it, some 7 years later.  But this one?  Nyah.  I've listened to it several times, and it has never grabbed me.  But others seemed to like it, so maybe I'm just missing something.  My recommendation?  If you can, borrow it before you buy it.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Eclectic, creative, and addictive, \\"Rated R\\" sees Queens of the Stone Age expanding on the riff-driven stoner rock found on their classic self-titled debut. Whereas their prior album found the band using grinding, repetitive riffs for the most part, with \\"Rated R\\" the band uses a much greater variety of sounds and song structures. \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" is fast and catchy ode to drug use, while the single \\"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\\" places Josh Homme's laid-back wail over a driving guitar riff. Other highlights include the trippy \\"Leg of Lamb,\\" the slow and atmosperic \\"Auto Pilot\\" and \\"In the Fade,\\" and the propulsive \\"Monsters in the Parasol\\" (how much pot did Homme smoke before he came up with that lyric?). The use of multiple singers is a plus, as Nick Oliveri's gritty voice powers \\"Auto Pilot\\" and Mark Lanegan lends \\"In the Fade\\" its relaxed air. Throughout the album, QOTSA maintain the garage edge that characterizes stoner rock, without it sounding like it was tape-recorded in a garage. Like its predecessor, \\"Rated R\\" is a great album for cruising around with the windows open and the stereo blasting, or just sitting around mellowing out.
B00002ND77|5.0|This non-fictional movie is outstanding!! It's like 3 hours long, but when you watch it, you wish it was longer. Some people may get offended, but educated ones will understand(mainly, because they'll watch the whole movie). Malcolm X's autobiography may give you more details, but it's best to watch the movie first to get a better understanding and imagination. Also, Denzel Washington plays an excellent role. So to sum this up, &quot;X&quot; is truly an excellent choice.
0784010919|5.0|What a terrific film, not only with great actors re: Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey, but the music is great too!

B00005R2M3|5.0|I own all of Shakira's CD's and find that all of them are unique and move me in a different way.  This album has a new twist because for the first time ever, she sings in English!  While some have called her a sell out or that the lyrics being in English and not in Spanish detract from the music, I can not agree.  If anyone has ever been able to sing one song in both English and Spanish it is Shakira.  For some tracks, like &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, I can hardly tell a difference at all between the Spanish and English tracks.  I find almost all of her songs on this album enjoyable.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys pop music, in any language.
B000002KKC|4.0|Although I was born in the 70's, I started listening to popular music at a very early age, pretending to DJ, so I grew up listening to bands like Foreigner, Journey, Styx, and well, um, Fleetwood Mac. But lets face it. There's only so many hundreds of times you can hear this stuff on classic rock stations that play the same 50 songs over and over before it makes you gag. I'm not putting Rumours down by any means, it's great. It's just been played to death on the radio. Tusk is the only FM album post '75 that I still listen to regularly. Lindsey Buckingham was at the peak of his creativity with the band.  Stevie and Christine have some excellent songs here as well.  The Sara edit is annoying, but the full version is on the Greatest Hits.  After Tusk, in order to really hear LB's potential you must get his solo albums. The first two are way out in left field because Fleetwood Mac wasn't going to let him experiment any more after Tusk sold a disappointing 4 million copies.  To all you young whippersnapers out there who only know \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and clicked on this page by accident, probably not for you.  A friend of mine heard it and his comment was \\"too mellow\\".  Oh well, I like Christopher Cross too.
0953104907|5.0|If we waited for a book to be perfect, they would never be finished. This particular book, however, is as close in its genre as could be found. It covers everything you need to know, from how to determine the spacing of frets, to how to wire your electronics, to how to install truss rods. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject. Prior to reading it, I was frankly just scared of working on my own guitar. Although I don't have immediate plans to build my own, this book has given me the confidence to make modifications to my current one and to realize that many of the people who have worked on my guitar knew far less about what they were doing than I now know. <br />The book does assume that you have some basic skills in woodworking and electronics; it would be unreasonable to expect the author to teach you this also. Yet, the author does provide valuable and appreciated tips and pointers in these areas regardless. He pretty much covers it all.  Over and over again I found myself thinking &quot;thank you!&quot; to the author for the information - buy this book, you won't regret it.
B000005S37|4.0|Yes, I decided it was time to Re-mix this album with a Tandy (Radio shack for you fussy kids) 4-track. Much more fun. I hear new sounds every time i play this.   made 6 tracks with actual melodies! Yes, buy this for Gardening, for re-mixing, if you're in a band and want something avant-inbetween tracks, you know.<BR>I added vocal to the remixes. yep. This actually inspired me to do my own version, with my Casio and EMU Drumulator. You'll love it, if i can find a record label, it'll be out next spring.<BR>PLASTIC GARDENING MUSAK.<br />All in all, this record is good for bathing to.
6304806426|4.0|The beauty in the filming this destined to be classic movie, wraps you in the feeling of flying over the open desert, the sands of the Sahara in an open-cockpit plane. You live the adventure of exploring and mapping Africa, feel the freedom of the men who lived it and the frustration of pointless nation-state borders over an endless rolling land.<br /> The myriad of contradictions in the modern era lay the backdrop and irony for this intricate and enticing film. It is poetic, it is sarcastic. It is time well-spent.
0792836634|5.0|Just watched this again recently and was reminded how freekie a ginger haired doll can be!!!<br />Genuinely scary to watch and the intense atmosphere builds throughout. Also, some of the most weird but wonderful death scenes:<br />1) Hammer smashing head, fall out window and smash into car roof <BR>   on street below. MMMmmm Very Painful- 8/10<br />2) Voodoo Mans death by arms ripped from the sockets, legs <BR>   snapped like cocktail sticks. MMMmmm Very Legless - 9/10<br />3) Death by electrocution.  Fired like an egg.<BR>   MMMmmm  Very Sizzzzlesome  7/10<br />Childs Play 3 was no way as good but probably had one of the best and sickest death scenes:<br />Chucky thrown into garbage truck. Chucky yells for help.  Trashman thinks a kid is in the trash and climbs in to save him.  Chucky (LUCKILY) manages to escape and you've guessed it......Presses the CRUSHER BUTTON!!!!  Poor old trashman gargles on his blood as he's crushed to a pulp.   <BR> MMMmmm Very Squishy- 10/10<br />We are a sick bunch , but hey, it's only make beleive..........OR IS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0684833395|5.0|I read this book as part of a high school<BR>independent study program. I almost had to<BR>take the course over again in summer because<BR>part of my review of contemporary America<BR>authors included a book-Catch 22-which was<BR>not on the School Boards &quot;Approved Books&quot; <BR>list. When I asked why wasn't it on the list,<BR>they answered that it wasn't on the list because<BR>it wasn't approved for independent study. Hhhm...<BR>what was this book about? To make a long story<BR>relatively short, they begrudingly gave me a passing<BR>grade and I wrote my first newspaper column for an<BR>underground newspaper in Chicago. Read this book.<BR>Question authority.
0385472951|4.0|If you love Grishams style of writing, you will like this book.<br />I like anything he has written ( SO FAR ANYWAY).
0385335482|5.0|What can I possibly say about this book without sounding completely insane? This book was incredibly funny, witty, and I fell completely in love with it! The British humor Sophie Kinsella provided in this book is so much fun, as are the bank letters. If you have ever felt the sensations and pleasure of shopping, this book is for you!
B00005LQ04|3.0|I ended up receiving this DVD set for Christmas this year and was totally psyched.  I had never seen the movie but other fans of the gore genre raved about it.  So I watched it.  &quot;What?!?&quot; I thought.  This movie isn't that great at all.  The blood is way too bright, it looks like paint and there's not nearly enough gore.  I guess as a horror movie it's ok, but the script is still no better than most of these Italian flicks and the acting could definitely see some improvement.  I agree with the other reviewer that gave this a negative review, the cinematography is the closest thing to a redeeming factor in the movie, but it's definitely not enough to make this worth purchasing.  I take that back, the music video of the title track is also really great, it's got to be one of the funniest videos I've ever seen; (foriegn funny) I guess it's Goblin, but it flashes &quot;Demonia&quot; at the beginning and the guys look a little young to be the legendary composers of the 1970s/80s.  I don't think the second disc could have fit on the first, but it is definitely expendable.  The soundtrack is ok, but Goblin put out some better stuff in their days (Dawn of the Dead, (Zombi) Profondo Rosso, Phenomenon....) and, no, there is no track listing or liner notes for it.  The DVD booklet is pretty thick and has some good points in interviews, etc, but I can't stress this enough: rent it.  Better yet, use your money to buy something by Lucio Fulci, George Romero or Pete Jackson: Dead-Alive (funny, well-acted/scripted and without a doubt the goriest movie ever made) Zombie, The Beyond, Dawn of the Dead or Bad Taste.  You can do better than this, so do it!
B00002E23E|3.0|Having seen every major act over the last twenty-five years, The Stones three times, The Who eight times, Pink Floyd two times, Roger Waters, The Allman Brothers Band four times, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney two times and many others I have to say that Led Zeppelin live never sounded even close to their albums. When I saw them in The Garden in N.Y. in 1977 the first song they opened with was The Song Remains the Same, it took me about a minute to realize that. I saw them twice on that tour and must say compared to the other bands I mentioned their live show was a dissappointment. Many times it would take a minute to be sure what song they were playing. Jimmy Paige would be playing three guitars on some tunes on the albums and could not reproduce the music as expected. I did enjoy the shows, but they didn't sound right. A few years ago Paige and Plant hired a good group of musicians to help out and that was better. I used to be a big Zeppelin fan in the 70's but after seeing the other big groups of that time then and now they blow Zeppelin off the stage, especially The Stones and The Who. Unfortunately this is the best video you can get of Zeppelin even though it's only partly a concert film. Jimmy should have hired an extra guitar player to help out. All the other groups hire extra help and they sound great, Jimmy shouldn't have been concerned to share the stage with another guitar player, the fans would have respected it and John Paul Jones could have had someone play bass while he played keyboards. If you are a fanatic and must have live Zeppelin video then I will say that the concert footage in this film will show you what I am talking about.
B00005A46T|2.0|i would give slipknots first cd 4 stars, but iowa just doesn't sound that good to my ears. here are 3 reasons of why i do not care for this cd:<BR>1.) it's really heavy and sometimes just sounds like screaming and people banging on stuff<BR>2.) it's lacking melody<BR>3.) they have have 9 members and only need (use) 4 or 5. shawn, chris, sid, and espicially craig are members in the band who seem to do nothing.<BR>      there are somes things that are good in this cd like joeys drumming, he's an amazing drummer and can use the double peddle faster than anyone i've seen.  i would recommend this cd only if u are a big metal head and like music that just screams all the time.

B000002C1V|5.0|I've just watched Roger Waters' In the Flesh DVD and it started me on this nostalgia trip. So I made some fried mozzarella. If you've never had this, try it -it's bad but soooo good!  That got me on to The Final Cut -suffice to say it raises the hackles and brings tears to the eyes like no album ever. Buy it and tell your friends. It should be on the school curriculum.
B00005QFHG|5.0|It has been a while since I saw this movie but it is still with me.  I had a wonderful time watching both of the movie's underdogs rise to the village/church challenge.
B00005QIPH|5.0|What a cd- I love it. The Strokes' debut couldn't be better- it actually lived up to its' hype. There's just one thing that bugs me about the Strokes- how is it that they can't be reviewed w/o being compared to another band (Ramones, Velvet Underground, etc.)? That being said, they're a pretty darn good band in their own right.
B00005LMBK|5.0|The self-entitled album really speaks for itself, but if you want to buy it; an in depth review by some geek who decided to spen the time to write it.<BR>-Re-Hash: Funny title for an opening track. Opening with the funky beats and meeting the guitar make you feel comfortable. It's makes the music that more real. The blend of electronic music with rock instruments is used throughout the entire album is done well.<BR>-5/4: I hear there's a video for this one now, and I can't wait to see it, because this track is one of the greatest. Starts out with a guitar riff and Smash Mouth-like lyrics, and a grunge beat underneath the keyboard gives the music a moving beat.<BR>-Tomorrow Come Today: The use of the piano and the reverbs on vocals make the song seem really slow. The sliding bass and the harmonica make for a soulfull sound without being depressive. It's a slow song. And it speaks for itself.<BR>-New Genious: A bit faster than the track before it, but not by much at all. Another slow song with those floating melodies. It's a bluesy hip-hop like track with 2-D (they made up the names, might as well use them)vocals making it unrepetitive.<BR>-Clint Eastwood: The crossover track. Once you've heard this song once, you remember the chorus (I mean he sings it like 35 times). Mad rhymes that are clear and unserstandable (sorry DMX), Del really gives the beat a totally different tone than the other tracks vefore it, but darn it; they just fit so well together! Explore the rest of the cd and then listen to this track and you'll appreciate Gorillaz forever.<BR>-Man Research: Coming back down from our pop-phobia track, we experiment a little with the Kid Koala side of Gorillaz. Totally filled with layers of sound, a very interesting song to hear. While it is one of the more experimental tracks and may alienate the first few times around, still a good song once you've come to appreciate the feel of Gorillaz.<BR>-Punk: I couldn't stop laughing when I heard this song! It is soooooooooooooooooo much like a punk cover that I was dying laughing! How true that the track should only be 1min36secs long (NOFX's Monosyllabic Girl: 58 seconds long. How many punks songs are actually anywhere near 5 min? I mean come on!). That's what Punk music is if you haven't ever heard from the genre of music. At least the main sound of it.<BR>-Sound Check: I was toally thinking Linkin Park when I heard this track. The DJ scratch was just a lot like 'Crawling' and it stuck in my head. This is another of the experimental tracks. Starting out with the somber guitar and 2-d's stuttering vocal line ('Gravity-y-y-y-y-yyy') returns near the end of the track again.<BR>-Double Bass: Take it away Kid Koalla. Bass lines and Turn table rockin in the background make this an exquisite track. Throwing different hooks and changing it up constantly, this song has lines of sounds instead of verses. I guess the chorus is the Bass use altogether. Breaks you into what electronica music is like.<BR>-Rock The House: Del comes back for round two in this hip-hop track. This song always reminds me of just a couple of chums in downtown New York or Chicago, freestylin for each other. Dishin' out the rhymes that just run so smoothly, definitely another of the better tracks on the album<BR>-19-2000: Yet another catchy tune by those silly homo(sapien)s. The blip and bleeps are just so hard to not recognize. The vocals are great and Noodle's back up vocals are great. A one two punch after Rock the House: you'll be swimming in musical nirvana after these two. Wait, though, the best is still yet to come...<BR>-Latin Simone: By far, the best track on the entire album for me. The great piano mixed with the ranchero-style song. Once again the vocals are superb and stick in your mind. Keeping with the simple melodies that are just so darn good that you can't stop yourself from hitting the back button to hear that track again. You'd think you stopped at Starbucks on this wild hip-hop/rock/electronic album rollercoaster of an album. Still proving that one group can perform any type of music and still style it their way without losing the overall texture of the Latin jazz feel. Just *sniff*.... lovely (What's the matter with me? :) )<BR>-Starshine: I'm getting dangerously close to 1000 words so Ill sum up the rest. Starshine is similar to Sound Check in that it has 2-d's crying vocals, only there isn't that hardness to it. More of a laid back sad song. Those old school synthesized beats are unique.<BR>-Slow Country: A good song for winding down. It sounds upbeat while being laid back. The synthesized organ is great too.<BR>-M1A1: Once you get through the first min1/2 of `Hello's then you can appreciate this song. The first you hear you're alright with it, but now I just skip the last ten seconds or so of HELLOOO so you can get to the meat of this great song. Has a Rage against the Machine feel to it.<BR>-Dracula seems a lot like New Genious meets Clint Eastwood without the Del. Good track still.<BR>-Suzuki Left Hand Method: The end track and stern reminder that great is only made through experimentation. I don't quite understand but the bong hit probably has something to do with the name. Grunge guitar riffs and hip-hip beats with a Japanese speech about music and progress. Violins play around like junior high Orch, and the piano has fun.
6305922756|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, no doubt. Come on- how can you resist a movie that features, among other things, a bizarre gardening accident, undersized bread, barbershop raga, and dancing dwarfs? To quote Nigel Tufnel, This Is Spinal Tap goes all the way to 11.
0140186395|5.0|The length of the book is long, but I didn't mind AT ALL. When I finished reading it, I hadn't wanted it to end. I wanted to keep along with the Trasks, and the Hamiltons. I wanted to see what became of Caleb and Abra and Lee. The Characters were great, and did not want to leave them. This book has some of the most dynamic characters. Each character had a very important part in the book. I believe that character and symbolism were the most dominant elements to this book. Steinbeck's imagination created a group of great 3-dimensional characters that you didn't want to leave. I liked diging down into the characters, and analyzing their symbolism... Sam Hamilton got me the most by far... and Cathy. The surprises kept me reading, and there were times when I couldn't put it down. Great Great book
0792844890|4.0|This is probably the most hilariously joke-filled Mel Brooks film, contrasting with his more complete films such as Young Frankenstien, which uses more funny ideas and concepts rather than one liners and visual jokes.  Young Frankenstein managaes to be more high-brow and includes an actual plot, whereas this one is joke after joke.  For a good trilogy, purchase Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  Then go buy Blazing Saddles and History of the World if you enjoyed those three.  Don't by Dracula, Dead and Loving it, and if you've done so, burn it.
0783223676|5.0|This movie was spectacular! It was funny as hell. Dramatic, and I just loved the style of how Robert Zemickis directed this movie to make it romantic, loving, caring, and funny as hell. This was a great movie!
B000001Y5J|5.0|This was my first nin purchase and it totally blew my mind! Its balance between the loudness and the art is perfect.  Just take the transition between Pinion and Wish: loud guitar, break, loud guitar, break, loud guitar, drum machine and sfx in wish.  You have to hear it to believe it! And Wish is such an awesome song! Oh my god, any music lover must buy this album.  Trust me, BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
0140288503|5.0|Like the average citizen, I don't know much about military strategy, foreign policy, etc. and was unsure if I'd get a lot out of BHD. But the book held my attention until the very end -- through the epilogue, AND afterword, AND comments in the &quot;sources&quot; section -- the book was 100% accessible.<br />There has never been a book I've read yet where I felt I was there. Anyway, I don't think I can say much that's not already been said, except this:<br />I would advise EVERYONE who's not read the book but has seen the movie to go ahead and read the book. Even though the movie was good, it's only 10% of what the book is, both in it's detail and emotion.<br />What a marvelous book. I regret not reading it sooner or going to any book signings.

0385505833|4.0|If Christmas is a frustrating time for you, then you will really enjoy this book. I've always been frustrated by the commercialization of Christmas, as well as the expectations that I decorate my house, send a card to everyone I've ever met, etc. I found this book to be hilarious, and if you're like me, you will too. I wasn't thrilled by the &quot;surprise&quot; (which is given away in many of the reviews below), which is why I subtracted one star from my rating. Sure, it's not a classic Grisham legal thriller, but it was a fun diversion, a quick read, and left me smiling during another frustrating Christmas season.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I have to give them credit, another epic (and I mean epic) studio released that still rocks. After the live release (which is one of the best live albums to ever be release) I feared the worse for Dream Theater, but my fears were calmed when I went and bought this album. The title track is one of the only 45 minute songs that I can stand to listen to in one sitting, very, very well done. \\"Blind Faith\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\" were absolutely asoutnding, the guitar work in there was insane. \\"The Great Debate\\", though a great song, was not as enjoyable because of the lyrics, just play music and try not to let real life seep into it, music is an escape. Well, if you want to kill 2 hours, listen to this and escape all you need to. A ledgendary work to say the least...<br />-MC
6305364613|4.0|I suspect Shakespeare would be pleased with Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of his work.  The 1968 version of Romeo &amp; Juliet was-- like this-- quite different from that which proceeded it.  (Before Franco Zeffirelli's film, Romeo and Juliet were always played by adults.)  <BR>I am mildly embarassed to confess that when I saw Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet in the theaters, I was profoundly confused.  Aside from reading the Cliff Notes about the play and watching the Zeffirelli film (of course, with the brief nudity redacted)in high school too-many years prior, I honestly did not know the tale.  Having matured intellectually and in the comfort of my home, I gave the DVD a try-- since Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Roughe both pleased me, I assumed I just missed something.  And I was right.  This is extremely loyal to the feel, the fun, the drama, and the tension of Shakespeare.  <BR>Since I am making my true confessions, here is another: I watched it again... with subtitles.  I missed a lot because of the clever manner in which the dialouge is arranged, which, naturally, is foriegn to my ear.<BR>There are only two criticisms I have.  Even though this film has a largely camp feel, Leonardo DiCaprio somehow manages to overract many of his lines.  Indeed, there are two points at which I cringe as Leonardo annuciates exactly the incorrect words; yet reveals an I-am-so-smart gleem in his eye.  The second is merely of the DVD.  It teases you with &quot;Special Features,&quot; only to discover that the only feature is the trailer.  This is disappointing.  Features, being plural, certainly made me expect something more.  Probably more relevant was my recent purchase of the Moulin Rouge DVD, which was so jam-packed with extras that I have spent hours wading through them and am not finished.  Something more here would have been nice.

0140143505|4.0|This wonderful book on the love of books and the love of selling books is heartwarming and absolutely charming.<br />Easily read (the format is a series of letters) and absolutely enjoyable. I could actually imagine Helen`s apt as well as the bookstore in England.<br />My only complaint is that they could have inserted more letters. The gaps between them was quite large at times.
0452282152|5.0|This book is one of the latest of our book club picks.  I was excited to finally read it.  It is not disappointing.  It is a simple book in many ways, though in only 200+ pages you realize how much you have learned about such a different time.  You will love Griet for her spirt and grit.  She will take you inside I painters mind.
0671027344|5.0|Someone else thinks like I do?  After reading this book the first thing I said to my best friend was \\"isn't it great when you find out that you arent the only one who thinks some things?\\"  As I read each line I found myself astounded at how simply yet beautifully life was described. It's a wonderful book. I even loaned it to my mother to read, and she loved it just as much as I do.
B000000OPZ|4.0|yes Terry from down the street is absolutely right! how did u know this?<BR>the whole set is great, Metal meets glam Hard rock...The songs like here I go again, still of the night, is this love are timeless. I love this one.<BR>we ever asked Mr Coverdale on his web site. He explained us that the thunderous guitar riff on the title \\"Still of the night\\"  came originally from the guitar maestro MICHAEL TOENST, when Coverfly was a member of Deep Purple in the 70's. Many Zeppelin fanatical fans thought that he had stolen from PLANT voice. Not it has nothing to do with that! Coverfly said to John Sykes to mess the old unfinished riff of long time ago guitar hero blackmore. And the result here is great.......a must for Deep purple and beertogenstrom fans.
B00005QG9J|4.0|after purchasing this cd I was excited to listen to the band I had come to konw and love. But upon putting it in I found that I was a lil dissappointed in it. So I just left it and listened to a few of the songs I liked. And soon I found I started to like it even better. suddenly there were more songs I liked and I like them better than before.I guess they just grow on you. All in all I was quite pleased with the cd. And found it one of the necities in my easy listening collection.
B00005UEAR|3.0|After the concert in Oslo the 28th of January and the quality of DT's latest releases, I was expecting this to be a great record.<br />Tracks like The Glass Prison and Disappear are indeed excellent, the former with portions that are reminecent of early Metallica, the latter one of the softer songs on the CD, but perhaps the best such since Lifting Shadows Off A Dream from Awake.<br />However, The Great Debate drags the first disc down. Dream Theater have never been particularly strong with lyrics, and the stem cell debate is one I think they should not have tried to handle. Four point five stars.<br />Disc two, however, is an utter disappointment. Overture 1928 from SFaM was excellent, as was Erotomania on Awake and Hell's Kitchen on FII, but this is just bad. Meanwhile, the intro to About To Crash sounds like the boss music from a computer game. Although parties are OK, the sixth degree is in all no more than two and a half stars.<br />Six Degrees is not in any way a bad buy, but it is very variable. Treat with caution.
038533348X|5.0|&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut received my vote in the MENSA BULLETIN poll of the best fiction books of the 20th century.  I still remember the November 1972 day I came across it in the Wichita, Kansas Public Library.  It was a green cover hardback misfiled at the end of the sports books with the games and crafts books.  I surmise that someone filing books thought &quot;cat's cradle is a string game, therefore, Vonnegut's 'Cat's Cradle' must belong here.&quot; I am glad that it serendipitously came to my attention.  It was and is an eye opening and thought provoking book.  It remains one of those books that I enjoy revisiting every few years just for the pleasure of becoming lost in the joyous meditation of reading.  Harlan Ellison thought Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; should have won the HUGO AWARD as best science fiction novel of 1963.  I agree.  More than science fiction, it transcends the genre and moves into literature.  Bravo, Kurt Vonnegut.  Job well done.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams truly comes alive with this album. The first track, New York, New York became famous in the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy because of the prominence of the World Trade Center buildings in the video. However this track is a thoughtful piece about a lover who is not bitter about the city after going through a painful break-up. Other songs of note include Firecracker, a fast paced love song, Rescue Blues and Gonna Make You Love Me. Most of the songs are catchy with their crisp acoustic guitar and distinctive vocals of Adams.
0684859106|4.0|This book is like a time-machine for your tastebuds. All the desserts I've made so far are terrific throw-backs to the days when butter, sugar and cream were essential food groups. The recipes are a HUGE hit with my daughter and all of her friends --most of them astonished at the thought of a homemade treat. Instructions are easy to follow, reliable and yield consistent results. I must say that at this point in my life, most of the recipes are a bit sweet and gooey for my palate, but they're incredible hits with everyone else.
6303407188|5.0|First I would like to say, that I actually bought this film on a whim. I remember seeing it at the time of it's release, and I didn't really remember anything about it, but I've been informed that it is out of print an extremely rare find. So today, when I was in the store, I saw a copy there on the shelf, and said \\"what the heck, It looks good.\\" So, as I am writing this review, the film is just finishing and I found it stunning. You do not even have to had previous knowledge of the worst director of all time (Johnny Depp as Edward D. Wood, Jr.) to enjoy the film. Some of Ed Wood's worst (best to his fans) films include \\"Glen or Glenda\\" and \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\". Johnny Depp gives an exceptional performance as Wood, who after constant disencouragement, does not give up his cause to produce his films. Although it is somewhat of a comedy, it is touching and tender. Although not for all tastes, this film will delight most all who view it.<br />Cast: <BR>Johnny Depp (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), Martin Landau (The Fall of the House of Usher), Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and the City), Bill Murray (Rushmore), Patricia Arquette (Bringing Out the Dead)<br />Crew: <BR>Director - Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands)<BR>Written by Scott Alaxander and Larry Karaszewski (Man on the Moon)<br />Rated R for Profanity, Drug Use, Crossdressing<br />1994/B&W/Touchstone
B00003CXXP|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie I can't recommend it enough, that being said you may not like it, at least at first. But it will stick with you and sometimes even haunt you. I only saw it once and could tell you what happened scene by scene now six months later. It should also be noted for those of you that worship the late mister Kubrick, that this is a Speilberg film. There is no denying that. He gave it to Steven for a reason. There is a depth of emotion and a knowledge of innocence in this movie that Kubrick could have never captured. So, some of you really have to get of your \\"Kubrick would have done this better\\" high horse (you know who you are). I'll leave it at that, no need to preach. Just see this movie and let it fester in your mind for a while. You'll get something out of it I promise.
B000002UAU|5.0|There have already been thousands of people spreading around words of eulogy for what was many many times called the greatest and most impressing gain in the history of discographic industry. Not wanting just to be another boring review on this already well documented subject, if the adjective boring can be aplied to a disertation on such an awesome, heart-taking work, this articles aim is no other than to make public the admiration and profound respect hold by me to the four members of the band who changed both the history of music and the way in wich mankind behaved.<BR>One thing is clear; Sgt. Pepper's was, while a new Fab Four album, thing that guaranteed from the very start a succes in sales, also an album whose lyrical inventions and suberv musical harmonies not lasted too long to turn it into a favourite of music fans and experts worldwide.<BR>This album was, and why should one say was, if it still is and will always be, nothing but an exquisite piece of magically conceived harmonies mixed in a way that could only be acknowledged by a genius of master-mixing art and orchstration, George Martin.  PaulMcCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr surprised the world with this awesome album, bright from the very cover itself.<BR>Having the early Beatles works been mere collections of rock 'n roll simple compositions, albeit some of them great in the way in which were performed, this album follows the line already started in LPs such as Rubber Soul and Revolver. The first albums, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Days Night, Beatles For Sale, and Help!, were followed by a second bunch of masterpieces of brillant compositions: Rubber Soul, Revolver, the so mented Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (wich people put the name of The White Album), Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine, Let It Be and Abbey Road. Two other discs were issued later, Past Masters I & II, putting together EPs songs and many forgotten or strange recordings by these geniuses.<BR>Sgt. Pepper's might be said to be the peak of crative flow in the Beatles Career. No doubt were the following albums, and specially The White Album, also incredible musical masterpieces.  Some people may say that White Album's songs are even better than Sgt. Pepper's. Depending that in musical tastes, it wont be considered here. But the shock that Sgt. Pepper's produced in the whole world is enough to make it the best record ever issue.
0140157352|5.0|This is the first book I've read on the issue of negotiation. The book is easy to read, and the authors use good, solid examples to illustrate the techniques they are teaching. The end of the book, with it's summary review, really pulls it all together. The writing style is clean, clear, and simple, without being so simplistic as to seem unbelieveable.<br />The authors try to show readers how to remain objective in negotiations, rather than letting their emotions take control. The speak of being \\"soft on people and hard on principles\\", the idea of staying focussed on the problem and not attacking or blaming people. The parts I found most useful are the notions of focussing on interests rather than positions, and finding alternatives that will allow both parties in the negotiation to gain something. The idea of moving away from positions to finding the common ground of shared interests is one that is particularly useful in that it can be applied to any situation, be it a parent/child conflict, a work situation, or any negotiation. This concept shows readers how to focus on their long term goals rather than on being \\"right\\" and winning in the short term.<br />I have used the techniques in this book to great success many times, in a variety of areas in my life. They are easy to use, and they work! I highly reccommend this classic text to everyone.
0385334206|4.0|This novel follows the trajectories of the failed science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout and the mentally unravelling used car salesman Dwayne Hoover as they head for a collision at a modest arts festival in the American Midwest.  Vonnegut uses this spare plot as a point of departure for observations on numerous topics of interest.  Some literary gimmicks get in the way of the enjoyment: Vonnegut's habit of explaining commonplace things as though he were addressing an alien with no concept of Earthly existence, and the integration of drawings by the author into the text.  Both would have been more effective had they been used more sparingly.  Nevertheless, this book is often funny and sometimes profound.
B000002IOY|4.0|When most people think of thrash and speed metal they automatically envision Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, and maybe Testament. Overkill should not be omitted from this list. The Years of Decay is a classic Thrash album. Decay would be the last album with guitarist Bobby Gustafson and he and Overkill shine on this one.<br />The opening track \\"Time To Kill\\" is an aggressive tour de force with muted rhythyms paving the way for crunching power chords a la \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" by Metallica. While Overkill lacks the lyrical skills of some bands \\"Elimination\\" is an honest appraisal about the concerns for AIDS in the late 80's and a demand for a cure. \\"I Hate\\" is blood pumping anthem for the angry with a catchy, melodic opening chord sequence and teen angst chorus.<br />Paying homage to the metal masters Black Sabbath, is \\"Skull Krusher\\"  a slow, sludging mammoth tuned low enough to break glass. \\"The Years of Decay\\" is probably the only true Overkill ballad which builds to a sing along conclusion. \\"Who Tends The Fire\\" might be Overkill's Stairway to Heaven featuring clean acoustic passages, thundering rhythyms, and electric riffs. The album ends with the blistering speed of \\"E.V.I.L. Never Dies\\" similar to Damage Incorporated.<br />Guitarist Gustafson employs fast solos drenched with whammy bar improvisation and saturated distortion to complement the very low end of bassist D D Verni and drummer Sid Falck. Many people find vocalists Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth's vocals irritating, but after a couple of careful listens they really do fit the music. This album is probably Overkill's best produced and best sounding effort. The low end is perhaps too much, but the guitar work was enough to catch the attention of transcription guru Wolf Marshall who acknowledged the album as a masterpiece. Dave Mustaine recognized Overkill's talent from the start and put them on the \\"Peace Sells\\" tour with Megadeth.  This is truly a landmark thrash album.
6304708491|2.0|I guess I'm one of those mean people that some other reviewers on this page have referred to.  I didn't like this movie, although I do like the Beatles and enjoyed all of the songs that are featured in it.  I appreciate zany, bizarre humor as much as anyone.  I don't necessarily ask for a comedy to be logical or even coherent, particularly when the filmmakers are shooting for such a quirky type of humor.  However, it should be funny, and the simple fact is that this film didn't make me laugh.  What can I say?
B00003CXI1|2.0|I am a big fan of Harry Potter books. I read them at least 4 times ( each book). I was very disapponted when I watched the movie. It didnt have the same magic as the book. First of all the important events were not in the movie. They made mistakes while transferring the scenes from the book to the movie. I went to see it with my friend who also is a big fan and she also didnt like the movie. The book is for evryone for all ages but the movie is just for kids. I can recommened the movie if you didnt read the book but if you know the book you will not like the movie.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Do we really need one more person saying that the Godfather series represents a towering achievement in American film?  This box set is an exceptional release.  \\"Part II\\" is my personal favorite, but \\"Part I\\" is not far behind.  \\"Part III,\\" despite some ludicrous hit scenes and Sofia Coppola's atrocious acting, is not as bad as many have said (it has a terrific finale).  The extra features are fantastic!  Coppola's commentary is compelling, revealing many fascinating details about the making of the films, the people involved, and his own battles with the studio.  It may be expensive, but the sheer rewatchability of these films and the plethora of extras promise many hours of viewing pleasure.
B00000427L|5.0|I can't speak for anyone else, but for me Vladimir Ashkenazy represents the Gold Standard for performance of the Rachmaninov concertos. The power and sonority he achieves in the first movement of the Third Concerto to my mind surpass even Horowitz. (I notice a lot of reviewers diss Ashkenazy in favor of Argerich, whose version of the Third Concerto I haven't heard. But Ashkenazy suits me fine.) My only complaint with this set is that it doesn't include the Paganini Variations, as other boxed sets of the Rachmaninov concertos do. Otherwise, it's marvelous.
0783229364|2.0|A Kansas farm boy (Michael J. Fox) travels to the Big Apple and rockets to the top of the corporate food chain through a combination of hard work and trickery.  There is not a single convincing moment in this film.  The performers work hard but they are hampered by mediocre, lackluster script and direction.  The result is a standard sitcom situation stretched out for two interminable hours, with a ludicrous resolution.  The soundtrack, which reminds one of the days when synthesizers ruled Hollywood and middle-of-the-road AOR garbage like Night Ranger seemed to blast from every radio, does nothing to improve the situation./
B00003CXTG|3.0|I had been waiting to see Pearl Harbor for a while, with all the hype and all.  I finally have seen it and it definetely did not live up to the hype it created.  The Pearl Harbor attack scene made the movie for me.  For those of you who enjoy special effects of this magnitude, it's worth renting. Otherwise, its a sappy cliche' love triangle story.  Im sorry, but Ben Affleck's character suvives not one, but two plane crashes?!?  That was a little more than I could swallow.  A good rental for me but that is all.
B0000039LE|3.0|I thought this movie was a good classic. the story plot was pretty good and the acting was ok. the movie didnt have any blood and it has some nudity in it. the movie needed abit more action in it, mostly it just showed myers stand in one place and disapear. if you like slasher movies, then rent or buy this.
B00005U1YO|5.0|Right after I bought the CD, I skipped around the album and listened to a few tracks and to be honest, my first impression wasen't great. <BR>When I got home, I decided to just give the album a spin from begining to end. I put on my headphones and just layed there with the music blasting. MAN... this album needs to be heard as a whole because its a whole experience. Its a Trip. And it has to be heard LOUD. Skipping around tracks doesnt do it justice.<BR>This albus is different from surrender because the &quot;dark&quot; feel is gone. It's just weird, trippy, upbeat fun.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I got the soundtrack before I went to see the movie and I'm glad I did.  I got a sense of the movie from it, and of course the motif is very prominent and also extremely important in the movie.  It really set the stage for what to expect in the cinematic version of this much loved book series.  <BR>  <BR>  However, I must agree with someone else who wrote a review on this soundtrack.  The music for Diagon Alley and the Great Hall in the movie WAS different than the soundtrack version.  Not necessarily better per se, but different.  In the soundtrack, I thought the &quot;Diagon Alley&quot; woodwinds were a wonderful complement to the charm of the Alley and the newness that Harry encounters.<BR>  <BR>  Though I really enjoy this soundtrack as a whole, I think my favorite track is &quot;The arrival of Baby Harry.&quot;  I think it transports you to that part of the movie and is very emotional fits perfectly.  As you hear it, you can almost see the dark Privet Drive and the three looking over and holding baby Harry.<BR>  <BR>  The epic proportions of &quot;Quidditch&quot; and &quot;The Chess Game&quot; were classic John Williams and are spectacular on the grandest of scales.  Although I did notice some similarities between this and other Williams' scores, it matters not.  I must disagree with my peers in that I don't think it resembles Star Wars as much as it resembles the Home Alone soundtrack.  It has the same type of motif and celesta (I think) instrument that Home Alone did.  A very good soundtrack to listen to while reading the books or just for fun.  As a final note, I will be very disappointed if this soundtrack is not honored at the Oscars.
B00005N53P|3.0|This band has been hyped so much it could hardly have lived up to all of the fuss. This is a good record, mind you (3,5 stars, actually) but it's just not that great. Some of the songs are very good but I don't like the 'lo-fi' performance 'n' production. I hope they will get their act together and pull out a really great second record. Right now they sound too much like an early 70's rock band, and they're not The Stooges, New York Dolls, Stones, Ramones or Flamin' Groovies.
0679720200|3.0|The title of this book is called \\"The Stranger\\", and for me, it certainly lives up to its title.  By the time I finished the book I felt I hardly knew this character any better than when I first began it.  I can appreciate the \\"existentialist\\" writing of it, but I found the book to be on the verge of depressing.  <br />Camus' style didn't sit well with me either.  It read too much like journal entries or stage directions.  The narration was very clipped for my taste.  The storyline got very muddled and weird when it dealt with what happened to Mersault and the murder.  The reasoning he gave for doing it was just unbelievable and dry.  <br />The book was an interesting change from the norm however.  I did feel my usual reading spectrum was broadened and refreshed by this book.  If you want a look into unconventional human reasoning, I suggest you get this book.  If you do not like unconventional (and sometimes depressing) glimpses into the human pshyche or practically non-existant dialogue, I suggest you do NOT get this book.
0767818040|1.0|Now, there's only one porno star in this movie regaled to a minor part  - the \\"Melanie Griffiths role\\" was originally supposed to go to an Adult Star, but 'box office' and the rating system dictated otherwise!  The Rating system??? - The \\"drill sequence\\" in this movie is still one of the most disturbing and uncesessary 'female abuse' moments seen on film - now, try to reverse this and do this to a guy!  The letters!<br />It's more or less a tribute [?] to \\"Vertigo\\" - this time our hero is claustrophobic, but the same premise - now a struggling actor in Hollywood [where-else?] is conned by \\"best friend\\" into 'watching the wife' - oh dear, shoulda headed straight for the door.<br />MELANIE GRIFFITH playing another kind of 'working girl' - she does have one notable line though [cannot put that in writing - this work just-just borders the dreaded NC-17 or possibly X rating] and she amply [and aptly] assists the hero.<br />The earlier De Palma movies, especially \\"Obsession\\" are very worth-while, this one - only if you must!
0525946284|2.0|This is not Follett's best work. The plot is just not plausible. We have a group of untrained woman posing as commandos. After receiving several days of training in England, they are told to parachute into France with the task of destroying the central communication exchange link between France and Germany just prior to the D-Day invasion. The commandos include two lesbians, a transevestite and a convict paroled to participate in this dubious exercise.<BR>The leader and heroine of this \\"Dirty Dozen\\" type group is Flick Clairet. Her main foe is a German officer named Dieter Franck. <BR>Follett's character development of Dieter and the other Germans reminded me of the people in \\"Hogans Heros\\". They are distracted with fronification (Dieters French girfriend), Dieters \\"migraine\\" headaches and poor communications among themselves.  Additionally, the Germans are constantly one step behind Flick and the French resistance.<BR>The movie based on this book should include Jodie Foster as Flick. Maybe she can bring Hannibal with her to tortue the resistance along with Dieter.<BR>Please save your money on this one and read Pillars of the Earth by Follett. That is an excellent read compared to Jackdaws.
B00003CXCS|2.0|The Wide Screen format ruins the movie - makes it hard to see unless you have a HUGE television.  For the price of the DVD, it should allow you the option of full screen if you prefer that over the wide screen format.  I started watching it, and gave up.  Rather see the VHS version without having to use binnoculars.
B000000W5N|5.0|I'm going to keep this short  - &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is the Rolling Stones' best album, so of course, it's one of THE best albums in rock.   Usually &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; gets the gold medal, but it's really splitting hairs.   If you want your first Stones album to hook you right away, this is THE ONE!  Buy it now!!
B000000WA6|5.0|A lot of people say Siamese Dream is the Pumpkin's best, but this seriously is. I mean, Siamese Dream is great but this has 38 songs and not one of them sucks! You really have to appreciate a band that can do that!
0553579908|5.0|...maybe even one of the best books I've ever read.  I could go on for pages raving about this, but I'll keep it short and sweet.<br />Everything about this series is good.  The story, characters, setting, pace, perspective, mood, etc...  All fit together very well.<br />Characters do die.  Unlike so many other fantasy authors that seem almost afraid to let a character die (Mr Jordan, are you listening), Martin lets everything from accident, assassination, war, or murder act on everyone involved.  He doesn't pump up a select few hero characters that you know will survive no matter what the odds.  <br />This uncertainty is what makes it so fun to read.  You really do have to keep reading to know what will happen next.
B00005T30L|5.0|This should make everyone's top ten list for 2001, this movie was probably less popular than memento when it hit theaters, but hopefully it will do well on DVD.  Anyone who doesn't like the typical teen movie should check this one out, because it is a movie with teens but without the Dawson's Creek type plot.....<br />A+
B000001OAA|5.0|This is definately a great rock CD. The music, guitars, synthesizers and all else are outstanding. Shirley, the lead singer, is one of the best vocalists in rock today. The song &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot; is destined to become a rock classic. My personal favorite is &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;.
B00004U30D|1.0|It is a sad note for our country when this type of sordid tale wins multiple Oscars including Best Picture of the Year. This film is a depressing story about sick, dysfunctional people and their ways of coping. Is there anything uplifting about it? Not that I can see. Do we really need to see a movie featuring:<br />The father (Lester) lusts and fantasizes over his daughter's teenage friend;<BR>The friend (Angela) talks using the raunchiest language imaginable;<BR>The neighbor is a drug dealer who is beaten by his own dad, sells to Lester and has a voyeuristic fetish with his video camera;<BR>The wife has an affair with a rival business owner and ultimately murders her husband.<br />These people and their real-life counterparts need the gospel message of Jesus Christ. He is the only answer. Stories like this are examples of what happens when people go in the opposite direction.
B00005176F|5.0|It's difficult really to fault Blur, although it would still be correct to state that they really have grown consistently better over the years.  Indeed, this certainly shows on the album, that opens with the UK Number 1 'Beetlebum'.  There are also a great deal of their earlier singles missing, although the bonus live CD more than makes up for any missing songs.<br />At the end of the day this is a collection that really stands out, definitely alongside Oasis, who they are much compared to.  There's a good mix of indie influences and cheeky pop with great hooks.  It would be difficult to pick out a favourite although it probably depends on whether you like Blur's pop or indie leanings.  In short though, it's an album of highlights with the large variety of music sitting well alongside each other.  Most importantly though, at 28 tracks, it's a real bargain and well worth getting.
B000062TU2|5.0|The Harry Potter books are wonderful. I like action and adventure books and Harry Potter is sure that kind of a book. J. K. Rowling did a great job on books 1-4. The author put in a lot of fanasty into books 1-3. I must say that in book 3 was really great because, that's when Harry finds out that he has a godfather and Hagrid had a hippogriff named Buckbeak, who is a half eagle and half horse. Well that's for now.<br />From,<BR>Sarah Ragin

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie starts at the end and goes backwards from there.  The main character (wonderfully acted by the talented Guy Pearce) has short-term memory loss and has to write notes to himself to remember what happened 5 minutes ago.  Carrie-Anne Moss is simply brilliant in this movie.  I want to write about all my favorite details in this movie, but then it would spoil it for everyone who reads this.  A small warning: this is not a movie that you can have going &quot;in the background&quot; doing other things, and still know what is going on, but from the first minute till the very end it grips you and will not let you go!
B00000ADG2|5.0|When I first listened to this CD I was blown away by the powerful message in the lyrics. This CD is uplifting and empowering. Its one of those CDs that makes you want to make a difference in the world. It certainly deserves every award it has one. A &quot;must&quot; CD for everyone's collection.
B0000524CY|5.0|This film is and will always be my favourite. Not that this new version has much improvement really, but it's always nice to see the stuff that they left out back then.<BR>The acting of Linda Blair is wonderful, and the others do a great job as well.
6304675348|5.0|It's hard to know where to start with what has rapidly become not only a movie that revolutionised its entire genre but also has become a cult classic.  It has spawned many, mostly inferior, imitators, two sequels and put Drew Barrymore and Wes Craven back on the map.  It starts out with what could possibly go down as one of the greatest teaser sequences in all movie history.  The twist in this horror flick though is that the killer and the victims are well versed in how to survive a horror movie and in the backlog of classics that they often dip into.  Therein lies the trick - if you know your movies well enough then you can survive.  For example, the killer whispers menacingly down the phone that his victim can get away if she can name the killer in `Friday The 13th'.  There's a whole lot of films that are referenced here, not least `Halloween', `Prom Night' and `Nightmare On Elm Street'.  The script by Kevin Williamson is a sure-fire winner with plenty of black comedy thrown in with its genuinely scary plot.<br /> Another thing that sets this apart from other movies is its cast, all of who are spot on.  The majority are virtual unknowns although unfortunately have found it difficult to make a statement elsewhere in the industry.  Neve Campbell as the resourceful heroine is continually astounding, as are Skeet Ulrich as her boyfriend, Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek and Courtney Cox is a role that's thankfully very different from her character in TV show `Friends'.<br />Right from the very beginning the movie manages to subvert its genre with its characters pointing out how clich&eacute;d horror movies usually are.  Most importantly though, it manages to be a hit to both an audience that are watching for pure entertainment and to one that understands its various nods and winks to the genre.  This is not only a classic of horror cinema but a classic in its own right.
0451527712|5.0|Finally, a classic novel that keeps your attention from beginning to end. I think what makes this novel so great is that it is so different then what you originally perceive the story to be about. It's nothing like any of the movies that Hollywood has created over the years. As you read, you find yourself completely in tune with everything that Victor Frankenstein feels. Sometimes it seems as if the story starts to just drag on, but just at the right moment, something new happens that grabs your attention and rekindles your interest! While writing this novel, Mary Shelly left out what seems to be some very important details. This, at first, may seem frustrating! But as you read on, you realize that it only gets the you to use your imagination to create parts the parts of the story that are missing. This actually seems to make the story a little more dramatic and scary then it would have been if Shelly had filled in all the blanks for you. There are some very interesting things going on in this book if you read between the lines. While reading, you must ask your self various questions about why Victor decides to create the monster and is there a connection to this and the death of his mother? I won't spoil any more for those of you who have not read this book yet. All in all, I was very impressed with this book and really enjoyed reading it. It is by no means, hard to follow or understand. I believe that anyone who reads this book, will enjoy it!
B000002VMH|5.0|Annie Lennux has put together a mixture of songs that put out a stong but beautiful message. This CD captures many emotions put to song. I listen to this CD alot. It is just wonderful!
B00000AFWW|5.0|This CD is in the top 10 of all my favorite CDs. Mainly, for the lyrics which are very revealing and honest in regards to Courtney Love. The other reason I like it is the Pop/Rock feel with more emphasis on the &quot;pop&quot;. There are still great guitars but the songs have a pop quality alittle like the Go-Gos. It manages to have that pop/rock quality without loosing a &quot;raw&quot; garage band quality. My favorite songs are &quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Awful&quot; and &quot;Reasons to Be Beautiful&quot;. An outstanding CD.
055352576X|3.0|This audio book of Bill Bryson's is not bad, but the abridgement really hurt it.  The parts in the book concerning Katz was deeply needed in order to liven up the audiocassette.  Sadky, this was not done.<br />It has many great moments, such as when Bryson comments on the idiosyncies of various nations, but the good parts are rather far in between.
B000002NJS|5.0|There really is something about Madonna. Shes still here after all these years, and while her music hasnt always hit high notes, her magnetic personality remains as powerful, overwhelming, and irresistable. Ray Of Light, her best since Like A Prayer, casts a shadow over Madonna, the exhibitionist, the diva, and most importantly, the material girl. If theres any label Madonna hates its that one. On Ray Of light, Madonna spins yarns of celebrity turmoil, motherhood, emotionally frozen men, and death. Doesnt sound like previous Madonna albums. Her last full studio album Bedtime Stories was a strong statement of redemption for 1992's sex- soaked Erotica, but both albums fell short of Like Prayer's revolution; despite a handful of memorable songs like \\"Rain\\" and \\"Secret\\". Ray Of Light's main focus is newfound spirituality; and whether it be a genuine message or the latest trend (Creed, Alanis Morrisette),the words and their accompanying production shine bright. opening with \\"Drowned World (substitute for love)\\", Ray's take on Madonna being in the spotlight is long overdue. We believe she does have issues with it. \\"Drowned\\"'s mix of Everything But The Girl-ish ambience and guitar make for one hell of a Madonna ballad. \\"Frozen\\" is utterly beautiful in its quiet digital love. This is Madonna, so theres plenty to dance to. The title track is good, but hardcore ravers may still snub their noses. Madonna knows a thing or too about dance culture, probably more than producer William Orbit, but shes no club kid with a pacifer in mouth and water bottle in hand. Ray's music holds special effects and houses borderline techno, but this is just a pop record. Period. \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" grabs for every dance formula there is, and while its no \\"Into The Groove\\", its quite accessible and catchy. This is Madonna at her best, spilling her guts on the ode to Lourdes song \\"Little Star\\" (baby's first electro-lullaby) the poetic Bjork-ish \\"Mer Girl\\" where she confronts her dead mother. Really the only other personal Madonna record, this is a must have for any fan who walked away from Erotica and Bedtime Stories saying \\"Is This It?\\"Ray Of Light sheds a new light on the human rollercoaster that is Madonna. Thanks for the ride.
B00005QW5X|5.0|A mutilated cross-dressing East-German gets shafted by his collaborator/lover and embarks on a journey to get his own back.  There, now that the plot is out of the way, what about the movie?  John Cameron Mitchell wrote, directed and starred in the original role (as well as the movie version), which was little more than a set at a drag club.  From there, it became an off-Broadway show, an album, and now, a truly amazing film.  While Mitchell's script is ironic and detatched (albeit very clever), his performance brings a very real pain to the role that keeps it from becoming self-indulgent.  The songs here are fabulous, one of the highlights being &quot;A Wig in a Box,&quot; which ends with a sing-along.  The production values are amazing throughout the film; this does not feel like a first film made on a shoestring, though it surely is that.  The DVD has an EXTREMELY thourough documentary, links to the songs, and assorted other goodies.  A great purchase.

THIS IS ONE ALONG WITH:DRESSED TO KILL,ALIVE II,ACE SOLO,GENE SOLO,ASYLUM,HOT IN THE SHADE,REVENGE,& CARNIVAL OF SOULS. I KNOW I LEFT OUT A LOT OF \\"CLASSIC\\" TITLES,BUT IT'S ONE GUYS OPINION. LISTEN WITH YOU EARS--JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE SAYS THOSE TITLES ARE GREAT & CD'S LIKE CRAZY NIGHTS ARE BE WEAK,DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE. YOU BE THE JUDGE FOR YOU!

0553266306|5.0|This book is brilliant. I chose to read it after we got it for homework in school. I read a few thrillers and mystery. But this book is on my list of top five books.<br />It's about an assassin whose codename is the Jackal. He is hired to kill the French president de Gaulle. You follow him when he brilliantly plans the murder. You see how he thinks, how he choose the perfect weapon, gets false passports etc. You end up liking him and whish him good luck, while you sometimes might want him to fail. How does Forsyth do that?<br />We meet many other characters through the reading, about fifty. Even if they are too many in a book of over 300 pages, it is not quite hard to follow the plot. Who are then the main characters? Well, the Jackal is one of course. The villain is the Jackal, but who is the hero? Is it Lebel, Rolland or Thomas? In a strange way, you find that the plot is the real main character. All things that happen in the book is just analyze of the attempt of murder on de Gaulle. Everything that happens is important and manipulates the ending of the story. This makes the story very complex and brilliant. You won't waste your time reading 150 pages with nothing happening. Every page is important.<br />Read it, or you'll regret it.<br />I will very soon see the both versions of the movie.
B0000042H4|5.0|Wagner, quite simply, was the best composer that ever existed in the history of this universe.  He created an art form that was not music, not poetry, not drama, not &quot;art;&quot; it was, in short, a combination of all of the above, in equal proportions.  I can't quite put it all into words, but I must say that in order to truly understand Der Ring des Nibelungen, and indeed all Wagner, you must study the works in depth.<br />Solti was also a fantastic composer, and certainly conducts this opera cycle wonderfully.  If you wish to hear what Wagner should sound like, and hear an &quot;accurate&quot; yet emotional rendition of Der Ring... then you simply must buy this.

But my 9 year old always bugged me about seeing the other 2 movies again and I could see that he was a big Dinosaurs fan! So I bought the Trilogy set and my whole family is excited about this! They all like to see the Dinosaurs causing havoc! Also the behind the scenes is educational for kids to see how they were made! Everyone loves the mystery of Dinosaurs!
0452282152|4.0|I had not read anything to get me interested in reading this book and then my book club chose it for discussion.  I found it to be a very well written story that I enjoyed very much. I was quite surprised. It is a great choice for a book club.
0671027573|4.0|I loved this book!!  It kept me interested all the way until the end.  There was suspense, action and romance all the way through and I couldn't put it down.  Although I did figure out who the killer was before it was uncovered.  If you are looking for a good romance suspense book to read this is a great one!
630575067X|2.0|I have to admit that I enjoyed the old Star Wars a lot. It was an epic set in space and added greatly to the science fiction genre. And it appealed to all ages.<BR>  I thought Episode 1 was cool when I saw it in the theatres, but after thinking about the plot and how it compared with the old ones, this is a piece of trash and a disgrace to the Star Wars films. This Star Wars isn't an awesome space epic (that even makes you think it really could happen) that appeals to people of all ages, like the the original trilogy, but more like a stupid action packed film for small kids. Perhaps Star Wars is used up, or maybe george Lucas doesn't care about it much more and doesn't put as much effort in it as in the old ones.<BR>For one thing, it is very babyish and superficial.  The whole thing might appeal a lot to 7-9 year olds.  I don't know what George Lucas was thinking when he put Jar-Jar Binks  ( a comical and mentally retarded Gungan, one of the stupidest things about the movie-perhaps to make extremely small children laugh and like it better) in there, ,who along with the lame jokes turned it into an unbelievably ridiculous comedy.  This is fiction and I know that of course this is a different galaxy and all, but I also thought that many things in it were way too unrealistic: the utter invincibility of the Jedi (except to other users of the force), the 15-year old girl solely ruling the planet, Anakin in the pod race thing, (although it was neat to watch), the force being re-defined as a concrete biological phenomenon which makes no biological sense, how Anakin goes into a fighter, has no idea how to use it and manages to become a  sort of war hero and destroy the enemy's mother ship, and the whole plot line from the start about how the aliens want to capture Queen Amidala to force her to sign a treaty. Almost as if to make up for the stupid plot, there are way overdone special effects, and computerized aliens that give a feeling of fakeness to the film.
B000001E3V|4.0|Just interesting to note that Layla, the song and the album, were much enhanced by the presence of Duane &quot;Sky Dog&quot; Allman. Virtually all the unforgettable solos there are by Duane, laid on after the other guys laid down the tracks, if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, here are the Dominos sans Sky Dog, and they sound a lot different but still sublime.<BR>The old foldout album cover of &quot;In Concert&quot; was a poster on mine and many other walls during my high-school days.
B00003CXB7|1.0|Heresy or not, all I can say is that a large segment of today's population must be comprised of nostalgic, angry ex-hippies, if this film can still glow for so many when examined under modern light. The rampant, idiotic sexism and ill-natured tone of the film is just sickening, not because of any duty to political correctness, but for the simple reason that a jerk is a jerk, no matter what the era(!).  And this film really is shockingly ill-willed throughout.  Trapper and Hawkeye (not to mention Skeritt's stomach-turning Duke Forrest) have to be among the most repulsive \\"protagonists\\" you'll ever see.  They aren't just \\"anti-authority\\", as the spun marketing would have you believe, they are just complete, utter, cretins.  Seriously, before the movie's half over, you'll be HOPING they get shot or hit by a bomb or something.  It's beyond belief.  This is certainly in contrast to the TV show, which was terrifically good-natured while still managing to portray hellish war conditions, and which I think was light-years superior to this \\"original\\".  All of the hype aside, this film is just so ignorant and offensive (sexism, racism, the hateful and angry tone, etc.) that I think its main, if not only, fans are primarily those who grew up with the film and are conveniently blinded by nostalgia.  Its \\"popularity\\" (if it even really exists anymore) will be infathomable to most modern viewers.  It makes for ugly, distasteful viewing, on many counts.  And it reminded me why just about everyone I grew up with from my generation never looked up to most of our flower-child precursors except with a healthy chunk of disdain.  What a shame.<br />Now that I write this review and actually notice this film's cover graphic for the first time instead of paying attention only to the endless lauding by reviewers, I have to admit: who can be surprised by any of this.  Blech.  Not for my DVD collection, thanks.  And not for yours either, unless you grew up revelling in the passive-aggressive anger of the 60's/70's and never learned to let it go.  Do yourself a favor and pass (or at the very least, rent first), especially if you loved the TV show.  Viewers who think \\"Dr T and The Women\\" is the only cinematic reason Altman ever gave to make them want to punch him in the face, just haven't seen this horribly overrated (and just plain horrible) film, yet.
B000053GSJ|5.0|I still have the soundtrack to a movie I saw sixteen years ago. Tom Cruise plays the part of an ambitous but smart-alec pilot Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who goes to Top Gun, the naval training academy for America's best pilots. He falls on love with a civilian instructor played by Kelly Mcgillis. A tragic accident claims the life of Maverick's best friend 'Goose' played by Anthony Edwards. Maverick quits the school after the tragedy and after learning of the story behind the disappearance of his father during the Vietnam War. But a military emergency which requires the Top Gun pilot's involvement sees Maverick bring home the bacon in a dogbattle which involves rescuing Top Gun rival 'Iceman' played by Val Kilmer. The battle scenes and photography blend in well with the cental character: the making of Maverick as a more mature, sensible pilot. Meg Ryan, Tom Skerrit and Michael Ironside play sensible roles as  supporting actors. A great film that needed no sequel.

6304645635|4.0|While not wholly faithful to Anne Bronte's novel of the same name, this adaptation has much to commend it. Excellent cinematography, as well as strong performances by the entire cast, makes this a must see production for all lovers of period pieces.<br /><br />An intriguing widow woman of mystery, Helen Graham (Tara Fitzgerald), moves into a crumbling residence known as Wildfell Hall. There, she sets up house with her very young son. Plain spoken, independent, and seeming to lack charm, she rebuffs the initial friendly overtures of the local townsfolk and manages to alienate most of them. Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), a young and handsome yeoman farmer, is not put off by her manner, however, and being smitten by her, pursues her, hoping to gain her affections. Soon, however, the townsfolk begin gossiping about her supposed assignations with a wealthy, local gentleman, Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy), the owner of Wildfell Hall. There comes a point where even the steadfast Mr. Markham wavers in his belief in her. It is then that Mrs. Graham tells him the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Lawrence and reveals her dark past.<br /><br />Rupert Graves steals the show as Arthur Huntingdon, the charming rake who captures and seduces Helen's young, romantic heart. Once married to her, however, he reveals himself to be a brutish, dissolute, and depraved philanderer, who causes her to flee their home with their young son. The role of Huntingdon is, undoubtedly, the juiciest. The film uses the narrative contrivance of flashbacks in order to explain the events that led Helen to take the extraordinary measures that she did. It tells the viewer of the sad story that brought Helen and her son to this sorry pass. Ultimately, Helen takes the high road, when an event occurs that causes her past to collide with her present. In that decision, however, lies the key to her future.<br /><br />Toby Stephens is wonderful as the yeoman farmer, whose tender heart is captured by the beautiful Helen. Tara Fitsgerald, while indeed beautiful, plays the role of Helen a tad too harshly, which, while serving to alenate the townsfolk, serves also to alienate the viewer somewhat. Even though the flashbacks serve to explain her present manner, and the viewer sees her in happier days, Helen is still not as simpatico a character as she could or should be. Still, this is a handsome, though somewhat dark and somber production that those who love period pieces will appreciate and enjoy.utiful Helen.

B00005YTFG|5.0|This movie has replaced \\"Titanic\\" and \\"The Matrix as my all-time favorite movies. This is the only movie that I have seen that I have cried at the end--even after seeing it 6 times. The choice of music and cast is amazingly done, and Ewen McGreggor is SUPURB!

B000002AH9|5.0|When I buy a CD, most often it's on impulse, just eager to hear what it's like. A very select few are ones I buy because of the acclaim I've heard about them. With LADY IN SATIN, it was the mixed reviews that got my interest peaked. Good, bad, in the middle, I don't care. I had to hear for myself. Needless to say, I'm glad I went with my gut, for I've heard truly one of the most authentically heartbreaking pieces of music ever in my life.<br />When LADY IN SATIN was recorded, Billie Holiday was definitely at the end of her life. Years of rough living & heroin addiction had all but put her formerly-honey sweet voice to shame. She was still a trooper though, for even as she was approaching yet another trial for drug possession, Billie approached this recording with the best of professionalism & even with her by-now-fading voice, she succeeded triumphantly.<br />It's safe to say you shouldn't approach this album without a box of tissues close by, for the performances on LADY IN SATIN are so true to life & heartbreaking, you're sure to be moved by hearing a once-great artist sounding like she's clinging to that last shred of life. The titles of songs like \\"Glad To Be Unhappy\\", \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\", \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" & most notably, \\"You've Changed\\" speak volumes. To say this album might be her the story of her life would only be stating the obvious.<br />But the song that really says the most about this whole album is \\"The End Of A Love Affair\\". The version that made it onto LADY IN SATIN is a wonder enough, but the bonus track that has Billie singing a cappella & later saying she doesn't even know how the song goes is the tell-tale sign that as good as this whole album did turn out, it wasn't exactly a labor of love. In fact, in only 17 more months, she'd be dead.<br />Some say that Ray Ellis's string arrangements are a hinderance to the album more than a help, but they provide the best back-up for Billie's war-weary-yet-still-resonant voice. Both are very beautiful in their own ways, whether they're light or dark. The result is not all that different from Frank Sinatra's influential albums that he was recording at around the same time.<br />When LADY IN SATIN was released, controversy abounded from many corners. Some said that the album should not have even been released & was an insult to Billie Holiday's once-marvelous talent. But the more open-minded hailed it as a masterpiece, albeit a dark one. Even Billie herself claimed it as her favorite. The fact that she managed to hang on while she recorded this album is truly a work of nature when you consider her state of mind & life at the time. She would record one more album before her death at the age of 44.<br />However, it's rare that an artist can end their career having known they've recorded their masterwork. But with LADY IN SATIN, maybe Billie was right in singing its praises. Sure, she may not have been in the best of shape & her better days were behind her. Yet some of the best music comes from a lifetime's worth of experience & actually living the life of the music. With LADY IN SATIN, Billie Holiday did that & then some. Of course, listening to an artist at the end of her tether will not be an easy feat. Once you take the plunge, though, you'll feel greatly rewared that you did.Both are very beautiful in their own ways, whether they're light or dark.

630460291X|5.0|Ok, Kevin did not have an English accent.  So what?!  The acting and action made the movie a winner.  This particular  version is very dear to me because the theme song  'Everything I do, I do for you' by Bryan Adams was dedicated to me by my father when I became  paralyzed in a pool incident.  To this very day, the song inspires me not to give up in life.  Plus, I'm waiting for the new  dts version that is currently in production.  I can't wait!

B000001ZSF|3.0|Made at a time before AIR and DAFT PUNK when French music was still a Johnny Halliday joke, this is an album that was and probably still is ahead of its time, it's time being that wonderful era in the future where we all fly around on jet packs and take our meals in pill form. <br />I used to, like, really envy this dude being married to Charlotte Rampling (or Charlotte Trampoline as we nicknamed her here in the maggot cave), but roundabout the realease of CHRONOLOGIE, I saw them together and thought HEY she looks like my old probabtion officer!!!!!! <br />Although JMJ had done big one-off gigs, CHRONOLOGIE marked the launch of the first ever concert tour by the French synth wizard. He professed his admiration for U2's ZOO TV concept, as well as an interest in \\"Le Rave\\" and tied it all to the launch of a swanky range of watches by Swatch who sponsored the album and tour. If the sponsor had been McDonald's would he have still called the album Chronologie? But JMJ claimed that he was very interested in the work being done by Swatch with youth and street culture. For example, it's use of Keith Haring's images appealed to his Gallic sensibilities. <br />To sum up: POMPOUS SYNTH MUSIC from the era of Stadium Rock. Best enjoyed with ooh-ah firework displays and/or laser battles in a UFO infested heaven. <br />Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

B0000024RZ|5.0|I don't like depressing music, and the lyrics on this album are kind of depressing.  I don't like folk music because it all sounds the same to me, and this is folk music. Finally, I don't like Bob Dylan - I sold John Wesley Harding &amp; Highway 61 Revisited back to the swap shop because these albums just plain annoyed me.<br />None of that matters. &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'&quot; is a work of profound grace, power and conviction. It touches me deeply because it is so naked and personal. <br />Some people disparage Bob Dylan's voice; here, it is beautiful.<br />A soundtrack to the universe.

0553801481|5.0|This book was even better than its previous novels of the Farseer triolgy. It shows Fitz grown up and healed, to some extent, of the wounds her recieved at the conclusion of Assassins Quest. He lives quietly with Nighteyes and his foster child Hap, until of course the past pays a visit. <BR>This book shows Hobb's ability to create and define charcters through beautiful language and strong detail. Although I generally dislike first person, I find it too constraining on the text, I think it really works with this series. FitzChivalry is such a defined character that one comes to know him very well. <BR>The plot was fast moving and believable. Loved characters from the other series are all present, Chade, Kettriken, and my favourite The Fool. As well as the inclusion of new ones, which look to be promising. <BR>The novel will make you laugh and cry (the end was bittersweet for me) but it is worth it. Buy it you will not be disappointed. However one last note, the Voyager cover is much better, so if you can buy that one.
B00005TT77|5.0|Well, I may just be the only one to write a review for this album not comparing it to the original Beatles works, because I am not familiar enough with most of the original Beatles stuff to give an educated opinion.  Therefore, my expectations for these songs were much lower than most others.<br />With that said, I have to say that this album was thoroughly enjoyable. Some tracks were good, some were GREAT, and some were just plain ok.  Nick Cave's rendition of \\"let it be\\" (one song I AM familiar with) was a little weird and disappointing.  However, all in all, this album is a pretty nice listen. <br />My fav o flavs have got to be Eddie Vedder's \\"you've got to hide your love away\\", Sarah Mclachlan's \\"Blackbird\\", and Aimee Mann and Michael Penn's \\"Two of Us\\".<br />I know it is hard for most of you serious Beatles fans, but try and give this album a chance without making unrealistic comparisons.  Obviously these artists are not the Beatles, and there will never again be anything that can match or compete with the Beatles in future renditions of these songs.  But most of the artists on this soundtrack did a pretty impressive job, and give credit where credit is due.
B00005R87Q|1.0|There is a lot of action and there are many angry people, so I suppose the title is accurate.  What there is not is any reason whatsoever to see this film.  There is no acting to speak of, no real plot development, no character development, no interesting dialogue.  There is no genuine exploration of the racing subculture, or any interest in looking at what tensions, interests, or economic forces might create such a subculture. It would be interesting so understand why these people are in such dead-end, sterile lives that suicidal races and peer respect have become so important.  Instead, we see a lot of cars, a lot of races, a lot of rather puerile challenges, and a lot of sex--but no intelligence, no clarity, no calls for the rest of us to examine our comfotable lives--and, in the end, no interest in the  very subject the filmmakers are portraying.  If it were possible to give this film no stars, I would do so.
0671024256|5.0|I am not a writer, I never will be a writer, and I have no desire to be a writer. Ever. But that didn't make me hesitate one second when this book went up for sale on Amazon. I don't know what it is about this man.....I have gotten totally engrossed in almost all of his fiction stories, but even his nonfiction books are engrossing. I've been a huge Stephen King fan since his first published novel \\"Carrie\\", and am always impatient to see what he'll think up next. I enjoyed \\"ON Writing\\" simply because it made me feel like I know him a little. When he writes \\"Dear Constant Reader\\" I feel like he's right in front of me, taking my hand, and ready to lead me down a long and terrifying, or funny, or unworldly place. But he seems to know his way around so well, I'm ready to follow wherever he leads, because I am his \\"Constant Reader\\". He complains that critics say he could sell his grocery list. Well, that may be a bit much, but if he managed to put his mind to work on a story about a laundry list, chances are, it'd be loved by his legions of fans. Anyway....if you really enjoy his works, and have not read this book because you think it's an instruction manual, give it a try. We learn a little more about Mr. King, his life and his wonderful family.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Going into this movie I was thinking about what several others have said: it's a knock off of Titanic, and not worth the time.  But, there were some people who told me that it was a great movie, and well worth the expense.  So, I rented it on DVD, and spent an evening watching it.  It was a very good movie.  Like Saving Private Ryan, it is a tribute to a generation who is being forgotten in this day of modern technology.  <br />The Department of Defense allowed the movie to be filmed on location in Pearl Harbor, and filming was done on an active aircraft as well.  Most of the extras in the film were military personnel too.  Having the government so helpful in the production of a movie is rare.  The DVD has a good \\"Making the Film\\" section that talks a great deal about the efforts put into the film to make it realistic, and accurate.<br />When you watch this movie (again, or for the first time), put yourself in the place of someone in the military during the early 1940's.  Spend a little money, and a little time to honor a generation that made extreme sacrifices for this country.

It was on a Friday night and I literally didn't stop reading until Sunday when I finished it, with two 3 hour breaks for sleeping.<BR>This book is amazing from all points of view - first of all, it's a great story and it's wonderfully told; second of all the characters are fantastically built, multidimensional and actually spontaneous and unpredictable; and last but not least, the philosophical background, that of individualism is not only an exceptional idea, but also perfectly argumented and illustrated.<BR>The Fountainhead reminded me of Cohen's &quot;Belle du Seigneur&quot; because of the both the way the 20's and 30's aristocracy is portrayed and the gloryfying of pure love, except Ayn Rand's masterpiece is far more interesting from both points of view. Also, in my point of view, this book is very much about Dominique, perhaps even more that about Roarke. One way or the other though, the way Ayn Rand succeeds in defining a character through the ones that surround him is extremely intersting.<BR>In conclusion, this is definitely not a book to miss, whether you believe in individualism or not. It will definitely make you see the world through different eyes.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I bought &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; along with Weezer's &quot;Green Album&quot; at a day after Thanksgiving sale last year. I probably listened to Weezer more first, but definitley remember being intrigued by the opening track on Travis' opus, &quot;Sing.&quot; I put both away for awhile after that. Neither really appealed to me that much.<br />But over the next few weeks I found myself singing the few lyrics I knew to &quot;Sing&quot; constantly. I pulled the album back out again. I was eager to dimiss it as standard pop fare. But then again, I thought, maybe that's what I *wanted*. I need a nice pop diversion every once in awhile.<br />I have a very valid theory that Fran Healy is channeling Paul McCartney. Don't believe me? Listen to &quot;Flowers in the Window.&quot; Over Thanksgiving break I envisioned myself and my crush sitting by a window in a log cabin, watching the flowers grow. &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot; uses some wonderfully vivid and charming imagery, even if it is a pop song.<br />Travis' album is great when you're in what I call a &quot;light depression&quot; -- you're sick of life, but you don't want to rock out to Metallica. You need a sympathetic ear and, day or night, Fran is there with one. One particular line -- this one in &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; summed up my feelings at the time -- &quot;I'd pray to God if there was heaven / but heaven seems so very far from here ...&quot;<br />&quot;Last Train&quot; may be a bit heavy for these lite-pop Brits, however. It's one of the few songs that go too far. The other, perhaps, is &quot;Indefinitley,&quot; just too sappy. I love &quot;My Love&quot; as much as the next guy, but this is just ridiculous.<br />For perfectly handcrafted pop, though, Travis is your best bet. Hey, look at it this way. It's a Beatle clone. Or an Oasis clone. Whatever.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Though this movie was probably not intended to be comical, the main character is so far out there that his comments and mannerisms are hilarious. After watching this a few times with people I know, we constantly quote things like, &quot;I have to return some video tapes.&quot; Believe me, when you see the movie you will understand what I mean.
B000000WF0|5.0|this is the best album in the world. it was made in 1997 yet its still hard to get tired of. the song bittersweet symphony couldnt be better than it is. whoever doesnt have this album should pick it up because all of the songs are worth your money
B00005IBGQ|4.0|You've probably heard of Rufus Wainwright before. He's the undisputed king of eccentric movie soundtracks. Contributions as of late include the Beatles cover &quot;Across the Universe&quot; for &quot;I Am Sam&quot; and &quot;Complainte de la Butte&quot; for &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;<br />But that's merely a hint of what Rufus Wainwright is really all about. You can't learn anything from miscellaneous songs. You need an entire album to really learn.<br />&quot;Poses,&quot; Wainwright's sophomore effort, is an extraordinary work, reminiscient of The Beatles, Billy Joel, Elton John, and others. But Rufus has a character all his own. With his unique, and often rather bratty, persona, he managed to pull you in. The bouncy keyboard of &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; starts you off. If you listen to the lyrics hard enough, you can figure out your own deep, dark obsessions -- what is it that really makes you smoke, eat too many donuts, or have 4 lattes a day?<br />Other songs catch the imagination in the same way. The title track is extremely intriguing, with its wonderfully melodic swing and the moody piano. Most of the lyrics leave me clueless, but I'm sure they mean something to somebody else.<br />The album's standout track, though, in my eyes, is &quot;Grey Gardens,&quot; a wonderfully poppy, yet moody, track. Rufus' higher-pitched voice in one verse of the song shows his versatility. And the melody is very reminiscient of something McCartney himself would write.<br />Whether your looking for a Beatle clone, a hot new artist, or just a moody guy, Poses should satisfy your tastes for some real music in 2002. It's time to throw away that Britney CD.

In order to stop the vampire from drinking the blood of everyone in town, Charlie enlists the help of Peter Vincent, an actor who has played a vampire killer in many horror films.

B000002OR4|5.0|From the response that one can observe to the score from Schindler's List, it is like no one took John Williams' work seriously prior to its release.  He had been renowned for his bombast music and his loud marches, but his subtler works might have been too easily forgotten.  However, there seems to be a turnaround in the public conception of Williams after Schindler's List.  To many people, he became a composer capable of the deep emotion inherent in more somber films.  To long time fans, this may have always been apparent, but for those who could not recognize his skill, Schindler's List divulged it completely and indubitably.<br />Schindler's List, even when it is depicting the greatest evil and the most visually horrifying images, never collapses and never overpowers.  Its greatest gift is its ability to outline and highlight, not to overshadow and reconstruct.  The multiple themes are all extraordinary and powerful, recurring where necessary, and coming to a crescendo as appropriate.  Frequently intermingled are appropriate and stirring excerpts from Hebrew hymns that humanize and reconnect the images on screen with the validity of the past.  Combined within are two sides of a film score that work together to create a magical whole.  The dominant passages are the string pieces, led by Ithzak Pearlman, and colasceing the traditional images of the film with music that isn't wholly inappropriate from the era depicted.  Alternately, there are delightful mechanical cues that reference Hebrew music and lighten the mood as necessary.  Best depicted in the track \\"Schindler's Workforce\\"--perhaps the best an most delightful of the tracks, outside of the suites--maintains a constant beat that circles and epitomizes the interaction of the Jews and their forced occupation.<br />Ultimately, it is a perfect film that is complimented by a completely appropriate score.  One can intensely understand and concur with the lifelong relationship between Williams and Spielberg, understanding where they are in tune, why they are so equally successful, and just how much they love filmmaking; all because they are good at what they do and share a mind in how it should be done.  Listening to the score from Schindler's List is an experience equally pleasant and disturbing; pleasant where the music relates the sanguine outlooks of the Jewish people, and disturbing as we see the atrocities that try to break their spirit.  The score in the end, represents, perhaps, the pinnacle of Williams' film scoring career, a point where he gained ubiquitous respect and appreciation.  The score for Schindler's List is an undeniable feat that should not be missed for its perfection, its depiction, and its beauty.
1559408898|4.0|With perhaps one of the most brutal scenes I have ever seen in a movie (in which firearms are used to dismember the main character), this film isn't for the young or faint of heart.  (If watching with someone under the age of 15, you can easily skip this scene by jumping to the next chapter just before it arrives.  And, by the way, I do recommend this movie for smart children--with parently supervision, of course and as always--because it is has interesting and provocative themes that create the context for profitable discussions.)  I like Robocop for the same reasons I really like Starship Troopers.  Indeed, Starship Troopers builds upon the clever, over the top irony and humor in Robocop, painting American culture for what it is--a drippy pap moved by skillful propaganda artists and merchandisers who turn truth, meaning, and reality on its head.  You can read my Starship Troopers review if  you are interested (it is a better film than Robocop, overall), so I'll stick to this film.  Told in the form of a comic book tale of an average man propelled into the role of the tortured superhero--a kind of Wolverine for the machine age--Robocop is at its best in telling a interesting story of corruption in a society that looks like our own, except with the volume turned up to eleven.  Nothing terribly deep here, but interesting tidbits pop up with sufficient regularity to set it above many in its genre.  But entertaining.  And while it is a bit dated in the political issues it confronts, I find it well crafted and effective.

0393317552|5.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond is a superb attempt to explain the fortunes of human history.  His central thesis is that the current Western-European domination of the world is not a product of superior intelligence, but of an accident of geography. Namely the Europeans were the beneficiaries of superior access to wild plants that could be utilized for food production, wild animals that could be domesticated and the absence of physical barriers permitted the transfer of technology and plants and animals from the \\"Fertile Crescent,\\" where farming was founded, to Europe.<br />The end result was that Europeans developed agricultural societies quicker than Mesoamericans, Africans and other societies. This led to larger, more dense societies with written languages, an increased resistence to germs, technological innovations and access to large beasts of burden that could be used for farming and warfare.  When the Spanish met the Incas the above advantages allowed less than 200 Spaniards to subdue an immense Inca Army.  <br />Diamond's theory is more than plausible and well argued.  Especially important is the effect of germs on the outcome of the confrontation as well as the latter ones between Europeans and most other of the worlds cultures.  At times germs, such as smallpox, effectively wiped out whole civilizations without the necessity of a single military confrontation.  The demise of the developed Native American civilizations in the Mississippi valley is a prime example.  <br />Contrary to other reviews, Diamond does not seek to use geographic determinism as an explanation for every cultural development.  As an example he readily admits that there are other important factors when considering a confrontation of two cultures with similar geographic advantages.  His explanation of why Europeans and not the Chinese colonized North America is an example.  His subscribes the failure of Chinese to complete the task not to food production, germs, or the lack of available technology, but to the 15th Century political process that China operated under.  The European system encouraged innovation as a result of numerous power centers where ideas that one center dismissed could be accepted by others.  Columbus' rejection by numerous parties before the Spanish agreed to finance his expedition is the classic example. On the other hand, China had  centralized political system so when a decision was made to stop exploration and destroy the navy there was no other place to go.<br />The book is well written and while repetitious at times it is an easy read.  If one wants to attempt to understand human history this book is a must read.
B000001GH9|5.0|Out of the many recordings I have come across that exposed me to the Berg concerto, I would certainly say that this is the most passionate while being the most accurate at the same time. The concerto, by its very instrumentation, seems to call for a sombreness in color and performance. This recording is faithful to it. Yet, it succeds even more by exhibiting a very large range of emotions. I have never heard the second half of the first movement played with so much energy. Unlike most recordings, this recording actually gives the listener a sense of &quot;forte&quot; unlike the other recordings' overly sombre mezzo-forte's. I had to look at the score to see if they were playing this piece accurately because there were parts that in which I thought that the wrong line was being emphasised. But according to the score, all of the &quot;haupstimmen&quot; and &quot;niebenstimmen&quot; were correct (even in the section in the last movement where the contra-basses and harp play the theme in a canon displaced by fifth and one measure. I would have liked the harp louder, but oh well.)<br />Two teenie complaints. Frau Mutter seemed a bit too fond of the non-vibrato sound where the score didn't call for it, and in my opinion, neither did the music. Specifically, in the second half of the second movement in which the violin arpegiates &quot;Est ist genugh&quot; twice and in the same movement, when the Corinthian folk song is quoted - she doesn't vibrato on these notes giving the piece an errie quality that i dont think the piece calls for.<br />And the complaint which I have for all recordings, why can't the first trombonist get an instrument with an Eb valve???? I am sure that he or she could even get an Eb switcheroonie-thing to swith their F-attatchment. Then they can do the glissando from Bb to Eb in the second movement properly!
0395193958|4.0|I don't want to say something about the content of the book here, because I think everybody knows it. I give my opinion only to the books printing.<BR>First it is only artificial leather bounded. Therefore the price is a little bit too high. 35 - 40$ US should have been enough for this issue. Otherwise the printing inside is ok and very good to read, because the letters are not too small and not as bad as  some customers have written here. Also the book block is not glued slanting into the book and the map at the end is also ok.<BR>All in all 4 stars and not 5, because of the cover material and the high price.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Yikes! With over 1200 customer reviews about `Gladiator' (as of this writing) posted, I think I'll hold off on reviewing the movie proper. I seriously doubt that anything I'll say about it will sound any different from what many of the others have written, so I'll let my fellow Amazonians try to wow you with their insights on how good, bad, or indifferent this flick is. Instead, I'm going to review something that most folks have neglected to mention in their prose critiques: the DVD extra features! And off we go...<br />Being the high-tech, big-budget box-office champion that it is, one would naturally assume that `Gladiator' would have a pretty wide array of bonus materials. And sure enough, that is indeed the case. In fact, there're so many extras, the studio devoted an entire second platter to `em. But first, let's start off with the feature-length commentary. Director Ridley Scott and a few of his filmmaking cohorts go into the details of how each particular scene was devised and filmed, how they tried to make the movie historically accurate in some ways, and other things regarding the making of this film. Throw in a few amusing anecdotes here and there, and you have pretty much your basic commentary track that doesn't particularly stand out from others I've listened to before.<br />Okay, now we can get on to the bonus disc. There's the obligatory teasers/trailers/TV spots section, as well as a half-hour behind-the-scenes doc where you see the director and principal actors get a bit too involved and in describing their roles, and taking things a bit too seriously. I mean, I like the movie and all, but sheesh-lighten up a little, guys! Also thrown in is an hour-long documentary that goes over the history of the original Roman gladitorial contests, which I found both entertaining and informative. True, it was likely included as an attempt to appease the more nitpicky moviegoers who demand historical accuracy, but I liked watching it none the less.<br />Then there's the gallery of deleted scenes, all of which include commentary from the director. After seeing these bits of trimmed footage, I thought it was a shame that Mr. Scott didn't see fit to restore them to the movie... oh well. There's also the interview with composer Hans Zimmer regarding the scoring of the film which I found less than exciting. I like the movie's soundtrack tunes and all, but it doesn't exactly make for a compelling interview. <br />Also thrown in to fill out the package are several storyboards and behind-the-scenes photos. You know, a little something for the cinema uber-mavens to drool over. Personally, I would've preferred a blooper reel, but that's me...<br />`Late
B00003CWPL|5.0|I had heard nothing but good things about this film for years before finally hunting it down and seeing it recently. Watching this movie with all the lights off (and in a non-drug induced emotional haze) was absolutely the most disturbing thing I have ever experienced. David Lynch somehow managed to channel every uneasy, nervous, paranoid, and hopeless situation I've ever been in and pour it into this film- before I was even born. Twenty minutes into Eraserhead and I couldn't wait for it to be over, yet I couldn't stop watching. It's impossible to truly describe the effect that this film achieves, so I'll stop here and recommend this very highly to those looking for an other-worldly and infinitely disturbing experience.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Ever since their first album, Herzeleid, came out, Rammstein were and an upward curve in terms of their music's quality. Their 2nd album, Sehnsucht, was better than the first, and now their 3rd, Mutter is even better! \\"Mutter\\" is way more than just worth your money. It's the best album yet of the best band on Earth (Rammstein) and I'm not exaggerating. All of the songs absolutely rule!
0345442989|5.0|If you have ever wondered about how the situation in The Phantom Menace came about, especially why the trade routes were being taxed and what the big deal was with the Trade Federation, then you should definitely consider Cloak of Deception. It is great to see how Darth Sidious maneuvers practically everyone in the novel to do his bidding and set up the situation for the blockade of Naboo. Some people have written that they find this book boring: you will find a lot of politics and debating here, so an action-oriented reader will not enjoy much of it, but personally I think that it is interesting. I really liked the plot. Highly recommended!
B00004SPYJ|5.0|It doesn't matter which versions of R&amp;J you've seen.  You haven't really SEEN it until you watch this gorgeous film.  My mother saw this film as a teenager and rented it when I was quite young.  It got me hooked on Shakespeare!  I've seen it so many times, I can quote the dialogue word for word.  Yes, there are scenes and dialogue omitted, but if they can edit the bible for film, I think they can edit Shakespeare.  The story loses nothing from these omissions.  In fact it gains a faster, meteoric pace, taking us with the young lovers as they soar high on love at first site, plunge into tragedy, and finally meet their violent ends.  Leonard Whiting is a tender, poetic, marvelous Romeo, but Olivia Hussey steals the film with her passionately perfect performance of Juliet. Remarks have been made about her crying &quot;too much&quot;.  Hello??!!  Critics who diss her for this have obviously never been a thirteen year old girl.  Your hormones are going wacko at thirteen.  I would sometimes cry at At&amp;T commercials when I was thirteen, and Juliet certainly had more cause to cry than that!  The haunting score by Nino Rota (who also scored the &quot;The Godfather&quot;) heightens every single scene in which it is used.  The music conveys the emotions of this story so well, it is almost a character itself.  Pick up the soundtrack!  It is phenomenal! <BR>I have seen many versions of R&amp;J over the years.  Every film version, many plays, but none compare to this.  Particularly, no Juliet I have ever seen has compared with the vitality, passion, and almost unreal beauty of Olivia Hussey.  She becomes Juliet in every way.  I won't say another actress will *never* compare to her performance, but so far, noone has even come close to matching it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I used to listen to No Noubt in my early teens, when their smash Tragic Kingdom came out -- they were an exciting \\"play-fun-stuff-and-grab-the-mainstream-teen-audience\\" band, and at times, inevitably naive. <br />What drew my attention to the band again, at the end of 2001, was their comeback single Hey Baby. Of course I'd heard stuff from their previous record Saturn's Return, but they failed to amaze me as this smart and jaunty number did. It seemed to me, after her well-put collaborations with US rapper Eve and electronic guru Moby, Gwen had finally found the true glitter in her voice, and was now a very confident and appealing \\"rock-chick\\".<br />I bought the album Rock Steady out of frustration that I could not find the record I was looking for in the record shop. Lucikly I did so -- the whole album is one hell of a parade: rock, ska, reggae, R&B and dub all melted in cutting-edge production and flavoured by Gwen's incredible voice. This was indeed, a much more better album than I'd expected, and a glorious comeback for a band that seemed to have problems as to where to fit in. With Rock Steady, No Doubt re-establish themselves as a quality mainstream band who are way apart from the other \\"hip shakers, hit makers\\" on the market.<br />If you're looking for something fresh in the truest sense of the word, Rock Steady is the right Choice.<br />Key Tracks: Hella Good, Hey Baby, Underneath It All, Running, Rock Steady
0800141660|5.0|There are two movies I watch with my little sis when I feel in that &quot;girl bonding&quot; mood.  One is &quot;Little Women&quot; and this beautiful film is the other.  It centers around two sisters, who are very different, but a complement to each other.  Marianne, played by the beautiful Kate Winslet, and Eleanor played by the impeccably talented Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay).  What is so refreshing about Jane Austen's writing is how her novels seem contemporary even though they are not.  Her characters speak and behave in ways that anyone today might speak or behave.  The relationships in this film between Eleanor and Edward, and Marianne and Willoughby are very familiar to us because they are typical of a modern day relationship.  Who hasn't been in a situation like Eleanor?  You desperately want to be with someone, but you're too afraid to tell them, or there's someone else in the way?  Or maybe you've been in a relationship like Marianne's, where you're dumped for no apparent reason except money?  This film conveys the love, joy, and pain of these two sisters in a way that is sometimes witty, sometimes sweet, and sometimes heartbreaking.  Break out the Kleenax!  =)
B00005JCCE|4.0|The movie isn't quite true to Dr. Adam's reality, there are some dramatic elements added, for instance his midlife crisis actually happened while he was 18, as I was told by him.<br />However this movie isn't supposed to be a biography, but rather an entertaining movie, and it does that well.<br />With Robin Williams familliar humor this movie engages the audience to see not just the over used concept of the healing power of laughter; but more so the power of connection, of sharing  the human experience. <br />This movie suggests that it isn't enough to just bring your skills to this difficult proffession, but also to take yourself along also. We're all human beings, and we need to treat people with the dignity and compassion we treat ourselves with. <br />This movie seems to say, to me, that there's nothing wrong with admiting to our shared humanity. This is a powerfull concept...<br />In any case beyond the ideals suggested, this movie is a light and warm hearted escaped about dealing with life, and overcomming obstacles. I for one recommend this movie.
6300214559|4.0|I first saw this film when I was 15, and I have owned it now for several years.  It was this film that piqued my interest not only in Lady Jane Grey, but in the entire Tudor dynasty.  Yes, there are historical inaccuracies, but what's new in film, eh?  The love story is completely fabricated, but touching and amusing all the same.  Cary Elwes is a greatly under-appreciated actor.  His performance in this film reveals a depth that I truly haven't seen him express in anything else.  Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as usual.  She looks like she stepped right out of a 16th century portrait.  One thing I do wish was included in the film is the time that Jane spent living at Catherine Parr's (Henry VIII's 6th wife) home with the future Queen Elizabeth and Catherine Parr's then husband, Thomas Seymour.  Apparently there were all sorts of things going on there between Bess and Tom and it would have been interesting to see how Jane reacted and dealt with that.  This is a tragic, romantic, and touching film.  I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially those who love period films or have an interest in the Tudor Dynasty.  It's marvelously entertaining!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I am definatley going to buy this on DVD. I saw it twice in the theatres and it is very true to the books. Hermione's potion logic got taken out of the end which i didn't like, but everything else was good! the characters were very well cast (hagrid is sooo good! hermione is so annoying in the beginning you wanna smack her.) the quiddich game was terrific and, just a little 15-year-old-ness here, but Oliver Wood's accent is great! Good book, good movie. great for parents and kids and everyone! my brother hasn't read the books and enjoyed the movie.
6305364613|3.0|First of all, modernizing Shakespeare is a tricky thing.  Not because I'm in that camp that thinks his works are sacred and should NEVER be trifled with (Okay guys!  Will was great but he was not GOD.  If we can edit the Bible for TV, can't we edit the Bard? Hm?) but because it has to be done in a way that does not distract from the story, and it has to be done in a way so that you can lose yourself in the dialogue even though it does not \\"fit\\" with the time period.  We'll dispense with the \\"bad\\" first.  <br />I had several problems with this film.  Many times, the actors are saying their lines and it is *painfully* obvious they have no idea what they are talking about.  They will latch on to one word that they understand and emphasize it, destroying the whole flow of the line, and taking emphasis off the whole point of their dialogue.  There was alot of inflection and screaming of lines that seemed.....odd.  In the middle of scenes, the action suddenly speeds up for no apparent reason like we're watching on fast forward.  This is not only distracting, but pointless.  <br />My second problem:  Claire Danes.  Now don't get me wrong, I like Claire.  I adored \\"My So Called Life\\", but her Juliet is the most lifeless, bland, and spiritless interpretation I've ever seen.  Juliet is the most passionate female role Shakespeare ever wrote.  She is vivacious, expressive, and madly in love.  Throughout this entire film, I never see any of that from Claire.  She delivers her lines like she's telling Romeo about the weather, and when her cousin is killed by her new husband her expression is the same as it has been through the whole film, like she's contemplating taking a shower or a bath!  When Juliet wakes up and finds her husband dead, she chokes out ONE sob and a not very convincing one at that.  <br />Another problem I had with the casting of Claire is that I just don't feel she was attractive enough to play Juliet, especially paired with Leonardo Dicaprio.  It was a bit unbelievable that his sexy, brooding, Romeo would fall passionately in love with this rather plain, emotionless girl.  Thirdly, could someone please tell me WHY Juliet's mother speaks with a southern accent?!  And why are all of Juliet's family obviously of spanish decent when she, her mother, and her father are not?  It was also a little hard to buy that Romeo was living in a trailer in Mantua.  Did he have a velvet Elvis painting as well?  Hmm....Ah well...on to the good.  <br />The updating swords to guns worked rather smoothly and calling the guns \\"Sword 9mm\\" etc. was a nice touch.  The balcony scene taking place in the pool was really quite brave and it worked well.  The aquarium when they first meet was very affective and was a cute addition of \\"hide and go seek\\" as they peek through at each other, eventually culminating in Romeo knocking his face against the glass.  Mercutio being a drag queen was an ingenius idea, and definitely not one I would have ever imagined.  Very clever!  <br />Paul Rudd is adorable as Paris, which is a pleasant surprise considering in most versions, Paris is usually old, ugly, and almost always has a nose of a very unusual shape (I don't know why this is but it seems to be a pattern).  The costumes at the party were very cute.  Romeo as a knight and Juliet as an angel.  Not very original, but cute just the same.  The love scene before Romeo leaves for his exile is sexy but tastefully done.  <br />Leonardo Dicaprio plays Romeo as a misunderstood James Dean-esque rebel with a mysterious aura about him.  Even by the end of the film, it feels we don't truly know all there is to know about Romeo.  This brings a freshness to the character and gives him some more depth, (although Dicaprio *should* have spent more time learning to understand his lines.  He is just as guilty of overemphasizing incorrect words as the others are).  The ending of the film is done lavishly which adds to the inevitable climax.  Dicaprio does a good job of conveying his pain and loss over the \\"death\\" of his wife.<br />The ending of this film is a bit different from others in that it has gleaned much from the story of R&J which Shakespeare based his play on rather than the play itself.  This adds an even more tragic somberness to the ending (as if it needed it!) which is an unexpected, yet effective addition.  The music chosen and scored for this film is all quite good.  The use of Radiohead's \\"Talk Show Host\\" as Romeo's theme music fits Dicaprio's moody version of the character to a tee.  The piano muscled \\"Kissing You\\" is a lovely song and fits well as the background to the aquarium scene.  <br />All of that said, this film is worth watching, especially if you enjoy Shakespeare.  It has many things that work, and many things that do not, but it is still enjoyable.  However, if you wish to see a more passionate and conventional version of Romeo and Juliet, I still recommend the 1969 Zeffirelli version with Leonard Whiting and the incomparable Olivia Hussey.  For me, it sets the standard to which all versions of Romeo and Juliet will be compared.
B000002ORU|2.0|One of the real problems with the Who is that in order to get to the real transcendant moments on most of their releases, you have to listen to a lot of mediocrity first.  For every &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; theres a &quot;Gettin' In Tune&quot;; for every &quot;Who Are You&quot; there's a &quot;Love Is Coming Down.&quot;  That, plus the fact that many of their best songs are only available as singles - the Join Together-Relay-Let's See Action trilogy, The Seeker, and Long Live Rock, and the box set would seem to be the perfect refuge to find the real good stuff without all the nonsense.  <br />What a disappointment.  You know you're in trouble when reading Pete Townshend's awful liner notes.  And then treated to single edits and otherwise edited versions of Who Are You, The Seeker, and 5:15.  The fourth disc puts stupid Keith Moon skits over the intros to Slip Kid and In a Hand or Face, and the great live version of A Quick One is spliced with the inferior studio version.  Twist and Shout, while meaningful as the last song from their 1982 Farewell Tour is not very good; the live version of I'm a Man show them up as intolerable old farts (&quot;When I sing 'I'm a man' everybody scream!&quot;) and the overarticulated Saturday Night's Alright (for Fighting) is just unfortunate.  <br />The fast forward button on my CD player really deserved a lot better, and so did I, for my money.
B000002LEE|5.0|In my opinion, Janes Addiction is one of the best bands to emerge from Los Angeles, and definitely the best representation ever of art-rock. Their diverse combination of jazz, folk, shred rock and tribal music bridges so many gaps and so many cultures. This album is their most focused, innovative and passionate, a culmination of passionate ideas forged into one giant blast. Perry's vocals are primitive screamings and subtle insinuations. Dave's fantastic guitar playing will not be surpassed by any other art-rock band (they seem to look down upon ability?). His solos and use of effects is magnificent, firing off grating solos or constructing lush, beautiful and eerie atmospheres. Eric Avery needs more credit-his creative jazz lines bring melodic taste to the rhythm section. Stephen's drumming fuses tribal-jazz with sporadic rock fills and illuminates the underlying chaos that Janes barely keeps control of. I don't know how to describe this band other than I have to be careful where I listen to them, they usually make me start sweating, shaking and moving around because of their power. They're the total package-technical skill, accurate and innovative artistic themes and passionate showmanship. They're intelligent yet humble, rejecting the dark, elitist outlook perpetuated by most art-rockers. Call them what you want, Janes Addiction's simply rules.
0425166805|5.0|This book is a good read, it opens up your mind to more possibilities.  Those who say this book is bad, and does not make sense are usually, close-minded, and are not able to accept other possibilities. If you are an open minded individual, I suggest this book.
0812550706|3.0|I'm not a big sci-fi reader. I have read books like 1984 and Contact and some Micheal Crichton books, but that's about it. Actually, Ender's Game is my first sci-fi novel that is a part of a series of books. I thought it was pretty good, but not great.<br />The main guy in the book is Ender described as a child super-genius. (Actually, Ender's genius mainly lies in being good in what can be thought of as a computer-game called the Simulator, and I wouldn't classify good gamers as geniuses, but oh well I'm rambling.) So this kid is really smart and thinks way too much about everything, and he also has to save the world from aliens (which of course look like giant bugs - no points for originality here). Ender is interesting to read about as we get to know him in the beginning of the book, but as the story moves on he gets pretty boring and predictable. He is your typical lonely depressed genius. The book doesn't really try to develop other characters. There's Valentine (Ender's sister) and Peter (Ender's brother). A note about Peter - this kid is smart like Ender, but he's also mean and witty, and that made him pretty entertaining. Maybe it's just me, but I was amused by this guy and would have liked to read more about him.<br />The book starts off very well, but it gets boring and repetitious in the middle, but it picks up again in the end. Orson Scott has a few interesting ideas about the future, but he's more interested in telling us what Ender thinks all the time than anything else. I don't mind being in the mind of an interesting character, but Ender wasn't interesting to me.<br />The Battle Room games are described in great detail, but I found them tedious and hard to follow. Another problem was that sometimes the kids didn't talk like kids. It would have been easier to digest some of the weighty dialogue if the characters were 16 or 26 instead of 6 year olds.<br />I know I've mainly focused on what I didn't like about the book, but I still give it a good recommendation. The book starts off well, and I loved the surprises in the last two or three chapters. *** stars
B00000099Y|5.0|This has to be the best rock album i have ever heard.  If u dont blieve me then go out and by it.  Once ur done with the first track u will know what i mean.  This cd is great and everyone needs to hear it.
B00000DGUG|5.0|When I first listened to this cd I was completely surprised. The lyrics were so different, they did not attack or injure as badly as they did on her first cd 'Jagged Little Pill'. The cd would sit in a box for the next two years while I moved and settled in...<BR>One day I was extremely bored and with nothing else to do decided to conquer the touring boxes in my closet. I came across the cd and put it in my cd player so I could listen while I worked. I was 14 when I first listened to it and since then grew up a great deal. I was now 16 and really into music, even more so than at the age of 14. When the song 'Baba' came on I stopped dead in my tracks. Oh, sweet Jesus! I thought while quickly picking up the notebooks I had dropped. The song was amazing! I sat down on my futon and immediantly realized I was not getting back up. I stayed there on that futon until the song 'Unsent' came on. I'm not to fond of that song I decided and turned off the cd player.<BR>Later I listened to the rest and was completely and totally in love. That was a few months ago and now I'm sitting here writing this long review.<BR>The songs 'Baba', 'Can't Not', 'UR', 'One' and 'Joining You' were my favorite's off the cd. This cd is not the best I've ever heard but it's certainly up there.
B00000DCHI|5.0|The music of Billy Joel remains as enduring, and as strong as it did back in the 1970's and 1980's. His Greatest Hits Volume 1&amp;2 still is selling off the shelves, as any classic album by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, or any of those &quot;Imitation Teen Idols&quot;.<br />The music is as strong, and delightful as you can imagine from the piano man. Each song still as legendary as it was back when it was first released. Songs like The Longest Time, The Stranger, and New York State Of Mind, are still some of the longest running staple songs on the radio.<br />To date, Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volume 1&amp;2 has sold more than 21 million copies, and has become the biggest selling greatest hits album by a solo artist. No matter what type of music is out there, the Piano Man always has one song to sing to you.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|OK, so this isn't the sort of movie I'd normally watch.  I was hesitant to see this movie, and the first 10 minutes weren't encouraging.  But I'm glad I made it through the first part, because the movie was, well-really good!<br />The cinematography was excellent.  I loved the use of vibrant reds that surrounded the Moulin Rouge, while the rest of the town was painted in drab grays.  The soundtrack  was distracting at times, mainly because I'd try and figure out the song they were remaking.  But the way they blended love songs together in the medley's was fun and very well done.  I may have to go out and get the soundtrack.<br />As for the actors, Nicole has outdone herself here.  Very well acted, and she sings suprisingly well.  As does Ewan (although I kept expecting to see Yoda appear around him!)<br />See this movie.  Go into it with an open mind and you will be very pleased!  And guys--this won't lower your testosterone levels!
B00005RHGK|2.0|For a movie that starts out with an exciting car chase scene it certainly didn't develop. Without giving away the ending it's hard to write a review except to say there are too many open ended questions that go unanswered. The question of where the bad guy comes from is left completely unexplored. And more importantly who the psychic is and if \\"she is ever wrong in any of her predictions.\\"<br />The ending is forced and looks more like they realized they were running out of money for this production. In the end it's worth it for the beginning car chase but that is it. Turn it off after that or you'll want to charge the studio for your time.<br />Jeepers Creepers guys how did you get a studio to fund this?
B00005QZWI|5.0|The Lord of the Ring, The Fellowship of the Rings soundtrack by Howard Shore has definitely got to be one of the best musical works ever recorded.  I listened to the soundtrack before the movie came out and was totally captivated.  It follows the movie perfectly and is a wonderful blend of sounds. It is not often that a whole soundtrack is enjoyable.  Usually there is at least one or two sections that are hard to endure or more often than not there are just one or two that are endurable.  This soundtrack is exquisite from beginning to end.  This is definitely my favorite CD of all time,  bar none!!!

B00001QEE7|5.0|After months of waiting, I borrowed this DVD from the library yesterday and was once again blown away by the film, appearing here fully restored and in its grand widescreen format, preserving the original 1:66:1 aspect ratio.  Simply put, this is the BEST way to experience the magic of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" at home until the eagerly anticipated \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD appears in fall 2008 -- I'd like to point out, too, that contrary to several other reviews on Amazon.com, this DVD plays great and didn't freeze on me once.<br />However, that's where the goodness of this disc ends.<br />The disc has no special features whatsoever.  Oh, sure, you can switch the language to Spanish or French, but there's no juice.  Not a single tidbit about the making of, no trivia game, no sing-along, nothing.  For this gem of a movie, I'dve expected more.  All the more reason to look forward to 2008's two-disc \\"Platinum Edition\\" reissue, which will be fully rerestored, THX certified, and bursting at the seams with bonuses.<br />Still, if you can find it, get this DVD -- until 2008, this is the ultumate \\"Little Mermaid\\" home entertainment experience.<br />***** (5/5) solely because of the supurb presentation of the film.  Poor DVD, but get it anyway.

0140177396|5.0|On the surface this allegorical tale is a short and simple story about the fate two friends encounter when they hire on in a new ranch to buck barley`. As Lennie and George are two poor wandering labourers their friendship is based purely on their companionship. The friendship is sustained by its complexity which has evolved as a result of the the influencing factors of the relationship. What makes this friendship very poignant is their awareness that this is their unique asset and that this sets them apart them from the mass of other casual labourers who are sad loners as a rule. George looks after Lennie who is retarded, but also big and awesomely powerful. Lennie doesn't mean any harm but he gets into situations where he becomes confused and he invariably panics. Consequently, the calamitous potential of his physical power looms constantly.  One of the first things they witness in the bunkhouse is that an old dog, the time-honoured companion of the disabled old Candy, is shot by one of the other men with the declared purpose of putting him out of his misery. The dog's owner Candy is against this but gets no support from the others and has to endure the ordeal in a state of crushed acquiescence. They wanted to get rid of him anyway because he caused a smell in the bunkhouse which, of course, puts a  question  mark over the purity of the asserted altruism (the old story of pragmatism first and principles later). George and Lennie have their own modest version of the American Dream in the shape of a little ten-acre farm they dream about buying. But the `bindle bum's' existence is a repeating short cycle of  earning a little and then frittering it away on short-term whims to make life bearable. When Candy hears about the little farm he informs them of his savings and asks to be part of it. The sudden and very unexpected feeling that the realisation of the dream is within their grasp causes a sort of incredulous euphoria and the mantras are repeated more often and more zealously. But catastrophe is always looming and when it happens, George saves Lennie from a terrifying ordeal by taking Lennie's life at that moment when Lennie is in a state of bliss, induced by George, dreaming of the farm. This novella is written in a very concise manner. In spite of the brevity, the story and the characters are plausible. The themes seem to me to definitely have a universal aspect but they are also unique to the setting.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This movie started life as a 1 hour episode.  When it was turned into a movie, the script was kept at its episode length, and the  move was legnthened by adding gee-wiz visuals of V'Ger.  The first half hour is good.  The last half hour is good.  The middle hour just never gets going. I kept wating for interesting things between Decker and Ilia, but nothing ever happened.  The crew seems to just sit around waiting for the last half hour to come so they can do something.<br />Still it isn't a truely dreadfull movie.  (Trek V pretty much defines the low end of the Trek quality spectrum.)  It isn't even a bad one.  It is just overly slow.  It has beautifull graphics and special effects that mostly still hold up against later Trek movies.  The soundtrack is gorgeous.  The new Enterprise was very cool at the time.<br />This director's cut improves on the original quite a bit, but it is still just a good movie.<br />In the story arc of the 6 \\"original series\\" movies, I generally rank this equal, or maybe just a hair above Trek 3.  I give it 3 stars, the Amazon defined \\"I like it\\" rank.  Because I do like it.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|Many records have a couple of good songs which stand out on a record and that is what you have paid for. On this second Duran LP, you pay very little and get decades worth of enjoyment. Each song on this New Romantic anthem click. The remastered version of the album is much different from the album I originally bought as a high schooler, but it's nice to hear each instrument individually now. Plus, it has a little harder edge to it especially on &quot;My Own Way&quot;, &quot;Lonely in your Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Hold Back the Rain&quot;.

B000006NPY|5.0|We all know the sad sad story. After Mellon Collie, the Pumpkins totally reworked their sound to a very low-key approach, with hardly any distortion pedals in sight and only two or three solos to be found...and what happened? All the little mindless sheep-like teeny bopper &quot;fans&quot; who had latched on to the band during Mellon Collie only cos they saw the videos on MTV (which meant they HAD TO BE FANS of the latest big thing, otherwise how could they keep being cool in the eyes of their mindless friends right?) bailed ship cos this wasn't Mellon Collie 2, Electric Bugaloo. What they would have realized, had they been REAL fans, is that the Pumpkins NEVER repeated themselves EVER. They had a new idea with each album and they committed to every one...whether it was a good choice to make career-wise or not. But the Pumpkins have never gone with the grain. For example when they started, bands were mostly playing 3 minute solo-less pop tunes. But anyhow, this album will most likely be viewed someday as the most unjustly overlooked album of the 90s. Billy unleashes his most powerful solo ever on &quot;For Martha.&quot; For years he's been soloing up and down that fretboard, and he finally finds perfection in a few simple slowly-played notes. Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete is a lovely graceful tune. To Sheila...man, I'll never forget the day I first heard that. I bought the album on its release date, rushed over to my girlfriend's house, and threw this in her CD player. We listened, mesmerized. When that solo in For MArtha burst out of the speakers I grabbed her and started waltzing around her living room...what an endearing, triumphant record.
1556154844|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. The programming community desperately needs some basic standards for how to write good code that is readable and extensible, and therefore time-saving and cost-conscious. In hundreds of pages of text worth reading, McConnell's thesis boils down to one simple point: Great code should be great bathtub reading. The reader should have a basic facility of the language, but if the reader can't decipher the code without having to flip extensively from page to page or carefully tracking variables, it isn't great code. This book provides many guidelines to writing good code. And it's not just theoretical: The author bases his tenets on behavioral research of programmers. More importantly, the practices outlined here are mostly common sense. Sadly though, these tenets are, in my experience, not very often followed. If you are a programmer and you are not following McConnell's basic guidelines, you are not good at what you do -- no matter how much you think differently. Whether you are a beginner or a pro, read it!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Seeing as how I liked &quot;Almost Famous&quot; when it was in theaters, the idea of a longer version was at the very least a concern.  While I was sure it would add more to the experience in general, I did in fact fear that it would have material that would have been better off on the cutting room floor.  Luckily, this &quot;Untitled&quot; version was great, and improved on an already good movie.  The commentary with writer/director Cameron Crowe and others (including his own mother, no less) is worth a listen, if only to hear some of the details Crowe gives into the making of this film and stories from his experiences on the road in the 70's.  While the extras are sparse, this is of little consequence to my viewing experience.  The skeleton of this DVD set (the bootleg and theatrical version) is more than enough to keep me satisfied.
6305364613|4.0|I write this as someone who has actually seen only the first fifteen minutes or so of this movie about five times and none of the rest. But each time I saw these same scenes I enjoyed them. And the last time I watched it was after I had begun reading the play of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in school and was getting very interested in Shakespeare`s work, and I realized that the movie is a lot easier to understand if you have read the play and you`re familiar with the lines. If not easier, it`s a lot more fun that way because then you can see how the way Luhrman brings it to the screen with such a different setting is very creative and stunning. And the amazing thing is that nothing about the story is changed at all, it`s just the setting. After a while watching this movie you`ll start enjoying the strangeness in a guy throwing his cigarette to the ground and drawing his gun as he says &quot;Peace? I hate the word as I hate hell, all Montagues and thee.&quot;<BR>I personally am very excited to see the rest of this movie once I am finished reading the play. Though I would have advised it for &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; I`m not going to say that you should get this movie NOW and watch it the whole way through because I promise you`re going to love it. But I will say that you should definitely try it out and see if you like it, because you might really enjoy it, especially if you are any kind of Shakespeare enthusiast.
B0000062GK|4.0|Sure, this album is much like Satriani's others, consisting mostly of blazing solos and power ballads. BUT, Joe's talent with the guitar is second to none. Despite the repetition of some tracks, there's not a dull moment to be had, and at times, his axework reaches ferocious levels that are a wonder to behold. Highlights include the title track, &quot;Psycho monkey,&quot; and the dynamic &quot;Train of Angels,&quot; which proves that even a raging guitar can be harmonious. First rate guitar work all around, and some good backup efforts (esp. on bass) make this a real treat for those who enjoy Satriani. Highly recommended to Joe's fans, and those who like Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen may also enjoy this.
078401213X|5.0|The movie PI centers around a Qabalistic principle that the sacred name of G-d is secreted away in the Hebrew text of the Torah.  Through the course of the movie, a mathemetician searching for patterns in the stock market stumbles across a pattern in the Torah that may lead to the discovery of the 216 letter Name.  In a fantastic, surreal story, you can feel Max's pain of genius.  All of the qabalistic math shown in the movie is accurate; Theta does approach 1.618 and AB+AM=ILD, and the true name of G-d does hold 72 syllables of three letters each (216 letters.)  But the relations between these principles is the fictional genius of Aranofski.

The movie that, largely brought Disney back to the scene--just as Cinderella did for the Studio in 1950.<br />The movie itself gets 5 stars, but the DVD gets 3 because there are not any bonus features. But I found the picture to be great...and Ariel's movie deserves the highest honors.  I unfortunately missed the theatrical release of this film in 1989, but have fallen in love ever since.  Ursula is a divine villainess...Ariel a fine heroine, and Sebastian and Flounder exceptional friends for her to have!  And the songs!  Wow!  <br />The Little Mermaid is such a hit, and stellar of a movie, that Disney has put it into its Platinum line--tentatively scheduled for 2008 (Just 6  years!).  While I have this DVD, and it makes me very happy (free with my preorder of Snow White--another gem!) I will definitely buy the 2 disc set, bursting with bonus features too!  <br />Great movie to have...enjoy!  Great songs, great characters...a great theme...great animation!

0920668372|5.0|I never found this book \\"creepy,\\" and neither did my son, to whom I first read it when he was about 2 years old. He loved it then...he missed the message, but adored the thought of his mommy rocking him in her lap forever and ever.<br />For those who insist on finding hidden agendas in every book on earth, and who must put a political twist on every simple thing, may I offer a suggestion? Give your child a warm bath, dress him in his jammies, and take him and his blankie or bear onto your lap. Hold him close and rock him while you read this book. I guarantee you, the message he'll get is that your love is utterly secure, unbreakable, and forever. Is that bad?<br />My son went through all the stages depicted in the book, predictably and not without angst for his mother! Now he is 16, he towers over me, he has dredlocks (don't ask) and a deep voice. Yesterday, apropos of nothing, he said, \\"Mom, remember that book you used to read to me about the mother rocking the son? I just want you to know when you are old like that, I will come and rock YOU, just like the book.\\" And he gave me an awkward half-man, half-boy hug.<br />Is that \\"creepy\\"? If it is, that's just the type of creepiness we need more of in this world. Children need to believe that they are loved no matter what they do and how \\"horrible\\" they get. This book says that in the most beautiful way. I'm glad I read it to him then, I'm glad I have it now, and I insist on taking it for what it is, a thoroughly beautiful and wonderful book.

0694003611|5.0|Some books become experiences in themselves, and as any parent who cherishes this book can tell you, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is one of those books.<br />The lush illustrations, full of detail and delight, give us a good view of the bunny's room as he gets ready to say goodnight and go to sleep. At the beginning of the story, his room is still light. Bunny is protracting the bedtime like any self-respecting toddler--in his case, he is saying \\"goodnight\\" to every single object in his room.<br />My children and I read this in a cadence that became part of the book. They chanted it along with me, and never tired of finding the elusive mouse, whose whereabouts change from page to page. We all said goodnight to everything in the room together--the comb and the brush and the bowl of mush were huge favorites.<br />Finally, the room darkens, the bunny's eyes start to close, and hopefully, one's own children are in the same condition. I love this book, as do my children, and hopefully when the time comes, their children will as well.

Back then, production wasn't what it is today, the band was so high they didn't know an amplifier from a toaster oven, and they were poor as dirt.  Those problems, combined with Combat Record's mistake of loosing the intended artwork, really caused this album some problems in the early going.<br />Now, in 2002, you can relive the glory of what this Thrash Metal classic accomplished.  It's all there... the liner notes, the correct lyrics, AMAZING production, the originally intended artwork, and a picture of the Megadeth original lineup to boot.  If that's not enough, they have also added These Boots in a special edition format, and the three song demo that got them signed.<br />This album is a MUST HAVE for all fans of Thrash Metal and/or Megadeth.  The late Gar Samuelson would be proud!
0552997692|4.0|There can be few people whose spines do not prickle with apprehension at the moment the preacher asks: 'Does anyone know any just cause why these two should not be joined together in holy matrimony....?'<BR>Our heroine is about to be the centre of a society wedding which will hit every front page in the land. She's marrying the son of one of the world's richest men and her mother, a social-climber extraordinaire, is fussing and list-making 24 hours a day. <BR>Everything is set, guests are being helicoptered in, the organist is flying from Geneva, ice swans are being sculpted.....there is just one small problem.  Ten years before the bride married a gay friend for immigration purposes, and never actually got a divorce!  When the photographer recognises her, she is thrown into a panic and tries, in secret to \\"put matters right\\".  She has less than 4 days to find and divorce a man she hasn't seen in a decade.<BR>Madeleine Wickham knows people so well and draws them beautifully. The set-aside father, bemused by his wife's tireless efficient anxiety, the dizzy bride who somehow thought that if she didn't admit to the previous wedding it would go away, the career-girl sister who is always so in control of her life (or is she?).<BR>You know people like this - and if you don't - the author brings them to life on the page so vividly that when you reach the last page you have the feeling you are saying goodbye to old friends.<BR>Intertwined in this desperate dash to save face, is a sadder story of how it is still not always possible to be proud of being gay, or to accept who you really are.
6305922756|4.0|Rob Reiner delivers the goods in this hilarious &quot;documentary style&quot; account of the rock group &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;.  This movie is a direct parody of the 70's music scene.  If you remember that time period, you can take the journey back...but this time, be ready for the laughter.  I strongly recommend this movie to musicians - especially those who performsd during this time setting.  They'll truly appreciate the humor!  This DVD is a &quot;must see&quot;.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Derek Sherinian left the DT keyboards - and Jordan Rudess (Dixie Dregs, Liquid Tension Experiment) jumped in. And it's good that he did! After publishing a prog milestone with &quot;Images And Words&quot;, and after cranking out mediocre stuff in the years to follow, DT is back again in the prog front row. Jordan already joined DT for the &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; album, but on &quot;Six Degrees&quot;, he has taken over a large amount of the songwriting responsibility. According to a Mike Portnoy interview in a german metal journal, Jordan has actually written most parts of the 42-minute title track on CD2. If you know Jordan's solo project &quot;Feeding The Wheel&quot;, you have plenty of evidence that this must be true. Actually, CD2 is what makes this album worth buying. CD1 is not bad at all - but it's not particularly exciting - hence only four stars. It's good old DT stuff in the usual style, no more, no less. Anyway, the title track will certainly mark another milestone in the history of prog.
B00004VVND|5.0|It must be the inspiration for films such as Robocop, Total Recall etc. And I know the director Michael Crichton went on to direct Jurassic Park.<br />It's a favourite, if not one of the greatest ever sci-fi's. Yul Brynner at his greatest. A robot in an adult fantasy adventure park, out of control, running amok, chasing a guest through West World, Roman World, Medievil World. Has his face partially ripped off, to expose a totally believable 1970's special effects cyborg face. Brynners performance is brilliant to the end, after rising for a final time after having acid thrown in his face!
B000059HCJ|5.0|I saw this movie about a year ago, and it still haunts me.  It is clearly a work of art, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to loved ones to see because it is so very devastating and soul-wretching.  Not since Shindler's List and Born on the Fourth of July, have I experienced such a shattering film experience.<br />I felt such empathy for the Ellen Burstyn character!  So naive and such an innocent dream - to appear on her favorite tv show and be able to wear her favorite dress!  The Marlyn Wayans character tugged at my heart, too.  He was clearly a good guy who got caught up in bad things.  The other characters were clearly not evil.  Yet, they all ended up damaged beyond redemption - no happy ending.  Death would have been merciful, yet they were cursed to live.<br />After I saw this movie, I could not sleep for a week, cried at inopportune times, and my family thought I was nutty.  A friend of mine saw this film, also, and every time we discussed it, we were almost in tears.<br />Many of us know characters somewhat like those in the movie.  Such a cautionary tale - if one goes too far, one might not find one's way back.  SUCH a powerful movie, yet I have no desire to see it again.  Once was enough!

B00005R87Q|4.0|Why do we watch \\"B\\" movies?  T & A, right?  Well they replaced the T & A with cars in this movie.  I am not into the Japanese four banger hot rods. I am an American Muscle Car fanatic.  This movie changed some of my views.  The cars in the movie are just plain pretty (especially the one and only Muscle Car, a blown 1968-69 Dodge Charger).  I had no idea the kind of power these cars could produce.  Granted, the acting left something to be desired.  It was bearable, however.  This was an ideal example of a \\"B\\" movie, right down to the Cheesy on liners ('I live my of a quarter of a mile at a time').  Your proverbial \\"naked women\\" have been replaced with a lot of really nice (expensive) cars.  The plot is simple to follow.  I rated this movie as high as I did because of what it is.  It is a great \\"B\\" movie.
B00005N53P|5.0|It is high time unpretentious rock makes a return, and the Strokes are the perfect leaders of such a movement. With all the macho nu-metal bands, it is a relief to hear New York City Cops, Last Night, Trying Your Luck, and so forth. There is definitely a &quot;regional&quot; feel to this album - no doubt they are a New York band, and it sounds like they have drawn inspiration from the best without ripping off anyone. Their second album will not be released soon enough.
B00004XQ83|2.0|O Brother where this stuff come from? Now I love country music but this is not the same thing as country music this is Bluegrass. I gave this a listen and I was in a coma by the time it ended. Now I know the music is supposed to sound old here but the sound was terrible. The movie stunk at the box office because the movie was boring and so is the soundtrack. This is got to be one of the most over hyped soundtracks I have ever heard of. There are so many complaints in music magazines as to why country radio is not playing this mountain music because this is not todays country! I remember where I live the radio started playing I am a man of constant sorrow and it annoyed people so much that the DJ even said she would not play it anymore. Now I know my review is probably going to annoy alot of you lovers of this soundtrack but do not take hard. We have a right to say what we want! I am just saying that this is overhyped and I do not understand what people are seeing in this soundtrack. For anyone who hates this soundtrack like me its O.K to hate this because I know many people who do.
B000002UD0|5.0|John Lennon's Walls and Bridges is a classic. Despite the wasteland that had become John Lennon's life, the music, angst, and polish that is Walls and Bridges will stand forever as one of Lennon's best efforts.<br />To get the album in perspective, one needs to look at John's life in 1974...the year of Walls and Bridges release. John is separated from Yoko. In January, John asks the queen for a royal pardon of his drug conviction that is being used in an attempt to deport him from the U.S. He is denied. In March, John makes the papers during a visit at the Troubadour nightclub in Los Angeles. He is heard making uncouth comments to the Smothers Brothers and seen with a sanitary napkin on his head. John ends up being ejected from the club. With a little help from his friends Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon, Lennon manages to stay fairly drunk, occasionally surfacing to produce Nilsson's album Pussy Cats and write a song or two.<br />In July, the Justice Department orders John to vacate the US within 60 days or face deportation. Lennon appeals. Lennon helps Elton John with \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"One Day (at a Time)\\", which was the B-side of the single. September sees the release of Walls and Bridges. In October, John gets his first post-Beatles Number One hit single with \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night.\\"<br />In short, 1974 was a year of chaos and joy for John Lennon. Walls and Bridges reflects that chaos and joy quite well. \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" and \\"Scared\\" clearly reflect the pain he felt during 1974. However, \\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\\" show John's bouts with better days.<br />The supporting cast of musicians is too numerous to name, but there are two `guest' musicians of note: Elton John and Harry Nilsson. Kudos go to Elton John for his role in getting John Lennon back on track and reunited with Yoko Ono. All in all, Walls and Bridges is a great blast from the past from one of the most talented Beatles.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is definitely one of the best CDs i've ever bought.  All the songs are great.  These 6 guys are so talented! I would recommend &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; to anyone, even if you don't usually listen to this kind of music.  It's amazing!
B000002UD1|5.0|After the Beatles meandered their separate ways, John Lennon released two studio albumsPlastic Ono Band and Imaginethat were pure genius, though not received exceptionally well by the buying public. Some Time in New York City, Lennons third serious studio effort, was a royal stinker that seemed born from a drug and alcoholic stupor. Lennons problems with Yokowhich stemmed from his excessive drinking and the threatened deportation during the Nixon yearsseemed enough to reduce his genius to pure drivel. Despite his continuing difficulties with alcohol and drugs, John managed to pull himself together for a period of intensely creative output. Mind Games was the first of three superb albums that would improve on the previous one exponentially. Before John Lennon retired to become a house husband and enjoy Seans childhood, he left a legacy of three extremely fine albumsMind Games, Walls and Bridges, and Rock n Roll.<br />The centerpiece of Mind Games was the continuing saga of John and Yokos difficulties with the US government. The liner notes contains a Declaration of Nutopia, which is a conceptual country built on the logical outcome of Imagine. The Nutopian International Anthem is a four-second period of silence on the album.<br />Mind Games remains one of the most powerful songs ever written by Lennona perfect marriage of the genius and smart aleck that was John Lennon. Remember the Beatle who responded to the question, How did you find America? with I turned left at Greenland? Lennon even had a name for himself during this period that seemed to sum up that genius/smart aleck wellDr. Winston OBoogie.<br />Love songs One Day (At a Time) and Out the Blue are very poignant looks at the condition of love. Although Lennon had left Yoko for the company of May Pang, the songs are quite obviously aimed at Yoko.<br />With the exception of Meat City, Mind Games represents a mellow Lennon. There are no overt rockers, just powerful songs from a man whose life is seemingly falling apart. The Plastic Ono Band members were Ken Ascher, David Spinozza, Gordon Edwards, Jim Keltner, Michael Brecker, and Sneaky Pete.ennon.

B00005UEAR|4.0|I really, really hate to say it, but be warned: if you're expecting this album to be as good as Scenes From A Memory, you're in for a letdown. Now, it's not really fair to compare an album that is undoubtedly a band's magnum opus to their newest work, but it's hard not to do it in this instance. But then again, I had extremely high expectations for this one. After the fantastic Scenes and subequent tour (and live album), the band certainly seemed to be on a roll, and then, when I saw the tracklisting for this one (with times), I just about wet my pants. Also, a pre-release review touted it as &quot;not only the best from Dream Theater, but one of the best prog ever.&quot; Alas... Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a fine album by any other standard. Disc 1 contains some of the classic Dream Theater sound, but it also find the band experimenting in various ways. The Glass Prison is an excellent opening track (one thing fans will immediately notice is the static fade-in that ties this album in with Scenes From A Memory), featuring the aggressive type of lyrics that Mike Portnoy usually writes. Blind Faith has some heavy-handed lyrics for what some people used to term as a Christian band (though they are written by James LaBrie, who turns in two lyrics on this album.) Misunderstood, though over 9 minutes long, is a simple ballad. It's beautiful in its way, though not prime meat. The Great Debate is a good song, but... come on, guys; you just don't write songs like that. This near-14-minute piece deals with the subject of stem cell research (complete with several minutes of voice-overs.) The last time Dream Theater tried social commentary (on Just Let Me Breathe) they came off sounding corny, and it's even worse here. Still... this song is good. But, come on... you're not Bob Dylan; you're Dream Theater. Not a bad song by any means, but don't look for them to play this one live. Disappear is a nice ballad with lyrics by James LaBrie that closes the first disc. These songs just mentioned (though undoubteldy Dream Theater, for their unsurpassed musicianship alone) show some signs of influence. I kept thinking, &quot;Tool! Tool!&quot; in my head when I first heard this album, and I'm glad to hear that I'm not crazy: lots of other people have mentioned the seeming Tool influence as well. The Glass Prison and, especiallly, The Great Debate (helped by its voiceovers, although the band always did that back when Kevin Moore was onboard) sound particularly Tool-esque. They could almost be Tool songs at certain points (before the highly technical stuff gets in.) On the other hand, I don't rightfully see the Radiohead influence that a lot of people have mentioned with regards to Disappear and, perhaps, Misunderstood. Perhaps it's there, but it's not as overt as the Tool (or, as we shall see, Pantera) influence. So, as you can see, the first disc is somewhat uneven; however, as for the second disc, all I can say is... Wow! The epic title track is truly one of Dream Theater's best pieces of music yet. The long overture is masterly and, for me, the highlight of the album. Jordan Rudess turns in some synth playing that truly sounds like a symphony orchestra (I've seen reviewers already refer to it as such.) Petrucci and (especially) Portnoy also shine on this part. The lyrics are fairly nice, each focusing on a different aspect of mental illness (six different degrees), and James's singing (which was questionable in bits on the first disc) is much, much better here. You have to wonder why Mike and John are taking so many vocal turns when they have the best singer in prog... but the stacatoo vocal melodies on The Test That Stumped Them All are undoubtedly cool. This epic tracks winds from extremely heavy (the latter track, which sounds very, very Pantera-esque; Mike and John were reportedly inspired to write an extremely heavy track after witnessing said band in concert) to beautiful ballad pieces (Goodnight Kiss.) The only thing that could've made this track better is... the Grand Finale. There isn't one! It's almost as if a track is missing. The last track on the album is labelled &quot;Losing Time/Grand Finale&quot;; from that one would rightfully expect some kind of instrumental closing piece (such as the incredible orchestra/drum coda on Finally Free, from Scenes), perhaps a re-working of the Overture. But no... it is in fact only a one-minute fadeout! Strange... still, this is overall a very good Dream Theater album. I can't say it's as good as Scenes was - but, then again, what is, folks? The band are in fine form, there are several great instrumental sections (Jordan really shines on the overture), and John Myung's bass can actually be heard! He seems to have turned it up on this album. Also, Portnoy is better than ever here; at the top of his game, it's clear that he is simply the best drummer in rock right now. Tracks such as the Glass Prison and the title track showcase his incredible skills, and... he knows it, too. Indeed, he credits himself as playing &quot;Lead Drums&quot; on this album. Alas, if you had his talent, you probably would, too. All in all, another very good Dream Theater album, though not another Scenes. Why is it not another Scenes? Well, aside from the fact that it's just pretty damn near impossible to top, you almost have to wonder how inspired or ready the band really was this time... in interviews during the recording of the album they were quoted as saying things like &quot;We're not going to try to top our last record; we're just going to go in and make an album...&quot; Thinking along those lines is always dangerous. Also, they were under a time limit of sorts, as Portnoy and Petrucci actually had to write their lyrics while on the road with G3. Perhaps, overall, it was not the ideal situation for the band to turn out their best work. Of course, in the end, they gave us a good album, anyway. This will be a pretty hard prog album to top this year; all fans should be climbing up the walls. A must for any Dream Theater fan, or neo-prog enthusiast.
B00005NKCM|3.0|Finally Upstairs Downstairs appears on DVD - I had been putting off buying the VHS versions for ages, hoping for a DVD release.<br />Now I am wondering if it was worth waiting for.<br />Of course the episodes are marvellous - A great drama series about life in early 20th century London which, after more than 30 years, still holds up well. It is a shame however that the quality of the prints used by A&amp;E are (in places) quite bad.<br />It seems that A&amp;E have used old video masters for these DVD's, probably some that were sourced in the 80's for a video release or a re-broadcast on PBS. There has been no apparent restoration on these prints so you still have all of the usual video tape interference - It's just that now you are able to see that interference in full digital quality ! The episode 'A voice from the past' was particularly bad.<br />All of this may not be apparent to the casual viewer but if you have an eye for quality - something we have started to expect from DVD, then you will be disappointed by the picture (and sound)quality of some of the material on this DVD.<br />I have yet to purchase season 2 as I notice similar problems being reported with that set also.<br />Come on now A&amp;E - You were doing so well with your early DVD releases. Don't let the quality slip now that you have started to release some truly classic examples of TV at it's best.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is was a landmark album for U2, not to mention a calculated risk. How many bands, after releasing one of the biggest albums of the decade, would completely re-invent their sound? U2 did, and improved upon it. From the opening notes of Zoo Station, it's obvious that U2 have left their old sound behind, in exchange for a new one. Incorporating dance beats, electronica, and neo-psychedelia into their repetoire might not seem like the best of ideas, but this album proves that it worked for U2. It's arguably their best album. The lyrics are, in fact, very good - certainly Bono's best. It's a very personal album, full of heartbreak and tenderness, love and loss. U2 had never opened up in this way before, and have rarely done it since. The aforementioned Zoo Station is actually the least interesting track on the album; it is chock full of absolutely great songs: Mysterious Ways, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, So Cruel, and other among them. Then there's the hit Even Better Than The Real Thing. Achtung Baby didn't, perhaps, turn out as many hit singles as previous (or subsequent) U2 albums, but it is surely their best as an album. Of course, aside from all this, the album is worth purchasing alone for the absolutely masterly track, One. This song replaced New Year's Day as my favorite U2 track of all-time. It's still one of my favorite &quot;broken heart&quot; song, and one of the first I go to when I'm feeling down. This album is a major (perhaps the best) accomplishment in the catalog of a major artist, and kudos to U2 for risking the change. And for succeeding.
B00003CXI1|5.0|One of the best family movies to come out in recent times. There is something in this movie for children and adults alike. The content kept true to the book and the special effects were amazing only adding to the movie not overshadowing it. After seeing the movie, reading the book was even more enjoyable because faces and the events could be put to the words. This movie has already become a classic.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Sure the Clash were on a major label. Sure they probably made this album to go make money in the USA. Sure there's nary a 2 minute '**** you' burst with loud guitar. But the Clash cemented their place in punk history by breaking away from the that norm, which is what the whole punk ethic is about. The lyrics are intelligent and the band could freakin' play and play damn hard too. Respect!
B000002ADT|5.0|Ever been in a position where you avoid something...simply because people are forcing it on you?  I have never watched an episode of &quot;Friends&quot; simply because people kept telling me I would love it.  And so it is with &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot;<br />Who knew?  I guess I did.<br />No failing to live up to expectations here.<br />More impulsive than &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; and less structured than &quot;Sketches of Spain,&quot; this album feels both relaxed and rich, complex but soothing.<br />Working through the timelines, I would guess that with this album, Davis did as much to free jazz artists as the camera did to free portrait artists.<br />Consider the tight structure of Brubeck or the levity of Charlie Parker...and then listen to this album again.  Davis may have done as much to being free jazz from structure as Jelly Roll Morton did 50 years prior.  (Sure, Jelly claims to have INVENTED Jazz, but that's another discussion.)<br />Yeah, this album is as good as everyone has told you it is.  And, if you are, like me, dragging your feet about it, you're only wasting your time.  This really is one of the greatest jazz albums - ever.<br />I am still avoiding &quot;Friends.&quot; though.
B00003CXXI|1.0|I'll admit first of all that I did not see this movie in theaters (I'm very happy I didn't waste the money), but had heard it was worth a view and was getting all the best of reviews from the major critics. I wish I had never seen it. I almost believe that my blind faith in its \\"horridness\\" prior to my seeing it should have been left as it was. After viewing the movie on DVD once (and not wanting the movie to ever touch the tray on my DVD player ever again), I wondered suddenly to myself, \\"what was it about this movie that every critic (and person for that matter) found so compelling?\\" I could personally not see past the numerous fart jokes and bathroom humour clouding up the picture. The premise of the entire movie was sentenced to death past the 45 minute point, the uphill struggle had begun at that point. The tiring Donkey character (a far cry from anything even remotely entertaining that Disney has ever done) really got on my nerves. Along with that, Shrek, as horribly unlikeable as he is, had become such a moronic character at that point that I simply wanted snap the disc in half and never speak of it again.<br />In order to leave this review short, let me suggest that all who decide to watch or listen to this movie must please consider a blindfold and some earplugs.<br />Beware the post-credit sequence, it's voice acting at its very worst (well, that kind of describes the entire movie).
B00005OM4N|4.0|It is a nice put together album, like many have commented though it does seem like a technically produced album, including Britney. You're not able to hear HER, like the music is drowning her out on some songs.<br />Having said that though, the album is a fun album. I bought the album not really looking for VOICE from Britney Spears but for FUN. And in my opinion, that's what I got.<br />I don't understand why people give her a hard time, I remember Madonna and Janet starting out the same way-and still continue success and neither of them have a great voice either and look at where both of them are!! Britney, I think will be around as long as Madonna and Janet has.
B000002H33|5.0|Wow!  This CD will blow you away.  The heavyness of the CD is incredible.  I mean it kicks a**.  <BR>Track 1:  The CD starts out on the 300 beat per minute Battery.  <BR>Track 3:  The Thing That Should Not Be is one of Metallica's heaviest tunes to date.<BR>Track 4:  Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is a complex, intricate song that is organized wonderfully.  <BR>Track 5:  Disposable Heroes is a tune for the extreme metalist.<BR>Track 6:  Leper Messiah is a awesome metal jam song that has a awesome solo.  <br />Track 7:  Orion is a complex instrumental that is beautiful with all of the rhythms.<BR>Track 8:  Damage, Inc.  is a 300 + beat per minute tune that talks about meanless violence so watch out.  What a great way to end an album!<BR>But by far the album belongs to the best song ever and the title track; Master Of Puppets.  This song has complex rhytms, a beautiful interlude, a solo that is one of the greatest ever, it is one of the heaviest ever songs ever, it has brutal lyrics, and total insanity.  Master Of Puppets makes you want to pick up and instrument and play until you drop.  I mean it is so crisp and perfect.  Hetfeild plays incredible difficult rhythms that are total perfect in there time frame.  Hammett plays a wonderful solo that just makes any guitar player feel inferior.  Burton (R.I.P.) lays down the law for any bass player.  He plays the bass better than anyone.  Ulrich's pounding drums reaches down to your soul.  The song climaxes with horrizing laughes from every corner of the speakes as the chord fades out of the best song recorded.  <BR>Everyone buy this CD.  It is so heavy and the arrangment of the CD will never be matched by anything else.  So I mean this isthe greatest metal band ever Metallica, at their all-time best.  This CD is second only to Guns N' Roses' Appetite For Destruction.
B00005V0X5|4.0|The remaster is a HUGE improvement over the original recording! It's louder, more clearer, and modernized. Just sounds like a whole new record!<br />The downside: These Boots is heavily edited b/c that was the only way it would be allowed on the record. There are a lot of things beeped out in that track.<br />Also, the demos aren't that great as they are only demos. The sound quality is poor. These are the demos Megadeth used to get their record deal. But all in all, this is a KILLER RECORD!!
0448060191|4.0|Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War?  Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this.  In Little Women, there's a family of seven.  Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War.  The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather.  Then they start vying each other for his attention.  Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc.  Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.<BR>  Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students.  The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary.  It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.<BR>  Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times.  Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\".  Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father.  At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry.  For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.<BR>  The content of the book is very good.  It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories.  A lot of the places in the book are real to.  For examole, Virginia.  The book teaches a very good moral.  Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.<BR>  If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!
B00005ASGG|5.0|Among the many John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, this unassuming gem has had such staying power that it should be placed on the same Western altar as the more widely regarded The Searchers.  Of note, Wayne's character is in almost a supporting role to Stewart's (the latter at least 10 years too old for the part), who gets both the girl and the fame as TMWSLV.  Not known for either irony or understatement, Ford crafts a tale in which the more heroic character dies an obscure death in old age, and  people with modern talents actually carry the day by winning an election.  The movie seems mockishly premodern - black and white and with production values that look like they are from a '50s teleplay. Without the starpower, this might be mistaken for an episode of Death Valley Days. But, what an episode!
B00005LMBK|5.0|Really great album. The Gorillaz expertly blend a nice mix of club, dub, reggae, hip hop, punk and mix it all in wonderful blend of sound. Hip-Hops fans will rejoice over cuts like \\"Rock the House\\" and \\"Clint Eastwood\\", yet clubbers will like joints like \\"Slow Country\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\" and more. This is a great alternative to all of that annoying bubble gum pop and rehashed Hip-Hop that's flooding the market. Any true fan of great music needs this album.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I implore you to read and obey ALL of the previous reviewers who gave this wasted 90 minutes a poor review. It is truly that bad. Was Clive Barker paid for his shining endorsement on the cover? Not only will I never see another film by the makers of this one, I will avoid all of his from now on. This movie doesn't know if it's a sci-fi, a horror, a teen spook flick, Silence Of The Lambs, or Nightmare On Elm Street, and changes gears so many times throughout its duration that the viewer isn't quite sure either. Only because it is suggested so strongly as the film progresses, I got the impression that there was no working script but the director saying \\"Yea, now this would be cool for the next scene!\\" Absolutely no sense is made throughout the film, nor is there any explination for the vague plot or the characters involved. Where did this goblin come from and why does he do what he does? The only insight we get is from a phychic from out of nowhere who was seemingly thrown in to awkwardly mouth something the writer was too poor to do himself or forgot to. Regardless, this movie is 100% horrible. Be afraid, be very afraid. (PS..Eileen Brennan, what were you thinking?)
B000001EL7|4.0|LOVE GUN is another short, classic, rocking album by KISS, the sixth and last album with the classic line-up. (Altough I think DYNASTY is very good an Anton Fig is a better drummer than Peter Criss). It has no great news, but an in-your-face production similar to DRESSED TO KIll. Very good.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is an incredible DVD and one that every Queensryche fan must have.<br />Those of you familiar with Queensryche know that they are one of the greatest bands to come out of the 90's.  Their alternative rock style combined with Geoff Tates amazing vocals is simply superb.<br />This dvd is from their Operation Mindcrime album, one of the greatest concept albums of all times.  In the class of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; this album tells a story throughout.<br />The DVD brings this to life with excellent 5.1 surround and spectacular digital sounds.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The Beatles...possibly the worst group of all time, they don't even deserve to be called rock n roll.  Their songs were completly pointless, and whoever says different must be on something.  Whoever called these men geniuses needs to be heavily sedated and then dragged to a barn where they will get some sense smacked into them.  If you want real rock check out Steely Dan and/or The Monkeys....garbage just pure and simple GARBAGE.
B00005JKQX|2.0|The central theme of A Beautiful Mind, which is supposedly based on the true story of John Nash is; the enduring love between Nash and his wife.  According to this movie her lifelong support of Nash led to his recovery from mental illness, and was the main reason he went on to win the Nobel Prize.  This is the story presented by the screenwriter and Ron Howard. Now lets look at the TRUE story of John Nash and see how it compares to the Hollywood version.<br />The REAL John Nash was not the loving family man shown on the screen. The REAL John Nash had NUMEROUS AFFAIRS with both women and men. One of these affairs resulted in the BIRTH of an ILLEGITIMATE CHILD whom John Nash ABANDONED and NEVER SUPPORTED. The REAL John Nash's destructive behavior resulted in his wife filing for a DIVORCE. They did NOT stay together as presented on the screen. The REAL John Nash tried on several occasions to RENOUNCE his American CITIZENSHIP. <br />If John Nash's story is as compelling as Ron Howard and his screenwriter would like audiences to believe, they wouldn't have had to rewrite it. The story as presented in the film is nothing like the REAL story of John Nash. The story as told is more of a fantasy than Lord of The Rings.  This is a pity because if they had stuck to the REAL story of John Nash they probably could have created a compelling film, case in point:<br />The movie Patton swept the Oscars and is considered a classic character study. Watch the movie and you will see that the screenwriters did not try to sugarcoat Patton's character in order to make him more appealing to audiences. He was shown at his best and worst. We saw him slapping and threatening to shoot the shell-shocked soldier, we saw his lack of disregard for his own men in order to beat Montgomery, etc. etc. <br />Ron Howard and the screenwriter of A Beautiful Mind should have been brave enough to present the REAL story of John Nash, complete with his faults rather than show us some sterilized version. <br />This is not the only problem with this movie. The pacing is tedious at times, and the plot can be hard to keep up with. The only saving grace of this film is the great performance by Russell Crowe.  <br />I had high expectations when I went to see this movie. I am a big fan of both Ron Howard and Russell Crowe, but this film as presented is a major disappointment, and it is not worthy of the Oscar for best picture.
B000059MEK|5.0|this is one of the best dance cd's out there. daft punk put together somg good beats and is all disco/house/techno music NOT POP! if you are thinking \\"homeowrk 2001\\" yor wrong :-( this isnt as repetetive as that cd, but it has some good repetetive songs on it. ir is all smooth and continous beats that you cant help to dance to! the best tracks are \\"one more time\\" \\"aerodynamic\\" \\"digital love\\" \\"harder, better, faster, stronger\\" \\" superheroes\\" \\"high life\\" \\"verdis quo\\" \\"short circut\\" and \\"face to face\\" they are other good songs too \\"crecendolls\\", but those are the best dance songs! you must buy this cd, it is worth the money $14.95 well, hope this was helpful
0792844793|5.0|Set in the quiet picture postcard logging community of Lumbertown, Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), a somewhat naive and squeaky clean college boy, finds a severed human ear. Shocked and disturbed he reports it immediately to the police whilst, with the help of his girlfriend (Laura Dern), he begins his own investigation, which soon leads him into stumbling into the seedy and violent world of abused nightclub singer Dorothy (Isabella Rosellini) and drug-sniffing psychopath (Dennis Hopper).<br />This is the first movie in which David Lynch really showed us all his cards and united themes and imagery, now familiar to millions through the likes of Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart and Twin Peaks. Although 16 years old, David Lynch's Blue Velvet has lost none of its shock value. It is still deeply and uniquely disturbing, at times incredibly surreal and utterly compelling viewing. Beautifully filmed and directed by Lynch, its aesthetic value is often deliberately at odds with the subject matter and it is a work of dark genius. It also features superb acting performances all round.  In particular, MacLachlan, Rosselinni, Dean Stockwell and Laura Dern shine, but it is Dennis Hopper's magnificent performance as a drug sniffing twisted psychopath that most people will remember.<br />Bizarre and frequently haunting, beautiful but frequently surreal, this is a movie that will stay with you for a very long time and really is a must see!
B00000ILDF|1.0|I was on fire after I watched Alien's, and couldn't wait to put the next installment into the dvd player. But, my friends, I couldn't get over the first five minutes. In those few moment's, it successfully grab's the entire purpose of the second film and throws it into the trash. I understand that by the time 3 came out the young girl (actress) was much too old to appear as young as she was before cryo-sleap. But, why kill her off? And the robot. Why? The soldier who was developing a crush on Ripley. Why? All dead. That made me so out of whack that I just couldn't enjoy the movie. I sat there perplexed in hopes that there would be something better in store for Ripley to take the place of her loss, or if even, to create something more exciting for the story line. I didn't feel the same tensity that was so dominant in the first two films. And coming from the director of Se7en, I am really surprised that the darkness couldn't have overcome that fault. Darkness in a film doesn't mean grit and gore, it means putting together the pieces of a puzzle in a mysterious circumastance. Not found here.<br /><br />Ripley is marooned with a bunch of religious skin heads that even though are supposed to be under a law of purification, use more \\"f\\" words than anything found in all the other films combined. (I thought that was funny and sad, wierd huh.) Anyway, as formula begat formula, anyone that tries to become close to Ripley in any shape form or fashion gets torn into gushy pieces. It became predictable after a while. - Someone is nice to Ripley - They get their face ripped off. I thought I was a psychic by the time the movie was over. Ripley shaves her head, and looks pretty cool. And no matter how much they tried, when you have a bucket-ful of alien's in the previous movie, One single alien (mutanized or not) just doesn't do the trick anymore. Been there - Done that - Seen that.<br /><br />If your on a mission to watch all of the Alien movies, then by all mean's watch it. But more than likely (if you share my opinion's) you will be sadly disappointed.(if you share my opinion's) you will be sadly disappointed.
6305657947|4.0|Generally speaking, I'm not a great fan of remakes and stepping into Hollywood legend Steve McQueen's shoes in what many considered to be a classic film would perhaps seem like an odd career move. However, Pierce Brosnan pulls it off with great style and I would go as far to say that although Pierce Brosnan may never reach the iconic status of Hollywood wild man Steve McQueen, this movie not only easily surpasses what was an over-rated original but it was also one of the best cinematic releases of 1999.<br />The plot of the original movie has been given a total makeover. Whereas in the original 1968 version, Steve McQueen organised a $2 million bank robbery, in a very 60's blow against the system, Brosnan pulls off an art robbery single handed, walking out a museum with a Monet painting worth fifty times the amount. However, the essence of the original movie has been retained, and revolves around a tough-nosed female insurance investigator conducting an ambiguous love affair (Rene Russo) with  millionaire playboy Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), whilst at the same time trying to trap her seemingly uncatchable quarry.<br />Conceived as a star vehicle between Bond movies by Pierce Brosnan's very own  Dreamtime Films as the perfect vehicle for his 007-buffed persona, the script underwent several rewrites, including ditching the script that later became the rival and disappointing Sean Connery/Catherine Zeta Jones movie `Entrapment'. And whereas Steve McQueen was surprisingly entirely cast against type in the 1968 original, the role of rugged bored playboy Thomas Crown fits Brosnan to an absolute tee. It is also to Director John McTiernan and Pierce Brosnan's credit that (the then) 45 year old Russo was cast opposite Brosnan in the role originally made famous by Faye Dunaway, unlike the ridiculous and almost sickening pairing of Grandfather Sean Connery and the young enough to be his granddaughter Catherine Zeta Jones in rival production `Entrapment'. Russo looks wonderful for her age and the sexual chemistry between her and Brosnan is excellent. As for John McTiernan (the top notch action Director behind such successful movies as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, Die Hard With A Vengeance) he doesn't try to copy the original in any way shape or form and thankfully avoids the split screen gimmickery of the original and instead replaces it with a much more glossy, snappy and modern style perfect for the movie.<br />All in all this is an excellent caper movie with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing and keep you happy. Well worth watching and well worth owning, this is one of the first titles I bought on DVD and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.ul for her age and the sexual chemistry between her and Brosnan is excellent.

B00000ILDE|5.0|Alien's is one of the most refreshing action film's that I've seen in a long time. It has all of the pieces needed to create a dazzling example of fine form and just plain slick wizadry.<br />Ripley awakens after being discovered in a decades old sleap. She is greeted upon awakening by \\"Mad about you\\" Paul Reiser, who shows he has more dirt under his fingernails than most think. After an entire colony of settler's disappear, Ripley is cohersed into returning to the planet which caused all of the problems in the first film. She goes on one condition: They don't go to study the Alien's (if there are Alien's), or to capture an Alien, but to kill them.<br />Once they land with a large crew of soldier's, they find the settler's are indeed missing, and they begin to find traces of resistances and soon discover that they are not the only ones alone on the planet. Bill Paxton is (unintentionally) hilarious as one of the soldier's, and has some of the more memorable quotes from the film:<br />\\"Game over man, Game over!\\"<br />\\"This can't be happenin', man, this can't be hapenin'.\\"<br />Also, an absolutely touching relationship is developed between Ripley and a young girl survivor. This is one of the stronger point's that alone could have been the film's back bone, even without all the extra goodies. (Entirely overlooked in the next movie.)<br />What it boil's down to is a lot of fun, and a great dvd to add to your collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is not a replica of the last album, while it still does retain some of the distinctive sounds with vague hints to the prior album, they are two different albums.  Morning View is a growth I think from Make Yourself. If you loved the last album you will find this one equally enjoyable. Songs like &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot; Just a Phase&quot; that teases the listener,  &quot;Mexico&quot; pleasantly mellow, &quot;Are You In&quot; with a great part vibe, and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; unique in sound but pleasing.  The album was a good transition from the last album.  Everyone should add this to their collection. I love it and I think that you will too.
B00005UEAR|4.0|There's an interesting mix of influences apparent with this double CD. As some people have mentioned, Yes, Pantera, and Pink Floyd seem to have worked their way into the Dream Theater subconscious. (Well, Floyd's been there already...just listen to &quot;Anna Lee&quot; off FII sometime.) But here's a strange similarity I noticed that I'd guess wasn't in the band's plans. &quot;Solitary Shell,&quot; one of my favorite tracks, sounds a lot like a band called The Samples. They like to employ upbeat piano work into their songs, as well. As for overall impressions, I really enjoy &quot;Misunderstood&quot; off disc 1 and the final four movements of disc 2, starting with &quot;Goodnight Kiss.&quot; These four movements are fairly mellow, so be forewarned if you're one of those people who only like Dream Theater when they're crunching off the power chords. But these four movements make me wish DT would cut an entire album of mellow, atmospheric songs. They have the talent and creativity to pull it off and make it incredible. On a final note, I give only four stars because nothing will ever compare to &quot;Scenes from a Memory.&quot; Longtime DT fans will not be disappointed.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke is a brilliant piece of animation. I really liked it a lot. It's the second movie done by Miyazaki that I have seen. The first was Sen To Chihhro which immediately became my favourite movie of all time. This movie is more epic in scope and the animation by Studio Ghibli is simply excellent. However, it had some scenes which were rather disturbing. Not recommended for very young children. For others, a must see movie.
B00003CXI1|5.0|they could not put everything or it would be way to long. they left out peeves.but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't see the movie or get the dvd.it was a great movie and i felt like seeing it again.i recommend it to anyone who likes a action-packed,sligtly scary,funny movie.
0446525537|5.0|This book was amazing. It was a story of a wonderful love between Jaime Sullivan and Landon Carter. You can see how much they loved each other on every page. I would reccomend it to everyone!
B00005RYKU|3.0|That there is nothing new under the sun is aptly demonstrated by this suspense/thriller which, though not too original, has some good moments and boasts a terrific performance by Leelee Sobieski.  All of which makes &#8220;The Glass House,&#8221; directed by Daniel Sackheim, worth a look.  It&#8217;s a road you&#8217;ve no doubt been down before, and pretty early on you have a good idea of where it&#8217;s going to wind up; but it&#8217;s well crafted and delivered, and serves as a showcase for Sobieski, who is one of the finest young actors in the business today.<br /> When their parents are killed in a car wreck, sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker (Sobieski) and her eleven-year-old brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), find themselves under the guardianship of Terrence and Dr. Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), who are apparently well off financially, and have a rather nice house that sits on a cliff in Malibu, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  It&#8217;s seemingly an idyll setting, but from the moment the children move in the climate within the household seems uncomfortable to all but Rhett.  Ruby senses something disconcerting with the arrangement, but there&#8217;s not much she can do about it.  The executor of the Baker&#8217;s will, Alvin Begleiter (Bruce Dern), advises Ruby that if it doesn&#8217;t work out with Mr. and Mrs. Glass, she and Rhett would become wards of the court; not a happy prospect.  It quickly becomes apparent to Ruby, however, that there&#8217;s more than meets the eye at play here, but to whom can she turn?  And therein lies the conundrum, because the answer is a resounding &#8220;no one.&#8221;  And especially in the wake of her parent&#8217;s death, that&#8217;s a tough thing for a sixteen-year-old to have to face.  What she doesn&#8217;t know, as well, is that it&#8217;s going to get a lot worse before it gets better.<br /> Director Sackheim does a good job of keeping up the tension in his film, but it could have been more effective had he employed a bit more subtlety and nuance.  And he has a troublesome affinity for camera shots through doors that are open just a crack, which allows one character (as well as the audience) to get a glimpse of another, as well as whatever is going on in the next room.  Initially, it works; but by the end of the film the impact it affords is diluted by overkill.  Things can only go bump in the night so many times, and you can only hold your breath so many times waiting for the eavesdropper to be discovered before it becomes second nature and ceases to be effective.  Even so, these are elements that can be overlooked, however, as Sackheim does keep it all moving along at a pace that sustains interest.  But the unimaginative ending is something of a letdown, and just too pat to ultimately have much of an impact.<br /> The saving grace of the film is clearly Sobieski, who as she matures is emerging as a cross between Helen Hunt and Jodie Foster, but with a talent and style uniquely her own.  In Ruby, she delivers a well rounded, three dimensional character which, in lesser hands, could easily have fallen into stereotype.  Ruby, however, is anything but.  This is a girl who comes from privilege (money, private school), and like any normal teenager has a certain disdain for her parents.  She knows her way around and is not beneath sneaking out into uncharted territory occasionally.  Sobieski makes her extremely believable, especially in her reactions to all that happens to and around her.  The scene in which she learns of her parent&#8217;s death is played very well, very real, as are the scenes in which her suspicions become increasingly aroused.  And it&#8217;s that level of realism she attains and brings to the character that carries the film.<br /> Diane Lane, on the other hand, does not fare as well.  Her performance as Erin is passable, but fairly weak.  She fails to bring anything to the role to make her character unique; it&#8217;s as if she never quite got a handle on who this person really is that she&#8217;s trying to portray.  To be fair, she does have her moments, but overall, her work here is average, at best.<br /> In Terry, Stellan Skarsgard creates a character who is not so much sinister as down right creepy.  He lacks the menace that would&#8217;ve made Ruby&#8217;s situation scarier, but in retrospect, his character is more real because of it.  And he has a slimy leer that is so very telling in regards to who Terry is.  Some of his actions at times seem too &#8220;staged,&#8221; like when he reaches across Ruby in the car to buckle her seat belt, but that falls on Sackheim, and is certainly not a reflection on Skarsgard&#8217;s performance, which is quite convincing.<br /> The supporting cast includes Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Michael O&#8217;Keefe (David Baker), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Chris Noth (Uncle Jack), Rachel Wilson (Hannah), Michael Paul Chan (Mr. Kim) and Carly Pope (Tasha).  Though not the greatest movie ever made, this one still has something to offer by way of atmosphere, some suspense, a few thrills and a decent (if not highly original) story.  But the main thing &#8220;The Glass House&#8221; has to offer is the memorable performance by Leelee Sobieski, who takes this film to a higher level single-handedly.  In the final analysis, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward storytelling, and it is entertaining; for a thriller, you could do much worse.  And that&#8217;s the magic of the movies.
0345413377|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is, of course, the last book in His Dark Materials.  It is, overall, a really great book, but I won't say anymore about the plot, since you can get that from the dust-jacket.<BR>In this book, we are introduced to a number of new and interesting people and places.  Philip Pullman always does an excellent job with that.  <BR>The ending, though, is a little disappointing.  I had one friend say that he wanted to through the book out the window once he read it.  But I think that the ending was really the best way for the series to close, even though it does tend to make the reader mad.<BR>If you like fantasy, then definitely read His Dark Materials.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The truly wonderful thing about Memento is the number of paradoxes it reveals in a second viewing, or a \\"backwards\\" viewing, for those more inclined to use the rewind button.  Joe Pantoliano's character, Teddy, is simultaneously honest and devious; Lenny (Guy Pearce) makes the conscious choice not to believe him because he is the only one who tells the painful truth.  When viewed the first time, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) seems cruel and deliberately fierce; only when her behavior is contextualized does it make sense.  And even then, the scene where she chastises Lenny, calling him a retard and a freak, is heartbreaking.<br />Critics either loved or hated the movie, and the ones who hated it said it lacked any depth in characterization.  I object heavily to this.  Lenny is urgent and displaced, but thanks to Guy Pearce's performance, he is one of the most intriguing characters in modern cinema.  He is incredibly likable, despite his being a walking, talking, present tense enigma.  He is a person in the truest sense, despite his handicap and inability to contextualize himself in the grid of everyday living.  Natalie calls him a survivor, but he's more than that.  He has to have faith that the world still goes on when he closes his eyes.  He's a believer, a testament that faith comes only with blissful ignorance.<br />Carrie-Anne Moss gives a stunning performance as Natalie.  If you're looking for a character who undergoes a transformation throughout the movie, look no further.  Perhaps because the movie is viewed backwards, we are left with the impression that she is a heartless manipulator.  Look closer and you'll realize that she experiences a transformation near the \\"end\\" of the sequence of events (or the beginning of the movie).  She wants Lenny to remember her.  When he doesn't, she's crushed.  How could he not remember her?  After all, Lenny seems to consume the lives of everyone with whom he comes in contact--and it is he who is unaffected by daily interactions.  <br />If we are to believe the message of Memento, we would see that one must be cruel to be kind, just as the movie itself is cruel to the viewer--demanding involvement with those already dead and beyond repair.
B00003CX5P|4.0|We all know that most everyone was dissatisfied with 'The Phantom Menace', but who really could be after all the hype it was subjected to? Everyone knows that when a movie is built up before its release and into something it's not, there will be a lot of disappointed people out there, and that's the case with this one. Yeah, Jar Jar is annoying, and yeah, there isn't the best action in the world, but hey, Jar Jar will be out--mostly--in Episode II and you have to explain some things in the first movie. <br />Personally I enjoyed this movie. Of all four in the trilogy such far, 'Empire Strikes Back' is the best, followed by 'Jedi', 'Phantom' and then the original. But in any case, that's my take on the movie. Now the DVD:<br />Picture Quality: 6/5. Not a typo, the picture is really that great. The scenes on Tattoine are amazing, as are the special effects, the space scenes and Naboo. If the FX don't blow you away, this will.<br />Sound Quality: 5/5. Easily one of the best of any DVD around. The laser blasts are crisp, the lightsabers perfect and the explosions top-notch...the ships sound excellent too.<br />Special Features: 6/5. This DVD is packed with them on 2 discs. Two trailers, 7 TV spots, a music video, and hour long documentary, 6 featurettes, 6 deleted scenes and a 12 part web documentary viewable without DVD-Rom, this should keep you occupied for some time.<br />Overall: 5.5/5. This is definitely the best DVD I own, but not the best movie I own. I can't stop talking about how great this is, and I think you'd be a fool not to own this one. If you're a Star Wars fan you'll love it...if you liked Episode I remotely, you'll love it, and if you're looking for a good sci-fi DVD...well, you're going to love it too.<br />Thanks for reading. Hope this helped.
B000002KO3|5.0|If you like new wave, funk, african rhythyms, jammin', electronica, this is the album to buy. Incredible bass lines, percussion and overall beat.  See if you can figure out who is playing what.  Very complex album. Even today it doesn't sound dated.  One of the greatest achievements in rock recording history-ahead of it's time.  Listened to it for over 20 years and still love it. Definitely in my top 5.
0553275976|4.0|Tom Wolfe does a wonderful job of displaying true feelings and thoughts to the reader in this unique story of the true realities of life in New York City.<BR>   One of the merits of the book is how easily you can relate to the characters, how truely real they are and how real they react to each situation is how many of us could see ourselves reacting to the same situation. He does this by having people deal with things that they think about only in their heads, but would never say out loud. Another merit of the book is the ability of the author to create a true essence of New York City and of the American way. At the beginning of the book the author descibes a situation taking place in the heart of New York City. \\"Half full! Half consumed!Somebody has just thrown a half-eaten jar of Hellman's mayonaise at him (the Mayor)!\\" The idea that the author has the object that is thrown be something so real something that we all know and all use, shows how American and how normal the author's ideas are so that the reader is able to relate.<BR>     One weakness of the book is how nothing seems to ever turn out right. That is not real lfe and in that aspect the story is never very fulfilling until the end, when by the time you finally get there and after all the bad things you've gone through with the characters it doesn't quite seem like enough good to fulfill the reader with in the end. It lacks the aspect of true happiness in the reader, making you think that life is all full of bad things and there is no hope for the good in people. And by the time you finally reach the good, it is so unexpected and uncommon that you don't even eralize it is there. You have to go through a tremendous amount of pain and hatred and it doesn't seem the happiness is worth all the pain.<BR>     Overall i think that the book was very long and had a lot of unecessary detail the reader could have lived without. I only suggest this book if you are willing to face your own mind and the thoughts thatyou keep inside. It is very prejudice and stereotypical, but tHat is what makes it as good as it is.
B0000074FB|5.0|Just okay! I think not, go listen to your Springsteen albums will you. This is perhaps the best package Thin Lizzy ever released! Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson cook on guitars to start and Phil Lynott has penned some of his most memorable tunes. The playing on this is as masterful as any Thin Lizzy album, but here, as with JAILBREAK, every song clicks. There is magic everywhere. C'mon even Huey Lewis on harmonica, at the time Clover had been touring some with Thin Lizzy.<br />OK! To pick a favorite song I would have to go with &quot;That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart&quot;, which is a wonderful ballad. There's the almost bluesy &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Southbound&quot;. Then there are great rockers like &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, and &quot;Killer Without a Cause&quot;. Then there is &quot;Dear Lord&quot;, which strangely enough is stupendous even though it is full of doubt and concern. A listen to this disc should provide almost everyone with a song they could like, or, maybe like me you'd hock all your Springsteen to have something this good in your collection!
0140433627|3.0|Published in 1818, Mary Shelley's best-selling novel Frankenstein has become famed and celebrated annually as thousands of children dress in various monster garb for Halloween, depicting themselves as Dr. Frankenstein's creation.  Although Shelley's story is sometimes slow and explicitly focused on minor details, the work presents many issues that are still being analyzed today in literature and society.  This is a testament of the timelessness of this great book.<br />Like other authors of the time, Shelley comments on the innocence of childhood when Frankenstein says, \\"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.\\"  Frankenstein's childhood was something that was precious and dear.  This thought has remained popular in current literature.  For example, in the television show Ed, the main character has this to say about the early days:<br />\\"Explain to me why we're always so condescending towards our younger selves.  We should be looking back in awe of who we were...all that passion, all that fire, all those dreams.  And then it all fades and people say, `Oh well, that's just part of growing up.'  I think that's tragic.\\"<br />The fascination of the idealism of children is still quite popular, not only in modern sitcoms but in blockbuster movies like Big or classic fairy tales like Peter Pan as well.  Although Shelley does not fully explore this matter, she addresses an issue that still gains press today.<br />Another theme of Frankenstein is equivalent of the modern day sociological issue of nature versus nurture.  The creature begins his life full of love and cannot even conceive of why someone would murder another person.  But as he faces constant abandonment and bitterness, the creature turns to acts that he once could not imagine.  Placing the blame on his nurture, or lack thereof, the creature exclaims, \\"I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no injustice in this?  Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?\\"  Shelley's answer to these questions is not all too clear, although the fate and doom of Frankenstein sends a message that the scientist was partially at fault.  But the answers that the creature would get in modern times are lucid and concise.<br />A final issue that is still prevalent in society is mankind's attempt to govern the physical world through science.  The results of Frankenstein's experiment indicate that Shelley strongly believes that man should not try to play God.  Stephen Hawking is currently trying to unify physics, or combine the theory of relativity with the theory of quantum mechanics.  Others try to clone life using DNA.  Hawking recently said, \\"\\"If we find the answer to [cloning or the unification of physics,] it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.\\"  Like Frankenstein, scientists are still trying to discover the mystery of life, and Shelley's commentary on this absorption is appropriate even today.<br /><br />This book is slow at times but in the end worth the read.exclaims, \\"I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.

B000001F9E|5.0|It took far too long for Thin Lizzy to step up to the plate with a major performance like this. They had flirted with good albums for years, but everything finally came together. As far as the review saying this was typical 80's metal, then this must be great, because it was the mid 70's. Just goes to show they were a band well ahead of their time!<br />The great lyrics, driving bass, Lynott's crooning, the double edged guitar attack that would become a trademark, and the pounding rhythms of Brian Downey's drums create a masterpiece! I can't even begin to tell you there are any songs you'd have to wade through to get to something good. These are all Lizzy killers! My favorites are &quot;Warriors&quot; and &quot;Emerald&quot;, where the group shows they can play swords and sorcery with the best of them. The variety of most Lizzy albums is present even here with the slower &quot;Romeo and the Lonely Girl&quot; and &quot;Running Back&quot;. Strong rockers are the three everyone knows, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, &quot;the Cowboy Song&quot;, and &quot;the Boys Are Back In Town&quot;.<br />Maybe it's just reliving great times from high school or one of the hottest tours I've seen with Robin Trower, but JAILBREAK is one of those lifetime achievements few bands, no matter how good, ever accomplish. Definitely a 100 all-time best CD!
B00005JKQX|4.0|Ron Howard has never been one of my favorite directors, I liked Apollo 13 and Ransom.  But he made two gargantuan missteps in the form on EDTV and The Grinch, both of which were exceedingly mediocre.  I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of Jennifer Connolly and Russell Crowe always seems to give a magnificent performance.  And I wasn't disappointed, Russell gives another great performance as troubled genius John Nash, and Jennifer Connolly more than acts with him as his wife.  This movie is definitely Ron Howards best work.  It is very mainstream, it's view of schizophrenia is subdued, there is no visual screwing around in the form of quick cuts and insane visual tricks to involve one in Nash's world.  It wasn't what I expected and I was refreshed to see a straight-forward depiction of schizophrenia.  It also has those little scenes that stay in my memory and really struck a chord.  The scene involving the garbageman was definitely one of them.  But that said, this view of schizophrenia is probably the main problem with the film.  I doubt schizophrenia is as simple as ignoring your visions, it's a little more complicated than that I would surmise.  It bothered me, but not enough for me not to recommend the film.  It is entertaining, and the lead performances are both deserving of Oscars, especially Jennifer who was screwed last year after her snub for Requiem for a Dream.  Its an example of how moving, mainstream filmmaking can be if it's done well.
B000002UAU|2.0|Afmitedly, though I am a huge Beatles fan, this CD isn't my favorite.  In fact, I think it's really overrated (*Brooke ducks to avoid the tomatoes being pelted at her face*).  I think it must have been a blast to make, and I'm sure I would love it if I were one of the Beatles (and I'm obviously not).  I just think that the CD isn't as great as it's hyped up to be.  Certainly it contains some wonderful pieces of music.  George Harrison's &quot;Within You, Without You&quot; is a very entrancing song&quot;Lucy in hte Sky With Diamonds&quot; is also a very bold, entertaining song.  However, I don't think that the CD as a whole flows very well; it seems very inconsistent.  The song list also is overly wacky.  I also remember reading somewhere that This album was Paul McCartney's response to the critical and commerical success of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, an amazing concept album that flowed rather beautifully.  McCartney may have been trying to hard.  Seargent Pepper sounds uneven nad pretentious.  I've always admired the musical versatility, intelligence, and wit of the Beatles.  The Beatles don't need to try so hard to amaze us with excessively smug humor.
B000051VWW|5.0|We had a long wait for a new Sade cd (9 years I believe it was) but Sade rewarded us with an effort that is as smooth as she is.  Full of great songs like &quot;By Your Side&quot;, &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;, and &quot;King of Sorrow&quot;, this cd is one of Sade's best.  If this mellow, romantic set of songs doesn't get you in the mood for romance, nothing will.  I only hope that she doesn't make us wait almost another decade for some new music from her.
B000001ABD|4.0|What can I say? The man knows how to bring out the most brilliant melodies and rhythms from keyboard instruments.  Very few artists are of such a caliber that they can completely blur the line between conventional instruments and synthesizers... Stevie Wonder has had more time and experience perfecting this craft than almost any other recording artist.  Even before polyphonic, multitimbral synthesizers and sampling workstations were readily available... He, along with a precious few others, mastered the instrument in such a way that it blends seamlessly with the rest of the band... and yet drives forward the rhythm and melody of each piece... producing unmistakable riffs (e.g. &quot;Superstition, &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, &quot;Sir Duke&quot;, etc.) that have not only become representative of African-American music history, but ingrained elements of American music history as a whole.<br />This album runs the gamut of Stevie Wonder's range of abilities in the arena of music.  His expression has taken various forms, and changed with the times, and the tools... but ultimately, whether you like old or new Stevie, this album gives you a very good sampling of the various areas in which he has applied his genius for melody, harmony and rhythm.
B00005NOOH|5.0|Some of the other reviewers have gone into more detail about the series - I just want to add my voice and say this series is absolutely outstanding. Well worth the hundred bucks!
B00005OB0A|5.0|I just got this album two weeks ago and i completely love it.  I have been a Kylie fan since i was six years old and i am constantly amazed at how diverse and multi-faceted she is. This album still has the club feel to it that Light Years had, especially tracks like CGYOOMH, fever,dancefloor, and my personal favorite, In your Eyes.  One of my best buys so far this year, and definitely worth the price.
6302814782|5.0|this is a great movie.

0140120416|5.0|If you want to follow your own pace studying russian this is the book for you.  Russian is as difficult as any other language but this book gives you,  slowly,  all parts of grammar and you will get a good vocabulary by the end of it.
0553328255|5.0|This is the most engaging fiction I have ever read. It's disappointing to finish it all, because I don't know where to find anything better. The stories all have elements of the bizarre and incredible which make them all unique. Holmes is the most three dimensional character in fiction. The writing is ingenious: always easy to follow, but beautifully descriptive. <br />The four novels are wonderful. For some reason, I don't feel as strongly about The Sign of Four, but the others are among the best writing ever. A Study in Scarlet has a cinematic sweep that spans two continents. The segment in historical Utah is some of my favorite of Doyle's writing ever, showing that he can be brilliant even without featuring Holmes and Watson. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a surreal self-contained nightmare, almost gothic in its gloomy, dark setting on the moor. The Valley of Fear again includes a backstory set in old America, featuring perhaps Doyle's singularly best story ever.<br />If you are at all like me, you will not be able to put this down and you will treasure this forever.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I thought for sure when we took our boys to see the movie, we'd be a little disappointed. To Our surprise...we really loved it! It is definately worth buying and keeping on hand for the kids on a rainy day. I'd watch it again as well!!
B00003CXXP|1.0|It is difficult to describe the physical pain I experienced when watching this movie. Haly Joel Osment's constant whining completely ruins this film, the only thing worse than it are those ridiculous aliens at the end of the film. Do we really need a film about a robot wanting to be a \\"real little boy\\"? Didn't they already come out with Pinnochio ? I would only recommend buying this DVD to hear the commentary by Spielberg... I would love to hear him try to explain away this car wreck of a movie.
B0000065O1|5.0|I tried lots of diffrent video workouts, but nothing worked like this one. Within 2 months I lost 30 pounds working out with Cindy 5 days a week. <BR>Once when I was working out, my male friend, who thought he was in good shape, came to visit me. He laughed at me, because he did not belive in &quot;those&quot; videos. I convinced him to try. 2 days later, he called and said he couldn't move. He loved it!
0887307280|5.0|I bought this book at the urging of a friend of mine. After picking it up I could not put it down. I read the whole thing in one night. If you have been in business for a while and are tired of your business running you and not you running your business this book will give you some fresh ideas of how to turn things around.
B000001F29|5.0|I love this recording and have listened to it again and again. Donna Summer's cover of &quot;State of Independence&quot; is inspirational, anthemic, but the musicians here obviously have a lot of fun as well. The title song is a wonderful tip of the hat to forties films. The Spanish singer, Ana Bel&eacute;n,was moved by &quot;I'll find my way home,&quot; a song which she covered on &quot;Geminis.&quot; &quot;Back to School&quot; is silly and grating, but provides comic relief. For me, however, the most spectacular track is &quot;The Mayflower,&quot; which beautifully captures the loneliness of human existence, the desperate need to leave the comfort of home, and the alienating effect of technology on our lives.  A group of humans are marooned in space, unable to communicate with or return to Earth.  Atmospheric music and the innocence of Jon Anderson's tenor are punctuated by a crackling of radio transmissions across vast distances.  It is such a sad, beautiful work of art.  For fans of Vangelis at his loveliest, there are a couple of other tracks sure to please, &quot;Beside&quot; and &quot;Outside of  This (Inside of That).&quot;  This twenty year old recording remains fresh and delightful.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Alright, i'm a huge fan of harry potter and i also love films. this movie was just awful. there are tons of mistakes, the effects look waaaay too computer generated, the acting is very subpar (except for dumbledore and snape) and it is just way too long without keeping you entertained, unless you are 9.
0451450523|5.0|No matter how many fantasy books you have read, The Last Unicorn is a fantasy unlike any other.  Unlike many other denser books, The Last Unicorn is light in both tone and content.  There is a fey air of the absurd about it that makes it all the more magical.<br />While I can put other fantasy books aside, I simply had to read The Last Unicorn from cover to cover in one sitting.  It really drew me into its own unique world; a world both beautiful and elusive.<br />The story is a simple one revolving around a unicorn (she is never named) who leaves her enchanted lilac wood only to find that she is the last surviving unicorn.  She decides to go on a quest in order to discover why, and is soon joined by Schmendrick the magician and Molly Grue, a scullery maid.  Together, this motley group travels to the castle of King Haggard where they believe the Red Bull has imprisoned all the other unicorns of the world.  All does not go as planned, of course, and adventure follows.<br />I think many people make the mistake of thinking The Last Unicorn is exclusively a children's book.  Nothing could be further from the truth as this beautiful, little tale can be read on many levels:  as an adventure story or as an exploration of the nature of truth, beauty, reality, immortality and the ultimate purpose of life.<br />Of all the fantasy books I have ever read, this is my alltime favorite and the one I find most beautiful as well as possessing the most depth and emotion.  It is a lovely tale that brings the secrets of life and love into wonderful focus.
B00005NWM3|3.0|I dont know, I started to listening to Nickleback a few years ago when The State came out, and I thought that they were great. So when there was so much hoopla about the new album I went out and bought it and I was a little disapointed. I found The State to be a great album through out, while Silver Side Up was lacking through out...I still think that they are a great band, but I do believe that the new cd was not as good as it could have been....although that might just be the mgb fan in me saying that...oh well...
B00005RZV4|5.0|I saw NIN's Fragility Tour in Philadelphia and this album captures every bit of passion, intensity, and power of the live show. I can't stop listening to it.
B000002I25|4.0|Between this their debut album and their final Jim Morrison masterpiece \\"L.A. Woman,\\" the Doors put out a collection of albums containing a few hits surrounded by a bunch of torpid filler.  But the bookends of their brief span together (again not counting releases after Morrison's death) were defining masterpieces of the craft of rock poetry.  The three highlights (not that the rest of the tracks are bad) of their debut album are the hard-driving 'Break on Through (to the Other Side),' the keyboard driven 'Light My Fire,' and the quintessential darkness of 'The End.'  'Break on Through' opens the album and gives the listener an example of the sheer raw power behind Morrison's vocals, while 'Light My Fire' shows that the band as a unit was more than just a prop behind Morrison.  And 'The End' is the ultimate expression of the dangerous vision of Morrison's poetry.  It is both over-rated and underestimated.  It is not as important as some worshippers claim, but it does take the rock vehicle into unknown territory.  Meanwhile, the rest of the tracks demonstrate the coarse sensuality that was Morrison.  His singing expresses an intensity that is far more threatening than ever was exhibited by Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.  Songs like 'Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)' and 'Back Door Man' show the Doors as a defiantly reprobate entity that sneered at the mores of conventional society.  This was the Doors' and Morrison's brilliance.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be Morrison's (and through him the Doors') downfall as well.
B00005T30L|5.0|I loved this film, literally the best film of 2001.  The DVD, allows the viewer to experience the film the way it was intended. Every shot ifs framed as if it were a panel in a comicbook. This story , one of the harsh reality of maturation in America is one that should be required of every kid in highschool.  The performances of Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi drive this Comedy/Drama/ post-punk cinematic adventure.  Laughing at moments that are embarrassing and depressing, this movie is a rarity in American Cinema, an almost realistic depiction of life, of being human.
0767830555|5.0|This movie created good modern cinema -- do the right thing &amp; pulp fiction etc.  It showed MacDonalds TV silly greeting cards --- it showed America as it was and how a lot of people live life.There is a documentary feel to it.  The screenplay has a lifelike feel with surprises throughout.  It takes its time and then expodes.The acting directing score etc all flawless.  This movie was the template unfortunately rather then follow it for the most part Hollywood followed Star Wars/Jaws...And where did all those OSCARS go? I mean who has EVER done a better acting job then De Niro here?
