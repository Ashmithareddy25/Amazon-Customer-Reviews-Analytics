B006RED4GA|1.0|Watched the Innkeepers without alot of preconceived expectations; just wanted a nice, old fashioned, suspenseful ghost story.  It started quite slowly, with a nice aura of foreboding- but that's all it ever was.  I found Claire, the hipster main character, incredibly annoying and wooden; though this may be due to the stilted, odd writing.  Throw in a completely out of place, odd Lena Dunham cameo as a coffee house barrista about halfway through and you realize you just don't care about these people.  A second major problem is the complete lack of anything resembling a plot- there's mention about a \\"ghost bride\\" periodically throughout the movie, but that storyline is never really explored to any satisfying extent.  The movie also unfortunately utilizes every ghost story cliche in the book- swinging doors, pianos that play themselves, voices only heard on recording equipment etc - but never develops the key element of a ghost story- THE  STORY.  I had no problems with the pace of the movie- I actually prefer intelligent ghost stories that build the tension and then deliver ; this one just never does.  save time and money and watch something like \\"The Others\\" or \\"Session 9\\"- you won't be disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read the early reviews and I, too, was disappointed that this was not the end of the story as had been advertised. However, Sylvia Day has knocked it out of the park again! There are, of course, some parts of the story with which I was unhappy, but overall I really enjoyed this chapter of Eva and Gideon's story!
0425269205|1.0|I am scratching my head over the ending to this series.<br /><br />VAGUE SPOILERS:<br /><br />Ultimately, what was the point? Sookie ended up right back where she started. It was as if everything from the middle of Book 1 up until the middle of Book 13 was completely negated. Eric couldn't have gotten a worse more depressing ending, and Bill was thrown in the trash. I had always hoped that Bill and Sookie would somehow reconcile, to me it would have tied things up nicely and connected us back to the roots of the series. I could have lived with her and Eric as well, as they have spent, oh the last 9 or so books establishing a relationship. But Sam? It was so out of left field. So much so you can't even call it a twist, it's just completely out of thin air which makes it unsatisfying. I feel like I did when I finished the last book in the Twilight Saga, bitterly disappointed.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am not a fan of war time books but read this after listening to an interview on NPR.  Highly recommend this book!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game very addictive. Slow build up of stars is a pain in the ass, but still great little pass -the -time -away game.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|A good workout when you don't have a lot of time!  My kids LOVE doing the 5 minute abdominal workout with me.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These are easy to attach and fit. I would have given them 5/5 if it were not for their height which makes them impossible to use on the speakers with a wall bracket. they are about an inch high. They are great on the receiver though and the pack is more than adequate for a 5.1ch system. great black and red mark. Solid build - go for it!
0385344333|4.0|Good, entertaining book. Couldn't put it down once I started.  Jack Reacher is a great character, and I look forward to each new book by Child.
B00CVCHJ6I|4.0|This is probably the best DT album since Damage Done.  The previous few albums sounded like they had been done before except for a few stand out songs.  This album, although retaining some of those repetitive elements, sounds a lot more fresh and diverse.
B00005OAE6|4.0|there really isn't more to say about this album, other than it's a very complete work. bob really hits his singing stride on this one, and the band is very polished. hollywood nights is one of the great rockers to this day, and the other lesser known tunes are as good, if not better. let it shine is one his greatest songs and displays his songwriting and band leading skills. bob says that used to spend hours in the studio. this album is definitely proof of the hours put in, resulting in a great production. the sequencing of the album is well thought out and lets you breathe while listening to the whole thing. i truly believe that this is bob in his finest hour.
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|I had given up on Soilwork after Sworn to a Great Divide.  The last couple albums were fairly uninteresting and I never really felt the need to listen to them after they were new.  The Panic Broadcast was good and I was happy they had found their sound again.  When Peter Wichers left again, I expected the band to revert back to mediocre music.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and actually like this album better than any of their previous.  The songs all sound different (a good achievement for a double album) with the perfect balance of metal and melody.  Highly recommended to fans of melodic death metal.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Love the wizard of Oz.  But, then again who didn't grow up with it.  Great story and movie.  Love all the characters.
1587672707|5.0|This gorgeous massive beautifully illustrated book is a welcome addition to my collection of Stephen King books. I was inspired to begin reading IT after a 25 year lapse. I think I will enjoy it even more this time.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This is absolutely the best blues session ever recorded--an observation made by someone who has been collecting, listening to, and examining blues for now over 60 years.  I would have sympathy for anyone introduced to this DVD early in their blues-listening career because everything else they might ever hear will pale in comparison.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I watched it twice - and I'm sure I will watch it again.  Watching the actors in their different characters was quite enjoyable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this series a couple of weeks ago and am already halfway through Season 3.<br />Season 3 is riveting!
B001KYR6XE|5.0|Great music
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen and it never did! I can not believe I had to wait 6 months for this book to come out. I have lost interest in the characters so much that I really don't care what happens next! I can't believe they even published this book!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Everything you expect In a modern version of Sherlock Holmes.  Lots of style, impossible deduction and doesnt lose sight of the original characters.  Holmes is trying to give up smoking as opposed to opium though.  Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as are the stories and production values.<br />Can't wait for season 3
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app has kept me very busy for the past couple of hours. seems to refresh horses energy pretty quickly if you put the game down for a bit. I have been able to play several mini games, care for the horse, do some chores, and not completely run out of gems or coins. definitely has potential. hoping that it doesn't bug me with notifications like pet hotel and some others. I want this to be fun, but not too demanding.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Pretty good film, although the film took a different route in a few areas from the Opera itself.  I still enjoyed it though.  Worth watching if you like the Opera.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Not sure what I was expecting but this book was just a little too &#34;out there&#34; for me.  I realize he is documenting his experience as it occurred but it could not hold my interest.  I never finished the book which is rare for me.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is one of the best films of all time. I absolutely hated the first Sherlock Holmes, but this sequel is one of my favorites.The acting, plot, special effects, and characters are amazing.  A Must- See film for those who like a little mystery, a lot of action, and a good time.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Jennifer Lawerence is amazing, you could throw any part at her and the old saying,  ' never judge a book by it's movie' flies right out the window!  She makes you care about the plot and the characters unlike many actors ever could.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|game was a little round about and frustrating try to know where to go next.All in all it was a good game
B002ZG9846|5.0|Great features and a great movie! Packaging was good and DVD worked fine. Definitely recommend. I don't know what else to say
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was a good book, The perfect Silver Lining. And the ending was to die for, I shed a few tears
B0034G4OUO|5.0|I have all the Rock's movies. I like all of them. I think this is the best he's been in. Great plot, story, and edge of your seat action from beginning to end. I got this movie for a great price too.
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|Just gives temperature and takes up whole screen to do so. Accuweather app is way better and is also free.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|I suppose if you like this sort of thing you're in for a good game.<br />Wasn't really my cup of tea.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Started off engaging but too many characters were introduced without connecting them in a meaningful way.  I have 40 pages left to go and want to finish it so I can read something else.  Very disappointed as I loved the first two books.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Excruciatingly dull plot not helped along by the rather clunky dialogue. The only thing making it somewhat watchable and bring it to life is the outstanding cast who deserve every $ they got paid and then some.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and enjoyable and addictive. It is very difficult to stop playing once you have started. Congrats to the developers.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved every moment of this and am only saddened by the fact that I've beat it and have no more to play! I hope to see more games like this and especially from this team :)
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love the characters names and how they resemble characters in the bible. It's a one of kind game that makes you think on your toes. I enjoy this game
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was sent a copy of this book when I was in Afghanistan living on Marine FOB (Forward Operating Base).  I could not put the dang thing down.  I gently took the cover off the book so I would be seen prancing around the place with a chick book.  I'm sure people wondered what I was reading and laughing out loud.  Thanks T for the book.  GREAT stuff!<br /><br />Tony
B001BANK32|5.0|Kept me interested from the beginning.  Looking forward  to the next book.  Stephen King always delivers a story that keeps you turning the pages!!!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Way too much boasting and self importance. I realize Seal Team six is a very important special Ops force, but come on, show a little modesty.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|If you appreciate the story behind the story, this movie (and book series) is excellent.  If you view it as kids killing kids, then you will hate it.  But, it is a story of government oppression, which evolves into an uprising against the government because of the main character in this story.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|It;s a classic, very 80's movie! I schooled my teenager on the 80's with this one. He even enjoyed it so much that he suggested the 4 stars
B000002KOJ|5.0|This has always been a favorite of ours. I think I have bought it very format, it's a classic album.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|i dont really have to explain why this movie it great.  weve all seen it and we all love it
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is amazing.<br />High quality sound, good microphone, extremely comfortable.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about it is when you click the side buttons, whoever you're talking to can hear a loud click. Luckily I don't use those buttons that often, but they are easy to program.<br /><br />Best headset I've ever owned.. Will re-buy if this one ever wears out (because newer models will likely be made more cheaply, unfortunately.. That's the way things are headed, anyways)
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I know I'm biased about this owing to the fact that I was a huge Stargate SG1 fan, but Atlantis beats them all for me. What with the &#34;Wraith&#34; being some of the baddest &#34;villians&#34; in any scifi series, to the great writing and acting.  No doubt about it for me.  This was the greatest.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It's cool because u get to play with fun weapons back then during the war. This is my review of weaphones. Hope u liked this review creators of weaphones.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is great.  I got an inside view of what it was like back when money was class and servants were looked down upon as nothing, yet the had a life all their own.  Keeps you wanting more.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This movie was wonderfully touching and very funny.  I highly recommend it!  I watched with a mixed age group of women and we all enjoyed!
B008EKMB82|5.0|An origami of a book, this Tale folds themes of death, culture, nature, physics, and reality into a page-turning story.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Christopher stole this movie, he was almost as good as he was in Inglorious Basterds.  Jamie was good also but this movie belonged to Chris.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle is quit simply, one of the best books I've read in quite a long time.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|She was GREAT!  Being a Philadelphian I enjoyed all the Eagles references and local scenes.  The dance contest was much better than Travolta and what's her name.
B00AYBU7TE|4.0|This was a song on the last album that Johnny Cash recorded... a tribute to a wonderful music career. Johnny knew how to live and how to die. It's more than music, it's the heart of music... a story born of trains and prison, and a career and life salvaged by June Carter of the classic blue grass group, The Carter Sisters. It's a story of the life of a country singer... part of America's history.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you enjoy playing bingo, this game is for you. It has many levels of play. I enjoy the free tournament portion. It definitely can get challenging.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was alright. Graphics were done well. Acting was okay. The virtual characters were better than the real ones! Story was okay. Could have been better though. Seemed to end too soon, sort of rushed at places. Younger kids might find it scary at times.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|We made the unfortunate decision to see this movie in the theater with the expense that entails. What it lacks in plot it makes up for by imitating scenes from other movies. The opening sequence has scenes that seem to be almost direct rip-offs of Star Trek (The Krypton Council and the Vulcan High Council), Star Wars (cloning, alien beast for transport), and Harry Potter (Harry, um, Supermans' Dad flies away on a \\"dragon\\".) This sequence would prove to be one of the more thoughtful portions of the movie. Later, there were monster machines ripped straight out of Transformers. At one point I fully expected to hear Sam shriek \\"Optimus!\\"<br /><br />The action, absent a story, became repetitive. When we left, even our family's most avid action movie fan was disappointed. \\"Well,\\" he commented sadly \\"it had explosions.\\" Special effects are nifty, but a great movie must have a great script before special effects are added.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It was very enjoyable - the right mix of adventure, humor, mystery, faith, friendship, sacrifice and goodness. Children may learn some important values from it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|you get alot of free puzzels to start. plus, you can buy them. and you can change the size of your puzzel pieces. I have enjoyed downloading and putting them together.  I have not had any problems with downloading them either.neanderthal just so you know you will never get bord with putting puzzles together.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is ruining my life! Warning it is very graphic at times and definantly not for the weak of stomach. CANNIBALISM HAPPENS YAY! The storyline is dark and intense which usually really turns me off of shows but it's so great in all aspects that it just sucks me right in. The acting is quite often simply flawless. Hugh Dancy (Will Graham) gives the best performance of his career in this show and often steals the scenes because he is just so believable and authentic. Mads Mikkelson (Hannibal) is also amazing in his role. He excels at showing the darkness and the coldness of Hannibal in a way that makes us love to hate him! The side characters are so funny but in a way that is perfectly balances with the darkness of this show. :I love this series and its basically gonna ruin your life so buy it. A+ purchase. *Wails* When is season two coming out ???? Not soon enough! Swiggity swiet You'll love this show buy it.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|It is a very hard subject matter to read, but he helps you through it with so much grace....it's amazing!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This grabbed my attention right from the beginning of the movie. Typically it takes me a little bit to start to get into a movie. Awesome movies.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Just too disjointed to really have an impact. I enjoyed his other zombie novel much more. This one, at least in my humble opinion, is extremely overrated.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard, not too easy. Got stuck on level 7 for a moment but just like the rest of the levels, once you grab a clue the rest comes together. Beat the game and now need more levels. I recommend this for all ages.  No instruction but simple to figure out. Find hidden clues by touching screen in different places. Collect objects for other clues that lead you to open the elevator.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Everything about this series is compelling and top-notch.<br /><br />The story lines and characters are original and entertaining.<br /><br />I strongly recommend Suits.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|His love for Afghanistan shines through in all his books. Hosseini's books should go a long way in telling the world that Afghan men and women are as human as you and I, with the same dreams and aspirations of relationships fulfilled and a life well lived only to find that the path is strewn with obstacles. In the end, it is always a journey where the world outside ourselves forces us to discover ourselves.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|(Note: This review is for the 11-track studio album, not the deluxe album with several additional live recordings.)<br />When I heard about the splitting of Queensryche in early 2012, I was really hoping the Wilton/Jackson/Rockenfield version would win the final lawsuit over rights to the band's name, over the Geoff Tate version. We won't know for sure until late 2013, but I still hope Wilton and company win.<br />Since becoming a QR fan after listening to the Mindcrime album in early 1990, and then later that year hearing Empire, following which I've purchased all the band's albums from 1983 to the present, I thought the vocals of Geoff Tate were awesome.<br />But following Chris DeGarmo's departure in 1998, and Tate's increasing takeover of the band to the eventual point where it was all him, with virtually no input from the other band members, I began to lose respect for Tate. Finally his ego nearly ripped the band to shreds in early 2012. A truly sad situation.<br />I have not bought Tate's new 'Queensryche' album, as I no longer consider his version of the band to be the original band.<br />But I have purchased the self-titled Queensryche album of the Wilton version of the band, and I have to say it is excellent. If Wilton and company lose the rights to the QR name and Tate wins, I will consider this self-titled album the last legitimate QR album.<br />Todd La Torre, the new lead singer for the band, musically sounds very much like the Geoff Tate of 1983-1994, and this short little album is a stripped-down guitar tour-de-force.<br />All the songs are good, but especially \\"Midnight Lullaby\\" and \\"A World Without.\\" They are really one song; listen to them together, late at night (about five minutes total), and you've got one rather scary song.<br />This is just a good, hard-rocking album; my only real criticism is that it's short.  Enjoy!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game though I don't have a lot of stars I think it's the best game ever except minecraft
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is super fun and a little bit  challenging. You should do it with a partner. We did it all in one day and can not wait for more levels please make more!!!!!!!  Yaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but i wish they would make the other city games available to kindles! you do have to buy some things with actual money but if you turn on parental controls it will first ask for your password...
B005DC68NI|5.0|I was curious about self-publishing myself and I highly recommend this to anyone else curious. This walks you through everything you want to know and even things you hadn't thought of. Great read.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|One of those books you couldn't stand to put down forefront beginning to end. I loved how personal it felt.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Yes, Somebody I Used to Know is extremely overplayed and even I have to turn it off when it comes up on the radio, but the rest of this album is simply amazing. I am shocked that that was one of the ONLY songs that made it to the radio. All the songs feel different and are all simply amazing. I love how experimental they all feel, all hitting different kinds of music and different emotional levels.<br /><br />I would suggest this to anyone, any day. You can just skip Somebody I Used to Know.
B001NAT05W|5.0|Not serious and not Batman's Catwoman but fun and campy.  Halle looked great! Sharon Stone is soooo good at being the cheesy villain.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have enjoyed all three of the books and can't wait for the next one. I only hope it is soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am a huge fan of hidden objects games this is a nice twist. The game end too soon. Need more levels and an overall goal plus a story line. I will be watching for future editions.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I am having a hard time installing the app, and I have a tablet. How can I read the word of GOD when I don't have a bible
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Engaging like each of the previous seasons.  Excellent character development, good story lines and an addictive quality that is hard to explain.
B002NTGKSM|1.0|This was one of the worst movies me and my daughter have watched, we wouldn't recommend it.  We rent movies from<br />amazon all the time and it's so easy and convenient, but this movie was horrible.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|MINIREVIEW: a taut, well plotted zombie apocalypse as it first strikes humanity that doesn't hold any punches in showing society unravel. The \\"cure\\" is a series of clue trails as things get bleaker and bleaker for humanity. Unlike other zombie tales they're harder to kill and they come en masse having the ability as shown in the trailers to build a \\"zombie pyramid\\" to get over towering walls. No places is truly safe. They don't let up on the overall grimness which I appreciated. OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|movie was good but long was better than going to the theater price was good for a 3D movie good buy
B008JFUO72|4.0|IRON MAN 3: a fun over the top Tony Stark action-tale which keeps the humor flowing and gives our hero PTSD. Nevertheless, it's same \\"ole\\" good fun with Tony Stark even if there are some minor plotholes. Stark deals with a lot of super villain problems without an effective suit of armor which means he has to be clever and lucky. He's usually both. Kudos to the child actor who played something of the mirror reflection ally archetype to Stark. Expect the usual Shane Black narrative flow. This picture has more of a \\"feel good\\" tone to it so check it out over MAN OF STEEL if you like that flavor. It is also doing incredibly well at the Box Office which tells me more than the naysayer critics who clearly don't have their fingers on the pulse of society. OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I dont' know what cable channel this is on, or if it's still on, but I lived the 2 seasons and am looking foward to more
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Probably the best series I have ever seen in my life, mind blowing! The books are even better! I will watch them again and again.
B005R32L66|5.0|love it. got my android just for Skyping and the app is perfect. I am very happy with this one.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Wonderfully descriptive writing throughout. I really enjoyed reading this and became very fond of the characters. I was sorry when I came to the last page
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I loved the music and the characters. I also enjoyed the show choir competitions.  In addition, the relationships between the characters were
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2: X-Men United is not only the best X-Men movie, but may also be one of the best superhero movies out there, at least in my opinion.  X2 is one of my favorite comic book films, and is without a doubt my favorite X-Men film.  Nearly everything the first film did right, this movie improved upon.  Nearly everything the first film did wrong, this film did right.<br /><br />I like the characters more here, especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  Wolverine gets much needed development in this movie.  We finally get info of how Wolverine became Wolverine and why he lost his memory.  We learn that his past is heavily connected to a man named William Striker (Brian Cox), who is one of the main villains of this film.<br /><br />We also focus more on Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in this film.  We see her powers developing rapidly and she taps into a new power later in the film it seems, which is left open for explanation in the next film.  We also get introduced to a new mutant named Nightcrawler Alan Cumming), who I really like.  I was never a big fan of Nightcrawler, but I think he was handled well here.  I also like his relationship with Storm (Halle Berry), who I actually like a bit more here.  I love the make-up effects for him, as well as the effect for when he is teleporting.<br /><br />We also focus more on Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore) and learn a bit about him.  We also get more focus on a mutant named Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who gets probably one of the more interesting developments in the movie.<br /><br />However there are a couple problems in the movie and they involve two character; Scott (Cyclops) and Professor X Patrick Stewart).  Professor X really gets shunned in this film and being used as a pawn which I was sad to see.  The first film did not give him much to do either.  That is one of the problems that the first movie had that this one did not fix.  I get why but I still do not like that.  Cyclops (James Marsden) also gets shafted in this film.  This one of the fewthings that the first film did right and this did not.  The first X-Men at least gave Cyclops something to do though it was not that much.  He, though, he is pretty much shunned entirely.  Scott is supposed to be the leader of the X-Men, and he is one of my favorite X-Men.  Seeing him get treated the way he does in these movies is a bit aggravating.<br /><br />The driving factors in this film, other than Wolverine, are definitely the villains.  Magneto (Ian McKellen) is back and is as cunning as ever.  You also have the new villain William Striker.  What is great about this movie is the social commentary.  The first film had the social commentary of humans and mutants, but here it is more in the foreground and is brought to its furthest ends through these two villains.  On one hand you have Magneto who believes that mutants are the next stage in evolution and that humans are obsolete.  On the other hand you have striker who views mutants as a disease that needs to be wiped out.  They are two sides of the same coin and they play off each other perfectly.  Usually when you have multiple super-villains in one movie the end result is a cluttered mess, but not here.  There is no super-villain team-up either like in many superhero films.  These two hate each other.<br /><br />Overall, X2 is a brilliant film and a must see for X-Men fans.  Even if you are not a fan of comic book movies I would still recommend that you give this a chance.  This is a very intellectual film and feels more than a typical comic book movie.
1781162646|5.0|Long before the actual release date of \\"Joyland\\" I was determined that I would not purchase a paperback version. I decided that I could wait until it would be released in e-book format. And I do believe that eventually it will be released on Kindle. I was not very strong in my resolve and drove to a bookstore late one evening to purchase it only three days after it was available. I do not regret it. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and Devin Jones' character really came alive for me. Stephen King and Blake Crouch are my two favorite authors because I am amazed by their descriptive detail and character development. I have not been able to really get into every single book that I have read by S.K. However, both \\"Joyland\\" and \\"11-22-63\\" gripped my interest within the first three pages. I am a huge fan of the e-book format and use my Kindle Paperwhite every day. I highly recommend \\"Joyland\\" and I am sure that you will not be disappointed, I know that I wasn't.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|This is probably the best television drama ever written. The only way I can watch this is in a marathon with one episode after the other because there is no way to wait a week for each new episode. The story, the character development, the character interplay, the incredible acting, the cinematography, are all incredibly well done. This is purely adult stuff and among adults, not for the faint of heart. Some of it is tough to watch, but if you can handle it, you will be rewarded.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Loved it up until the ending .I think they could have chosen something different. Still a good series.I will start on 4 and see
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Once you start this unassuming little game, you will be looking for more. When I ran out of coins on this game, I started looking around for more games like it. I found several, and they were all free. They want you to buy more coins, and if you have no patience, you will buy more! You don't have to buy more because the game regenerates them without you paying for them, but not fast enough! So hold your breath and jump right in and join us! You'll love it!
B00AEFY44Y|1.0|I was expecting a good sounding and clear blu-ray<br />instead it was one of the worst quality blu-ray's I<br />have seen, and I have seen a lot.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is great!!!! I think I am addicted!!!! I love the game because of the different versions such as the Miami and the Paris titles.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have not played this game in a while but I know that I like this game and I know that I will love this version.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|this app is really fun. my brother thought that I was not really playing the piano. but when he looked he saw that I was.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I just finished re-reading American Gods... It's been about 10 years since the first time... It got better.  It is an immigrant's story told by one of America's finest writer/immigrants.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have seen this movie at least four times. The acting is superb and I can't wait for the sequel. Highly recommend it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|couldn't put it down even though with each page I got more worried about how dreadful human nature can be!  Had to reach the end in the hopes that there would be some solace in it - ie they were freaks, there was some explanation to put my mind at ease... read it and find out - it's worth it!
B00CF2UORK|4.0|I have always liked Shaun the Sheep.  My daughter has also been a fan since she has had a stuffed lamb since she was an infant to play along.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very well executed. A vital theory for daily life backed with interesting concrete examples. An essential read for anyone looking for a change.
B00006B1HH|5.0|Loved this movie in the 70s and fun to watch with my Family now as a musical that still holds up.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a really great story with a fascinating premise.  I was really intrigued with the characters and with the way that the story was set up.<br /><br />I have read many of King's books and would put this in the same class with Bag of Bones and The Shining.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Absolutely loved this book from start to finish.  Savored every word, sentence, beautifully written and did not want it to end.  Loved all the characters and the author made you connect with each and every one of them
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Mitch should stay with short stories and/or writing sports columns.  I thought that the characters were quite shallow, the plot predictable and the story development was thin.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy playing playing this game wish I could play Candy Crash on my Tablet please bring it back lot of people miss it and enjoy joy playing it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love Magic the Gathering, so I'm already a tad biased, but I've also never played it digitally. In fact, I was a bit skeptical about playing without physical cards, I felt something would be 'lost in translation', it often happens when porting tangible card games to the video game medium (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon etc etc). They end up losing the feel, and often end up feeling silly; although those aren't the best examples if I was trying to avoid that.<br />My point is, really, that nothing is lost in this. I love it, and quite frankly, have become somewhat addicted to it. It's nice since I can play when my brothers or friends aren't around, or aren't in the mood to slap some cards down. The opponent AI is pretty challenging on the 'Mage' difficulty (Hard Mode for veteran players), so I don't feel like the game is feeding me victories. I drop a 'bomb' card, and the game will just deal with it if it can; it's almost patronizing sometimes. I love it; I need to actually be playing a game of Magic or I'll lose.<br />The Sealed Play option is pretty sick too. The 'Packs' that you open are varied, and usually spread the way you'd expect a handful of Boosters to. Not everything is good, you don't get many things that are great, but you usually get at least one awesome card to build around; and then the rest are there to help your 'vision'. There are parameters which the game gives you for good &#34;Solid&#34; deck design, and it tries to rate your deck as you play, but there's no need to adhere by it. So if you cook up some wacky, but effective, card combination for a deck, and the game doesn't grasp your brilliance, ignore it. You'll show it who's boss when you smash the competition. Although, it can be quite helpful when you're looking at a pile of seemingly unrelated cards and effects. Basic Parameters, without getting too techy; it lets you experiment and gives you a suggestion, but won't hold your hand.<br />I recommend this to anybody who plays Magic the Gathering, Sealed or otherwise; and anybody that likes card games in general.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Loved movie! Nicholson and Keaton's performance was amazing and the dialogue was intriguing and fascinating to watch! Very true to life!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is the best keyboard I've ever downloaded! Our is definitely worth the money!! You won't be disappointed. I don't like buying apps so I used the free one and once it expired I had to buy it.
B004IFGORQ|4.0|Watched this for family movie night with our 3 year old.  We all laughed and enjoyed it. We recommend it
B0091REZMW|2.0|I like the game and it's a lot of fun but the rooms would not always open.  I would tap 3 to 4 times and it may or may not open. I emailed the the software company and they are working on the problem and told me my case was resolved and to check for updates....soliloquy tip then I wait or say forget!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great stradigy game. I love it. it is sometimes hard but not always. I highly recomend this app its one of my favorites. so it could be your favorite too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season seemed like it was going to be the last or something because they seemed to rush events, and some events seemed to be mentioned and developed, but then overlooked. The season was great, as always, though. It ends with a very surprising turn of events.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great movie,  very entertaining even though it starts a little slow. Getting ready for the RED 2 movie coming out soon.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is a really great film and I wish it continued on.  The marketing is why it tanked so much at the box office.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like3d this better than Kite Runner as it did not have the same kind of trite ending. I could not put this bookk down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love ihe game very fun temple runner type easy to learn and many fun power ups but also has a learnig curve
B00BQJTHYY|4.0|Ask yourself one question before you buy this, do you like Finntroll's other works? If yes, then buy it because it's really just another Finntroll album. It doesn't evolve musically or go anywhere else, but it will still rock your Trollish boxers off, and really what else do you want?<br /><br />My favorite tracks are Blodsvept, Skogsdotter, and Midvinterdraken
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I could not get it to work and its not as easy as described. I am very unimpressed. Just plain horrible
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read, likes to read, or has ever picked up a book before. John is a Complete genious when it comes to writing entertaining and heartfelt novels. It one of those books that will make you laugh and cry within the same chapter. Highly recommend you read this book and I guarantee you won't regret it
B0084670FU|2.0|This movie was hard to follow and very disjointed. The language was bad and not for family, we did not care for it.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|I came across this band on Sirius!  Its new wave aethetics really appealed to me.  I was not let down.  It reminded me of a mix of the Cure, New Order, and 90's indie pop.  Great stuf!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really loved the direction the story took in this installment of the series.  The plot had some interesting developments and the sex scenes were some of the hottest, but I felt that with so many new developments, little was resolved by the ending of the book.  I enjoy a good cliff hanger, but this novel felt unfinished, especially when the author has to leave a note explaining that this isn't the end of the book, that we should join her to see where the story finishes.  I felt that it cheapened the story. Had she just resolved one of the many twists - the pregnancy, the marriage, the suicide, the Russian mob, the reporter, the rock star, the relationship between Eva's parents - I would have felt that the ending wasn't rushed or that it wasn't just a marketing strategy to get me to buy another book.  Yes, I loved the book up until the last chapter, but the lack of a decent ending really bothered me.
B00340ESIS|4.0|After reading this book, I took Snyder's 15 beats an applied them to several fiction books I had recently read. Every one of them, no matter what the style or genre, contained the 15 beats (and of course, a whole lot more). Save the Cat answered a lot of questions I had about why some movies and novels work and why some don't.<br />Snyder has an engaging style and offers concrete examples to back up what he's saying. I highly recommend this book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|More levels please.. really makes you think with some puzzles. Kinda bummed there isn't more levels to start. Can't wait.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|We need to know what's in our food and how it's made. Thanks a million to the movie makers and thanks to amazon who made this free to prime members!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! its very addicting!  I cant wait to see the movie! I would recommend this to everyone I know!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting :)<br />I play it every day :)<br />The graphics and sound are pretty good. I love the fact that you have to collect items to earn prizes!!
B000NY12LO|5.0|This is a can't put down , mind twisting , romance, mystery. I loved this book, but was sad to find out the truth. You would never guess it, but once you find out, you might understand. But who knows, we might th have we different judgements. I find this to be a very inspirational book, without the shooting. Just the fact that it shows how bad bullying gets, and how easily things can change. Thanks for the great read Jodi !
B006QPX6IG|3.0|This is a big project/long movie that stays true to Killer Angels.  However, it is poorly directed and acted.  The Battle deserves the budget, actors and depth of a Saving Private Ryan by Speilberg.  Nonetheless, enjoyable to watch if you have a good understanding of the battle and its historic significance.
B009K86D86|4.0|It's scary to think that Roundup has penetrated animal feed grains and as a result there may be Roundup in a lot of our meats and vegetables we eat everyday. EAT ORGANIC!!
B008602KQI|4.0|were better in my opinion.  The books made the social points more clear.  The film was glittery, glitzy, techno-perfecto, but not intellectual.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Marvelous cast. So much fun yet serious at times. Each character has an important part. Thrilled to add it to my collection.

B008VVT51U|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for anyone over 40.  Fantastic acting, wonderful cultural shots of India, and a superb story.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Similar to the X-Files in that it involves an FBI agent uncovering strange events that the government and other people keep secret from the mainstream public. It also involves alien conspiracies from other dimensions, which is a lot of what the X-Files touched upon.
0062255657|5.0|Like many people, my initial reaction to seeing the short length of Ocean at the End of the Lane was disappointment. After so many years without a new Gaiman novel, now we get one and it's less than 200 pages? But having read it now, my reaction couldn't be more different; no matter how many pages this book is, it's got more heart. character, power, beauty, and magic than dozens of other books I know put together. Ocean is a story of childhood memories, in which a man remembers back to a series of incidents that started with his kitten dying and ended with events that changed his fundamental conception of the universe. If that sounds hyperbolic, it shouldn't; this is a book about magic and the nature of the world, and over the course of the story, Gaiman creates a world that left me reading pages over and over again just to savor the astonishing descriptions and visions he had conjured up. In many ways, Ocean is an adult fairy tale - the characters all fit into basic archetypes of one sort or another, and the plotting is less about realism in any way and more in conveying an incredible series of events, cleverness, and rituals that expose something fundamental about the way the world works. But \\"archetypal characters \\" doesn't mean \\"simple characters,\\" because Gaiman, as usual, turns all of his world's inhabitants into vibrant, complex, rich characters that feel as though we've known them all for years. I have no doubt that all of this sounds like overly high praise, or that I'm overreacting to the joys Ocean holds. But to put it simply, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a masterpiece, one that transported me to another world and showed me sights that will linger with me for years after I turned the final page. It created an astonishing mythology, brought its characters to life, touched me emotionally, ended perfectly, and did all of that in less than 200 pages. The relative brevity of Ocean isn't a problem; indeed, the book is so rich, so beautiful, that to have it go on much longer would be too much. No, the biggest thing that the book's length will leave you thinking is this: how is it that Gaiman can pack so much imagination and magic into so few pages, and do more in them than many authors accomplish in a lifetime? I had high hopes for The Ocean at the End of the Lane, but it more than met them; it surpassed them and left me in awe of what it accomplished.it go on much longer would be too much.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I fount this  movie to be great escapist entertainment, just like the comics of my childhood. I hope to see moe like it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Don't understand why this has been on the Best Seller List for months.  It is really dumb.<br />I did not get into the book until I read 50% of it - almost stopped reading.<br />Janice
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love this game, couldn't put it down. The reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I downloaded it for free and halfway through the game they make you buy it for $5.00 otherwise it's a great game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game has been very fun and entertaining. it keeps me thinking. have to rate though so not a fan of that but oh well
B0084AZXKK|1.0|It was hard to understand, and did not hook me in. No one should have to read this. But the movie was cool.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|What appreciated most about this book was its honesty about success and failure. Altucher gives us permission to be ourselves as we actually are. In the process of doing this we will become who want to be, the kinds of people we could never become if we were trying to. I've already gifted multiple copies. You will find at least one idea that you can use, probably more, that will help to,reshape your life and your thinking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a refreshing game to play because it doesn't feel predictable.Timing is everything!I never feel anxious when playing this game.It has a light competitive urging for those young at heart teenagers.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES AND SANDRA BULLOCK JUST PLAYS HER CHARACTERS SO NATURALLY SO BELIEVABLY.GREAT! SHE SHOULD GET AN OSCAR FOR HER WORK EACH MOVIE IS SUCH A MOVING WORK.SHE IS SO BELIEVABLE.LOVE HER!
B002FQOI0A|4.0|at first it was a little slow and i didnt see how all the events Miranda was talking about connected but in the last few chapters it all became clear. At first i thought it was an okay book but as i read more towards the end of it i realised that it was a great book with interesting characters and plot. Overall i would recommend this book to anyone who loves realistic fiction and mystery. It is a great book for anyone from about age 10 and up. I even know adults who have read and loved this book.
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|This is a very good film.  I would recommend it to adults only it deals with very adult topics.  The portrayals of alcoholism, violence and abuse are very graphic.  Without giving to much away you could summarize the film by saying &#34;we all fall down and with a little help we all can get backup&#34;
1593272774|5.0|Every LEGO item on the store shelves was another kit--with the special pieces to make fighters, or turrets, or whatever.  Where did all the imagination building LEGO ideas go?  Well, with the addition of a LEGO motor (tiny) a child or adult can use IMAGINATION again, this time to build simple machines.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game fist day I downloaded it I ended up playing for hours.  Still have a tough time putting it down.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Movie was just like I remembered.  My 13 year old granddaughter wanted to see this movie so I know from experience, Amazon is the best place to find those things that are hard to find.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Don't care for, as it takes you to too many places.  You don't know how to maneuver around in it.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This movie has great 3D effects. The action will keep you on the edge of your seat. The 4 stars is because of some language. I liked the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really love this app. you wont regret getting this app!!!!! its a must have!!! can't wait to do the next levels.
B008518MOW|4.0|I have always been a Men In Black fan. I am becoming a 3D movie fan. When this movie came out as a 3D movie, I had to get it. The movie is pretty much a Men In Black movie with all the usual action. The 3D effects make this one cool. If you like Men In Black movies, you will like this one.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John's music has always seemed [to me] symbolic and apropos to human expression of feeling.  A definite recommendation to anyone considering this CD set.
B00CW665VI|4.0|It was nice to read a story like this from the man's perspective. Thankfully, this man has a good sense of humor. An enjoyable, quick read.
B00AANGHXQ|4.0|Another Blazy and Bob recommendation led me to this double CD offering.  While the second disk is largely a live repeat of the first studio disk, three numbers on it - So Excited, Voodoo Child  (Jimi Hendrix, 1968) and Little Wing - were worth the purchase and just outright awesome guitar.  Like so many great music artists gone before their time, Stevie Ray Vaughan's version(s) of soul, R&B, are timeless.
1250012570|5.0|When Park sees Eleanor walk onto the bus, he can't look away. She's like some kind of elaborately decorated train wreck. Park has a very tenuous, very small bit of social status. He certainly doesn't have any to waste on the crazy looking new girl.<br /><br />Eleanor doesn't want to be on the bus sitting next to the weird Asian kid even if he is the only one who will give her a seat. She doesn't want to be at a new school. She definitely doesn't want to be in the same house as Richie even if her mom swears things will be different this time. Eleanor doesn't believe anything can really be different. Not for her. Not anymore.<br /><br />At least they don't have to talk to each other.<br /><br />Reading the same comic doesn't count as actually being friends. Neither does wanting to hold hands. Or sharing mix tapes and batteries. Eleanor and Park both remember that first moment on the bus. What they don't understand is how they got from that first moment to a very different moment where no one else matters in Eleanor & Park (2012) by Rainbow Rowell.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is Rowell's second novel. It is preceded by her adult debut The Attachments.<br /><br />Set in Omaha in 1986, Eleanor & Park is technically a historical novel. I have wondered about the choice of time period,* and how it will appeal to actual teen readers, but at the end of the day it works. Rowell includes numerous references to the time including bands Eleanor and Park listen to, comics they read and more passing references to pop culture of the era.** I was born in 1986 and I caught about 98% of the references in this book. I'm not sure how younger readers would fair or if it would even be an issue to the overall reading experience.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is written in third person but it alternates between both Eleanor and Park's point of view allowing readers to understand their changing relationship even faster than the characters themselves. Eleanor & Park is one of the most romantic books ever--without, I might add, really being a romance. Instead this book shares a snapshot of Park and Eleanor's lives.<br /><br />I've heard people call this book sad or even heartbreaking. And there are some terrible moments, especially with Eleanor's circumstances becoming increasingly terrible. But there is also more than that as the story showcases smaller moments of happiness and hope. Ultimately, in addition to being a favorite read, Eleanor & Park is one of the most optimistic and hopeful books I've read this year.***<br /><br />Rowell's writing in Eleanor & Park is seamless as she weaves together the stories of an incredibly unlikely pair that is somehow incredibly right. If this book doesn't get some attention during awards season I (along with most of the reading public) will be incredibly surprised.<br /><br />*Rowell has a thoughtful post on her blog called \\"Why is Park Korean?\\" I never thought Park's ethnicity was a big question--or something that should be questioned at all really--but that post does offer some insight into the choice of setting.<br /><br />**My most favorite was an early reference to the Clint Eastwood movie Any Which Way But Loose. And of course Park's dad looking like my favorite 1980s private investigator was excellent.<br /><br />***Everyone has a different idea about three certain words at the end of the story. Personally, I am completely confidence everything works out as it should.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Strings Attached by Judy Blundell, The Secret Life of Prince Charming by Deb Caletti, Stealing Henry by Carolyn MacCullough, The Piper's Son by Melina Marchetta, Watchmen by Alan Moore, Stargirl by Jerry Spinelliever--without, I might add, really being a romance.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stop reading this review and go get this book! Its a great story of who we are and what we do as the human race.
030758836X|4.0|Absolutely loved this novel apart from its ending.After enjoying all of its suspense and twists and turns,it was an anti climax and I felt cheated as a reader.In spite of this,I would highly recommend it!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|An eye opener & very challenging. It shakes & shocks your know how and tells about a new way that's different and novel. In fact, the way it gets hooked to you is the way it teaches you to hook via pitching right.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Iron man with his third movie is now the official 2nd biggest hit next to the new star trek and man of steel. The big twist at the ending have people wondering where is Tony Stark now? Will this be the end of Iron Man? We will see in the new avengers 2 coming to theaters on July 13 2015. See you then
B009YX02T8|4.0|I have the soundtracks to three of the Twilight movies: Twilight, Eclipse, and this one. The Eclipse soundtrack, I just don't like much at all. I bought it before really listening to it, which was a mistake. This soundtrack and the one for the first movie, though, are ones that I enjoy much more. I like most of the songs on the album, and both are in my cycle of albums I listen to when I want some music. When it comes to the Twilight movie soundtracks, I'd definitely recommend taking each alone and not assuming that because you've liked (or not liked) one, you'll like (or not like) another. The movies were mostly directed by different people, so each director brought their own taste to the music they chose. Some of them may agree with your own tastes and others not. Definitely listen to the samples of the songs before buying (unless you remember well enough from watching the movie to know you like the music) and don't buy purely based on your opinions of other soundtracks in this series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have found this series to be so well done. The actors are perfect and dialogue is top notch. Maggie Smith is outstanding. I watched the first three seasons all at once. So addictive! Can't wait for season four.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love Charlene Harris' writing. I thought it was a great ending to a great series and I'm sorry there will not be more. I'm gonna miss Sookie...her friends, family, and enemies!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|E&G's personal problems are getting kinda old but I like where Day is taking the plot lines.  Gideon can surely afford a medication to help him sleep, can't he?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty awesome so far, and I've only been playing for 30 minutes!! Definitely something worth checking out!!!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I purchased this material for myself (Kindle download) and a hard copy for a dear friend on this same challenging journey.  This is a story about hope, caring and the journey of the human soul.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|What could've been a pretty good and contemporary telling of the origins of Superman turned out to be overrun and ruined by a needless Michael Bay/Transformers-type chapter of endless CGI explosions and destruction that way overstayed its welcome after only a couple of minutes. Nolan wrote or co-wrote all that into the story? That disappointed me. The movie, in my opinion, would've shined so much brighter if it had stayed focused on Superman's/Kal-el's struggles adapting to life on earth and showing how he came to be from those struggles. Instead, it veered off into eye candy and action that would've been best served--on a much smaller scale, I might add--for the next movie (which, I assume, there will be one).<br />I've really no desire to sit down and watch this again. It disappointed me that much.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|It's cute, it's creative, it's family-friendly.  Easy to learn, challenging enough to keep you entertained for a while.  The music is good compared to similar apps. Slightly irreverent, but nothing offensive.  And I am impressed by the permissions - it's kept to an absolute minimum.  Other developers should take note!
B002WPVNZM|5.0|In order to get the full experience from this album, you need to listen to it multiple times. Every time I listen to this CD I hear something new. OneRepublic takes you through a journey with each song, and the experience is simply enjoyable.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Although the subject matter is somewhat grim, the performances will keep you coming back for more. The entire presentation is so meticulous and well thought out that the sets and camera work are artwork in themselves. And...I don't see myself accepting any invitations gourmet dinner parties anytime soon.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I really enjoy this artist. It was a good mix of her old and new songs and even the country hits. Fun to listen to as your driving.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent!! Great script and acting. It is a very smart show where you can see all the political interests acting inside and outside of a company and in the legacy system.
1608871452|4.0|It is a BIG coffee table book where each chapter is devoted to a past season with glossy pics, pull out and pasted on gimmicky stuff, Fun!!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Good movie to watch wih family on weekend evening if you like history- relates cinema. Russel Crow is good as always.
0425263924|5.0|Can't get enough of Gideon and this is not the end of the series! Excited Sylvia decided to write another crossfire novel better than Fifty Shades!
B002N2LEVM|4.0|The concept of having a machine imprint you with a personality is a long shot but overall the characters are very well developed i this series.
0316228532|1.0|I listened to every word of this doleful, vulgar, seamy book while driving across the country. I knew it was an adult book and not intended for children but it is as though Ms Rowling set out to prove that in spite of her previous wonderful books she can write one that is as depressed and depressing as she is.  The book is a bloodbath of death, dark events, the foulest of language (how can a WOMAN so casually and frequently use a nasty word that denigrates all women???). There is not one happy person or one happy event in it and it rapidly sucks all the joy out of the reader. Most of the characters die, including an innocent child. It is not just gritty, but grimy. All the characters hate one another, cheat on one another, kill or want to kill one another, and there is no humor or lightness of tone anywhere in it.  I'm glad I only rented the CD set and didn't give her very much of my money for producing this kind of writing.  I knew it was an adult book but I wasn't prepared for it to be an expression of Ms. Rowling's ongoing clinical depression.  Good literature raises one up and inspires one to greatness; it doesn't drag one down into mud and guts and misery like this book.  Skip it altogether until she writes a decent one, and read one of the pieces of great literature that explore the development of GOOD character and have exciting, rewarding plots, like \\"Shane\\" or \\"Rebecca\\". Neither of these have happy endings, but they are well written, well plotted, and well developed. I'm not a prude and I'm not hung up on political correctness, but how can we condemn Paul Dean for using the N-word decades ago and not condemn  J K Rowling for currently using - PUBLISHING, even - the C-word repeatedly in this horrible, awful, depressing, joyless book???<br />This book is lacking decency in any form.  There's a reason the classics are the classics.  Read one of them instead and save your money, your time, and your mood.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Although the storyline is not unpredictable the music and choreography is stupendous. Cher and Christina Aguilera make a great team in this movie. I just love the music in it!
B00C1S945G|3.0|3 stars is the highest rating i'll give any video in the amazon prime service period  until they stop discriminating against android tablets and release  an app that allows you to view their video on android  tablets other than their precious piece of junk they call the kindle fire that runs a very restrictive and modified version of an older androif os.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I've read many of John Scalzi's books -- always enjoyed them and given that they are Sci-Fi, found them to be entertaining while being internally logical and consistent (something not every book does).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book -- or should I write &#34;Codas&#34; as in some ways, it is almost three books in one.  If you enjoyed the movie &#34;Crash&#34; I think you will like how the three codas intersect.<br /><br />Beyond that, the protagonists in the book asks a great question -- no spoilers -- that particularly resonated with me as well as my college-aged daughter.  I hope that you enjoy it as much as we did!!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Insufficient amount of  quests to be able to level up. Needs better chance to get the rare fish. Pearl chests are a major rip off. I was given a 36 sand dollars in a 5 pearl chest.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What fun ... Along with Wallee (spelling?) one of the very best of its type.<br />Very cute and moving.<br />Worth anyone's time.
B002I8PVQA|4.0|De Niro and Norton are 2 of the most talented actors around. They give this story an aura of believability that lesser talents wouldn't have been able to pull off. The plot is classic \\"heist\\" material;  super-difficult robbery to pull off....only one man can handle it....that sort of thing. Nothing too original here. But the acting chops of De Niro, Norton, Bassett and Brando elevate this movie beyond cliche.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good game that makes you rate them to continue on with the play. Kind of silly if you ask me.
B00296A4F4|5.0|This was a series I wouldn't have expected to like; a series about teenagers (which I am far from).  But immediately I was drawn to the diversity of characters.  I liked the idea that any kid could watch and feel understood and ultimately accepted.  I loved the way taboo subjects were unflinchingly tackled.  The characters are fun, funny, sad, confused, angry … the list goes on, all within storylines that make you champ at the bit for the next episode.  All this and incredible musical talent!  What more can one want?
B00846REIS|5.0|I read the reviews and a lot of people had the same thing to say... its like fifty shades of grey, well it is. But that didn't bother me. Captured me from the get go and held me to the end. If you like fsog you will more than likely like this. Although the excessive use of the \\"c\\" word was a bit much that's really the worst I can say about it. I genuinely liked the characters.  Don't disregard the book based on the bad reviews, I believe u can sample before purchase.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and waited a long time for the final boot. After Robert Jordan died I was afraid the conclusion would never be published or if it was it would lose something in the translation. Well Brandon Sanderson nailed it. Granted he had all of Jordan's notes but he did a great job of putting it all together and wrapping up the story. The shift in writing style was noticeable, but it didn't detract form the enjoyment of finally seeing the character development and the conclusion of the story line. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been a fan of the Wheel of Time series.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the way this app syncs all your other devices. I like the fact that this app allows you to buy books or anything so easily.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner.  Profound story.  Then I read his second book, A Thousand Splendid Suns and I was not as enamored.  Then I started to read his third book, And The Mountains Echoed.  I quit reading it because I found the writing to be so disjointed.  I was really disappointed.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I always enjoy the Jack Reacher novels.  He is a great hero  to me.  The author portrays a man who operates outside the law but has his own moral compass.
1781162646|5.0|Another one of those king books I found myself reading way past my bed time.  The next day I started it again.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This story is depressing and has a very tragic ending.  The book has some surprises but in general it is certainly not a summer read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is written beautifully. If you like character studies, this is your next great read. You will get totally involved with Victoria.
B001O03NCW|5.0|I love listening to this album. The genre is the basis of gospel, country and rock and roll today. Awesome!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I have owned this album for a few weeks now.  Love it.  Darius does a great job with this album.  A lot of heart and sole goes into his music and it is fun to share it with my kids.  Great songs and will continue to purchase his music!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He draws you in, captures you, only to release you with the last word on the last page. Even then, you're breathless, only waiting.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I am hooked on this show.  It has some comedy, some Sifi and a couple of beautiful women. And I like the idea of a Eureka
B0054XOMX4|4.0|my nephew cant stop playing this toy every day. I will order some more in the near future. thank you.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|You won't regret this purchase. If you like music at all, you can't help but love this album. There are so many sounds in here: soul, rock, blues. Their harmonies are the best yet (which is saying something), and the depth of sound is a step up.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|Best album on 2013 - josh homme is on top of his game with QoTSA best album to date.  Many guest appearances by different artist, such as Dave Grohl, Elton John and Nick Oliveri.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|First off, this review is solely about the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy product.  If you want a movie review, there are plenty of others to look at, but this is not the place. My aim is simply to review the product you would be purchasing, and not the movie itself.<br /><br />For anyone who intends to purchase this Blu-Ray with the intention of utilizing the \\"added value\\" of the UltraViolet digital copy for online streaming on your computer or other digital device, don't.  Simply do not.  In fact, it's probably a good idea to never purchase digital copy via UltraViolet ever, full stop.  Save yourself the trouble, these really aren't the droids you're looking for (hemorrhoids is more like it).  If you'd like to understand my reasoning, by all means, continue with this review and you will have a full account of why I gave The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Two Disk Special Edition  (DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) a single star (I'd give it none if I could).<br /><br />OK, so here's how it went down.  I initially contacted UltraViolet/Flixster (you need to sign up for two separate services, that are linked, but somehow different, but equally faulty) regarding my disappointment that I'd have to be tied into their ecosystem without choice, but I was reminded that \\"iTunes is not compatible.\\"  Yeah, it's available in iTunes, you mean it's not a service Warner Brothers/ NewLine Cinema wish to cede market share to.  Great, I get that, hope you have an equally easy to use service...<br /><br />Sorry, not in the cards.  After voicing my initial disappointment to hear that \\"most movies are now going this way because of DRM,\\" I begrudgingly signed up for the Flixster/UltraViolet account, only I didn't, or I did and didn't, sort of.  I typed in the digital copy code from the card enclosed within the Blu-Ray/DVD case and was prompted to enter my account information.  I successfully created a new account, and was given an offer to add 5 free DVD's to my Flixster account by downloading their app (hey, might as well add a few others if I'm ever going to use the service at all, right?)  So I go ahead and download the crapware and try and log in.  No dice.  Was my password wrong or can I not be logged into the app and the website at the same time? I tried logging out just to be sure.  Still no luck with the password, I tried to log back in on the website.  Password invalid?  OK, click \\"forgot password,\\" a new password is sent to my email.  I try to use it and it doesn't work.  Curious about UltraViolet side of the operation, I go to the UltraViolet website, type in my email and plug in the password, and Bingo!<br /><br />OK, so I'm logged in and go to account to change my password, I change it, and an emailed confirmation is sent to my address.  OK, now we're getting somewhere.  So I'm curious about how UltraViolet differs from Flixster, and decide to check my library, glad to see that Flixster was at least able to successfully talk to UltraViolet, even if I couldn't log in to Flixter yet.  Then this is where things got weird.  I noticed that the movie wasn't actually the Hobbit, but the movie Pay It Forward.  Wut? O.o<br /><br />No really, I clearly saw The Hobbit indicated when I typed in the digital copy code, and it showed my name under the library when I first created the account, so what happened?  Well, I tried logging into Flixster one more time, and, bizarrely, it stated that I successfully signed in with Facebook.  What, what???  I didn't authorize my Facebook account to sign in, and yet it clearly did it anyway.  Suddenly, the website wants to access my personal info and email address (which, har har, they already should have).<br /><br />I go to facebook, check and sure enough, the Flixster facebook app was added to my very short list without my authorization (I don't even know how that happens).  I promptly deleted the app from my facebook account, went back to the website, and noticed that The Hobbit was in fact gone from the library, only to be replaced with the saccharine and slightly constipated faces of Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment. At this point, I'm over it, I'm through with the whole thing, and, notably, I still can't sign in to Flixter with the regular password.  Sorry, but no thanks.  This is a friggin' nightmare that I don't ever want to relive, so what's the point of bothering and wasting my time trying to play along.  Next time, I'll think twice about Blu-Ray and, sadly, probably buy through an ecosystem that is easy to use, works and is reliable (iTunes).<br /><br />Really a bummer, but then this review should have been about a movie, or maybe even the Blu-Ray quality, sound, extra features, etc.  Instead, you got this pathetic tirade from someone who's just completely fed up with trying to navigate through the fragmented landscape of DRM control.  I can now honestly understand why some people turn to pirating, and that's just being honest.  I never did get those \\"5 free movies\\" through their DVD to digital program, I think I'll just have to resort to converting my DVDs using software and uploading to a private online storage and streaming that way.  I hate to do it, mostly because it's a hassle, and not my preferred approach, but they've honestly left me no choice.  Sorry Peter Jackson and everyone who was actually involved in creating this movie, but the distribution side of your industry really sucks and is undermining my interest in the quality of hard copy, and is forcing me to adopt a different standard to keep up with the trends in technology.  This upsets me deeply.<br /><br />By the way, the Blu-Ray disc was fine, it came in the box as promised, played fine in my player, and never showed a hint of anything remotely resembling Haley Joel Osment.  I will, however, never be purchasing another Blu-Ray that exclusively offers the joke that is UltraViolet digital copy ever again.nly to be replaced with the saccharine and slightly constipated faces of Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey, and Haley Joel Osment.

B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really like having the app on my tablet but I would give it five stars if when I am looking for a certain item it would show more than a just a few choices.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Great comedy, dark humor, but I can't stop laughing throughout the movie, but the ending could have been better :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't begin to explain why I like this show. It's not action packed, but it is dramatically packed. There is always something going on and the actors draw you in to caring. Give the first season about 2 episodes and then you should be hooked, after that each season has not disappointed.
0307950689|3.0|Although I loved the history of Washington DC, the familiar buildings, and insights into the Masons that are scattered throughout the novel, I found the characters acted largely in unbelievable and downright stupid ways. Langdon in particular seemed to be a dunderhead, running off to Washington with a secret, valuable object that had been entrusted to him, solely on a cell phone call from someone he didn't know. Really? There are similar instances of stupidity and naivete throughout--necessary for the plot perhaps, but still irritating. I can see Brown's wealth of research and I'm envious of his suspenseful pacing, but I find this book inferior to Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just read it. If you can put the back down before you finish chapter 1 then don't. Classic story telling.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked this book because it was a scientific approach to problem solving. However, may be a bit slow developing for a non scientist.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the first five rooms I escaped from.  Challenging but not difficult.  A good game to play while waiting on something.
B004661J04|3.0|Its a dark movie both in visual portrayl and the overall feel which I'm not fond of. But to put that aside and view it a little more objectively it did have good suspense, timing and its characters didnt magically posses super abilities like some movies which I liked.<br />  I thought Morgan Freeman's character was able to jump to conclusions too easily just for the sake of advancing the plot quickly. I lost interest at the end when Pitt's wife was dragged into the events which I not only didnt like but thought was a cheap was of getting audience shock.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I loved this move, but boy, did it get under my skin. Heartwarming, gut-wrenching, sad, uplifting, really well done. Even the little kids did a good job acting.
0446572993|4.0|I've read everything that D. Baldacci has written and I just couldn't seem to get &#34;into&#34; this one as well.  I finished it but think I'll have to read it again sometime
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Thought something profound would come out, but it never did. Great actors with nothing happening. Rarely does a movie make me feel I've wasted my time, but this one definitely did. Over 2 hours worth.
0525425764|5.0|I had to read it first to make sure it was OK for him to read, and it was.  It kept my attention too.  I should have known that anything written by Grisham woud be just fine.  I'm going to get the whole series for him.
0544139453|5.0|good condition & quick delivery.<br />novel is engrossing<br />will recommend to all my friends who love to read.<br />because of this book I ordered his other books
030758836X|5.0|Just when you thought you had it all figured out, you find out that you didn't. Was really interesting.  Already loaned it to my grandaughter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it isnt as good as the computer version but still alot of fun :D absolutely love this game so much!! welk thats my review!
0061950726|5.0|Such a great story the way it was all tied together.  I didn't want it to end.  I wish she would have kept writing a couple more chapters.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Gameplay is good and like real magic game.  Enjoyed the single player campaign and sealed deck could be amazing if expanded. Pretty solid title for fans of magic the gathering.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fun tho watch, keeps our interest with all the twists & turns! We are  Looking forward to the next episode!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a fun game. It is both easy and challenging at the same time. The only problem I have with it so far is this FORCED RATING,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, as Mr Sparks does capture your imagination and makes you feel as though you actually know the characters. I was so sad when I finished this book...I wanted to hear more!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I`'ve followed the True Blood series faithfully and wondered about the books that inspired the series.  I  started at the end and enjoyed the end so much I`m going back to  the beginning to learn all the differences the book series has to offer.  CJ
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Extremely addictive game. Would recommend if your bored and have a lot of time on your hands. Only problem is its hard on the eyes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A good game but there should be some option for hints or self teaching<br />To help out when a person is stuck
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|To start this off, I never really cared for the original \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" I just could never get into it ever. I thought this looked decent and I rented it on Blu Ray. First off, this movie looks beautiful on Blu Ray, The effects are great and make this movie worth watching. The acting is fairly good from everyone, Franco is great and the voice acting is great also especially the monkey, Finley, who never comes off as Jar Jar Binks and is a fun character in the movie. The story is good enough, nothing huge but still good. The first 5-10 minutes when they get to Oz is a little boring and a few other parts are but it's an entertaining movie for anyone so that's why I enjoyed it. Rating: 7.5/10
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing! Oh my gosh. I. Cried twice reading this book. I can't put into my head what kids like August feels like. I love how it has reality in it that shows what really happens in the real world. Thank you R. J. Palacio! AMAZING book!!
B00003CX5P|4.0|As a stand alone movie it is good but for a SW movie, it's okay I guess. Let's start off with the special effects and they are great for the most part. The non humanoid aliens look incredibly fake and the podrace carts look fake as well because they are painted too light and bright. The acting is mostly bad, Liam Neeson, Ray Park, and Ian McDiarmand are good in this film, Ewan McGregor was quite disappointing when you compare this performance in the other two prequels to this, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd are terrible, Lloyd is the impossible not to hate character with his moon face and his overracting, Portman is usually good but failed due to having the weirdest voice I have ever heard in a SW movie. This movie has three good characters (Qui Gonn, The Emperor, and Darth Maul) but has some of the worst like Little Anakin, Sebulba, Jar Jar, Boss Nass, and Queen Amidala's Decoy. The film has many problems but has enough to make up for it. Darth Maul is a flatout badass as he goes on Tatooine in search of the jedi, The action is pretty good, The lightsaber duel at the end is a fantastic scene and that's what gives the movie my rating. Rating: 7.5/10
B00B935SUY|5.0|Really a great true story of the legendary studio where so many of the greatest albums of Rock were recorded, from the 70's into the 00's.  It is sad that it's gone, but I'm glad that I heard the story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Wasn't sure how all the different actors would tie together, but it was flawless. Was a bit surprised not to see Edward Norton as Hulk, but the actor (whom I've seen in other movies) I felt did a good job. Full of great action, honestly nothing too un-family friendly that I can recall. Really enjoyed it.
B00846REIS|5.0|A very Easy read. Great drama storyline. Not sure if its worth $10 on kindle because I finished it so quickly.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Would watch again and again. This movie is fun to watch for the whole family. It is a little scary about how things could possibly happen like this though.
B009LE7AU4|5.0|I laughed cried and couldn't stop reading. You don't need to be a john taylor or Duran fan to enjoy this book. fantastic tragic and emotional.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|A gift for my wife and son they love these movies and books and I like to catch the movies myself great purchase and would tell everyone they should buy this set if they like potter movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive for not only me but my kids as well.  I would like to thank whomever created this game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the funniest game so far best game ever love the updated in Paris really fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great my sister had this game  I thought it was dumb but it is awesome because it is a brain teaser if u think it is dumb u need to try it and I promise u will be<br />amazed
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a great book and I liked it because it was a boy going into the  5th grade and making new friends
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I prefer reading classics over diary of a wimpy kid which I very odd but I think it's great.nothing inappropriate in a classic. I'm only ten and I understandably every book out there I think but jungle book is my absolute favorite
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read everyone of her books except one and am always thrilled with them.  No bad language and good clean material.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so awesome!!!! It is so addictive and makes.time fly because it's so fun!!! I can't wait till they come out with new levels!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a great game but it could get boring after awhile because it needs more stuff like on 360 and PC, I play it on PC and I think u need stuff like mine carts and more stuff like that plus to go along with CO-OP, it needs a free multiplayer server, I think everyone with this app would play on it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It goes with me when I have my Kindle and near internet connections. Easy to read  and compare one version to another.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a really fun game for all ages. Only problem I have is the game is addictive. I downloaded the game for my daughter but found that I am playing it more than she is.
B009L32R5I|5.0|Outstanding! I bought this last night and listened to same throughout the evening. Sounds fantastic. Great song selection. Some Genesis songs have Steve sticking to script, while others he puts news wrinkles in there. At under $10 for this download, well, let's just say it's well worth it. 21 tracks! I'm going full 5 Stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very well acted. Sets are beautiful and the whole production quality is outstanding. Its a unique look into a world and society that most people are simply unfamiliar with. You tend to lose yourself in the relationships and family dynamics and understanding of peoples state of mind in that era. I love the show.
B00368PSN2|5.0|While I would not rate it is the Star War category or Blade Runner....it was an excellent movie with action, terror and suspense...well acted and good visuals with a good story line.....a definite buy and collection rating.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The costumes, the sets and the characters are all fascinating.  The story lines move right along and there is suspense and surprise in every episode,  I highly recommend this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  It is absorbing, delightful and easy to get lost.  I couldn't stop watching and highly recommend.
B007JZGIMS|2.0|I bought this player because it claimed to have excellent cross-fade capabilities.  NOT.  What's so hard about having a cross-fade feature that really works, anyway, Amazon cloud  player?  Big disappointment.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Started watching this when it first came out but got too busy to keep up with it. Having a chance to watch it now is great. This is a great show. Hate to see it end.
B005SMGRH0|4.0|I wanted to see more videos, but this was ok.<br />Could have saved the money and seen more Gorillaz videos on YouTube...but the music CD was good
B005MLOKXA|3.0|The main character's gaze freaks me out sometimes. The stories could have more meat to them and the main story seems to go too slowly.
B00969PR18|5.0|:) nice app for kindle fire. easy to use. good features. easy to read . highly recommend this app. and it is free.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Bought the book on recommendation by another.  I haven't started it yet, but I've heard from reviews and friends that it great.  Don't know yet.  If I like it, I'll buy the books that follow it.
B004ZQ74G8|2.0|When writing about such difficult matters, it is of utmost importance to make the story believable. So much of this gruesome tale was not.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I love this game, but have to admit that I haven't used it on Kindle yet.  I'm enjoying the reading so much that games on Kindle seem a waste.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent series. Due to our fascination with reality shows and our love of posting violence done against others, these concepts are not so far fetched for our future.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This beautiful story was worth every minute. I enjoyed the writing style, one of the best. Well worth the purchase.
0062255657|5.0|The narrator, never named, is the classic 7-year-old unpopular kid. A loner who always has his head in a book, he is the sad kid who has no one come to his birthday party. After his parents financial fortunes wane, they take on borders, one of whom kills himself. This leads him to meet Lettie Hempstock, an 11-year-old who lives on a farm at the end of a lane, with her mother and grandmother. Soon, the trio's weird talent for knowing what people are doing and thinking becomes obvious. Soon the boy is whirled into a terrifying supernatural adventure that pits him against dark forces and personalities.<br /><br />Gaiman is an expert at putting helpless kids in harm's way. And of getting them out gain. But \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is NOT a kid's book. It deals with marital infidelity, suicide, nudity, loneliness and terrifying supernatural forces. It IS, however, a wonderful read and brilliantly original, like most of Gaiman's work. He know now to break through the patina of what we call reality, unveiling the dark and writhing forces beneath. Longtime Gaiman fans will recognize familiar themes in his writing - the scary monster-mother from Coraline, the three-faced goddess from the Sandman series and the unlikely bravery of timid children. But he packages these expertly into new forms.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" brings we readers into the impressionable mind of a frightened seven year old, letting us re-experience the chthonic darkness and magic possibility which the world holds for the young.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The Guernsey....novel uses letters as the only narrative device in telling the story of one author's personal journey as well as revealing the impacts of the German occupation on the Channel Islands.  This was one of those books that left me upset that it ended.  I wanted to know more.  One feels that you know the characters well because you are &#34;eavesdropping&#34; on their correspondence.<br /><br />I have another confession that I should make.  When I saw the name of the author, I did a double-take.  I knew a Mary Ann Shaffer.  She had worked for me 23 years ago when I lived in Marin County, California.  What a shock to learn that the author and &#34;my&#34; Mary Ann were the same person! And...how sad to learn that she had died before the book was such a success.  For me, the &#34;voice&#34; of Juliet WAS the voice of Mary Ann!<br /><br />I also related to this book because my French wife was born just after the War in a village on the Normandy coast that looks out on the Channel Islands.  We have just finished translating into English the diary of my wife's grandmother covering June and July 1944 during the Normandy invasion.  Both this diary and the book gave me an insight on what happens to civilian populations during war - something that is often missing in reading the usual history books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fast and fun. The game is simple and easy to play. Love the different country trains. Daily missions are easy to fulfill
B000JFDBXO|3.0|Action scenes were pretty good but there was no real narrative to pull it together. Character development was weak, motivations undefined. I was hoping for better and really wanted to get to know the characters better. Oh well, the action was pretty good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful season; however, I hated the end of it.  What a tragedy!  I won't give it away here, but if you have followed any of the internet news about Downton you know what happens.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I am enjoying watching this show from ne beginning. Many episodes have me laughing out loud.  Some are trite, and don't have the same hilarious factor, but the episodes are so short, you'll be on to a new one pretty quickly.  A silly show, overall, and I do so love digital content.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very enjoyable series, I will watch it again.  Downton abbey orig. uk version all season.  This is how I rate this series, thank you
B0046UGSNS|2.0|A little too simple and convenient. Seems as if the only purpose was embracing diverse families rather than fleshing out story.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|This movie started out similar to the book, then that just kind of went away altogether. I don't have a problem with discrepancies from book to movie, but when complete characters are removed and the actual story are changed to be unrecognizable, I have a problem with that. Not happy with it and would not watch again :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So addicting.  Having fun with this app.  Ready to keep going.  Hope their is a second version.  Lets keep it going
B009GEYX5E|2.0|The quality of picture is bad, the film cost more than it is worth.  The camera nor the film is worth it.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|meh... you can try if you want... only one actual game.. gets boring. maybe you'll like it... i uninstalled in a week.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Fifty shades of grey upgraded. I can't wait until the next book comes out. Definitely a good read from start to finish.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game has proven to be challenging and entertaining. I am glad to have found this. If you enjoy a challenge I recommend downloading.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great movie!  Wonderful performances by a great cast.  Highly recommend for everyone.  Captures the beauty of the broadway performance.  Don't miss it.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I love the first book in this series a lot, this second one seemed to drag a little though and I can't help but be frustrated with the main character's infidelity. She comes across as a bit selfish and braty in this book.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book did  not flow,  so unlike his first two books.  It was not as moving,in fact I kept waiting for it to get better.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved the way it was narrated in first person by the male half of the couple because (a) it was a fresh take on the romance novel and (b) the inner dude-monologue was pretty accurate. And by that I mean, dudes are crass. They are blunt. They dont think in hearts-and-flowers like women do. So I appreciated the honesty of the way they fell for each other.<br /><br />This wasn't my all-time favorite book but I will definitely read the sequel.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Love the story and what makes it more fascinating is it's based on actual events. Highly recommend adding it to your movie collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|3rd season great so far! I'm half way through, but it is my favorite yet. Even my husband enjoys it and be does not usually like shows like this
B0027CNFR4|4.0|Not a bad chick flick... it's not quite as good as the first movie, but still it's worth the watch.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Lots of choices.  Like the variety.  Really enjoying this game.  Easy to play and has great graphics.  The price is right, also.....free!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a good read.  It reminded me of Piccoult, where the view of a parent who feels they know their family inside and out only to find they do have doubt.  Also brings in the grief of bullying -- an age- old issue with serious results.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I recommend it to people who love temple run!!! Please get it it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth it!!!!! Please get it!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is part 2 in a 3 part series.  You have to take the time to get involved in the story and then you become eager to pick it up and continue.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|One of the more watchable Stephen King adaptations, The Mist keeps its viewer wanting to see what happens next for the entire run time. The ending is a bit of a whammy.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Housseini is a master story teller who, true to his mid-eastern roots tells tale upon tale and weaves them together in a complex narrative. The result is deeply satisfying and compelling. One person's tale complements a story from someone else's life and fills in the piece of a puzzle. His depicting of family relationships and the deep love between siblings is heartwarming and memorable.<br />I can't wait for his next book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really addictive game. At first I could not put it down. I definitely recommend getting this app. It is a lot of fun.
1878424319|5.0|I am open minded to practical ideas and teachings with a positive direction. This book did give me an opportunity to view life from a unique perspective. Great book/author. Recommend!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It is a fun game for all ages. Interesting and challenging the further along you are in the game. Good
B009NY43NY|2.0|The series has loss steam as it went along.  I finished all the books, but in the end it felt like the author had run out of ideas.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It does not perform as promised and takes up an entire outlet. Spending money on this item is a waste, its just a charger.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|the series was awesome. can't wait for season 4......by all means be sure to watch season 1 and season 2
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved it. I felt like I was living right along with him. You feel like you are in the story yourself. Fast reading did not want it to end.
B000RGUNHW|4.0|Wish the movie would have had more of the earlier songs from the band's vast library. Still, a solid flick for U2 fans
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|year for the next one. Loved the first two , they were hard to put down. This one was hard to read, it took me longer because I could not get in to it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|No directions, so you really have to use your brain! Really enjoying playing the game and hoping it sharpens my thinking!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|just getting into the Game of Thrones Series and this book grabs you and pulls you in quickly.  A well written and fun read
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book seemed like it was rushed. There is no wrap up to most stories. This was supposed to be a trilogy turned into more.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|Sums up most story lines and picks up the pace.. I am watching it again and having lots of fun..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game more challenging as you go<br /><br />Can't wait for the next game to start and to see how fast I can complete it
B001L1S1SK|4.0|If this show comes back i would see it again! I am only pending season 2.  I felt this season a little slower than the rest ...
B0062QRTKA|3.0|Not so bad, not so good. Animations are cute.. For Gameplay I demand more excitement .. Sounds could be more exciting ..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great and really addictive, and for that, I have to give the game a five. It's really well made. The only problem is that the game includes things like save me and the game itself is based off of the idea of temple run. This is not an original game,and for that reason, I suggest you get temple run 2, for free.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Saw Trombone Shorty in concert recently, awesome. I had never heard of him until a month ago at the concert.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game.  Makes you think and tests your memory.  the game is a good time waster.  This game is definitely worth down loading.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found it very difficult to continue reading this book. In my opinion, it is not as well written as the other two and I find the story to be lacking and predictable.
1432794426|5.0|I recently purchased this book and found it to be worth every penny I spent on its purchased. The author is truly dedicated in her pursuit of love and affection for Michael Jackson. This is a MUST BUY for any one who enjoyed MJ the King of Pop!
B0054JELS4|5.0|I love this show and when nothing else is on TV, I like to watch some of the older episodes of NCIS.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|What was old is new again! I guess old age and a desire to feel young again somehow inspired Black Sabbath to get back together and record something worthy of their legacy. Well done old dudes!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just found out about this series two weeks ago, I have read the first two books and I'm finishing this book, I could not put the books down.  I had to make a rule not to read the book in the bed because I wasn't sleeping.  Can't wait to find out what happens in the next book
1401216676|4.0|Very Alan Moore - intense and dark. Nicely bound. Cool edition to own, because they redid the coloring from the original.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's really fun to play and I would recommend everyone to try this game out. The only problem is very limited time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book continued the series wonderfully... Loved the story!!i look forward to reading the next book whenever it comes out!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I can not get enough of this game.  It is worth getting the full version.  Keeps me busy for hours.
0345529057|5.0|Husband is enjoying books and at such a reasonable price compared to the individual larger print copies. Great Buy and great service!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This was a pretty good movie although some parts were a little keep up with who was who and who did what to whom. Overall I enjoyed it and the leading man is not hard to look at.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game....fun to play not too difficult but enough to keep you playing. :) Find the hidden objects...solve the puzzles to open more doors so you can move up to the next floor.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|No, I am not -- yet -- a fan of Martin Freeman.  I want Ian Holm to un-age and play young Bilbo.  However, since Einstein's relativity won't cooperate and there is a limit to computer enhancement of an aged actor, I looked for any sign of depth that was, by design, missing from Bilbo.  I found it at the very end of the movie, when Bilbo says he wants to help the Dwarves regain the home and hearth he himself was so reluctant to leave, reluctant because he had it.  They didn't, and everyone deserves a home.  Perhaps, more than anything, this is why Jackson decided to make three movies out of such a short story.  I can't wait for the other two because, my little issue with Freeman notwithstanding, the production, cinematography, acting, and the 3D effects were all amazing.  And of course, Ian McKellen was recast.  If for no other reason, I am anticipating the rest just to see him.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I'd call this a good action movie. Little bits of humor added in, like most action movies. They added a tiny twist with the agent pursuing the lead character (Bruce Willis) , in that they try to make him likeable. Seeing who the exact villain is not so straight forward, though not some huge surprise either. All in all, good action flick.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I didn't even know this show existed until the 3rd season. I don't know how I missed it. It's amazing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm not able to get on my kindle fire its stupid it sayings there's an error when I try to download it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game to kill time. Also good to play with kids. My daughter loves this. Need more levels. Hints will be good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|She kept me wanting more through the whole book. Great read for those needing more than a simple love story.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|The people that made this game still deserve a star for trying to make a game at least. Even though it sucks
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a classic read.  I read it because one of my child clients was doing a project on it and wanted to talk about it.  It is a timeless, ageless, classic.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Covers great and protects awesome!  Will hold up the fire for reading on a hard surface in any direction.  Love it1
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A great classic novel comparable to &#34;Around the World in 80 Days&#34; and &#34;Journey to the Center of the Earth.&#34;  This is a fun story, especially for young readers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game will get you hooked easily.  I like that it is not the &#34;standard&#34; drop down pictures type game.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|This is a sophisticated story of aging opera stars avoiding the doldrums associated with life in a retirement home by staging an annual end of year gala production.  The story is filled with aging artistic &#34;characters&#34; whose eccentricities color their world, and the film is cast with actual former leading musicians and opera stars. The story is fascinating, filled with elements of love, anger, passion, kindness, ego and even sex.  Director Dustin Hoffman effectively guides the tale through a series of daily interactions and developments that expose the core humanity of the characters and send them to a triumphant climax.  Each actor, lead by Maggie  Smith, does a outstanding job of developing interesting and complex characterizations.  This film is definitely not for the &#34;explosions and car chase&#34; crowd.  But for those of us still interested in films that provide a &#34;people-centric&#34; story with an uplifting theme, this film is worth your time.
B009IF82SK|5.0|It was an easy and fast download and came in HD very well. It is fun to watch on the Kindle.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|OK - in an effort at full disclosure I must admit that I am not a Tom Cruise fan.  His off screen personal is so big and so negative that it usually gets in the way for me.  But I found this to be a pretty good action film with a sufficient amount of off-setting humor to make for an evenings entertainment. There are a variety of actors who would have brought more fun and charisma to the part, but Cruise does a journeyman's job.  The result is a popcorn and soda pop night at the movies.
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|I enjoy this app, but wish there were more help options.  I use it on my Kindle, so the help is extremely limited.  if you have a computer and it has more options on a PC or laptop, then have at it. If you are unfamiliar with the app and its functions it can be very frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good mind game but only 10 levels. I will be ready for the next 10 I hope they are just as good
B00D41H2PS|3.0|It's kind of hard to work the puzzles unless your really really a master at the point and click or riddle type games
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great way to spend a few hours. I only have it 4 stars because it wasn't long enough. If they add to the game I'll give it 5.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Wish it would have been longer! But it's a fun little mystery game  and I recommend it  to anyone who enjoys a good point and click adventure
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My 8 year old says its a great show and its free! She says the show is hilarious and Shaun is so cute.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Thought it was challenging but not to the point of giving up. Better than I thought it would be. Great graphics and flowed nicely.
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg offers personal insight and experience with current statistics, in order to uncover the reasons why women are not achieving career heights. The reasons are complicated and this book will not solve the problem, but it brings to light women's self sabotaging  behavior and starts a valid conversation. Sandberg's voice is honest and refreshing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome, fun, and addictive! I recommend this game highly! My kid's got me hooked on it and now we help each other with daily challenges.
B000035P5E|5.0|I had read the book and also seen the film before. Was very happy with the purchase.  Good quality too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first picked up Ender's Game about ten years ago in school and absolutely loved it. It ranked as my favorite science fiction novel and one of my favorite novels period back then and it is still ranked just as highly today. Loved it, I hope the movie does it some justice.
B004GYY714|5.0|It works. No errors. Better than iheart by a long shot. Couldn't find George Norey. That would have been nice.
B002KKCVQE|5.0|TEVA sells excellent sandals. This is my second pair in a dozen years and the 1st pair are still in use.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|This movie came to me in new like condition. It has a very good story and it will keep your interest through the complete movie. I rented it before I bought it and now it is even cheaper to buy through Amazon. It is a keeper and one that will be watched a lot.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Could tell where this story was going from the middle on but still a good read.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good murder mystery.
B007V4530A|5.0|In the first chapter I got everything I needed as a speaker. The creators of TED have given so much to this world of &#34;out of the box&#34; thinking. They have allowed us to be up-front and present at the world stage of brilliance and given us the back stage pass to witness a better, advanced, supported, esoteric and feasible world. This book takes you step-by-step with how to craft all aspects of your talk - from audience reaction to the music of your words. I couldn't take notes fast enough. Because I have been in the virtual audience for so many talks, it was fun getting the inside scoop on the presenters. It is easily written and clear as crystal to get the &#34;how to&#34; teachings. I can see it will be a &#34;have to have&#34; in my library. Anyone who deals with the public - a must.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I kept fighting, trying to see if it finally picked up...no luck. Others may like the disjointed approach. I am NOT a fan. Never even finished it.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|As long as the network is going to feed us garbage to rake in the money, we will continue to have a plethora of REALITY &#34;junk' on TV. This was a breath of  FRESH AIR - live air that was written, produced superbly. The cast the best. It was like being in New York at a new show every week. I don't know how they produced a full Broadway production each week. I actually worked meetings around it and planned for it. I don't even know what's on any stations anymore. I'm waiting for TV to fold into choice of online vs. TV. When we find something good like this - it's gone. Too much, Too little with networks now. I'll keep watching the reruns on kindle and be my own programmer.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Doesn't matter if you are a fight fan or not, the gritty and at times searing acting by Tom Hardy makes this one of my families favorites, and a movie i consider to be a classic!!  I wish they would make a sequel, i WANT to know what happened next with all the characters!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|YOU have to get this game it is wicked fun once you start you cant stop<br />Its so addicting to play yet so hard to finish a 5 v 5
B000HZEE64|5.0|Wish more people would stand up for what's right!<br />Great story, well acted, liked that the challenges the Coach faced were shown, not just the fanfare and Happy-Happy parts.  This should be part of the 5th-6th grade curriculum in this country, we need to get our children back to basics and hard work to earn your rewards in life!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The first novel I ever read by Gillian Flynn was Gone Girl.  It is a fantastic book!  Maybe that why I wasn't as impressed with Sharp Objects as I should have been.  It's a good book but after reading Gone Girl I was hoping for more.  However, one thing is for sure...Gillian Flynn is fantastic.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr hosseini is one of my favorite writers!!  I was elated to see that he had a third book released.  The way his words just tug on your heart strings is incredible.  So looking forward to number four!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Excellent concert. Netrebko brilliant as usual, You'll enjoy every moment of it, particularly the less frequently heard duets. Great value!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I'm a hard sell for albums or cd's.  My wife recommended Gary Clark, Jr.  She couldn't have been more on target.  Great sound.  Music to lose yourself.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am offended by the excess inclusion of alternative lifestyle (Gay) subject matter. Other than that, this is a rich content series which should be enjoyed by most mature audiences.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the entire book, I would recommend this title to people of all ages. This author has a great imagination.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|Man Yuri translations of Aurelius' writ ok mgs are impenetrable due to their use of archaic English vocabulary. This version finds a reasonable balance and promotes greater understanding of stoic thought.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a great way to pass the time. I don't like having to do a review but the game is fun.
B00006HAZG|5.0|This is a great, witty, and wonderfully acted version of the Dickens classic. The acting is excellent, and Daniel Radcliffe is adorable!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Excellent tunes that will keep your &#34;occupied&#34; and entertained.  If you like Maroon 5, then this is the way to go.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was amazing! I laughed and cried. I couldn't turn it off. I can't wait for the next season. Love this show!'n
B00124PXW8|5.0|You will always remember this movie because it will always comes back to haunt you.  It is great to watch it every so many years!
B00336G7HI|5.0|These are great batteries.  I always keep an extra one charged when we travel so I never am without power.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome!! I am an adult an I love this game just as much as I loved Mario Bros. I recommend it to anyone that still think about the good ole days of Nintendo!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A very engaging novel.  Words paint a canvas of Passion and ensuring emotions.  It transports you to a very personal and emotional zone.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The scripts are very smart with unexpected twists and turns.  The scripts frequently include difficult ethical choices that the main characters must make.  The acting is superb.  The closed captioning option is a great feature to have.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Absolutely great album, one word of advise is that the CD have a dynamic range of 5 while the LP version have a dynamic range of 11 making it sound a LOT better than the CD.<br /><br />Loudness war affected this cd and looks like everyone else in the industry is doing the same, loud and brickwalled is not better.<br /><br />So in short this is a great album with great music but the CD version is victim of loudness war.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No seriously, read this book. Try not to stay up late finishing it. Howey creates a world of speculative fiction that is fully flushed and believable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Clean ,dry humor drama. To watch Downtown Abbey and absorb on a Sunday and start a work week on a Monday is inspiring.
B009AJDET6|5.0|All of their best....better if had included !@&, but HEY, you can't have everything...but it would have been absolutely perfect.
B001E7EONC|4.0|Set in london in the early 70's...Very well done in every way, this movie is one of Statham's best.  It is full of suspense, intrigue, and life like action. The movie is based on a true story, the Baker Street Robbery of 1971,so stunts are at a minimum compared to other Statham movies. I highly recommend this one.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|It can't get more perfect than this...all of her early stuff well packaged to keep original artwork. Great for any Joni musci fan.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Intriguing and poetic in language and visual impact. I felt engaged and entertained. Time and place were well established. Class and gender discrimination were treated both objectively and sensitively.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I find the acting incredible and the story even better.  Maggie Smith makes it for me..she's the best. Get it!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was one of my top three couples for this series. It also started an interesting new arch to the overall plot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Waiting for the next season to start!  I wish there were more episodes in each season.  That said, one of the most enjoyable series I've ever watched.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I was really excited about playing this game. Unfortunately its 1.2 gigabyte size makes it too big to install on my first generation Kindle Fire, even after uninstalling most of my other applications and deleting a ton of media content.  It really is a shame, I would have like to have played it.<br /><br />Wizards of the Coast, please make your card based strategy game a reasonable file size. There is no good reason it should be so ridiculously large. If you customers cannot install your product, they cannot buy its content.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This was a cute movie!  I love that Santa had a German accent and tattoos!  What a great group of Guardians!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the first two books, but was very disappointed in the wait for Entwined with You.  Also, the fact there would be another book to follow.  Just to much waiting/time between. The books are very easy reading, entertaining but don't know if I will purchase another series of books from Sylvia Day.
1476729719|4.0|I have to say, I really like Jodi Picoult and was looking forward to reading this book.  I read the reviews on Amazon and was sure this was going to be a terrific read.  And it was.  What I absolutely DIDN'T expect -- and I honestly have no clue how I missed this in the reviews -- is that the tragedy that shakes up this small town is a school shooting.  Without giving away any of the plot line, I will just say that this book is well-written, and the characters are interesting.  I also have to say, though, that I found reading this painful, particularly in light of the New Town shooting.  The book gave me an interesting view into what it must be like to be involved personally in a tragedy at this level.  That said, I was happy to reach the last page and put this one down.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Really great book and series.  Not a typical ending, Very interesting and thrilling to read. Creative writer, very  impressive too
B00AR5BR8C|5.0|Great fun exploring the stereotypes of Welsh and English in this comedy. Hugh Grant is appealing, as usual, and the scenery and culture of Wales comes across beautifully.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|A novel which provides excellent descriptions about the complexities of Black culture in Nigeria, the Unites States, and England. The plot is rather thin, so this is not a page turner.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got the bag for my family cammera equipment. All I can say is that eventhoug is not a $100 bag it finctions well and is very versatile.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Crisp storyline and marvelous cast make for a great show.  Although this a close follower of the British story, I'm still entertained with this show.  I can't wait for the next year.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Soapy, trite piece that is almost as vanilla as all those little paperbacks i bought on subway :)<br />Needed to read to support conversation otherwise wont touch it
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I really love Glee, it reminds me of just how I was in high school.  My friend reccomended this movie for me and I enjoy it so much!!!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|The first book was the best. It ended with a cliff hanger. The second was not as good and also ended with a cliff hanger. Fine - so you had to read the third book. Another cliff hanger! After reading three books I think the reader expected more than that. It was clever but not satisfying. There were many questions unanswered. Also the ending was sloppy -  why would any parent, knowing the danger, allow their son to go off to the most dangerous place he could. It made no sense.Was Archer in such a hurry to finish the book??? Is he planning a 4th??
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|This is the best prequel I have ever seen! My granddaughter and I have watched it many times already! It's a must see if you like the original Wizzard of Oz!
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This app seems amazing, but the thing is, i cant play videos on it! It isn't just this app, its all the other apps I've tried too. It won't let me play any videos. It just freezes up my kindle fire hd. im really worried.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I've read the first five books and had no interest in the HBO series until<br />a friend asked me some questions about the Game of Thrones.  I tried to<br />explained it but I found it to complex to give a quick explanation of the people<br />and their relationships.  I found it easier to watch the series with them and<br />fill in some of the gap.  I found myself watching more and more for the pure<br />enjoyment.  It is much better the I ever expected.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse books and I feel that the last few books especially this one have been very rushed. Almost like the author was sick of the series so she rushed just to get it over with. The book was a page turner up until the end when it left you hanging with no explanation as to what happened with the rest of Sookies life....maybe she wants you to decide that for yourself...or maybe she leaves you hanging so you have to buy the next book..
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|The movie is great,  but amazons quality of streaming is very poor only could get through half the movie because of all the buffering.  Really disappointed in quality really wish I had know before renting.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have read all 3 books in the series and I have enjoyed them all. I like Sylvia's writing style.
B008Y5FNL4|4.0|Maybe tame now, by current standards, but the insanity of war holds up well.  You need to think about what this movie is saying
B00CWY76CC|4.0|You have to solve the puzzles, and they're tricky. You have to move the colors by looking around the room and finding colors.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|You really believe the clones are separate people. I cannot even imagine how difficult this must be, but Tatiana does it and does it well. She maintains individual mannerism for each clone really selling you on it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Got this game for my Niece to play and now I'm starting to play too. It has really good graphics and I like how it in a way teaches how to care for a horse.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love how it further develops the relationship and leaves you wanting more! Good thing because there's more to come!
B0061S073A|5.0|I love being able to control their kindle. lol they don't listen to me when i tell my kids to play this for a while and stay off of that. this app has really turned the tables.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app was the right amount of fun and challenging to pass some idle time. I had to put some thought into most levels, but not so much as to get frustrated.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I wanted to punch myself in the face for watching this. It was terrible. I'm not at all impressed with this movie. I love MW, but this was ridiculous.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I cannot get it to sync so I can check calendar online as well as just on my phone....Android.  This  has been very frustrating.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I was very well made. It's a movie that the whole family can watch and lived up to all of the hype around it! I wish i could've seen this in the theaters.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|love the challanges of going against others and saving yourself at the same time. haven't gotten to play much, having trouble getting online to play. didn't realise it was an online game when I got it, but I enjoy all the Angry Bird games.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am so greatful for this site. it connects me and my family that is all over the world. it is my first line of defense in communication.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good read.  Not exactly the kind of book I read but surprisingly fun and exciting!  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've used this app for everything! IT's absolutely awesome. I just wish that Corporate businesses would stay off of it.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Sweet storyline, and you can feel the music and happiness flowing through the old folks living in this unique performing artists' retirement home. A great feel-good movie!
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie kept me wanting more!  I highly recommend it.<br />Ben Affleck gave a believable performance. A thumbs up for this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is my favorite series at the moment...love Gideon and Eva...cant wait for the next one...i am so excited that she is going further with this couple
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome! I have played it at least 20 time in a week.  I am trying to lean how to take care of a hourse  and this helps me ALOT.
1599218011|5.0|I have Stage 4 cancer & since starting this way of eating/life,I feel that I've added time to my diagnosis of 11-13 months to live. Thank you Kris.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an incredible read that happens to be a true story of the combat and chivalry in the skies during World War Two. I was sorry when it ended as I wanted it to go on and on. The book and stories touched my heart in many ways. I was especially glad to hear the German hero was reunited with some of the United States B17 crew that he saved with his kindness and christian beliefs. What an honor to be able to read about these courageous men. My thanks to the authors Adam Makos and Larry Alexander for bringing this fine work to all of us.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker- Award-Winning Author of \\"I Saw the Light\\" - A True Story of a Near Death Experience
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Fabulous book-couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've read in a long time. I would highly recommend it.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I like it a lot I have it on all of my electronical devices ... if u like watching music videos this is the app for u
B005VPXR3Q|5.0|Kathy Bates and James Caan perfectly captured King's macabre horror in this film and played it out beautifully. The progressing development of Annie Wilkes' character was masterful.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|This is my favorite CD from the boys. It is SO MUCH better then their first soundtrack--which I also loved. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes a rock-pop kind of genre.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it's so fun to play !!Another thing is the guy driving a hobo ; )<br />I would think that only little kids only played this but I'm 15
B00021HBGS|5.0|If you have an active child, and you want to keep him busy while showering, this is a great toy which provides hours of fun.
B0026Q8F6C|5.0|Words cannot even express how much I love this movie. I watch it every night and fall asleep listening to it.  My wife...well not so crazy about it but who doesn't love a good musical?
B000JML90Y|4.0|A little hard to read since it was written soooooo long ago but very interesting.  Everyone should read this so they will have a better understanding of Darwinism.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 9 year old son plays this game and the associated games with great passion for hours as much as he is permitted to. He would certainly recommend it to other kids of his age range .
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I just started watching Game of Thrones. I went into it not expecting much, just another average blood and gore flick with predicable characters and predictable if not redundant plots & schemes. But after I watched the pilot episode, I knew right away that I was viewing something extraordinary. I don't know why it took me so long to get this, I'm not a trendy person. I heard all the noise people have been making over this show and now I understand why. It is my delight to tell you that this series is amazing! Watch it for yourself and see. If you even remotely love SCIFI, action, suspense, and stories about knights and kings, and epic battles, then you will want to watch Game of Thrones.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son plays with and other games for hours. He seems thoroughly satisfied with it. I am sure that he would highly recommend it to other kids.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|My review would be the same as countless others.  George Lucas lost his mind, and I'm glad someone else has the reigns.  If only they could go back and tweak the originals properly, and maybe retain the integrity everyone will be happy again.  Regrettably, George did an interview stating how the prequels were very much his answer to his displeasure with the Bush administration.  Had I known that prior to purchasing, I would have cancelled the order and never given George another dime.  Entertain, don't politicize, George.  You're not good at it.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|The twists & turns will have you gleefully enjoying the unexpected. Throw caution to the wind and just buckle down for a fun ride.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This has been a fun game. It challenges without creating frustration. This was just the type of game I was looking for. It starts out relatively easy so that you get a good understanding of how the game works. Each level gets a little more challenging.
B006885EFE|5.0|Stephen Spielberg & Tom Hanks put together a beautiful tribute to the Veterans of WWII in Europe. From D-Day to Market Garden to the Battle of the Bulge and finally the taking of the Eagles Nest. The story of the the 506th PIR 101st Infantry, E Company men is a must for all, lest we forget.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|After reading half of this book, I decided it was as accurate a comparison I could come up with. Adam Johnson nails it. Run, Jun Do, run.<br /><br />Must read.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|This movie is flawless. Russell Crowe is unrecognizable as Bud White. Kevin Spacey is all charm. Kim Basinger is luminescent. Guy Pearce is at his best. An all star cast including; James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny DeVito, and even a young Simon Baker. I love this movie!
B005FQ2H8W|3.0|Good movie for holidays. Plot is OK, actors also. Not a great Science Fiction movie but not a bad movie.
1843106698|5.0|Easy to read and understand. A good overview of Asperger's Syndrome and how to live with it. Differentiates between Asperger's and other autism spectrum disorder.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A movie I can watch over and over. High School was that way......Real is Real and this movie made it real
0140120416|5.0|Apparently this is one of the best books for a beginner to have when they're studying Russian. I purchased this for my brother months ago. I think it was over 8 months ago in fact. I still see him with it every now and then. He studied it so much that I started hearing Russian people that I'd never heard before.<br /><br />It's got to be a good book, because he's speaking full sentences now, and he understand basic Russian spoken by others. I recommend this book for anyone looking to get their sibling into speaking Russian! lol
0739341340|4.0|I've already used this material to create buzz and excitement in my landscape classes and I'm really enjoying the listen. It's one of the most important awareness' to cultivate in the information age.<br /><br />However, the authors themselves don't use a lot of their own suggestions in the material. They will spend many minutes methodically going on about how you need to say things briefly in order to be remembered. As a result, I have already forgotten much more of their good ideas than if they had used their own formulas to write each chapter. In short, stickiness is not and never will be the only or most important attribute of good information. It is one of many. And that's a good thing. It's now a month after reading the book and I can't remember a single thing except that stickiness is good. But because I know there is value there I'll go back and re-read the information when I need it. I just read another book: The Happiness Hypothesis and it has stuck with me five times more than made to stick has. I think this speaks to the fact that it is much easier to talk about sticky stories in a book like this than it is to actually create stickiness at will in any company/setting/book/chapter.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Nice to have a facebook app for my kindle fire. Much similar to the app for my galaxy S3 and works the same. Much easier to use than opening the web and actually going to facebook.com.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love it so far - but for some reason I have lost it on my Kindle.  Can you possibly help retrieve it?  I do not know how it happened but it has been a few days.  I loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;  and &#34;And the Mountains echoed&#34; matches it and perhaps may even exceed it if I have a chance to finish it.<br />Please help me find my book<br /><br />thank you
B007QEHQY6|3.0|I wasn't as big a fan of his as I had thought. I don't know enough to rate the quality of the recordings.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|really fun for the whole family. Steve Carell was hilarious ! Really loved his minions. Music production was great also, can't wait till part 2.
B008Y6SLL2|3.0|I love Kevin Spacey, but this movie was not that good.  It kinda dragged for me, and seemed like they ran out of money so they cut some scenes that may have given the movie more substance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was told this was a great series, It is full of sex and a little romance. Read if you like.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really like this author and these are my favorite books. I read them again while waiting for the next one to arrive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was told to read this book and I did. It is full of sex and a little romance. Read if you like this type
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Received a Kindle Fire as a gift and wanted a case that would protect it.  This does the job - wish there were more bright colors available or maybe even patterns.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was told to read this book and I did. It is full of sex and a little romance. Read if you like this type.
B001EBYMAI|5.0|one of the best comic book movies ever,based on a comic but not kiddified and doesn't center 90% of the movie around the main character's girlfriend!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like having the bible on my kindle. It is easy to carry and use in most situations. I would recommend it to anyone.
B001IASHWY|5.0|one of the few movies that the sequel is better than the original. also another great comic book based movie, the best ones are always the ones you wouldn't even know it was based on a comic book just by watching it, like Constantine, The Crow and the Hellboy series.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like this game would love it if you didn't have to bye all the hints to rare fish when you don't need them to figure out what to grow for them. Would give five stars if game worked more smoothly.
B00C0EA1TO|5.0|This was the same version as the bluray it was the best batman film since the dark knight I loved tom hardey as the dark evil bane...
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This movie was not good, it was a poor revamp of the original and it was really dumb. I expected a new story and a different take but it was trying to hard to be a prequel. You really shouldn't mess with the classics.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|perfecto
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What more do you need to know? It's the original Star Trek that I watched when I was a kid. I love it!!!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|A surf movie with a good story line.  You can watch with your family.  Supposed to be a true story.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Pros: cheaper than other gaming mice, plenty of customizable buttons, great tracking sensor, comfortable ergonomic design (for right-handed people), easy software to deal with, good-looking design<br /><br />Cons: feels too \\"plastic-ky\\", can only adjust the logo light, side buttons feel awkward (seems to be too large for me), very light mouse (I prefer a heavy mouse - even with the included weights, the mouse is still very light), the thumb rest is covered in a rubber-type material that is slippery (traction isn't very good), the whole mouse feels slippery (especially, when my hands get sweaty)<br /><br />After a month of using the mouse, I was not satisfied. The cons outweighed the pros for me. In saying that, though, I do have to commend the GREAT customer service that Anker offers. I've added a star in my rating. They actually refunded me, and for that alone, they deserve another star from me. I wanted to like the mouse, but it was just too slippery and too light for me. If they ever make update the mouse in the future, I hope they make the mouse better in terms of the materials used for the exterior and make it way heavier. I don't even mind if they make it a bit more expensive, I would gladly try it out.
B005PK57IK|5.0|like the caharacters and the way they are developed. a fun show to watch.  there are definitely winners and losers
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This device has enough positive reviews.  I just wanted to drop and tell you about the excellent customer service provided by the seller Anker.  I was contacted by customer service directly to make sure everything was ok (I assume they do this for all purchases).  I originally had a minor problem and they were very responsive and helpful.  They mailed me a new device in two days free of charge.  This device works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I suppose that if you a child with absolutely NO concern whatsoever for acting... and with NO concern whatsoever for plot... and were ONLY interested in 3D effects... then this movie might rate something greater than a 1.<br /><br />But, since I am not a child, AND I didn't watch it in 3D...  I must give the on-word critique... YUCK<br /><br />I rarely just stop watching a movie that I paid to rent.  After about 35 minutesI simply could not force myself to continue the agony.<br /><br />This movie was trully awful.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the customizability of this app! This is by far the best app like this I've found! There are so many sound options to choose from!
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Anything with Maggie Smith in it has to be good and this movie does not disappoint.  The acting is superb and the music alone is worth watching the movie.  I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this one and could not wait to read the rest!!!  Well written.  HELD MY ATTENTION and I do not like to read!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Very interesting story but because a different style of writing , it was a little slow reading.  I found it to be more of a learning experience than  a for pleasure reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I do not like to read but WOW, THIS DID HOLD MY ATTENTION!!!!!!!  I thought the story was very well written.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Generally good story.  Interesting to see Tarintino's view of this era.  However not necessarily true to typical tarantino style.  Would recommend to watch.
B0061S073A|5.0|I live this app my daughter was buy apps when I wasn't looking. Not anymore! Thank you kids place. I recommend it to all parents.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I purchased Office Suite PRO. Spreadsheets MUST support multiplication; the app I downloaded does not. A tap on the \\"?123\\" button provides me with TWO rows of numbers across the top of the keyboard (?) but no \\"*\\" key for multiplication! The test drive shows a different keyboard layout than is provided with the app I downloaded. This is not a minor oversight - it is a major screwup.  If I cannot get this problem resolved soon I'm going to want my money back
1401937268|3.0|I am a tarot reader and collector for over 20 years. I always gravitated towards darker, whimsical and goddess type decks.  This deck is way out of my comfort zone, in types of deck. I like the deck the color and imagery is wonderful.Doreen and  her artists do a wonderful job.<br /> I also found she put all her oracle stuff, angels, dragons, unicorns, fairies and mermaids and packaged them up in one deck. It works, but having all happy positive readings for me is  unbalanced, but that just a personal thing on my reading style.<br />The size and how they handle while shuffling didn't like that, taking it out of the box cards stuck together. For me its not practical to have them that large in size,I shuffle my tarot cards like a poker player.<br />The deck is ok for beginners, I still think you need a basic knowledge of tarot. But that's my personal opinion.<br />The deck picked me after falling off the shelf 3 times while looking at other decks, so it came home with me.  Although I like this deck, I can't say I love it, it doesn't have the excitement like when I got her Goddess Oracle cards, which I love. I may still have to work with them more,I'm not used to all positive in a tarot deck.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Great service for an amazing movie! Got the movie in time as well as in great condition. The special features are great.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This is an amazing movie! You will be amazed by the aerial performance of the performers in this movie.it even tells a story where you are pulling for the main characters.
B000002LCX|5.0|This last album of Smiths is amazing, I liked very much. And recomend of all people. Buy it. There are many specials songs.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Very sweet show.  Well acted with interesting story lines, each episode is different with focus on different cast members.  Gives insight into life in two different settings.
B007F5S1FY|5.0|This first album of Smiths is amazing, I liked very much. And recomend of all people. Buy it. There are many specials songs.
6304806469|4.0|I remembered this movie fondly from my childhood and wanted my 4 yr old daughter to see it.  It's still a very cute movie and she really liked it.<br /><br />What I did not recall was that it's over 2 hours long which was pushing it for a 4 yr old.  It's also very &#34;British&#34; so I found myself  having to do some explaining.<br /><br />Still very cute though.  We sang Mary Poppins songs at my house for a few weeks after watching it.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I find myself unable to stop playing it most of the time. It is very entertaining.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|Great ideas! I would like to see couples who have taken the plunge together and did this. Perhaps you discussed it and I missed it.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|This album is a true return to form for Queensryche indeed! For all those die hard fans who witnessed their musical change over the years will be pleased to know that what once was Queensryche is once again present today. If you compare this album to Geoff Tate's \\"Queensryche\\" you'll hear exactly what I'm talking about. THIS IS QUEENSRYCHE! Todd La Torre has proven himself to be more than worthy as a legitimate front man and has joined the group with a positive approach. Not only can he deliver when it comes to the hits but can also bring credibility to the table as far as new material. This album ROCKS! Buy it but do yourself a favor...buy the mp3. This album is not lengthy by any means and I've debated on what version to buy. After spending hours searching the stores with no luck I finally decided to download it. I'm glad I did. Unless you're a packaging supporter or in it for the extra goodies than the music itself is worth saving a few bucks. Enjoy!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Easily one of the best booKs I have read.  You feel as though you are in the midst of the characters feeling their joy and  sorrow.  The ugliness of slavery is depicted as well as the inner beauty and determined spirit of the characters.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Loved it!  I am just getting a chance to catch up on watching the Batman movies.  This one is great.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing angry birds when I'm waiting in a doctor's office.  The supplier quickly provided my app so I'm ready.  The Rio theme is great.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|What a fascinating book. I chose this book randomly to read and I am glad for my decision. It makes you wish for such a place...Maybe the circus will be at my town next.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|As I read this, I kept thinking that the author had in mind that it should be made into a tv miniseries or movie.  I was, therefore, very unsurprised to discover that she is a scriptwriter.  I thought the book read like a somewhat extended synopsis.  Anyone who's ever done a creative writing class will probably have been exhorted to &#34;show, don't tell&#34;.  Ms Joyce would do well to bear that in mind.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I fell in love with the lead villain.<br /><br />It is a good mix of cute, heart warming, thrilling, heroism, good music and a good fast story. Will soon buy a DVD for keeps.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has everything you want in a book! It has romance, some funny quirks, sci-fi, action, everything. I love the Hunger Games and the whole series. There amazing!! Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. You somehow feel that you know Katniss and her feelings. I'm telling you, read it.<br />You feel the struggle for her sister and her mom.<br />The longing for Peeta and his embrace.<br />The fighting unknown<br />Choosing to fight for your freedom.<br />The choice of the boy who saved her life when she most needed it and her &#34;love&#34; in the games. Or the best friend she has always counted on for years.<br />Peeta or Gale?<br />The spark of rebellion.....
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like it but the problem was to install it.<br />Explanations where not clear enough and after 4 trials , I found it.<br />Now , I find it very usefull
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|I was skeptical at first as I haven't watched many classics but was soon sucked into the plot and was highly entertained!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really great game to play when you are bored! perfect for horse lovers like me :) doesn't lag or blur
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Im kinda angry that they dont have game updates yet on amazon this is not even close to the one on google play
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|we love the cute graphics and the way it imitates.<br /><br />the next one w/ the iphone is even cuter - they go back and forth!!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Two brilliant musicians playing off one another to perfection. Magic listening, I was extremely happy to receive the bonus DVD with this purchase. It was the icing on the cake!
B004498KPU|5.0|arrived on time and in time for me to open and start ajourney through the years of hits and favorites from this mega super star and human being.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Do yourself a favor and block out some big chunks of time to read this book. It'll be worth it. Great read, but if you read it as I did--in drips and drabs over several weeks--you'll have the feeling that you're not quite getting it. And you'll be tempted to drop it. The plot unfolds in a fairly complicated way that would easily be handled if reading large chunks in one sitting. I had to constantly go back and try to piece things back together when I picked up the book each time.<br /><br />It was worth it though. In fact I think I'll read it again after a bit.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|arrived on time and in time to pop it in the player and catch up on some history 101 from an African American perspective and experience here in these untied staes
B0091WNK8M|4.0|If you've wondered how middle school age boys act, here's a good place to find out. Reminds me of when I was their age. Fun movie with lots of laughs and adventure. Worth the watch!
B00192IV9U|5.0|fans will love it and new comer also can get some of the essence of the king of pop. arrived on time and in time for me to play it over and over until I discovered which one will be my favorites from this album.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This issue falls squarely into the category of things that I don't want to be true, but probably are true. This explanation of the economic state of the world is the best fit for the data, and, as the authors point out,  if there's an 800 pound gorilla in the room, there's no point in ignoring it. There will be an ever shrinking demand for labor, worsening, on average, each decade by several percentage points. The fact that job creation has equaled job destruction in the past was a fortunate past trend, but was not, and is not a basic law of economics. The acceleration of technology will slowly eat away at the demand for labor, and, feeding upon itself, will worsen exponentially. While it's true that the future will bring tremendous abundance, there will be significant political upheaval, and we will face that upheaval with a political system mired in a quagmire of beliefs that evolved a century ago. A good 25 to 50% of us will be, eventually, simply unnecessary in the economy, and our current political system does not have the flexibility to adapt. We'll live in.....interesting.....times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hollywood are you reading......if you are then take note.  This would be an awesome movie!  I can totally see Angelina Jolie playing Jules!  Either way this is one good book. Characters are real, even the minor characters are memorable.  I haven't been engrossed in a book this interesting in a while.  Its nice to remember why I read in the first place, it is for books like this.  Destined to be a classic. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was the best book that I have ever read and I definitely suggest you reading it right away!!!!!!!!!:);) definitely a five star book!<br /><br />PS :I love AUGGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:);)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like it. It's simple and fun. Hopefully it keeps up the fun, only on floor ten.  Cool game.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Firefly was terrific. When it was cancelled by FOX Joss Whedon made Serenity to tie up the loose ends. He did a great job. This film can stand alone from the series, but is a good resolution of the story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS SITE, LIKE GOING SHOPPING WITH OUT SPENDING MONEY, SO MUCH TO LEARN AND DISCOVER TRY IT
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 4 year old loves this game, just like any other Dr. Panda game.  Fun, lots to do and easy to use.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|been having so much trouble with my kindle recharge cord that I was so happy to find the original to my device, and this works great so I can use my kindle again!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl has shown how vulnerability, growth, and achievement all go together. This honest and well-written account of her personal and professional journey is a generous gift to all women....and men too!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|great songs! I am not sure what I am supposedto say beyond I loved it so I am filling this up as best as I can
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Fun movie. If you liked princess bride you'll enjoy this one. Puts  a new spin on an old fairy tale.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very customizable, I enjoy being able to choose how I wake up. Since I'm not a big morning person, waking up to my favorite songs makes my mornings a bit better. Love the slide to dim feature. Worth the 99&cent; completely and totally
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is an absolute must read. I will include some quotes below - and if you don't laugh..well I don't know how none of these would make you laugh - but I suggest stopping whatever you are doing, heading tot he bookstore or Amazon and getting this book. Clear your calender and read it! You will not regret it.. If you're in a slump of those ooh too serious books, this is the perfect read. If you're on a beach just relaxing - perfect read. And if you need some great laughter and humor with some hot romance, perfect book! The story line is fresh and real. It's being told from the male POV and seeing inside of his head makes the story that much better.  I also think the way it's told as if you're being told a story makes you feel part of the book, like he is talking to you - loved that! Drew is unfiltered, honest to a fault sometimes, raw, and real.  Kate is his perfect match. I just read a book called \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\" by Stephanie Perkins and in the end she references that no one is perfect, but everyone is a perfect match for somoene else - and I love that and think it's true here. Drew truly didn't believe in love until he found Kate.. and his level of worship for her is swoon worthy! Drew was a character that took you in by the first page and while you love to hate him in the begining, you'll be rooting him on in the end. Now - where is book #2?? I cannot wait -- I need a second book now! This book gets 5/5 sunshines for it's funny, romantic, and well told story. Check out the quotes below and then click on the link and buy the book from Amazon - you know you want to!! Get it! Today! Then tell me what you think!! So - check out the quotes and if you are not convinced already - then buy the book and read it, right away!<br /><br />Link to full review:<br />[...]
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Not really a feel-good child's story, regardless of the talking rabbits. Very well written, and a great favorite that you'll always remember. Mostly because it manages to make talking rabbits into a serious, gripping, adventure drama. That takes skill.
B00BESKTMG|4.0|The plot is interesting but it has a few holes here and there. The soundtrack though is perfectly mashed with the action. That's what makes the movie.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|This album has all his best songs' Brings back memories.  If you are a fan of his you'l love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoy a game that makes you think.  This one does just that.  You're offered different roads to choose from, there are plenty of hidden objects and you have to figure out how to use the items in your inventory to move forward.  The graphics are good and the story line is intriguing.  I recommend this game if you're looking for more than just screen after screen of hidden objects.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I'm such a fan.  The opening music alone is a great experience.  What can I say about it that hasn't already been said.  I want to LIVE there, whether upstairs or downstairs.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is nice to have a calculator on my Kindle Fire.  I use it a lot on the job site.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was interested in this book because there is a statue of Tesla on the American side of Niagara Falls. I was aware that he had something to do with harnessing the power of the falls to help with providing energy to the surrounding area. What surprised me was that this book was a lesson in perseverance - to continue to strive to achieve your goals...to use your imagination, your creativity, and your knowledge. Not only was this a wonderful biography,  but it is an appropriate message to students as they enter college - to reach for the moon, because if they miss,  they still will land among the stars.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|This was exciting from the opening paragraph. Strong characters, well developed plot and excellent build up. Highly recommended reading to all.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|The best movie I have seen in quite some time. My wife selected it for viewing. Did not get up to get snacks as it really held our attention.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I was captivated by this story.  The author reveals the journey to become authentic as both an African in Africa and and African in the United States.<br />The characters were fully developed and allowed you to care about them and their struggles.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books I've read all year. There was a great deal of incorporating 80's pop culture and nerd culture in the book. Definitely recommended for all readers!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is enjoyable for kids and adults. It is also very colorful. I like that you can build without purchasing more stuff.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was truly fascinated by the story.  Loved the 2nd book in the series also.  It was well researched, but also had a great story line. Great historical fiction.
B00AKS656U|2.0|The game starts off easy enough, then it gets faster, and it's hard to move fast enough to complete the level. I'd recommend it to people with fast reflexes who have no issues with playing games on a tablet. The animated intro is cool, and you can earn wallpapers for your tablet, but not much else here. The levels are repetitive too, with the same furniture objects repeating at faster intervals, and the same music playing through each level, making you turn the sound off after a while. Props to anyone who actually beat this game. The online games at the garfield.com site are easier, especially for younger players.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not his best but good reading. A little too many unconnected separate stories. Had to almost write named of characters and their families to remember correctly.
B006LRUVUA|1.0|Couldn't really get it work well on a Kindle Fire HD. Not very functional. Plus I heard it was unsafe, too. What's the point of being able to access files if hackers could possibly access them too?
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|J. Hough is great in this.  Looks like her acting career is going to be a wonderful as her dancing
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was amazing! It was so hard to stop reading....I had to know what was next.... it's sad but true to see how bad the gang life can be and how rich people aren't always happy.... the love story between the two was perfect... this is one of the best books I've read in a while!!! Definitely recommend!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I lived every moment if these journeys. His descriptions of characters, cultures, traditions and sceneries immersed me totally. I hope he writes more books.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|This is a good movie, but I think I need more patient to watch the plot, slowly, but happy ending.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Great laughs. The guys' group stuff is the best. The meltdown at the pregnancy seminar is hilarious, too. Watch it now!
B001DM1VXE|4.0|The black and white photography, the angle of the camera shots all added to haunting characteristics of the actors and overall feel of the movie.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great show! I'm totally addicted to this show now! Currently on season 2 and will definitely be watching the rest. It only gets better!
B005MLP8E0|5.0|Still is and will always be a classic at it's best.  Timeless masterpiece.  I grasp different message every time I see it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! you can build many different things out of colorf blocks! I recomend this highly for children ages three to fifteen.
0374214913|2.0|Silly plot. Boring. And terrible ending. With so many good books out there, pass on this one. Waste of time.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|In this unusual book Cain brings together autobiography, behavioural psychology and case studies to document the development of the `extrovert ideal' commencing with the beginning of the twentieth century. She sensitively explores the ways that this new ideal of character and behavior came to be exalted over prior models. From this solid foundation she proceeds to explain without judgment, the struggles that introverts often face at home and work and suggests thoughtful strategies for the introverted to achieve their potential and demonstrate their unique strengths.<br /><br />This book will be of interest to professionals, managers, parents and couples. It is rare find.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am a huge fan after buying this movie. I always saw it as a recommendation so I decided to go out on a leg and buy it. Wonderful!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|We loved this so much very funny.<br /><br />Loved Barbara in this It so reminded of myself and how I have been with my Own Family  LOL
B008Y6RYDS|4.0|I rewatched this movie again it seems like every 10 years and it does not disappoint. Good character development and interesting turns as you see these men just want to make it to the big party. Jacck Nicholson as the drunk Southern attorney is one of my favorites of his characters. He brings them to life.<br /><br />Some depiction of standard 60s drug uand alcohol use with brief nudity and violence. Would be rated PG-13 today.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Was not sure what was going on  confusing. Not a Tom Hanks  movie to me<br /><br />I would not recommend it,
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Needs to allow saves of more than 1 game so that different users can enjoy it. Without the ability to save more than 1 game my daughter can't earn high scores and accomplishments. That aside, this is a brilliant game that would otherwise deserve a perfect score.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really love this book because it is nice, unrealistic, and naive book that I can always go back to for ENTRTAINING!!!! Thanks, E.L.James.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Excellent season.  The writing was fantastic.  The season end was a thrill.  I was happy with part of it and sad at other partsl.  All in all a great show.
B006Y9DY8Q|4.0|Animation fans will love this movie. The inking and coloring styles are very unique and work together to create a dynamic visual feast that will melt your rods and cones with delight. The plot is action driven, this is not Akira or Ghost in the Shell here, just a bunch of guys and comely gals racing. Again this just pure visual fun and entertainment so be advised and enjoy the ride.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much that I finished the Paris week 1 challenge 2 days before but I have a problem the app won't let me connect my face book agent so I can't play against ppl.any suggestions?
B00114RKT8|5.0|I teach both European and U. S. History, and use this film in class as part of a modular on ending the slave trade. Every time I show this film I have a room full of students (and this is college), both crying and cheering. Now, that is what I call a great film.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Fun game make sure you pick wisely when you start the game.<br />If you like casting spells and using up grades to win it help.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Our whole family sits down and watches this exciting show. It's like a theatre experience every week. And it doesn't hurt that Oliver Queen is fun to look at :)
B00BWRKVVS|2.0|As others have said the second movie is really bad. My main complaint however is with the surround sound on the main movie. The Emperor's voice has been given resonance to differentiate it I suppose and it is really troublesome. I found the sound very distorted when he was speaking. It is all to do with the surround sound as changing to stereo solved the problem immediately. The DVDs do not exhibit the problem to the same extent and it is only the first movie that is affected. The video is excellent, and the Blu-ray picture is noticeably better than the DVDs. Unlike some other reviewers I am not a great fan of these films. Disney in the Andes is too patronising to the Inca people, (compare the attention given to the Africans in Lion King and the Chinese in Mulan), and the Emperor must surely be the smarmiest nastiest piece of work Disney has ever foisted on their customers! My previous DVD disc gives me better overall satisfaction and I do not have to even think about the second film. Kronk is not only half-witted he may suffer from other socially dubious failings as well!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I feel like I know myself better and can take comfort that I'm not as different from the rest of the world as I thought I was.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie had some really funny parts. But towards the end it felt awkward sometimes...like hearing your parents fight when you were a kid.
1400067936|4.0|Fooled by Randomness - The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, has been written by the author of The Black Swan, Nassim Nicolas Taleb. In your library, it will stands close to Dance with Chance. In the same idea, the role of randomness in everyday life (with a focus in finance) is shown. Taleb's concept of \\"fooled by randomness\\" is similar to the \\"illusion of control\\" of Dance with Chance (or the opposite).<br /><br />Taleb warns reader against people or situations that may seem impressive, but are due to luck (randomness). This concept is well summarized by the following quote: \\"Mild success can be explainable by skills and labor. Wild success is attributable to variance.\\" To demonstrate his ideas, Taleb uses the concept of \\"black swans\\" (rare events) and shows that we can't predict them. One problem is that detecting risks and avoiding them is mediated by the emotional part of the brain, not the rational part (the one which could understand probabilities).<br /><br />In his book, Taleb has a lot to say about journalists and traders (he is an option trader) for example, and how they are fooled by randomness (but he admits to be himself fooled by randomness: \\"I am just like every single character whom I ridiculed in this book.\\"). By the way, here is a good quote for traders: \\"There is no point searching for patterns that are available to everyone with a brokerage account; once detected, they would be self-canceling\\". He also explains that we are not independence-friendly: \\"When viewing two events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B causes A, or both cause each other\\".<br /><br />To conclude, Fooled by Randomness is an excellent reading full of examples where randomness is a trap. Any decision maker and anybody involved with probabilities should read this book.
193700788X|1.0|I can not think of a more undeniably precise way to sum up the entirety of the Charlaine Harris Southern Vampire Mysteries / Sookie Stackhouse experience than with those famous words.<br /><br />This should be on the Top 10 Worst Books EVER Written list. I can not fathom how an editor or publisher allowed this to go forth and curious of they still have jobs. For the record, I did not spend a dime on DEA, choosing the library option, but I did finally read the...book...in order to review.<br /><br />13 books to turn Sookie into a bed hopping version of Arlene, complete with suitor living in a trailer and born again righteous bigoted attitude.<br /><br />I knew I should have stopped reading when Harris decided to make the &#34;Divorce&#34; more important by requiring it be done publicly! When the actual marriage was supposedly such an important act it could keep a King from ordering his minion to hand over an asset! A 'marriage' which could be done in private with only one witness.....but the 'divorce' - with a human no less - was required to be made public? The same supposed marriage which wasn't deemed important enough to overcome the &#34;forced marriage contract&#34; because it was deemed unimportant since Sookie was human?  Oh yes, that makes sense. Even my description of this plot sounds like tail-chasing! I'm not going to bother bringing up any other scenes/plot since other reviews have done a fantastic job of pointing out the sheer absurdity and head-scratching inane bizarreness.<br /><br />Nothing...N.O.T.H.I.N.G in this installment made sense and that it was the final of the series is proof of Harris lack of talent-IMHO.  She clung like a howler monkey to a pre-ordained ending dreamed up sometime around the second book (when it probably made sense) and did nothing to work her way toward said ending, choosing instead to grab the $$ and hoodwink everyone. Once again IMO, when an author isn't smart enough or talented enough to change direction, grow or let go of ideas which no longer fit the direction her characters have gone, said writer goes down as a swindler instead of an author. Had she been less greedy or more talented to work toward her original ending its doubtful her fans would've reacted as they have, myself included. I was ready to accept almost anything - as long as it made sense - but her desire to annihilate Eric for whatever reason only sacrificed Sookie character and turned her in to little more than a judgmental bed hopping whore with an obvious case of  &#34;if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with&#34;. After it ends with Sam - and it will end - will Alcide finally get his turn riding since he's the only interst who didn't get his shot? Gotta say I would think &#34;furry wolf sex&#34; might one-up &#34;seal sex&#34;.<br /><br />Slippery Seal Sex. *shudders, stomach turns and skin crawls*<br /><br />Oh Ms. Harris....Really?<br /><br />Fool me once.....f ideas which no longer fit the direction her characters have gone, said writer goes down as a swindler instead of an author.

B000002HEP|4.0|A hard rocking album!  Not what I was expecting since Joshua homme is a part of it, he doesn't do any vocals  which I hadn't realized. More of a hard rock sound. Fun to listen to during a long drive.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|It was an awesome sci-fi movie. Great graphics. The storyline is well written.  The acting is well done. I highly recommend  this movie to all sci-fi movie lovers.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|If your a fan of the band get this album. If I had a tail and I appear missing are stellar cuts but the cd will not disappoint
0525478817|5.0|I haven't cried for words in a really long time. This book makes me cry for almost five minutes. I read the last two pages twice, and nothing to do just cry.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|If you are not a Darius fan, this CD will make you one! You will enjoy this disc even if you are only a casual country music listener.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse has been fantastic, I swapped from logitech wireless mouse to this and I wouldn't go back!  It isn't expensive and it feels durable, I had to use all the included weights for it to feel good in my hand though, I have large hands though.  I would definitely buy Anker products again! The customization of the buttons is fantastic, I absolutely love it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Great book. Read it in 2 days. Can't wait to read Inferno. Hope he keeps writing more books Dan Brown rocks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|In this game I found myself useing math and really looking at a situation from every angle. I loved it it was easy to get lost in the game it's a great distraction and very entertaining. Can't wait for more rooms :).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to pass time.  Was difficult at times but that is what made is fun.  Almost addictive at times.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The story is OK but no more than this, one more of the thriller´s we can espect, nothing extraordinary, but a good entertainment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Never thought all this tablet stuff would help me get closer to God and our Lord Jesus.... but then I came across this app. I highly recommend this to anyone working on getting more into the Word. I really feel blessed to have access to it. Load this app. You will be encouraged and will grow in wisdom.
B001O4XWJM|5.0|i really liked this movie it was great it was the best western movie I have seen in A long time
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I don't play piano, but I thought this was a fun game and could be useful for a child who IS learning to play piano.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My granddaughter really enjoys this game it teaches her responsability I love playing this as well very relaxing real fun for small kids
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Great movie-seeing how people age and what they carry with them from the past.  Had humor and sadness when you realize your life is not what it used to be.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|I thought I could pick my own song on it but it's a whole bunch of junk from when my mom was a kid and if they had rap or pop stations or songs everyone would get it if u like old songs I recommend but if u listen to kiss 105don't get it
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I was reluctant at first because of the preview. But I had heard good things about it so I decided to give it a try<br /> I was not disappointed it was solo cute I highly reccomened it!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Enjoyable but needs a &quot;how-to-guide&quot;, other than it is ok. Hard to get the really go units and buildings without difficult to get items.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|While it would have been nice to have this on Blu-Ray, this is the most complete edition of this series. My husband and I watched it in entirety a few years ago, and were happy to have done the research to find the complete version without edits.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|My daughter has taken over my tablet to play minecraft so this app was a must get for her and her sisters.<br />They love it because they can switch out any item if they are having trouble finding or making it themselves.  I just think they are enjoying getting everything wit a few button clicks.<br />The only down side I see is I've lost my tablet to the kids for a longer period of time.<br /><br />Good app.<br />Great price.<br />Extremely useful if you like the easy way for minecraft.
B000002MTU|4.0|I do like this album, and I hate to admit it, but unfortunately I have to agree with one of the Amazon reviewers who said he seems to be just kicking out some of the songs w/o actually feeling them, which is so unECish and disappointing.  I really prefer his live stuff-he is much better on youtube than some of his recorded songs (just my opinion-sorry). Some songs on this album are better than others but it is a nice collection of the blues by the only guy I really like to hear sing them! (It is a sad disease w/o a cure, I know).
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Sure, &#34;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&#34; will be remembered as Disney's first feature, but this feature is his finest, and the &#34;Big Top Edition&#34; is the one to have as the film has been digitally restored.<br /><br />Because the package artwork is present-day, and not directly from the film, prospective purchasers might be confused that this edition is yet another Disney retelling of an earlier masterpiece.<br /><br />But, this edition is the real deal.<br /><br />Kudos to Disney's restorers for including the original &#34;RKO&#34; opening title card, and not replacing it with the late 1950's &#34;Buena Vista&#34; title card, sadly still present on some of Disney's reissues.
B00992CF6W|5.0|First the game is awesome i like it but mojang needs to add more stuff like blow tnt in creative and bigger maps and enderman and please add herobrine i like challenges to the survival that would be EPIC!!!!
1439152802|5.0|Really enjoyed the plot.  Many surprises!  You will never guess the ending or many of the things that happen in the story.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|UP is one of my favorite movies.  It has a good story, and very cute characters!  I just bought a DVD too.  I'm going to share it with my friends.  Love the background music, especially the flutes.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I consider easy sudoku one where I can fill in all the numbers without any pencilling in because there are no more clues. Very easy should give you even more numbers so you can have a quick, mindless game. In this game the Very Easy is Medium difficulty to me. I like my Sudoku to be somewhat easy and I like to try to figure it out in my head.  But when it's too hard all it becomes is a trial and error puzzle with a lot of erasing. Maybe others like that but it is frustrating and not fun to me.<br /><br />I will try this a bit longer but it's already looking like it's going to get a delete from me.<br /><br />I gave it a 3 because I like the color, but -2 because of the difficulty.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this! Definitely adult in content and theme. However, the incorporation of the supernatural and the historical is phenomenally done. I could watch a whole season in one sitting.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I discovered National very late in life. I have followed their music barely 1.5 years ago and consider myself a loyal fan. I was apprehensive about their new album as there was more hype about the band in the media before its arrival. Having listened to the album since its release and reviewed the lyrics in detail to make sure I wasn't just being 'a fan', I can honestly say they're keeping it real and honest.<br /><br />Whether you have never heard the band, or you have, Trouble Will Find Me continues their journey with ironic, deep, realistic sense of purpose. Highly recommended for people who no longer find anything powerful on the FM stations.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I Was so excited for this book to come and when it finally did I couldn't stop reading it.. But only to discover that it could have been way much better. It was good but not as good as the other two books.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Oh my! This COULD have been a good movie. This could have been a great movie. The violence was way too graphic. I guess it had to be that way to sell. Think I'd have rather seen the writers have a bit more imagination. What a shame. Great classic story, Awesome potential in the premise. Poor execution. Wish I had both my money and my time back.
0425263924|5.0|I can't say enough about this series!! This book takes you one step further into Gideon and Eve's troubled life and how they are over coming their demons together!!  Can't wait for the next book!!
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|After you have started a note, if you inadvertantly make a mark on the text either by touching the text with a stylus or if your fingers happen to touch the screen, then the program crashes and you cant recover the note you were working on. use on my Kindle Fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its so funny and no bugs or freezing my 2 year old loves this movie love
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I like trying to figure out how to control items in flight.  It took a while but I was aqble to do this regulary.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing book, a little hard to read since there's so much going on during the dialouge - kept having to go back and remind myself what they were even talking about. Can't wait for the movie series to come out :)
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Nice game to play with to pass some time and learn to control the Galaxy for motion.  My grandson likes it also.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I watched this with my kids and it stands up to the test of time. Not overly cute, but fun and scary!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|so much fun. my grandchildren love it!<br />would recommend for young children.<br />easy for kids and grandparents to understand. keeps their attention.
B008R6MI8G|4.0|My relatives came from Scotland and Ireland, so I enjoy reading the history of those countries. The movie, &#34;Michael Collins&#34;, helps me to understand more of the history of the Irish rebellion for independence from Great Britain. Liam Neeson is always interesting to watch. He brings his characters to life. This movie helps paint a believable picture of the rebellion, and then the Irish civil war that followed, as they turned on their own countrymen.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has done so much for me. I absolutely love it without a doubt. Charlie's character is so touching and yet so relatively creative. Everything Charlie faces in his freshman high school year is just unbearably saddening. This book and the movie had me in tears crying. Not enough words will ever be able to explain how much I love this book. I really wish there was a sequel to it; it is a old story renewed to many people's attention highly recommend this book to anyone who just wants to read a heart touching story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is wonderful. The characters are believable and I got a glimpse into life before war and after war.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love the castle series and having the extras on the dvds makes it even more fun to watch.  Great add on to your collection.
1781162646|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King's work for over 30 years, so it's safe to say I know what to expect from a certain title. Not so from this little gem. I knew it would be different being printed as a paperback from Hard Case Crime publishers. One of two things could happen, either King was throwing out a fast one to meet a quota, or something new and fresh was being offered to us old pros as well as new converts. Joyland is one of those books that you honestly can't pigeonhole into one description. It is on one hand a heartwarming (and breaking) tale of a young man who's \\"love of his life\\" has dumped him, and of course he has nothing to live for. Who hasn't been there before? He decides to move to North Carolina for the summer to work for a local amusement park, part small-time carnival and part permanent fixture in this little town. He soon fits in with the locals and the carnies as well, even making friends with a couple for life. Under other circumstances he could see himself with the girl, but is too much of the good guy to do so. There is also a supposed ghost of a murdered girl in the haunted house ride for those expecting the supernatural. Who was the man who killed her under everyone's nose and walked out? He also befriends a young boy with cerebral palsy and his cold mother who fears for hers son's life and overprotects him, while deep down inside she is tired of taking care of him. She also resents living off of her father, a tv evangelist who has become rich off of other's trust in him. All of these characters and more come together in the end in a masterful turn of events by King which I never would have seen coming. Even if you don't like King and his brand of literature, you will like Joyland just on it's own. It is a true coming of age story that all of us who is a certain age can relate to. Readers of all ages welcome. Don't miss this one.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|If you loved the first season of castle you will love the second one as well.  I highly recommend it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|way so much fun! a nice time waster ..kids or adults will like playing nemo!  who doesn't like nemo!,?  awesome colors and graphics!! :) :)
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The Journey was good and it was good to see where it all started. The cinematography was excellent, A real adventure!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is interesting to see the development that will bring an end to aristocracy.  I felt sorry for these parasites of society.
1781162646|3.0|Stephen King's style is unmistakable, but the genre of the dime novel mystery might not be his strong suit. A likeable protagonist, but not much in the way of mysterious, and little to no spooky stuff. A quick read - but buy it on sale.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|What a sweet movie! Great vehicle for anna and rebel both. I look forward to seeing them both in more movies.
B000W9399S|4.0|This book feels a bit like &#34;Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; in its humor and style, with its asides, brief explanatory tangents, its disrespect to just about anything, and general lack of overall &#34;main&#34; plot (ie, more a series of silly unrelated stories that reuse the same characters). In fact, Rincewind is a bit like Arthur, the likeable unlikely adventurer. Overall, I liked it and will probably continue the series.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the style, at times, is so abrupt, it's occasionally difficult to know what's going on (eg. Rincewind and Twoflower suddenly are on a modern airplane the sentence after falling off a dragon). Not a big deal, but can jar your engagement to the story.
B0064MGU98|3.0|I know this show was a hit originally but it is just not interesting to me. I like the actors, just not the story.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse to replace a wireless mouse most because I needed a more precise mouse for some of my graphics programs and some games.  This mouse has been great.  It works as good or better than any mouse I have ever had the pleasure of using.  Even without any customizing it was fantastic.  I admit I ran into this mouse while searching Amazon and had planned on buying one like the one I use on my other PC which cost me over $70.  This mouse has been every bit as good at $40.  The precision is just so nice on this thing.<br /><br />This mouse also has a nice design.  It just feel well in my hand.<br /><br />The left and right buttons feel good.<br /><br />The scroll wheel feels nice.<br /><br />There is plenty of customization that can be done with this mouse.<br /><br />This mouse comes with some small weights you can put in.  I just put them all in and it felt fine.  You could use it without any for a lighter feel or add as you wish.  Seems like a nice option but I really do not pay much attention to this.  I do not however favor really light mice.<br /><br />For me, the mouse fits perfectly in my hand.  So, it feel lucky there.  Not every mouse fits everyone the same.  I may have to purchase another one of these as a backup.  I like the design.  The only thing I miss from the plan wireless mouse was the fact it was easy for me to change hands with it and it felt the same.  Most of these mice I use are mostly made for right hands.  Not an issue I just find myself sometimes switching hands and it feels weird so I switch back.  Definitely a right handed mouse.<br /><br />I would recommend this mouse to anyone.  It makes a great general use mouse and has options that can make it very useful for many other programs.  Just have to download the software, set things how you want it and go from there.  I used this things without doing anything other than hooking it up and it was great so if you do not like messing around with settings and such you will still be fine.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I thought this actress did a great job. I didn't think anyone could do as well as Gwyneth Paltrow but this actress held her own quite well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You must see because u will love this sitcom. Check it out !!!! I really enjoy Amazon prime just wish I could play the videos without flash player
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun. had a few easy levels but other than that pretty challenging. only wish there were more levels.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I love the story and the characters but they did not come to life or meet my expectations as well as they could have.  This may be unfair... after all three of the movies are out I am sure I'll think better of them all... reading the books first hurt my impression of the translation!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought it was interesting to read about orphan trains. I never new they took children from the east and sent them west to work on farms and factories. Then theirs the story of the teenager who has to do community service for stealing a book at the library by helping out an old woman who was once an orphan train casualty. The story sort of ended abruptly but I still liked reading about how things turn out in the end.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I wanted to give this movie a shot but couldn't even finish it....I love the actors but almost felt sorry for them that they were in this movie.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|It is going to end horribly, I think.<br />I hope Deb comes thru it alright, but I have a bad feeling she's going down too!<br /><br />I can't wait to see what happens!!
0425263924|3.0|It was ok I thought Ava would know by now how much she means to gideon.<br />She was killing me how she would keep questions her thoughts and just leap
B004EF65QA|5.0|Excellent acting and wonderful scenes.  Some of my favorite actors come together to bring the story alive. I will watch this again some day.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|Awful camera, questionable controls, and quite a bit short. But at the end of the day, it's a really fun game, and that's all that really matters for a videogame to be justified.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Simple Best Queensryche album in 20 years where every song on it is good. Very much tastes like the Old Queensryche we very much love
B00CWVM1AC|5.0|Wasn't a fan of part one, but this movie did the trick. The actors were brilliant and quite handsome, I may add. Love every moment of it!!!
B0036K3OFY|5.0|If you like action packed martial arts movies you will like this. It was interesting from start to finish. Would definitely recommend.
B000JMKOI2|4.0|Charles Bukowski' s writing style makes me feel like he's right here talking to me, personally telling me his story. He has such a simple unaffected style of writing that's fast and easy to read. The simplicity and personal tone of  his writings are an effective vehicle for conveying the harsher realities of his life and stories. It's easy to get hooked, but also hard not to come away with a sense of sadness for the suffering of his childhood and how that molded the rest of his life.
B005544V6A|5.0|Finally a tv show with noble characters that is funny and engaging. There are too many shows with all drama and no wisdom, which gets to be so boring! I love the two main characters because they always go for the lofty choice, and are never victimized by their choices. 5 stars plus!!!
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Movie was ok. I would not watch it again. The actor is one of my favorite though. I give it only one thumb up.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|There is a lot in this series that is very engaging. But after a while, with brutality and decadence repeatedly triumphing over the moral code, it gets rather depressing.
B00847UYWA|5.0|I heard the first chapter of this book on the Classic Tales Podcast and loved it. This book was an influence on Lovecraft and the C'thulhu mythos.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|As we watched \\"Now you see me\\" I realized my adult sons had never seen \\"The Sting.\\" I'm happy they now have - good stuff.
0061438294|5.0|It's a fun little read. Sometimes you can't help think... I did that yesterday.<br />You can find this one on Amazon here: What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People<br /><br />About the Authors:<br /><br />Joe Navarro worked as an FBI special agent in the area of counter-intelligence and behavioural assessment for 25 years. I actually recognized him from watching Poker videos where he teaches you about poker reading as well! You can find his website here:  [...]<br />Marvin Karlins is a Professor of Management at the University of South Florida. He has a Ph.D. in Psychology from Princeton University - his profile can be found here:  [...]<br />Self-Improvement Type: Understanding people.<br /><br />The Book:<br />The book goes through a few parts:<br />1. A little history and advice on overall body language (such as understanding context - for example: someone may appear nervous in front of you, but they may have just came from an accident - so context is important).<br />2. An understanding of where body language originates (Your brain!) - sort of a `preparation' to understanding what he discusses later.<br />3. Body language by body part (from feet to the face!)<br />4. Lie detection through body language.<br />The book is well constructed and well written. To give you a little taste without spoiling the book - some little facts for you, with some little interesting facts.<br />- Tucking your feet under your chair: May indicate stress<br />- Feet are the best indicators of body language<br />- Half shoulder shrugs often indicate someone giving you less attention.<br />- We actually look away from people we are comfortable with as well - it doesn't mean we are rude looking into the distance as our friend is talking (although it may be perceived as rude)<br /><br />To be critical - some of the body language is obvious. However, I felt that the additional information and interesting little examples from Joe's history made the read interesting.<br /><br />What to expect:<br />1. A book about body language - basics and a little more<br />2. Interesting little stories about body language from an FBI agent.<br />3. A book that will make you reconsider, think and over think about what that person did yesterday and why.<br />It's not an encyclopaedia - It is definitely a great initial read, but not a comprehensive guide to body language - so I would rate it as a beginner. I would say if you are starting - read this book - but if you know  enough then I would suggest you dive into the specialities you want to know more about (such as poker & lie detection for example).<br /><br />Summary:<br />It's an awesome book. I would give this book a 4.5/5. A great little starter to understanding body language and makes you wonder a few times when you talk to someone else. It might also make you wonder what your own body is saying when you are talking too!<br /><br />As Joe says, everyone is unique and context is important. You can know what the signs mean - but no person is the same. I also have developed a new hobby, PEOPLE WATCHING!eresting.<br /><br />What to expect:<br />1.

B0092S4WLY|5.0|Awesome and addicting! If you like to solve puzzles you will love this! Cheats app also available for this game too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun for me and my son to play together in the evening and when we are winding down for the evening
B0091LS07E|5.0|This music really improves my mood! Alicia is right on target on the vocals, and The title song makes me feel like I'm the one on fire! I think everyone will relate to most of her songs on this CD, especially &#34;Brand New Me&#34;.  &#34;Not Even A King,&#34;  melts my heart.  I can't say enough for this album, all you AK lovers will love this!
B007AL48UK|4.0|It just is taking me a while to get one of them done.  But with practice I'll get there.  I really like it though.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I practically worship this movie because of the closure it gives. It didn't have time to wrap every little detail up, but it got what it had to right.<br /><br />The first copy I got skipped and froze, but Amazon got me a replacement right away.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|We were bored so I decided to go ahead and get it even though I'd passed it over before because of the reviews.  So I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game how could u not love it you will fall in love with it in a instent u guys you will love plus. U go around the world in it
B000SMWUPS|3.0|We've had our Sunshine Kids stroller buggy buddy on our BOB for two years now and it's exactly what we needed - inexpensive but functional. The two cup holders are great for my son's sippy cups as well as my drinks and I don't feel bad if my coffee sloshes around. Wipes right up and is good as new.  When I fold the BOB up, the console sometimes gets squished but it pops right out again when I unfold the stroller.<br /><br />In fact, I just signed into Amazon to buy two more of these consoles for our new Bumbleride Indie Twin but unfortunately have discovered that this item is TWICE as expensive as it was when I bought it two years ago. Really?? That's why I took off two stars. I really like this console but not for this price. I'm going to keep shopping around.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is fun, kept me busy for an hour, but very predictable. Would continue to play with more levels and more difficulty
0316044695|5.0|I loved this book.  It started out slow because he spent a while talking about his experiences in boot camp.  I struggled getting through that part but after that I couldnt stop reading.  This book will be one of my all time favorites.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I could not pit this book down.  It was beautifully written and emotionally charged.  I cried myself to sleep the night I finished it.  I am looking forward to reading more of this authors books.  Definitely worth reading.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The show is losing its edge- with all the breaks and the<br />episodes are all becoming the same thing- same issues<br />they need to liven it up- its just getting old and stagnant...<br /><br />gone are the days of MASH- where it was produced in a timely manner and it never got old
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Great game love play it. Lot of color. Going to all city<br />s enjoy enjoy being chase by dog and police. The pride are nice.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The app itself looks very well done on my kindle fire but when ever i choose a video it stays in the loading screen for a good time and the video doesn't show
B005K17RU0|2.0|This newer version is nowhere as good and user-friendly as the old one. If there is no decent update soon, I am going to delete it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|is one of the best games ive played in a really long time timeit is a really good,great,and fun game for kids i recommend it.definitely
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Anyone can play this game from about age ten and up. It requires thinking in sequence and helps to develop children's spacial thinking.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|this was delightful yet kept the original feeling of the movie,  well done by all ...puts you in a good mood
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you are willing to work hard and have enough patience to persevere, you don't have to spend money AT ALL to get to the top. If you have a few dollars to spend, you will have an absolute blast. I love this game!!!
0142410322|3.0|The good: There are a few iconic lines and exchanges that were lifted from this book. Also it appears that Wonka and the notes and missing bits may have had an influence on Rowling and her magical candy stores.<br /><br />This is less cohesive than the Chocolate Factory. It seemed to be a couple idea nuggets that could make a whole book. Wonka comes across even more strongly as a sociopath.<br /><br />Unless you're 10, read the Chocolate Factory and stop.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this game is cute and fun. I mean if people really want rarity, fluttershy, or rainbow dash without paying real money than they will get it if they save. I got fluttershy without paying actual money so you see! Anyway I think this game is really great for my little pony fans everywhere. People really just don't listen to the ratings under four stars cuz this game ain't worth any less. I hope u love this game as much as I do once u get it! =)
0142410314|4.0|I'm correcting some gaps from my reading list, and I decided to burn through some quick items by Roald Dahl. My experience with this book is strongly colored by the movie (the one with Gene Wilder) which was a phenomenal adaptation. I was surprised by the number of lines directly lifted from the book, although the movie often added little touches to make the mood creepier. I spent most of the time comparing the two, and while I agree with all of the changes made for the different medium, I think the movie may be the superior product. All of the characters in the film are given greater depth, making their falls more spectacular. The redemption and forgiveness of Charlie Bucket in the film is superior to the meek lucky winner of the book.
0762777931|5.0|She is one of the many experts in the movie Hungry For change and I enjoy this book she wrote easy to understand and I also like how it seems like she is just sitting at a table next to you having a conversation. Her personalty really shines in this book and I have laughed out loud at some of her blunt but so true teaches. Very enjoyable read.
014241011X|2.0|This story seemed to be less about wonder and more about how the author could play meta-jokes on children. There were bright spots to it, but it's not close to the first thing I would recommend to get a child interested in this author.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This movie keeps you on your toes and the inventive ways that Harrison Ford avoids capture will keep you watching.
B000255LIY|4.0|I thought Glen and Patrick were great together, probably because they are great actors. I think I've watched three times!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's amazing!!! Extremely fun and challenging!! T by is one of our family games. This game is downloaded on every device in my house.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I liked to see the time before Robin was an outlaw. King John was a nasty, evil person jealous of Robin. Never knew John turned Robin into an outlaw. Great twist on an old story.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I drove many miles to see this movie, while I was troubled by how the movie will turn out. Right at the start of the movie it works its way through the show we (Bronies) love and ends perfectly. Seem like there was a hint for season three, and I cannot speak for the Bronies but to me... this movie is worth getting since I still carry that great feeling of watching as if it was the show.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The show seems somewhat derivative of the x files, yet not enough to stop watching it. The subplot is introduced early on and almost every episode ties to it.
1451695195|1.0|I have read several books on NDE and by far this is the most boring & tedious book ever. Author description of hell is a realm of \\"earthworm's eye view\\" and heaven \\"the core\\". Vague is only the begining... Because he is a Doctor, I was expecting him to \\"elaborate\\" a little more...Maybe I was expecting too much of someone with a Doctoral degree.  5% of the book was about his nde and it was very repetitive...So I am being very generous when I say 5%.  The medical data he put on the book was way more interesting to read than his nde. I did not care for his style of writing about the things that everyone was doing while he was in \\"coma\\".  Also did not care for all the irrelevant chapters on skydiving, father's education, biological father's education and on and on.  His nde could be written in 2 pages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was in to this book just by reading the first chapter..so much happens in this book it is crazy..! It keeps you guessing just when you think you know what is going on it flips..can't wait for losing hope..! It's already pre ordered..!!
B004UID2LC|2.0|It used to work fine til the new update now I can play almost none of my videos change it and you'll get 5 starts
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It would help if the game gave some hints on some of the first levels so you could get the hang of it. Other then that a lot of fun but need more then 10 levels so we can keep playing the game or change it up so we can go back in and replay with different options.
0375869026|4.0|i realy like this woderful book Wonder. To me it is not too, too sad.(ok I admite just a little)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is such a great sequel to the hunger games! There surprise and suspense at every turn! I recommend this to anyone who loved the hunger games. SPOILER ALERT: Katniss and Peeta go back into the Games......
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|A simple game. Controls take just a second to learn. There is some difficulty to learn how to brake and steer properly. But that's part of the game. Collecting coins for cars, power ups, and characters adds to the fun. It feels like a cross between Jetpack Joyride and their airboat game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very good like temple run but better you collect coins and dodge obstacles and shoot down enemy's and get new armor
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! If there is one thing I love about Suzanne Collins writing its her subtle but incomprehensible ability to foreshadow. Excited for the movie and more excited to read book 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game.but I think it should update quicker. Some things that should be added is The Nether,make the zombie pigmen`s skim like the pc version. And add more spawn eggs in creative mode.
B0088O11NU|2.0|Places  adware with the game and irritates me after a while.  Gets very repetitious after a very short period of time.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I loved the original, the sequel simply explains how it all got started. Lots fun to watch and has some good life lessons, too, for the kiddies (not too young, some images of the witches might be frightening to small children). Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Get stuck often and some puzzles extremely challenging to complete. They should offer hints as an option or some players may just quit if not able to move forward due to an unsolved puzzle
B004EBZX6W|5.0|We use this to check our home wireless network from time to time if our connection seems slow, and I used it at my office recently to help troubleshoot an issue as well. At home, we discovered that one of our neighbors' wi-fi was on the same channel as ours, causing some interference. Wi-Fi Analyzer tells you what other channel will work as well, or better. Also shows other wi-fi networks within range.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|doesn't really show me what i want. doesn't seem as accurate as other apps. not easy to navigate through the app.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|OMG!  Did that REALLY happen??  I try not to give an particulars about movie/shows.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  I'm just glad I have all the seasons of Dexter.  Because, next year is the last, and I just can't let him go!<br />The only character I didn't like was Hanna McKay.<br />I don't have ShowTime, so I have to wait for the dvd's to come out.  I'm positive that Dexter is really Harry's biological child. I thought that would have been exposed in the season when Deb was investigating Harry's lovers.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I liked it. It was funny. I think kids would like it more. I still want to see the new one out next week.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Every animal lover will hope that there is truth in this tale. Even without truth or assurances, it's an excellent read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun! It is much better than other games where you try to get<br />through the door! It is very addicting though but totally awesome!
1932100660|4.0|Very informative. Lots of facts about food and nutrition. Was surprised to read about animal proteins and their effect on our bodies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Try not to read this in public if you would be embarrassed to look like a blubbering baby. Honest, emotional, and warm.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I love Fawlty Towers and had all seasons on VHS. Finally ordered the DVD set and just love it! Arrived so fast too! Thanks!
B009ME47H2|4.0|Pretty handy and easy to use. Especially for meetings or setting important memos. And it's free! Playback quality is pretty good; and has pretty good range.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|We discovered it when I picked it out from our local library, and it was well loved and watched for the time we had it checked out.  She loved it so much I decided to see if I could find a copy of it for her on Amazon.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A classic piece on a very triumphant moment in a turbulent time. Owen does an amazing job of capturing  the sacrifices made by his team an  himself to protect our country.
B005VGUA5S|5.0|My son introduced this group to me, and I find myself replaying this album often.  It's energy and variety are outstanding.
B00821OUT6|1.0|I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I really wanted to like this show. However, I'm not into the dystopian survival dramas, so I just couldn't get into Falling Skies. Besides that, the story line doesn't appeal to me at all. A global invasion by reptile-looking things who are out to control children? Really? As Washington Post critic Hank Stuever puts it: \\"There is too much empty bravado, clumsy post-American (earthling) patriotism, and a lot of scruffy dudes and shapely dames all thanking one another, for what they did back there.\\" In other words, boring.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Much to short and all the game really is used for is to push other games for you to play. Other than that it is everything others are saying about it not that bad of a game.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This movie is phenomenal. It grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go for the entire movie. Excellent acting, especially Longshanks, Robert the Bruce, and of course William Wallace. There's a reason it won the Best Picture academy award, a MUST see. I've seen it at least 20x.
B004INHTK4|5.0|An interesting book on child rearing the chinese way in a western world.  Fabulous autobiography but written like a novel, couldn't put it down
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I was able to get videos onto my tablet with this free app. Easy to use and the price was right.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|This is just a solid end of the world story. It has great special effects, an outstanding cast, and the science is even accurate. Leder (the director) got advice from NASA and it shows. Armageddon, although fun to watch, had some implausible elements and wasn't as accurate on the science. I'm no brainiac when it comes to the physics and space science but I'm at least literate on it and I appreciate the effort to maintain scientific accuracy.<br /><br />Disaster movies often have spectacular visuals and special effects but come up short on the script, acting, and plot. But Deep Impact delivers on all accounts. The special effects, especially the final tidal wave sequence, are impressive, but despite that the movie really revolves around the characters and their personal relationships during the last days before the comet strike, and how it affects and even transforms their relationships. This makes Deep Impact more than just another catastrophe flick and more of a personal drama set against the backdrop of an extinction level event.<br /><br />Overall, a fine movie from director Mimi Leder and worth checking out even if you're not a sci-fi fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The child says--I love this game. It's challenging and fun and tricky. Mom says he&nbsp;can do&nbsp;it on his own and still win levels fast enough to stay engaged.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Some preposterous scenes, even for a fantasy film.  I never connected with the main characters.  Jeremy Renner was sleepwalking through the script.  Actually, I'm not sure why I rated it this high.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I had hopes that this movie would be a fun action movie. It had lots of action, but the plot line did not make sense. Certainly not worth a premium rental fee.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Sit back and try to get ready!  Great action.  Plenty of explosions.  Bravo to J D as M. Thank you for keeping the 50 year run going!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|I have seen it multiple times and it remains enjoyable! Paul Newman is cool in this role. Worth purchasing rather than renting.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Just to reiterate what others have already said, these things kick serious butt for the price. The bass is nice. Present but never overpowering. Some slowing down and muddying occasionally occurs with aggressive, faster, bass heavy tracks. I primarily listen to alt rock like Queens of the Stone Age. Their new album &#34;...Like Clockwork&#34; sounds amazing on these cans. Daft Punk also shines on these bad boys. For 32 bucks shipped, they're a steal. They are extremely clampy out of the...ahem....package (cardboard holder thing) but I strapped them over a folded throw pillow for a few days before I left for work and they're much more comfortable now. I've been wearing them for almost an hour right now and they're just fine. Little sweaty but I'm rocking &#34;Lose Yourself To Dance&#34; right now anyway so it's fitting.People have mentioned a set of Beyerdynamic velour covers as a swap for these but they cost almost as much as the cans do in the first place. The design is a straight up ripoff of the AKG 240s but that isn't a bad thing. They're not portable, it's like wearing a neck brace when you put them around your neck. Keep them at home and enjoy.<br /><br />They also come with a storage bag which is nice enough for an extra and a screw on plug adapter. Kinda slick in this price range.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|I bought this movie, as Im a Bab's Streisand fan. Very happy with movie. Sorry I missed it as the cinema. But VERY happy to own it now!
0765334798|3.0|The cover promised me non-stop hilarity.  The novel started out promising enough.  The tone and diction reminded me of Douglas Adams.  The only problem:  that's where the similarities end.  The novel didn't deliver so much as a titter.  I wanted to like this novel.  I really did.  I understand a bit of science, I like metafiction well enough, and I love all things Star Trek (including parodies), so this should have been a slam dunk.  I really dislike bad writing, however. As any number of reviewers have noted, the plot is rushed and poorly constructed and the characters underdeveloped.  The protagonist, Andy Dahl, is supposed to be our touchstone.  We're supposed to care about him.  I never made that emotional connection, however, because Andy (as well as the rest of the intergalactic equivalent of the Scooby Gang) is so two-dimensional.  The only person I care about in the whole novel is Jenkins, a computer hacker who figures out \\"the narrative.\\"
6302787068|5.0|The original Disney Aladdin is one of the best post-Walt productions.  You can almost believe the story line in spite of its highly unlikely plot.  The VHS recording looks good on a upscaling VHS/DVD player, and the price for VHS is hard to beat.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Many memorable lines, intrigue, love, still in original black and white format.  Enjoy film at its best.  Very worth while.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|Nothing of value for my Kindle.  Kindle requires being shut down to charge effectively and this application only works when Kindle is on.
0307593525|5.0|Finally, after forty years of loving Julia, we finally got &#34;the Book.&#34;  We are cooking from it while reading a fantastic biography of Julia Child called &#34;Dearie.&#34; Highly recommend both. The book came in fine condition; excellent seller.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a book that flows surprisingly well considering there are no main characters and it jumps around a bit. This format is different but refreshing, the description of the battles and events events really convey what happened/is going on. I would recommend this book as long as one know they are getting a typical story.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Spaghetti Western & a bit tongue & cheek.  The start is slow and painful at times, but as the movie moves on, there are parts that are fun & funny. The 1 horse town & it's folks are great. It starts a bit obvious and the editing is choppy.  Arnold aside, this movie has great car chases, guns & a some good fights.  There is some character development and the film works to incorporate several innovative themes from other action movies. The 2 things I like in the film are the guns & the hand to hand combat scenes.  The villain is absolutely fabulous, Arnold is good here and the other characters were perfect.  With what is going on in our nation today with 2nd amendment issues & border crossings, this film doesn't take itself seriously.  Not a musts see, but fun.  Also, the \\"R\\" rating is for language.  There is some gruesome violence if only to make the point.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|I took a pass on this film when it was in theaters but recently caught up to it on a drowsy Saturday afternoon.  I wasn't expecting much and certainly from the aspect of seeing something fresh and new I got what I was expecting.  Still I have to admit, I enjoyed Barbra Streisand as a lead actress once again.  And yes she still can be effectively funny.  Here she plays a meddlesome and stereotypical Jewish mother.<br /><br />Living in New Jersey, Joyce is expecting a visit from her only son, Andy (Seth Rogen) who is flying in from California for a business presentation.  Andy, a chemical engineer by trade, has invented a cleaning product that is all organic and has no deadly ingredients.  Unfortunately he gave it a terrible name that is neither pronounceable nor understandable.  Andy can't wait to get away from his loving mom, but when she tells him a sweet story about her first love as a 19 year old, he discovers the man works for a large company in San Francisco.<br /><br />Since Andy has a series of presentations across the country he was going to drive to each.  This whole premise is a borders on ridiculous as it is unlikely that large companies like Costco, K-Mart and a shopping channel are going to listen to this guy who has no track record.  With that out of the way, Joyce insists they save money where they can, since Andy is essentially broke.  So they room together and are bundled up in a Chevy Aero which is just a tad larger than a toaster.<br /><br />Probably the best scenes are in Lubbock, Texas where Joyce takes on the challenge of eating a 4 pound steak with all the trimmings.  It's free if she does it in an hour.  It will cost $100 if she doesn't.  With Las Vegas as the last stop, Andy breaks the news that he had found her former love in San Francisco.  After first refusing (sure), Babs, I mean Joyce says yes.  There is a double surprise at the end which is fitting for the film.  OK, I admit it, I liked the whole trip.
B003O97W5K|5.0|If you want to get the most out of this film, do yourself a favor and get the Blu-Ray version of it (if you have a player.) The quality if the most crisp I have seen of this movie...ever! If you are not familiar with this movie, it is about noisy ghosts that inhabit a suburban home. It's from the mind of Steven Spielberg, and it's one of his better features, if you ask me. The special effects, for the most part, stand the test of time. Some of them look as though they have been cleaned up for the Blu-Ray version. It really helps \\"pull you in\\" to the story. The only thing this is lacking is that I wish it had a director's commentary. Overall, though, I'm very satisfied I added this to my collection.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I notice that is pretty but I try download it said it can't please fix it I try everything it does won't let me please fix it all I got is kindle fire not hd just kindle fire.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece of an album. This is what metalheads should have people listen to when non-metalers say \\"everything is so evil and depressing in metal.\\" These guys weave their spirituality seamlessly into commentaries on the human condition. Calling for peace and helping \\"others while we're still alive\\" while reminding fans not to \\"call me your hero\\" are themes present not only in this album, but also in our lives. The music is equally powerful in conveying this positivity through melodies that are at once light hearted, yet serious and heavy when they need to be. Rescue and Restore is still very much August Burns Red, and it feels more like Constellations with a few moments throwing back to Messengers.<br /><br />A few highlights of this album are the lead guitarist's solos. Metal solos these days are all about speed and technicality, and while there is a place for that, guitarist Steve Morse had a great song called \\"tumenni notes,\\" and sometimes (not always) that's all these speed solos have. Often times a well placed note that creates the right feel, timing, and phrasing is more important than being able to play six-string ascending and descending 16th note sweeps at 250 beats per minute in conjunction to the breakdown in the background.<br /><br />Also of note is the bassist's screaming (correct me if I'm wrong on which member is doing the backing screams). Since Leveler (their previous album) his screams have become more pronounced and add an additional dimension and depth. Both he and the lead vocalist have some of the clearest and more unique screams in the industry.<br /><br />Finally, the drummer has always been inventive, and, at times, unconventional. He has to reflect the music the band writes and his perspective, as well the rest of the band's, is unique. Some of his beats are catchy in and of themselves even without guitars and such accompanying him.<br /><br />Needless to say, this cd will be worn out within a few weeks. This is the band's best release yet, and if they keep putting out music in the future then there will be much to look forward to as they get better and continue to grow and mature their sound.
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|Love this movie :). OF COURSE the first film is way better! But this one is good too. I would not count any of the 3 movies out in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is a great game. I don't play survival only build.I<br /> I have it on  all three of my kindles. And just as I  figured out how to get the mods maps and texture packs on my 2nd gen fires the first gen was way easier.as I was just as ,my wife got me the new nook HD+ now I reviewed it and all and B&N signing google,and claiming that it was a true android tablet I was happy. Until three days ago when I registered<br />My nook .and can get none of my stuff from amazon.cause the nook is not a open android device,its a nook. If it looks like shit smells like shit then chances are ,its most likely shit. Now don't get me wrong its a very nice device. But that being said,I've stil got three years worth of stuffs that I can't get. I.M talking upwards of$ 2500 or more. So if any one can point me in the right direction other than rooting it id really appreciate it. Thanks
B003IY48PS|5.0|This movies just great fun to watch. The recent Evil Dead is also worth a watch if you have not seen it yet! I don't say that about many remake type of movies either.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Im hooked!  Sons of Anarchy has taken over our home.  We love it.  Season two was exciting, grabbed us and pulled us in.  We cant wait to keep watching.
B008M7BQHE|4.0|Don't have much of a 'review', just wanted to say I'm glad I finally had a chance to catch up on S3. I don't like starting a season if I miss some episodes and cannot view them onDemand or whatever. At the time Fox didn't have such a thing available, so I figured I'd get the DVDs someday. Glad Amazon had the season streaming. Finished the entire season in a couple days.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series, can't wait for more seasons. Character development is superb, sometimes a little disappointing as to the direction they decide to take.  Go BBC!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Story is good, but at times hard to follow. Rather violent for teenagers.  Have finished the entire series now, would recommend if you like survivor books
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Found the style of chapters allocated to different characters a bit much at first.  But I quickly came to enjoy pulling the threads together.  Martin leaves you wondering what comes next after each chapter.  The story draws you in, like all great epics, making for a book that is hard to put down.  Great value on Kindle.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|This is a really fun game for preschoolers. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I wish it had more scenarios.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|This series is timeless.  Our whole family loved watching it and talking about it.  I didn't watch it when it was running on tv, but really enjoyed it this time around.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was hard enough to keep you engaged but not so hard that you would want quit. I thought it was a fun way to pass some time.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I loved this version of Phantom and so did my teen girls. Highly recommended. Great music and cinematography. A must see.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I discovered Lark Rise to Candelford by accident. This is a quality show. I enjoy being transported back to the end of the 19th century and becoming a part of the lives of the two communities it depicts. Anyone who loves British shows or history will enjoy laughing and crying with the good folks of Lark Rise and Candleford.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Good series to watch. Good acting and plot storyline. Look forward to season three<br />Set in New York which makes it even better
B003JZCVR8|2.0|For me, the most interesting aspect of the film was that I never  recognized Brosnan until I  checked on the cast. Of course, I have not seen him since a couple of years after the end of Remington Steele;  like the rest of us he has aged, but aged very well both in looks and maturity as an actor.  He and most of the cast (none of whom are familiar to me) did a fine job, very credible in their roles. Naturally, I sympathize with Polanski who lost his wife in a bizarre murder plot in the United States and is still living under the cloud of an untested (in court) rape charge, which some believe is unwarranted (and I know nothing about other than its existence); but why he should get involved with, or perpetuate, this mish-mash of a plot, I have to wonder. By reputation, he should have known how to turn whatever he was given in the book (which I have not read) into a thriller which went beyond the trite and worn scenario he filmed. A shame, too, since he had such a good cast with which to work.<br />At any rate, I certainly commend it to any fan of Brosnan; he handles his subordinate role with excellence. The other lead players are worth watching as well. If you are a virulently anti-American in the UK (the U.S.A or anyplace else) you will probably find this quite enjoyable  for its subject matter if not its quality as a movie. If you just want to go slumming with a mildly entertaining film which is a programmer ( a B film in the days of double features, many a made for TV film today) you might find what you want with this one.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Reading the novel at the same time! It has a great plot line, acting, and sets/costumes are exquisite! A must see!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Awesome read, love how it is written in different chapters for each of the different characters.  The characters are amazing and the descriptive language sets the scene for everything.....clothing, battle scenes, persona.....just loved it!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|...and excellent story of Rodriguez himself on the documentary Searching for Sugarman.  I'd recommend both to others who are interested in rock music of the 70s and in the history of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|U know what this is generally going to be about and contain its pretty good if you like the whole Hannibal saga.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey just has a great way with words. I found my self giggling out loud more than once while reading this book. Loved it!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Good price for a good product.  Our Android and iPhone need recharging daily, and this device helps with that.  We might want one for both cars!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Really enjoyed this season. Special effects are great, good plot. Can't wait to start season two hope it's just as good.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Addictive Series. What happens next?<br />A must see medical series set in Seattle around all,that is good and evil.<br />Watch and find out.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|This isn't a bad shooter. It's not great either. It is really slow paced and cheap when compared to Dead Trigger and Shadowgun. The animations for the  NPC's is choppy and the NPC's are also pretty dumb. It's a good example of graphics over game play though, because this game looks really good, yet plays not so good.
1400069807|2.0|I thought I would learn something from this book, but it had nothing in it that I didn't already know. I was a little disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|its basically just the internet except set up a different way. i dont like it because you need internet connections AND all the videos do is buffer
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is AWESOME. I really like it. It's better<br />Then temple run and subway surfers combined<br />I really like it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is one of my favorite authors and is at the top now!! She has an outstanding use of words in these books.
B00BX8PG5M|4.0|Well-written suspense thriller about a Soviet nuclear sub and its captain's power struggle with a KGB agent on board for control of the sub. Ed Harris does a great job as the captain who suffers from epilepsy and who has flashbacks about a tragedy aboard one of his ships. The suspense builds as the KGB agent (played well by David Duchovny)  gets increasingly more control of the sub and perhaps of the nuclear missile onboard. Great acting by all, good build up of tension and suspense. But, as other reviewers have said, the end is totally out of character with the film's depiction of sweaty realism---it resorted to some sort of fantasy world so that audiences can achieve some vicarious satisfaction through the families of the servicemen. (It reminded me of the ending of Edge of Darkness with Mel Gibson, where we see the father and daughter strolling out of the hospital, side by side, even though both had already died!). Besides this strange ending, everything else was excellent. I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of Solitaire is a nice way to pass down time.  It is easy and fast with helpful features.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Watched Scotty's season (10) on American Idol. Man, he was a winner from the start. I love this, his first CD and highly recommend it to anyone who looking for a clean CD of country music. He's a 10!!
0061537969|5.0|This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.  We used it for a Reading Group and everyone in the group also enjoyed it.  Lots of topics to discuss.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|For many years I've been a fan of Whitney Houston but only recently have really gotten &#34;into&#34; her story/biography. I have basically worn out this CD. I recommend it highly.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book was like watching an episode of fringe, which I miss. So I loved this book. Very interesting, the magnets in the fingers thing, what! Never knew that. Read it.
B00200K2UG|4.0|I use this bag when I need to carry a lot of equipment. But I also use a couple smaller bags when I don't need to carry as much as this one is very large. It can be awkward, and very heavy when loaded, if you mean to walk around with it. But taking it to a location shoot requiring little hiking around I love this bag. It comes with many adjustable, Velcro dividers to adjust to your liking. Nevertheless, I still had to make a couple custom u-shaped dividers as the 3 included ones are meant for centering a camera and lens in the bag. In order to accommodate a large lense with attached hoods I needed the U shapes off center and wider so that I would leave a lot of easily accessible compartments. I regular fit a camera w/ attached lens (any of mine), 3-4 additional lenses, 2 flashes, and a multitude of filters, chargers, cables, batteries, flash accessories, cleaning tools, and still have room for more junk.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the first Kate Morton novel I've read and it won't be my last.  Her writing style immediately pulls you into the story, easily imagining the surroundings and feeling the emotions of the characters.  Dolly is dying and her children want to know more about her past,her secrets.  Laurel was a little girl, hiding in a treehouse, when she witnesses her mother stab and kill a stranger that had walked on to their property. The book goes back and forth from the present to Dolly's life in London during the war. Romance,revenge,mystery.  Just when you think Laurel has finished her search and has uncovered her mother's past she sees a picture that changes everything.  Enough said. I will be recommending this book to friends and members of my book club.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have not read that many biographies (I think this was my second).  It is really not my thing. That being said, I can not imagine anyone reading this book and not giving it 5 stars.  This book by far exceeded my expectations.  This book gives an objective view of Jobs, sometimes displaying him as an ass and sometimes brilliant. I will not go into detail about the book since there are thousands of reviews which do a very good job of this.  I'll just say I give it high recommendations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough to motivate to keep playing but not so difficult that the average player (which I am) will give up. Good job!!!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Absolutely immersive read. Read the book in two successive evenings and was thinking about it for the rest of the week.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|I liked Monsters University, but I didn't love it.  I'm glad I got to see where Mike and Sully got their start, and there are some really funny, engaging moments in this movie, but overall, I fear that it is a forgettable movie.  I'm glad that Pixar has stated that they will be working on more original projects instead of sequels.  Now, Monsters University does not even come close to being a bad movie (like Cars 2), but it's far from great (Toy Story 2, 3) in the Pixar Universe.<br /><br />Bottom line - the kids will love it (although it did get a bit scary for some kids at my theater late in the movie) and the adults will find something to laugh at.  The animation is great (there's a scene at a lake that really stands out).  The 3D is definitely not worth it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The book was a little slow to start but picks up and becomes and real page-turner. The ending seemed a bit chopped, but then again this is a three-part series so the author had to stop somewhere. Currently reading the next book in the series and thoroughly enjoying it.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|My only regret is that I didn't see the two of them play when they did it again at Tanglewood.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Can be read in a day or two but can take a lifetime to understand. Take the time to read something worthwhile.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The only thing I was struck with in this book was the amount of introspection this 17 year old protagonist had to deal with.  I felt it was a bit much for her age.  There could have been more time given to the games which I found to be hectic and hurried.  This book had my attention, but not as riveting as the first book.  Still, I will read the third book with hopes it will complete this trilogy in a more cohesive manner.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The ending this season was sad, wish they would have not killed Matthew off he was one of my favorite character.
1556438850|5.0|The book is very well structured, and delivers great tips and advices. I highly recommend it to everyone who's serious about teaching yoga (as well to every yoga students).
B006LSZECO|4.0|An absorbing page-turner, hard to put down.  The story had me interested very early and held me until the absolute end.  The down side: I found the over-use of coarse language somewhat off-putting, as the story could easily stand on it's own without this distraction.  Otherwise, I would rank this among the best of the books I have read this year.
B00821OX98|2.0|I like the aliens in this series, but the people were pretty unbelievable. This is just another formulaic TV offering. Not much here, which is disappointing from Spielberg. Watched the first season expecting things to get better. They never did.
B005FRF6PC|3.0|Not too much more information then is already known.  Wonderful pictures not much information regarding himself,  Each chapter simply repeats the same remarks regarding his Uncles and family.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It is a great tool for learning a simple tune if you don't have a piano.  Only one octave, but it suffices for small music projects.  Very handy to have with you anywhere.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I bought this after reading other reviews and It has really nice graphics and accurate weather. I like how it shows the earthquakes. (I'm in California I suppose for midwest it would show Tornado warnings)  I did tone down/tweak the earthquake settings because it was blowing up my phone at first with every little teeny one within 3 states of me. I fixed it to only show ones near me that are over a 3.0 so now I dont get bothered with every little one.<br /><br />The weather function works great and you can tweak the settings to show what you want up in the notification bar. I have mine set to show current temp and current humidity levels.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It was very well done, excellent visual effects and the actors were superb.  I just did not get it.  The ending was too uncertain for me.
B00821OX98|5.0|I've been waiting for the 3rd season of The Walking Dead to come on Netflix, so in the meantime, found this show. I think this is a new favorite!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I finally worked up the courage to buy this app when the first two either didn't work or had very few colors to choose from. This app however has lots of options to choose from and almost feels like your drawing at home. It has different backgrounds, stickers, markers, crayons, penciled, paint, and stamps to choose from. It was worth the money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My seven year old granddaughter downloaded it and enjoyed it so much that her four year old brother HAD to have it. They absolutely love it! It is on BOTH of their Kindles! No fussing on who has the next turn!
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|This app made my kindle go nuts with popups and then a virus! Do not put this on your device!!!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This is the best show I have watched in a long time. Keep up the Great work and keep them coming!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I think he could have picked better songs overall. He needs to utilize his depth a little more for his range
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Simple action movie - that's OK. But, compared to Die Hard 3 and Die Hard 4, for instance, I find this one to be rather trivial...
B005PK57IK|5.0|It's not your average courtroom drama! The good wife is well written and has an excellent cast! I can't wait for season five. I highly recommend this series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing with my horse it's almost life like. My daughter loves playing this game. Plus saves me money
B00881VLCE|4.0|A great app for for kids or if your bored and need to pass the time away.  Cute pictures, but more for a 4 or 5 year old.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|You have to love a sweet story that shows us that we can always learn and always love. That is what Like: a sweet tale that feels true in your heart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Reread it twice. Still makes me cry. Gonna read it a million times more. Would most definitely recommend to anyone with a heart.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I have hard time finding &#34;new&#34; artist who I like. Too many performers, not enough artist out there. This is a work of an artist.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love this game just as much as the other Quell games. It is addicting. I can't get anything else done. Very fun. And I'm not a youngster.
0770437419|4.0|This is an entertaining and unique book that takes a somewhat silly and impossible subject and makes an awesome \\"what-if?\\" scenario to consider. What if zombies, like a viral pandemic, infected and turned the population into bloodthirsty undead automatons and the world had to band together and make impossible choices to ensure the survival of the remaining mortals? This book, besides entertaining us with gruesome zombie violence, poses very human questions about the \\"human condition\\" and takes on various social problems and considers how people would act if a zombie apocalypse occurred.<br /><br />Unlike traditional novel's this is written like a report, composed of multiple interviews of survivors following the \\"end\\" of the war. The UN writer interviews numerous people from diverse walks of life from all corners of the globe to obtain their account of the war during the initial outbreak, the great panic, total war, and the drawing down of hostilities.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it and seemed pretty realistic. Good summer read.
0062238868|5.0|Great book by a great man. Yeah, the writing isnt refined, but the man was a soldier not a writer.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I had heard that this show was pretty good, so I decided to give it a shot. I tend to like shows and movies set in this time era...but this show is amazing. From the first episode it sucks you into the storyline. Hopefully it stays around for a lot longer than most shows these days. Quality television is so hard to come by these days with the slew of mindless and absolutely horrible programing that is popular with the modern audience. We need less Kardashians, Teen Moms, Dancing twits, fist pumping beach dwellers, and all around &#34;reality&#34; television...and more amazingly well cast and scripted viewing opportunities. Hopefully the creators or actors of this show stumble upon this review one day, because I would like to congratulate all of them on a job well done. I am one who watches television and movies for free via streaming sources the majority of the time. I don't care to download, since once I see a movie/series I am done with it and will never watch it again. This series I took a chance on actually buying it, and the gamble was worth it. Hopefully they receive a portion of the proceeds though I do not know how it works exactly. I will be paying for season two as soon as I am done with season one, and the other seasons as they come out. One day I may actually buy the physical copies of the DVD's as well so I can rewatch without relying on an internet connection. I enjoy this show enough to watch them again.
B0085OELXK|4.0|Matt Damon is a very talented actor who got better with age!  There isn't much he's done that I did not like!
0062183613|4.0|I increasingly discover that I do not especially love books that report on human behavior through use of all kinds of game-like academic experiments. This book is full of this kind of 'work' and Ariely is a master of collaborating with others to probe 'behavior' in this way. Nonetheless the work does provide certain insights, if not to my mind earth- shaking ones. Among these is that most of us lie to the point where it might begin to damage our image of ourselves as honest. We cheat to the point that we believe we will get away with it. We try to fool others and fool ourselves also.<br />One experiment I did learn something from was attributed to Roy Baumeister. It has to do with 'ego depletion' and explains why we may resist the fattening foods all day and give in to the urge for the chocolate cake at night. The idea is that each bit of resistance tires us a bit, and that when we become depleted of resistance at night we then binge.<br />Again the book probes a wide variety of conditions and offers a variety of insights on the subject of our ability to be untruthful to ourselves and others.<br />Better readers than I will get more from the book than I did.
B007OLYQ4E|2.0|I have always liked the movie because mainly living Audrey Hepburn but the book was kind of boring. I still don't get why Capote was so popular. Maybe for his day he was risqu&eacute; or something.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|All in all, an interesting look at the English ways of old...<br />We liked all three seasons and are looking forward<br />to the 4th.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|The first thing that people will notice right off the bat with Grimes is her breathy high-pitched voice. This is where the line must be drawn, because song after song, Grimes will carve electronic landscapes and her voice melts into the scenery a lot of the times. This is a turn off to some people, and it's definitely one of the barriers I had to overcome in order to like Visions.<br /><br />I think this album is imaginative, quirky and full of great ideas.<br /><br />I love how Grimes separates the first half of Visions into a ground for upbeat music. The shorter >2 minute tracks space out the sounds interestingly. The left the second half of the album is where shit gets interesting. Visiting Statue, the middle track sets the tone for the second half of Visions, and From Be a Body onward, it's a ride that may lead to some very dark places. All songs break the 4 minute mark and the second to last two songs are even longer. If you let yourself become enthralled by the second half of Visions, I promise you will encounter some very rewarding material that makes up for all the length.<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is a journey through a vast field of electronic ghost stories that enthrall you and make you warm inside. It's that good.
0316247545|5.0|Really beautiful and amazingly helpful, this book is a must have for anyone who enjoys MLP. It is not a cheaply made book it is amazing quality for these days.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|You might look at someone like Portia DeRossi and think she hasn't a problem in the world.  This book exquisitely captures her descent into anorexia, ably capturing how she thought at the time and the lengths she went to in pursuit of perfection..  It is captivating, disturbing and left me with some questions, like who hires an 82 pound actress for a movie?  Didn't the producers and directors of Ally McBeal notice that the women on the show were literally fading away?  At least 3 later admitted to being anorexic while on the show.  DeRossi writes well, and includes the details that make the difference.  It is a riveting read.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|The Super Heroes could have come out earlier in the movie, but the Batman/Superman storyline was cute. Lego movies are just fun for the family
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game. I like the challange. i feel like I'm using my brain and keeping it young.
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|My mom wanted this movie, so I pre ordered it on Amazon to play on her Roku. She enjoys it, I have not watched it yet, but enjoy all the other Die Hard movies
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I started reading this book thinking that it would be dry.  But after I started reading it I couldn't stop reading it.  I hope that there is a sequel to this book.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Got these for the 2 big Who fans in the family. Both loved the book and were pleased with the gifts.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Many questions about he film were answered, but the most remarkable thing to me was the fear that Arthur Clark could instill. Remarkable!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked the book but it was too short. I finished it in 2 days.  I actually liked that more characters stories were included but they too were so brief. It does suck that another book has to be purchased. I just hope I don't have to wait a year.
1781162646|5.0|have not yet read this book by ood, a short steven king but from past  experience and having read his other booksthis can only be good
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good story with a interesting ending.  I enjoyed the way the story was told by the father and how it evolved.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|'it is fun and gives me something to do when I am bored. some of the levels are not that easy but for the most part it is an easy game.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the wit and the humor of &#34;Suits&#34;, although I think it became much more serious in the Season 2. I'm excited for Season 3!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Shaun is one smart sheep, let me tell ya!  I personally enjoy 'claymation' videos, but Shaun is in a class all by himself.  The writers responsible for the scripts have done a wonderful job of 'problem solving' where they get Shaun into a situation and then solve the problem.  No discernible dialog from the characters but you understand whats going on.  The technical side of things is also wonderful with smooth action and expressive expressions on the faces.  Totally fun for all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great love it. Keeps the kids busy! Now I don't have to buy a real horse!!!<br /> Love notice it love it love it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this book.  This book grabs you from page one and never lets you go.  From the mysterious island to the peculiar children who inhabit it, this book is a must read for people of all ages.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I love the writing! The story is interesting with many twists and turns and cliffhangers. Some humor woven in helps.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the twists in the plot. Very well written and I can definitely recommend. Main characters are very well written so that you feel you really know them. It was easy to empathize with these parents.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Excellent movie. Loved it a lot. I have watched this movie many times since this rental. Very Excellent.<br />Loved it!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, and Hosseini is one of my top 3 favorite writers, but I found this book to be disjointed. The writing itself was beautiful and full of his usual insights that astound me, however, I felt the story never really took hold and I found myself putting the book down more often than usual, and not compelled to pick it back up. I am glad I read it simply because his writing inspires me and is truly a work of literary art, but the story fell short for me.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very good movie especially when you know people lived through an event like this. The producers could have made the beginning of the movie with the coming of the tidal wave a more indepth and accurate. Otherwise and excellent movie.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Only Woody Allen could do comedy like this.  This was classic Woody, with Diane Keaton at his side.  Woody Allen has had some hits and misses in his film career, and this was definitely a hit!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's Beautifully done. So glad I can watch it on Amazon Prime since I missed it the first time around.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Duels 2014 is the best in the series by far. I love the sealed format although two decks is kind of low to start with.
B009EAO38C|5.0|If you haven't heard The Piano Guys, you are in a for a treat. They are amazing musicians who will make you smile!
1565234243|3.0|This is a very well written book and I'm sure I will get something out of it, but it wasn't what I was looking for. It said \\"capturing expression\\" in the title (which is what I was looking for). It didn't say that it was only one expression--surly (as shown on the cover). Great work by an incredibly talented man, but now I'll need to keep looking for a book that shows expression(s).
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|If you haven't heard The Piano Guys, you are in a for a treat. They are amazing musicians who will make you smile!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|A MUST READ for any James Bond fan. I loved Damian Stevenson's first book 'Solstice' and this was also an exciting page turner. I would suggest this book to ANYONE wanting to read a FANTASTIC ACTION PACKED with true facts book!
B0028YPDVW|5.0|very nice, i like it because it is look like real one and so you can put it as decorate.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|I have to say 20 words and dont know what else to say. It was an awesum fantasy movie from the eighties that I grew up to. If someone else complains about this movie...its because they are lamers.
B006VRDZ44|5.0|If you liked Sopranos, then you'll probably also love this \\"Prohibition Era\\" period piece of Americana.  It has a'lot to look forward in a crime drama.  Beautiful and Smart Woman, great clothing and sets, great music and art, and lots of alcohol, drugs, and sex. It will suck you in and work wonders on your imagination. What more could you ask for in a show?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was good, opened some other doors to help explain things.  However, it ended so abruptly that I was thinking, are you kidding me?  I do love Gideon & the chemistry between him & Eva.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great product. I have bought this CPU Cooler before and since I am going to overclock my CPU. This is my second build is why I purchase this again. If you are building a computer I suggest getting one for your build. It will not let you down.
1421550644|5.0|Buying this set on impulse turned out to be the best decision I made for as long as I remember. Its so good It made me have to write a review even though I never do. I saw the movie a long time ago and while I liked it, I thought it was messing a lot of things and felt kind of rushed and confusing and left a lot to be desired, but it had potential. And I'm glad to say that this novel takes all that potential and explodes it all over your mind! The setting is the same , but the story is a lot different and a lot darker than the one in the movie. And Its SO much better! This is definitely one of the best (if not the best) epic visual novels out there. The paper quality is amazing and everything else about the book is just perfect. Its one of those books that makes you want to read the whole thing again  the moment you finish it. A very tiny detail that I wish it had is the english translation of the sound effects in the panels, but I understand that they choose to put those in the end of the book to not disturb the original art (which is beautiful by the way), but that's such a small nitpick and doesn't distract from the overall amazing experience.<br /><br />If you are interested enough to view this page right now, then I say stop reading and click on that buy button, I expect a thank you note from you in the future ;p
B00CF34B2I|1.0|For the life of me, this game would not download so this far, I don't know if it's the app store or the game itself.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was an intresting concept for a movie. I enjoyed it very much.  I recommend reading the books then seeing the movies.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoy the way the love scenes make you feel the emotion of the characters! Every twist and turn in the book keeps you involved and not bored.  I look forward to the next in the series.  I pick up each new book months after finishing the last one and it comes back to memory right away. I love this series!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed her third book, it wasn't may favorite out of the three but still a good read! I didn't want to story to end I still need to know what happens after there married. Is Tray a father????
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie is just f***ing great! Another milestone in modern cinema from my favorite director! This is a must have for all movie aficionados! Highly recommended!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome book! Can't not wait for the next one. Hopefully we don't have to wait too long to see what's next in the crossfire series :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A GOOD GAME OF THE MOST FUN TO PLAY THE GAME AND I THINK THAT THE GAME IS A VERY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love the game but the app freezes way too much. Sometimes I have to delete the app and re download it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing and just like temple run. who ever is creating these games keep going because you have me interested. It is just what kids need and want.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I felt a connection with this book early on. It literally made me cry, laugh, smile, and brought goose bumps to my skin. Defiantly one of the best books I've ever read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Humble, funny, insightful, honest and incredibly easy to be &#34;inside&#34; the head of a SEAL.  Worthwhile read to understand our servicemen as well as this amazing young man.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|Let's start with the premise that neutrinos are heating up the Earth, which is nonsense. Neutrinos do not react with ordinary matter. In fact they can only be detected when they have penetrated the Earth's surface.<br />Let's look at the premise that the Mayans somehow predicted that the Earth would end in 2012. They had short count and long count calendars but there is nothing special about a calendar that ends in 2012 or any other year.<br />I have visited the major Mayan sites in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Yucatan as well as Copan in Honduras and Tikal and Quirigua in Guatemala.<br />I have read about the translations of Mayan sources and have a collection of Mayan documentaries.<br />Any scientist who has translated the Mayan language would be appalled by the scientific ignorance found in this film.<br />Finally,we are now in 2013 and nothing terrible happened last year. So relax: we made it safely through 2012. Unfortunately, many Mayans were murdered by the right wing government in Mexico. But that's another story. If you would like to learn more about the Mayans in Chiapas in 2012, get the DVDs Oscar Chavez Chiapas and A Place Called Chiapas from Zeitgeist Video,both available here on AMZ.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Super true, super acting by a gal that bolts this movie to the wall.  I've never seen an actor carry a story like this.  All you have to do is watch her eyes and the superlative movie making techniques by the production team stays with you like events such as Iwo Jima, D-day, .....9/11.  Jessica, enjoy your new apartment in New York....you earned it gal......
B0001AUAU4|5.0|On this CD she sings 12 beautiful French songs. I think I'm in love!<br />P.S. Don't miss her latest CD titled Little French Songs. Check it out.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This season starts out in epic proportion as Doctor Who comes to America. Matt Smith is a delight as Doctor Who and the supporting cast is brilliant. If you aren't already a fan of the Doctor, you will be this season!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was very pleased with the reboot of TOS in the previous film, but I was worried they'd lose the Star Trek magic with this follow-up. I was worried it would be just your typical Hollywood big budget action film using Star Trek characters. To a degree - objectively - that's what this film is, BUT the Star Trek aspects run much deeper than just a veneer and this saves the film for big Star Trek fans like myself. Enthralled is a word I very rarely use to describe a movie viewing experience, but with this film I was genuinely enthralled from beginning to end. Part of it was the joy of being among these characters again. The original series had an ENORMOUS impact on me when I was growing up and it's a great pleasure to see the characters portrayed so skillfully by good actors and treated with so much respect by the scriptwriter. On top of this, the level of film making on display is very impressive. Every aspect of the film just works. I went to see it expecting the worst, but ended up having one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use this app every day. It is my alarm clock as well as my timer. I use it for taking a nap or spending time on the computer.
B009MYARIK|2.0|I loved all her older Shopaholic novels - I remember laughing out loud to those - in public no less! I couldn't wait to read the next one..so when I saw she had a new novel out - I bought it right away - so disappointing.  The ending was predictable, not funny - the characters were lame! I hope she fires back with a good one soon
B004LQI0HE|3.0|And then left us with more questions trying to make sense of it all. Why did they not run away?
B0055SWM08|4.0|Not only are the graphics high quality but the game play is superb! There is no down side to this game. It's a great way to kill time while waiting in the Dr.'s office. I don't rate anything a 5 in case, someday, I run across a truly great game. This one's close.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I love this record.  I know some are disappointed that it is an album of covers rather than new original material.  Get over it!  Jeff did a fantastic job here, and for records like this one, it is second only to Harry Nilsson's \\"A Little Touch Of Schmillson In The Night\\" in my book.
B000MVIAUY|5.0|Missed this episode on TV so purchased it on Amazon.  It was worth every penny.  Love this show, one of my favorites.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|I read about this band in Mojo, and I was glad I decided to buy this record. I have always been a fan of so-called psychedelic rock.  I immediately loved this record - my favorite so far from the band.  Lonerism is fantastic too, but I think this collection of songs is a little stronger overall.  It's just great, fun music.  Lots have been comparing Kevin's voice to John Lennon's -- I hear more of a resemblence to Stewkey from the Nazz.  Anyway, I'm glad that Kevin and co. have managed to embrace psyche and come across sounding fresh rather than being yet another band trying to recreate the 60s.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I am so happy for this version of Queensryche and the fans! This album shows they still have their Heavy Metal chops they seemed to have all but lost. DTC has three good songs but otherwise was a travesty of epic scope. I really thought this band was done for until now. To call this a rebirth is really quite true.\\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" is Queensryche's best song since \\"The Right Side Of My Mind\\" off the otherwise lackluster Q2K. The rest of the album is great too and definately has a Rage/Warning feel which many will appreciate. It is a little bit on the short side but that just leaves me excited for the next album. Todd does an excellent job here replacing an iconic signer yet has his own voice and Scott hasn't sounded this inspired on the drums in years. Those beautiful guitar harmonies are a welcome return and I am craving to hear more. Nice job guys and welcome back! This really is the best Queensryche album since Promised Land!!!
B004SIP7AS|5.0|My own copy of Emma was lost so I was grateful that this one was sent and is new. Thanks
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing the humanity in Bond and M.  Three generations of females agree on this:  Bond is  smokin' hot.
1451648537|2.0|I had to force myself through the first fifty pages then I QUIT.  Probably should have started Jobs story with his working life not all that early stuff.  Maybe someday I'll get<br />back to this book.
B00005Y443|4.0|Concierto is my favorite. Other cuts on the CD are good mood music, but Concierto will always rank highest in my opinion.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Loved it but anything by Rick Riordan involving Percy Jackson is almost always a winner , so far anyway and I have read quite a few .
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Like the horror stories.  Wish the games were cheaper, I would like to play more games like this.  Otherwise enjoying place this game allot.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man is my favorite super hero so I got the app and tried it and it was amazing and the update was awesome cause it gave discounts on it.But who ever likes marvel or iron man or the avengers then this is an app for you.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|This revitilization of the Dr. Who show of old is so very, very good.  Why are you reading reviews?  Go watch the show!<br /><br />Rose really took a while to grow on me, but overall the show can't be beat for brilliant, entertaining, heart-tugging, flashy scifi!  It's just darn good, loveable television.  Thank you, BBC!
B0096HL33G|3.0|Rachel Weisz is great. As usual, she performs very well but the movie is a bit depressing. I'm not sure I would recommend it.
1401310672|5.0|Hilarious book. Easy to flick through - great coffee table book. Always has me in hysterics every time I pick it up.
1442362901|5.0|This is one of those books that held my attention.  I will listen to it again because I thoroughly enjoyed the experience
B000PMG16U|5.0|a must have for all star war fans.  had to get this with the original star war series.  completed my star wars collection.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This movie was well written.  The acting was super.  It left me with a feeling of &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; all over.  I will enjoy watching this from time to time and will share it with others.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|ever since i got a blu ray player, i had to build my blu ray collection.  this is my favorite movie and had to get.
B005GU8ILW|5.0|I love all the songs on this album, it sounds great playing, and the unique coloring is fun. Great stuff that you do not hear on the radio.
B001G619C0|5.0|one of my favorite movies and great to have for my blu ray collection.  real good price for 3 blu ray disc.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|all the jack reacher stories are a hit. i love the way he simplifies his life. i feel sad for him and the lonliness it evokes when the book ends. smile and look friendly!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a welcome escape into a world that's so difficult to imagine for most of us. The quality of this production is superior in every sense.
B008BM9L72|3.0|A very simple story, not written with much flair.<br />The juicy bits described OK but lacked real Oomph and very predictable.<br />Will probably be made into a Soft Porn Movie
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Love this author she keeps the story tight and relates the other characters you have met in her other books through all her stories.  I enjoy seeing how they all evolve.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|My daughter raved about this show and had been wanting me to check it out. Sat down to watch only one episode to see what was what...ended up watching the entire season in one go. Loved it! It's funny, quirky, goofy..laugh out loud fun. One of the better teen shows out there. Definitely recommended.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved the eagles references. Great love story. Loved mental health awareness. Easy read.  Enjoyed comparing the book to the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great way to round off this captivating series. Suspenseful but left the reader happy by tying up a lot of loose ends with several characters.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and still love it and will cry every time. It's such a good love story.
B001676320|5.0|two groups Chicago and EWF under the same roof the same night, fantastic show. Great DVD would highly recommend to any fan
B000YJ85BI|3.0|I am on the fence here--it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I liked the concept and I very much liked the characters, which is of major importance to me, but there was something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. One story line was just dropped; perhaps it will be explored later in the series, but I wasn't left with that impression. It's almost as if the author started down that path, then had second thoughts and decided not to pursue it. Instead of taking it out he left it hanging. And, even though it wasn't essential to the story(in the manner in which it was handled), the dropping was done so abruptly that I kept waiting for the other shoe to hit the plot, and it kept me from really enjoying the rest of the book.
0143036424|5.0|Walt is the man of men taking on what ever the world offers up and makes it right in a gentle amusing way. A great read a real page turner.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Very cute game but it locked up and shut down my kindle and when I was finally able to turn my kindle fire back on Nemo's Reef was uninstalled.  Update: few hours later Nemo was back and working fine.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'm hooked on Dr. Who.<br />I thought that the effects were janky at first, but now it's part of the culture.<br /><br />Love this show.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This was one of Amazon's free app of the day.  Knowing of it's popularity I got it and played it.<br /><br />It is definitely a time killer.  I lost a good amount of hours to my life to this game which is a good thing for a game lol<br /><br />It's a simple beat them up/rpg/puzzle game.  Though I believe this game is highly about luck when it comes to matching the puzzle pieces.<br /><br />I beat the game in about 8 hours.  It is quite repetitive so I stopped every so often to rest.  Just keep plowing through and get those upgrades when you can as it really helps to progress faster, don't just wait and save up gold/exp.  Use the potions whenever you can to get that edge for the gold/exp/supplies you need.
B004EERGHS|4.0|The easy-going natural rapport between Newman and Redford is pure joy. Overall, the movie feels a bit dated stylistically, but that's a big part of its charm (or can be a bit of a turn-off to a younger viewer... say, 40 yrs old or less). For me, it's a cool classic I've seen about 4 times.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I just love this app! There are so many options, and combinations for relaxing sounds. The developers really did a wonderful job here in my opinion!
B00C8985DU|3.0|Would have given 5 stars if the package was a little less expensive. Time will tell if it will old it's value. Really excited to have the partial Cow Palace concert on CD. I attended the Cow Palace show, so was also excited to see a ticket stub for the show also. They took the whole ticket at the door, so no souvenir. I'll keep buying Paul's Deluxe Releases even though I cringe a little when buying them.
B008393Q2O|3.0|I use this quite regularly. It can be a little touchy to navigate on the small phone screen, but I like the color options and the ability to make not just regular notes, but also check lists.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I downloaded this after playing angry birds Rio for a while.<br />I knew that it was a different type of game, but this one is one that does not interest me.<br />The constant web page pop ups don't help either.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Finally a really good reason to watch a drama series which isn't graphic, crude or  made for reality style TV.<br /><br />The cast are perfectly suited for their parts, the sets are historically correct.<br />The scenery gorgeous.<br />Another fine production from the BBC
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Movie was just so so. Rented regular copy. Very poor reception. Looked like a bad feed. There was nothing wrong on my end. Maybe hd would of worked.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I pretty much love any Hayao Miyazaki films. I find them cute and magical. Especially this one right here. Anne Hathaway is good at voice acting in this film. This movie is magical and captures what people usually see or want out of life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show! It has many plot twists that leaves you wanting more! Anyone who likes Pride and prejudice will like this.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|This movie was really good, but I felt it was a bit slow. Other than that, a 4 out of 5. I loved the story, animation, and the power of Nausicaa doing everything she can to find peace.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|that you have to watch about 4 times before it becomes clear.  A gutsy move by Hanks, making an intelligent movie.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Kindle is just amazing!  I read my books both on the Kindle and on the computer, and upload on the personal computer.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Just when you think it can't get better it does. The writers of Downton Abbey have succeeded in maintaining the pace and thus the interest of their audience by introducing new twists and turns in the evolving saga of the lives of the upstairs and downstairs inhabitants of the Abbey. This is truly an outstanding colorful series which holds one's interest episode to episode and season to season. Like a good book, it is hard to put it down.  Well done!
B008602KQI|5.0|It's a great movie I like it and one of the reasons I bbought it was bcause my wife wanted to c it
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Pretty good book, but an awfully lot of foreign names to remember who is who.<br />Take notes as to different people and what they did.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, though be prepared for a not-so-happy ending.  The writing style of the book is classic Bronte, with all of the messiness and complications you might expect from a Bronte sister's novel.  The story is predictable, but I think the more interesting part of the book is to see how mid-19th century English society viewed courtship, marriage, childrearing, friendship, and death. I've come away from the book with a better sense of what life was like for the Bronte sisters through the plot and characters of Wuthering Heights.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Cannot wait for the next two movies. It's a shame the series is ended but I'm happy with the way it worked out.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|The sound is great and the casing iothe product is perfect.. Bopnanmassa simply rocks!  A good buy for a great price..
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Hey, its ROBO Cop what else can you say, ED-209, the Jarvic Heart, and all the blood sex and violence that made it great.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is amazing. And is very detailed. I recommend this to anyone who read the Hunger Games. If you like exciting, surprising, and suspension then this book is really for you!
B007LGPSX0|5.0|What can be better than 90210?  I only wish there were all the seasons to watch or buy!  Only one season, is just sad and taunting!
1616550414|5.0|Graphics and book design are awesome...  And finally get &#34;official&#34; game timeline...  Good bit is the comic at the end which is a prequel to Skyward Sword.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I loved this movie, it is one if those put your cares aside and watch a good movie.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
0062082353|5.0|This is the type of book you can't put down. Well written and the tale of a true hero. Buy it. And enjoy it.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|An epic tale that is never boring. Having said that, there are a lot of insignificant names that are constantly thrown in, and you wonder which ones you should disregard. Also, keep the maps handy so that you can refer to them as the battles rage on. I happen to like entering a world that can be explored further, but if you are not, this book series is not for you. It is well worth the effort.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought this would be a fun game for my 4 year old grandson to play since he's into Monster Jam.  As it turned out, his dad and 16 year old cousin spent a good part of the day completing with each other for the highest score!  It was a hit!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am finding this series to be spectacular!  The characters are developed well.  The plot very interesting.  I am enjoying it immensely!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Inspired me to read the book by Eric Metaxas.  Great insight into a significant time and place in European history.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow-up to the first book. Surprises and plot twists abound. Loved it!<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next entry in the series.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|I enjoy history, so this movie really appeals to me! I also have the movies 300, Troy, and Apocalypto in my library.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|The re-creations of the different scenes of the movie are very entertaining and the action is very fast and enjoyable.  Great game!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was the best out of the 3. I felt like Sylvia Day finally found her own voice and wasn't writing a book on a borrowed plot anymore. The sex scenes were very steamy and the love story became quite interesting in this one. This is the book where I began to really love all the characters. I already loved Ava and Karrie, but not anyone else. Giddeon warmed up to me by this book, and I really love her mother. I know she's a weird, gold digger, but at least she knows that and will own it.<br />  I felt like in this book the character's stories were coming together nicely. I started to get excited and was really rooting for a happy ending..
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Does exactly as it promises with some very informative screens related to signal strength and channel usage.  One of the most useful apps on my Kindle right now.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Im glad u have all the seasons - I use Netflix also an they don't :-) there are a couple other series that I started on Netflix an couldn't finish til I joined amazon - good job
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This classic story is by far amazing, its a page turned and its a must read. Many of the points in this book are truthfully scary, one of the characters in this story isn;t afraid to say what is on his mind and while at times i disagree with him he is the only one that isn't two face.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this movie several times and it kept entertaining me as if new.<br />Looking forward to the avengers II.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started season 3.<br />Looks wonderful so far and I could sense there's<br />gonna be a lot of surprises and new challenges awaiting<br />Downton Abbey.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|a truely amazing distpian movie. a must see for any fan of the genre. christian bale at his best. a story of feelings in a world where feeling is outlawed
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just when we thought the story was great, the war comes<br />and the owners and employees of Downton Abbey are faced<br />with hard challenges and difficult decisions to make.<br />They make it through with great success, not without making<br />a lot of sacrifices of course.<br />What's waiting for them in season 3???<br />I can't wait...
B000002LE6|5.0|This is my favorite era of Prince.  This album takes you on a spiritual journey from one song to the next.  It is defintiely one of my all time faves.  I love how you have to listen to it all the way thru, there are no separate tracks to skip, its one long experience.  Love it!
B008YUHQ3M|5.0|The final installment to the Harry Potter franchise, it delivers what all the fans could possibly ask for. Even for non-fans like me who have been following this saga will be delighted at the conclusion to this tale, with great special effects, good direction, good acting and a great script.<br /><br />There is nothing to hate here, any flaws could simply be nitpicks to an otherwise tight storyline in a reasonably consistent mythology. I've not read the books, don't consider myself a fan, so you may refer to a true fan for verification as to the plot consistencies in the movie in relation to the books.<br /><br />The film is also available in 3D, I like this particular feature as it adds another fun dimension to the home movie experience. If you're not into 3D you could purchase 2D version instead.
B001O54NHQ|5.0|Prince is just musical genius.  You can tell he really got into this movie cause the songs just go perfect with the scenes.  Love this album!
B0081HLMD8|3.0|This would have been an otherwise good movie for me if not for the great expectations I had developed by all the hype surrounding this movie. I was expecting a tight plot, no holes or \\"why did they do that instead of this\\" moments.<br /><br />The plot involves the antagonist weaving an intricate web in which to manipulate and ultimately kill the protagonist, which could have been done in a number of quite simpler ways. It also involves a science fiction device that seems so out of place in a real world scenario like the one the movie takes place in. Billions are also in stake for the antagonist, who seems to be working for a larger group, and has a lot of Special Forces military connections, yet he works alone instead of having a team that would have finished the job easily.<br /><br />The spectacle of this movie is all the suffering the protagonist has to endure at the hands of the antagonist. The protagonist,is acted superbly by the lead actor Aksel Hennie, there is a scene in a ravine where he is all bloody and crying and this wrenched my heart out. Part of the hype revolves around Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's performance, currently popular for his role in the `Game of Thrones' series. I didn't consider his role to have required a high level of ability, he just has to look menacing, but he is a handsome, charismatic bastard and thus you will look forward to his scenes.<br /><br />This used to be at a much higher price, around $24, a price I would have regretted paying. I feel to have made the right decision to wait till the price dropped to $14.99 before making the purchase.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity is the answer for the huge fan following screaming for the Firefly series to continue.  The same cast, writers and director of the Firefly series finally have given us the full-length version of the Firefly series that has thousands of fans standing in line at Comic-Con gatherings all over the nation.  This is a Must-Have.  Lots of insider information and extras as well as the incredible movie. If you have never been a Sci-Fi fan, try this one.  It won't disappoint.
B0092QITO2|4.0|Total Recall 2012 is a remake of the Total Recall 1990 movie. By establishing the plot on Earth instead of Mars, this remake attempts to make a more realistic world for the story to take place. But it could have been more plausible to establish a colony on Mars as in the original 1990 movie, than it would have to make a tunnel that runs through the very center of the Earth as in this remake. Otherwise it made believable through special effects and conceptualization, the environments and technology. It has that well adapted `Blade Runner' dystopian feel.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the question of what reality is. The original movie relied heavily on surreal interpretations of technology, and absurd fantastic moments, which further muddled the line of reality that messed with the viewer's mind. This to me is what was lost in this remake.<br /><br />In this movie many mourn the replacement of the charismatic but aptly ridiculous Arnold Schwazenegger with Colin Farrell. But as the remake goes for the more `realistic' approach I think Colin Farrell a good replacement. Kate Beckinsale is fantastic as she hams up a nasty villain, she wears something tight and this doesn't hurt the eyes at all. I miss her when she is not on the screen.<br /><br />I have no regrets at this buying remake, it is a fun special effects movie. I was still interested on how this remake would interpret a plot that I am already familiar with. I drank good beer and ate beef hotdogs and slices of mature cheddar while viewing this, but soda and popcorn will do well if that is your preference.
0786891416|5.0|Castle Fans have been asking for the book that Richard Castle has been writing during the first series and Here It Is!  All Castle Fans who are serious about following this sensation ...  well this is simply a must have.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|I like the extras such as bomb deflects, peaches for time, strawberry's. I wish you could earn them quicker that's all.
078689136X|5.0|Yes, you got it!  Remember the edginess in book one?  Well, here is emotional baggage meets murder.  Castle takes us on a tension tilled trip all the while keeping romance simmering just under the surface.  If you are behind on this series, get Heat Wave and Heat Rises.  You will love the synergy of the series.  Keep reading, Castle Fans!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The parents of Jacob seek to vindicate him as the murderer of a classmate.  It cannot possibly be true -  both the parents and the reader think.  As the father delves more deeply into the case, having the opportunity to defend his son, he begins to question certain things about his son based on his own past.  When he discloses his past to his wife, who is a psychologist, she consults experts in the field to try and seek the truth.  When the truth is ultimately revealed, neither parent can handle the results.  Thus, a plot twist at the very end of the novel that is unexpected.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series made me a Sci-fi fan for the first time in my life!  Like to get invested in the characters?  Like to wonder what happens next?  Like to &#34;geek&#34; about this stuff with your friends?  Great!  Get Firefly, get out the snacks, invite friends and have a marathon because one episode won't be enough.  Plus...not only are there the usual DVD add-ons but there are three (count 'em, three) unaired episodes.  Perfect for a long weekend or summer holiday where everyone will love it over good friend and food!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The reader is sucked into this story, immediately bonding with the worried husband, But then we see the wife's story unfold through her diary.  By the time total insanity sets in, the reader is desperately trying to make sense of the plot twists and put rationality into total and complete irrationality.  I was left literally gasping for air at the close of the novel.  Flynn is a brilliant story teller.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|very interesting how Jack as talented as he is always remains humble in all adversity and accepts what is thrown at him then deals with it. There is a lesson there for all of us. Life is what we make of it. Never give up. There is always tomorrow, a new day. Very good, very inspiring.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is one of my most often used games on my kindle. Almost all of my friends have the game, and you don't have to have Wi-Fi to play! It also keeps you busy with lots of hunts, challenges, and (every four weeks) a change in background! I like this game and so will u.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|...if you don't like this movie, look at your life and look at your choices.<br /><br />Someone else said that this movie is perfect. I agree fully. It WILL change your life.<br /><br />It's hilarious, it's witty, it's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again, and every single time I do, it gets better. The cast is brilliant, as is the dialogue. Everything about this movie is impeccably excellent.<br /><br />Stop what you're doing and watch \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" Now.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite Kanye works. Instead of producing the same garbage album after album he is on of the few rappers bringing something new to the table and it is definitely working in his favor.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A nice change of pace from other games I play.  I enjoy the challenge of finding clues.  Good to play when I have a little extra time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the authenticity of this period drama and the well developed characters. This show never fails to transport me to a different time and place. One of my all time favorite escapes from real life!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am not a body builder, but an average Joe, who has enjoyed sports and exercise throughout my childhood and young adult life.  I really enjoyed this book for several reasons.  First it was a quick read, I think I read the whole thing in a day or two and absorbed most of the information I wanted to apply.  I have not lifted \\"heavy\\" in many years as I attributed it to greater chance of injury.  While I was familiar with the overload concept, I don't think I had practiced it in sometime, choosing to mix cardio and weights to mostly stay in shape.  The second thing I liked is it gave a very simple workout plan, basically 3-4 exercises of 4-6 reps per workout. I have been using the variation suggested for 4 workout/week schedule, adding triceps to chest day and biceps to back day and eliminating the separate arm day.  My arms get enough of a workout on these days and are big enough that they don't need their own day.  Less than a month in I have had tremendous strength gains.  To be fair, there was a time that I was much stronger than I am now, so these gains are not above and beyond where I have ever been, but they certainly are above and beyond where I was.  I also found the in detail explanation or certain important exercises and the reference to bodybuilder.com for video explanation of exercises to be an excellent reference.  Certain exercises require good form to prevent injury and to achieve the desired results of the exercise.  I mostly workout by myself, which is unfortunate as I am aware that having a partner would benefit me in many ways as the book suggests and have found this all to be true in the past.  One of the problems I am working through is my comfort level with the exercises at heavier weights (often using the Smith machine, which is frowned upon in the book for good reason).  The diet information is okay, but I don't feel I should comment too much on it as I have not been following it.  I eat relatively healthy, since the book I have been much better about post workout nutrition, but I am not a moderation kind of guy.  So when I am eating healthy I eat healthy most of the time and then I eat a large pizza and a ice cream and cookies for dessert one night.<br /><br />Most importantly the results.  It has been less than a month and so far they have been excellent.  I weigh around 185 and about 5'10\\".  I don't have a six pack or a gut, but have definitely lost some body fat since beginning, but probably not that much because of my diet or lack thereof.  My strength gains have been great.  I can deadlift and squat over 300lbs. and bench 265 (on smith machine, so a lot less on free weights).  On top of this, I have lower back issues, but have been asymptomatic for many years now, instead of hurting my lower back, I believe deadlifts, squats and the core/ab exercises have significantly strengthened by lower back.<br /><br />Overall very happy with workout and information provided in the book as well as its \\"readability.\\"  Of note, I also find Mike's website to very informative.  And Mike himself appears to be very available as well, responding to my only email so far within 1 day.  I also bought his cookbook (shredded chef), which I flipped through, if one can do such a thing on a kindle.  I was hoping it would inspire me get into a better diet routine.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very intense and interesting movie with a great, truth based, story.  I have almost 0 complaints about this feature and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0375851569|5.0|We got this set when my daughter was not quite three.  It was a great set to read to her through the years.  She still loves it when we get tongue-tied at 'Fox in Socks'; though she enjoys reading the others in the set herself (her being seven now!).

B00B2JSRAS|2.0|this book is very confusing long and repetitive of the same subject will not recommend it for people that looking for spiritual book
B00C7JFIRC|2.0|The basic concept and theme of the movie held much promise but a mediocre script, mediocre acting, and poor direction hurt it badly.  Most egregious was its inability to decide if it was a movie for children or adults resulting in something for neither. If you are an Oz fan wait till this stinker is in the sale bin.  It shouldn't take long.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply one of the best shows ever written for TV.<br /><br />DA has an engaging story, deep characters, moments of heartbreak and joy, with a wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography.<br /><br />It doesn't get any better than this.
193700788X|3.0|My review:<br /><br />Dead Ever After is the final installment of one of my favorite book series ever. I was very excited to see how Sookie's story was ending and I have to admit, that after finished the last book, I still have mixed feelings. I finished reading it in May already and I think it was wise to let it all settle before writing a review about it.<br /><br />Dead Ever After is well written and it continues the tradition of Charlaine Harris' amazing writing- and storytelling skills. However, I was disappointed and the reason behind my disappointment is easy - I did not like the fact how the author decided to end the series. With that said, I know it's not the author's problem, but my own, because after all, she is the one who created it and has a right to end her story how she likes. This dilemma is also why I decided to wait with the review, otherwise it would have been very emotional.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Sookie finds herself in a complicated situation. Arlene is back and trying to get her old job back at Merlotte's. Arlene is found dead and all the evidence is pointing towards Sookie. Besides that, already estranged relationship with Eric is getting very complicate and odd because Eric has been promised away to a Vampire Queen to be married. Yes, you got that right! That's shortly about the plot.<br /><br />What I disliked:<br /><br />What was different about Dead Ever After is, that the book is written from multiple point of views and that disturbed me. It was unusual to read somebody else's thoughts but Sookie's.<br /><br />Sookie seemed off. I do understand, that Sookie is tired of the supernatural creatures after all what she has been through and that she needs some stability and normality in her life, but her sassyness was gone. It seemed, that she simply gave up or that she was put into the circumstances when it was easier to not fight for and I did not like that.<br /><br />I did not like what happened to Eric and I missed Sookie's and Eric's relationship. Even though I understand the logic and way of thinking behind why these two could not be together, I would have wanted their breakup being different. Eric's character has through the series built up for a different departure, I honestly have difficulties of believing, that he would leave Sookie without a proper goodbye.<br /><br />I also did not like how Eric ended up with, it was not only sad, but cruel. As said, I get the idea of these two not being together, but the ending of Eric's and Sookie's love story could have been much different and I have difficulties of understanding, why the author chose the way she did. It did not fit with the rest of the story.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />I think it was awesome to meet so many characters from previous books and I think the author did an excellent job with waving them into the final book. I was happy to see all of Sookie's friends gathering for one last time to support the heroine of the series. It was heart-warming and brilliant move from the author.<br /><br />I liked how Sookie re-bonded with Tara and how Sookie understood the need of her own family and children.<br /><br />I still think, that Charlaine Harris is a great writer with an awesome writing style which I have enjoyed for a long time and I have loved the world she created in the Sookie Stackhouse Series! The end of the series gives the bittersweet feeling because I loved the series, but I did not like the ending.<br /><br />Generally:<br /><br />Read it! It's not my favorite book in the series, far from it, but it gave me a good reading experience and it wraps up the whole series and in case you have read all the other books in the series, I recommend to read Dead Ever After as well.'s relationship. Even though I understand the logic and way of thinking behind why these two could not be together, I would have wanted their breakup being different. Eric's character has through the series built up for a different departure, I honestly have difficulties of believing, that he would leave Sookie without a proper goodbye.<br /><br />I also did not like how Eric ended up with, it was not only sad, but cruel. As said, I get the idea of these two not being together, but the ending of Eric's and Sookie's love story could have been much different and I have difficulties of understanding, why the author chose the way she did. It did not fit with the rest of the story.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />I think it was awesome to meet so many characters from previous books and I think the author did an excellent job with waving them into the final book. I was happy to see all of Sookie's friends gathering for one last time to support the heroine of the series. It was heart-warming and brilliant move from the author.<br /><br />I liked how Sookie re-bonded with Tara and how Sookie understood the need of her own family and children.<br /><br />I still think, that Charlaine Harris is a great writer with an awesome writing style which I have enjoyed for a long time and I have loved the world she created in the Sookie Stackhouse Series! The end of the series gives the bittersweet feeling because I loved the series, but I did not like the ending.<br /><br />Generally:<br /><br />Read it! It's not my favorite book in the series, far from it, but it gave me a good reading experience and it wraps up the whole series and in case you have read all the other books in the series, I recommend to read Dead Ever After as well.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|I never get tired of listening to it.  Their best effort yet.  I liked Nothing is Wrong, but this is infinitely better.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful series with great characters and story line.  I cannot wait for Season 4 to begin.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I'm a nursing student, great show to get in a few laughs during the summer break. Recommend to anyone to watch.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I have all ways been curious about the struggle for the hearts and minds of the American people. The book reads like a novel with all the twists and turns of a well crafted story.
B00BNWWVFG|3.0|I fell asleep 15 minutes into it.  I managed to watch in it's entirety the next day, but it just never really caught may full attention. I found it to be nothing new, bad acting, and a mediocre plot.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I have been a Queensryche fan since the early 80's (The Warning) (Rage For Order) . But when Operation Mind Crime came out it became one of my top 5 albums of all time. I love good music and it is hard to have a favorite # 1.  This new CD is simply awesome. It sounds a lot like there classic stuff and also an Empire sound to it. But at the same time it does not sound dated at all. The new lead singer sounds great. And lets face it Geoff Tate's vocals have gone down hill now for a while. And his solo stuff oooouch, not so great.<br /> I just hope this new CD is the first of many great things to come from this awesome band. Even a live CD would be very cool.<br />So I gave this great CD a much deserved 5 star rating. So if you are reading this and have not yet purchased the new Queensryhe....... buy it!<br /><br />  Dano
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging for the mature mind and fun.  Thought it would be so easy but I was wrong.  So very wrong
B005K17RU0|3.0|It is ok for a free app. It is always running and draining my battery on my Kindle, though. Thanks.
B00821OX98|5.0|It keeps you guessing and wanting to know whats next and I'm glad this show is still alive probably because of its director but love it so far and cant wait to watch the rest of season 3
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subwaysurfers is a really cool game because every month on the game you go to a different country around the world.  I LOVE IT!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never brought myself to read such a great book and I have never found such a book to make me cry. I utterly enjoyed each word written. So. Good.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you like Marvel its for you. Lots of action and humor mixed in. Very enjoyable to watch. I would recommend it for everyone.
B00499QUK2|5.0|keeps you on your toes the entire season! Watch season two as well because who can stand a cliff hanger!
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|This book seems like it was written by a high school student.  I do not recommend this book.  The whole point of him writing this book was to make money for himself.  In the book the author says if we don't like the book we can ask for our money back.  I am asking for my money back now.<br /><br />Some \\"great tips\\" from the author:<br /><br />1.) Take walks (wow)<br />2.) Don't sleep with someone you don't love.  (wow)<br />3.) Think of good ideas everyday (wow)<br /><br />and more...
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Nice to see a movie where I can't &#34;predict the plot &#34; as I go.  I actually got to be in the story.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Our 18 month old daughter regularly asks, &#34;Bike?&#34; now!  She's petite for her age, but fits securely in the seat.  I am 5' 3&#34; and have cruiser handlebars and it is a pretty comfortable fit.  The only thing that takes some getting used to is I have to set my feet a little wider on the pedals in order to accommodate the WeeRide.  My husband and I love that we are able to ride bikes together again!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Gold gold good.  Yummy beautiful inspiring warm gentle  nourishing gold. Nurturing happy witty watched it 3 times yes! Richard Parker
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is awesome and really made me laugh and made me want to find out what would happen next, I love \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Cabin Fever\\".
B0059DQHHI|4.0|I thought it was a good movie.  While the plot was a little thin and obvious.  The acting was good and it kept my mind from jumping ahead to figuring out the ending.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Look elsewhere for a review of the Gladiator film.<br /><br />This Steelbook version contains a theatrical and extend version of the film. For those who care, this does contain the &#34;fixed&#34; version of the blu-ray. IE: the one that looks pretty.<br /><br />The steelbook case is nothing overtly special, but it is fairly cool for those interested. I purchased this version because it was it contained the right version of the film along with being considerably lower in cost. The case was a nice bonus.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app way faster then the news.  The extreme weather videos are great too. I recommend it to all
B00CATSONE|2.0|This was an interesting read, but it all lead up to a sales pitch for the real book with all of the how to bits about unleashing your genius and whatever else. Bonus star for being free.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have read all five books - enjoyed them all - am just so frustrated that book six won't be out for almost two years - that was a major disappointment....<br />Am feeling a bit manipulated by George Martin - is he EVER going to finish this series and tie up all the story lines?
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|The tracks with Pharrell are super fun and make you want to dance. The others... meh. Not as appealing as older DP.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled's writing just keeps getting better and better - this is is one of those novels I didn't want to leave - the story, the images; everything is beautifully done.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|I am a loyal nin fan and now a loyal HTDA fan. Both bands turn out thoughtful, interesting music with a unique vision. Mariqueen's voice is beautiful. I can't wait to hear them live.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|this was an ok book to read and i did finish the series. however, it was somehow written a bit simplistically, with a lot of repetitive paragraphs and could have definitely used some humor to lighten the otherwise sometimes dull read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will keep you thinking and guessing on how to solve the puzzle and get out of the game.
B0064W67IM|4.0|One of the few authors around today that can spin a yarn that is so steeped in the imagination. Reading this was like taking a pure shot of Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine.
B000I55YV2|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  One of my favorite parts is &#34;here come the minis&#34;.  You will have to watch it to see.
193700788X|3.0|Well, it's over. This was a fast read for me. It took a day and a half for me to read it. I tend to read Charlaine Harris books fast. I loved this series when it started - it was a guilty pleasure. The last couple of books in the series have really gone downhill in my opinion. I did enjoy this book more than the 4 prior to it. I do not know if the decline in writing i is due to the HBO show True Blood, if Charlaine Harris is just churning out books knowing they will sell, or if my taste and interests have changed. I gave it a 3 due to nostalgia when I first read and loved the series, the fact that it was a fast read and kept my interest. I was happy to see how it did end. I always wanted her and this person to end up together. I also liked the letter Charlaine Harris wrote to her readers- I thought that was classy. I do appreciate that she knew she would not make all of her readers happy with the ending but that she stayed true to her vision of the character and the book
B005HSL626|1.0|The game itself is a lot of fun but this particular version slowed down my Kindle very badly and I had to get rid of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very good. It makes you think. Some levels are easier than others and so far I'm up to level. Needed to rate the game to enable me to get the next level.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and its message. I recommend viewing it at least once. The cast is mainly a list and they all do wonderful jobs bringing believability to thier multiple roles in multiple situations. My only problem is the climax scenes where things become slightly jumpy. Though the directors of the Matrix movies loom large over this tale given thier past record. This is one of thier better movies. It not overly preach in plot, and despite the multiple stories seemingly being disjointed from one another, the plot eventually focuses on a singular theme between each tail.<br /><br />My only reason I think it will be misunderstood is because most expectations will center around the directors' past movies. Most of which are anime and comic adaptations. But this film is really much like thier first movies before much of that. More in the thinking genre with strong character visuals and layered ploting.<br /><br />Overall I recommend seeing the movie at least once.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Excellent suspenseful thriller that kept me reading into the wee hours of the night!  The characters are interesting, and in the end, not exactly who you think they are.  Good and bad, pure right and pure wrong, the author sets these concepts upside down;  we, the readers, are as confused and bewildered as the protagonist as old secrets and new truths are revealed and then assimilated into the storyline.  I never guessed the ending, but the author pulled all the loose ends together with panache, and gave a great read that still lingers long after the last words are read.  I highly recommend this book!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was different from anything I've ever read. It kept my interest and didn't want to stop reading. The guys point of view was a lot of fun!
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I started watching the season and was not impressed with the lackluster performances of three of the main characters.  As the season progressed, though, I was just as engrossed with the series as I had been with the previous seven seasons.  I am so glad I didn't stop watching and finished out my &#34;24&#34; experience.  One of the greatest series of all time!!!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|So much fun to figure out how to solve the puzzles!  Not just a mindless game with no thinking or skill involved!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Although Ken Follett has been around for decades, I've only recently discovered his work.  Book One of this triology caught me from the get-go.  The interlaced stories and characters are what prompted me to read Book Two as well.  It's wonderful when you can learn something while being entertained.<br />Follett's books are sweeping and at times overwhelming.  In all honesty I found I could glance over certain paragraphs or pages and not miss much.  Also, I'm glad I downloaded them to my Kindle so as not to carry around such huge books!<br />This particular genre that he writes, the historical fictions, remind me of James Michener's works.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|All ads immediately disappeared.  Facebook runs fine. So far, anyway, there's no change in the way it runs,  Thanks Adblock plus.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|amazing but gets boring after a while ok love the daily mystery box and New character every 4 weeks but wish they were cheaper
