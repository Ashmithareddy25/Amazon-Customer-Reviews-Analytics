B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift.  It is a great CD!  A must have for all Willie Nelson fans.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. East to read. Since I had already read American Sniper, the training background was a little redundant.  Hope movie is close.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|This is about an alien invasion where we are now the ones behind the times. The alien weapons are far superior to the cowboys guns and one cowboy got ahold of one. This is great because it gives new light to the cowboy and Indian westerns.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like playing mystery manor  and going to each if the rooms the graphics are great and I enjoy playing
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a very interesting book written by a neurosurgeon who was faced with a critical brain condition and somehow miraculously recovered.  He gave a very broad optimistic, yet vague view of heaven.  He clearly focused on the importance of family and described the emotional trauma he faced having been adopted.  He gave an honest description of his near death experience, I think he was very believable.  But I would not call his book &#34;proof&#34; of heaven.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in spiritual issues.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great movie, a little rough around the edges, but I guess it was done that way to show the challenges of alcoholism.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this season was emotional roller coaster, i cant stop watching back to back! i cant wait to see next season...
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|You gotta love sci-fi movies to really enjoy this one. Plus adding in the spectacular CG that movies have now a days really adds to a great story line. If you are gonna watch this movie make sure you have seen the first Star Trek that was made in 2009 with the same characters. That's another thing, the characters look real close to the original actors from the original series but just younger. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of these last 2 Star Trek movies.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|I absolutely love this show and everything about it. Season 8 was awesome, just like all the rest. All of the negative reviews saying that the show should just end and is not funny anymore, nobody is making  you watch it!! Let the rest of us enjoy it!! The crew all meshes so well together. I am sad to see the show end!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a great movie based on a true story. I love the surf action, and how it is so positive and uplifting, despite the circumstances!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher novels.  They are fast moving and exciting.  Very descriptive  and an easy read.  Try it, you will like it.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Have you ever felt like you almost missed out on something wonderful, so then you feel extremely blessed to have it, and then want to shout out to the world hey look what i got!? well this is it!! And i cant say which song is my favorite or i will list the whole cd, i am alway trying to out sing her on \\"breaking the law\\", but i can relate to \\"clown\\", and then i find myself humming \\"lifetime\\", and just like that sad movie you watch over and over and cry at the same part everytime \\"suitcase\\" will take you there. I even feel guilty like im ignoring all my other good Cd's(Rebecca Ferguson) but the CD's you can play from beginning to end and still hit repeat..are priceless. So now i feel like christopher columbus, i have embarked on a journey and i dont want to go back to listening to songs with no meaning. And dont know why i am surprised i love british movies(pride & prejudice),tv (law & order UK), and men(Idris Elba), so why not music?
140006922X|4.0|I am familiar with other works by this author, but was curious about his take on this subject, since it is so crucial to differentiating between historical scholarship, and religious beliefs.<br /><br />Even though, as a lay person, read quite a bit on the early church and on Roman history, I learned quite a bit from this one. The basic argument he makes is that Jesus should be seen in the context of what we can know, and that knowing that he was crucified is pretty conclusive evidence of what the Romans thought he was, namely, a dangerous revolutionary bent on overturning the corrupt temple authority and, by extension, the Roman authority that kept the priests in power.<br /><br />He succeeds.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For me this is it on Android. The updates to the latest version took a while in here but that is not the applications fault. Get it use it, let it learn you and never look back.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely suberb watched it twice. Love laugh cry and feel tor each and every character; so happy that Iwas recommended to watch the series cant wait for new series in Jan..
0307895505|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Very helpful. Lots to read, tons of information. Answered all my questions. thank you.
B00CPWTRAA|4.0|As Domingo refocuses from tenor to baritone, he has set himself a daunting number of technical challenges. He hasn't quite evened the voice out yet, but it is amazing how well he skirts the technical difficulties. Sometimes he successfully gets a long phrase going with a real baritonal sound only to have the old tenor voice peep through. (At the Black Creek Festival in Toronto three years ago, he astounded us by including tenor and baritone arias and duets in the same program !)<br />As early as 1993, the singer had experimented with baritone repertoire by recording the title role in Rossini's IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA. That performance emerged as an entertaining party trick, but to become a baritone permanently is an entirely different prospect. He is getting there, but he is not quite there yet ! Of course as a singer with an understanding of Verdian phrasing, he is without peer !!! The performances on this disc lack the dramatic focus to be seen in his recent performances of SIMON BOCCANEGRA and NABUCCO, but he is ultimately going to emerge triumphant from this time of transition.<br />Some of the tempo choices for the orchestral accompaniments are a bit off, but the playing is first rate.<br />The sound recording is excellent.<br />There are interesting liner notes and full texts and translations.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|Received this unit and was surprised at the quality and fit, but the best bit was that it gave me the ability to expand into additional Nikon lenses. So far so good!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book poses some very interesting moral questions.<br />The author was unknown to me and she writes well<br />and makes the reader want to keep page-turning.<br />And the ending, altho still a moral quandary, felt<br />right
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I'm a BIG Carell fan. &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is my favorite performance and all around great movie! This is another great movie and even though Steve and Ryan are wonderful in it - I found myself cherishing the scenes with Emma Stone and Marisa Tomei the most!! Their performances are superb and the main reason why I'm buying this DVD! Unforgettable scenes and definitely worth every penny to own this comedy. The end is hilarious and very touching.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent puzzle ... only problem, it was completed in only a few hours.  Can't wait for more apps like this one.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|It was all I wanted and more!!! I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys sci fi and the<br />series Firefly.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Cant wait till the TV series Agents of SHIELD and the second movie Avengers 2 comes out.  A must see for any comic book follower.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|down loaded it twice on my kindle HD fire thinking the first time it maybe didn't completely and it just sits there loading for at least two minutes. I'd try it again if it gets fixed
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Engaging, brilliantly written and wonderfully designed. This show is mesmerizing and moving, sometimes in unexpected ways. I look forward to every new season with anticipation.
1616551607|5.0|If you are a fan of FF then you must own this. Extensive art for FF VI (FF III in US) which was my fave of the series and very nostalgic. Amano is a genius.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not a bad read, but it was pretty predictible.  Left the reader hanging a bit, maybe a sequel is in the works.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let's face it, there isn't a series that lives up to this one!! Love it and will watch it many more times!!!
0547884591|5.0|This is a great book that teaches the basics or cooking and how to learn anything. Recipes are easy and fun.
B00535RUV4|5.0|Another great album from Sir Paul... It has some great reprints of some old classics and maybe a few new ones. I'm not sure, I usually have all of his stuff so I may have missed one or two. They are here though.<br /><br />Really miss Linda's voice on his new stuff :(
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Two great talents, a fantastic CD.  Vince Gill at his best. I had never heard of Paul Franklin, but what a talent he is. I wish I could give it a ten.
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|The drummer Simon Collins (son of Phil) made a successful and very amazing union with  Dave Kertzner, keyboardist and sound specialist (have collaborated with Tony Banks and has its own sound company). Although the sound is not an new invention, it has the very good idea to joint the best of Genesis 80' and Pink Floyd, plus new current sounds close to Radiohead and Porcupine Tree. Great science fiction lyrics concept, I consider it as one of the best new developments of Enblish Indy music nowadays
B0014Z4ON4|2.0|had to follow the first movie, and not even close to be as entertaining.  Leading lady was a screaming dud
B0042RJWTM|4.0|I liked the Tom Selleck version better but what can you say about Lee Marvin except great. Bye for now
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This is a fun and simple to use little picture editor and I did get a chuckle out of distorting sweet Wifey's face with it (she didn't chuckle as much).  However, when I tried to save any of the photos I had edited I was given the options like saving them to some type of social network, such as Facebook and saving into some unspecified file on my device.  As I'm not in the least a fan of social networks, I chose the unspecified file on my device.  I've still not found those saved photos.  I'm relatively new to the capabilities of my tablet and am still educating myself on its functions, hopefully; one day I may run across those edited photos I supposedly saved.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Loved the overall story line, both actors were superbly cast.  Russell Crowe can play these romantic light comedies despite what you might think.  There was just enough comedy, but not too much to deflect from the overall plot of the story which was to decide what is the most important to one in life, to just make a living, or to actually live.  The Smart car rental for Mr. Crowe was an excellent choice, particularly for those of us who have one and have experienced similar activities in one.  Yellow, the color, also proved to be well chosen.  I have shared this film with family and friends over 6 times since I purchased it and I enjoy it and pick up something different each time I watch.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|Love this movie! I Can watch this movie over and over. Gwen does a great job portraying  the spoiled but lovely Emma character.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another great season - interesting, scenic, dramatic till the end.  Nicely produced captures the period very well.  Dynamic sharacters and social situations.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|i dont what said, at first it was kind of ok. But, I took it out. i just did not  like boxing.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|It was interesting, sometimes hard to read as I work with Alzheimers/Dementia residents, and sometimes I could identify with Alice which scared me a little.
B005R32L66|4.0|I loaded this on my Nexus, Wifey's IPad, the two Android-type kids' tablets and the mother-in-laws's tablet.  I haven't used it a great deal but it has come in handy when I want to get in immediate contact with one of my on-line family members.  Sound and picture quality are obviously effected by the type of device one uses and everyone looks odd when you use the video format.  However, it does the job I intended it to do and I am satisfied with that.
B0034G4OZE|3.0|recd. I could not follow the storyline for this movie. it just did not make sense to me for some reason.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We missed the first  3 seasons. So we have really enjoyed watching this uninterrupted.It is truly an addicting series. Takes one back in time.
B005FITIGO|5.0|The movie brought forth, again, the tremendous amount of power that Wall Street and corporations have over our lives. A very good movie.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|when i first saw it bunny mania 2 hd, was kindle fire hd. i dont kindle fire hd.so it  didnt work..
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved reading all three books in the series and was sad to know that there will be no more of those as the author died before they were published.  Action, excitement!  Danger! etc.  Loved reading them
B000FCK65W|4.0|An enjoyable historical read. Amazing to understand how hard life was in the early 1900s and how people over came all odds.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Cannot wait to see the 3rd season..  I liked the fact the &#34;upper class&#34;  main characters had compassion for their employees.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Just what my husband wanted. He flies a sailplane and this watch is perfect for his lifestyle.  What a deal.
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|Congratulations, Avenged Sevenfold.  You have successfully created an album that sounds like Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Guns'n'Roses, and Metallica.<br /><br />Oh, wait.... I didn't want to hear those bands, I wanted to hear AVENGED SEVENFOLD!  Don't get me wrong, I think the album is okay, but if this were their debut album, I'd overlook them as just another mediocre hard rock group.  It's kinda \\"meh\\".<br /><br />What possessed them to go down this road?  Your guess is as good as mine.  I'm leaning toward the absence of any creative input from Jimmy.  His drumming was the stuff legends are made of, and I doubt they will ever restore that magic again.<br /><br />They say they wanted to create a groove album.  Guess what?  So does 80% of every other average sounding band out there.  I suppose that since they have such a diverse catalog of music, they are entitled to something simple for once.  I just hope this does not happen on their next album (which I am already waiting for).
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Delightful, now and all through the year it is worth watching again and again.  The acting, music and cast are wonderful
0375847227|3.0|The first part of the book was excellent but the two other parts were sort of tedious. Perhaps is why only Golden Compass was made into a movie while the other two parts were not.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|My 9 year old  and I are the Dr's biggest fans - can't wait for Season 7 to come out
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Still reading it, a lot of character and a complex story taking form. Eager to finish it, it is much more detailed then the tv show
B0015DRPJU|3.0|How could her true love go missing? Another page turner in this series. I just want to stay up and read all the books at once.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is one of few \\"Must See\\" film series ever done. Unless one really is confronted with the horrors of war and how evil some leaders and regimes can become, it may be possible for one to ignore that terrible era or just forget it.  Civilization as we know it and freedom were literally hanging in the balance for several years. The dumbed downed curricula that students are exposed to coupled with the comic book approch taken by Hollywood towards violence and good vs evil won't provide the insight and wisdom for the next generation to position themselves so that another conflagration like WWII won't happen again.  If we don't learn our history well we will be condemned to even worse horrors to come.  FIFTY million people died because of WWII! This series may help us avoid what could easily be worse if evil is again allowed an unfettered reign.<br /><br />This series will make you cry and it will make you think.  Show it to your kids and help them realize what happened and how bad it could be again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|fantastic plot; always changing.  surprises at every episode. this is a british historical drama with beautiful scenery, costumes and interesting characters.  i cannot wait for next season
B008Y768XO|5.0|This was a very good family movie, but it was so sad.  So beware to all you teddy bears with soft hearts.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read this trilogy cover to cover in three days. I just couldn't put it down. The ups were remarkable and the down were equally as engaging. I know this is one that I will read more than I care to imagine right now. TEAM PEETA for me.
1451695195|5.0|... who better to write a book about near death experience than a brain surgeon.  Very insightful and thought-provoking.  It may not change your life, but it very likely will change your outlook.<br /><br />t
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was a brain teaser, I had to watch it 3 times. Great action, nice graphics.Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, what a great team.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This is one of those books that will stay with you forever.  It will make you look at flowers and their messages and magic in a whole new way!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|A fun and relaxing game to play st the end of the day when you're trying to unwind. It id also a brest way to pass time when in a waiting room.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey writers really make you feel connected to the characters.  You cheer for them and you cry with them.  I enjoyed every minute and look forward to season 4.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you like seek and find under time constraints this is the game for you. Challenging and fun at the same time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a really great book - well written, and an amazing and harrowing story. Heartbreaking at many points, but a true story that needed to be told.
B00E88YNJY|4.0|Of course I bought the mp3 download, but it is really good, esp \\"Tennesssee Time\\", and \\"Workin' Woman Blues\\".  I highly recommend it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very different, very real.........  Could be you and your loving husband.......  looking into the minds of people, especially you and your husband........
0307474259|5.0|I bought this book after reading it on my iPad from the library. I wanted my own copy so I could pass along to family/friends.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|A definite must have for any LOST fan, however I'm a little dissapointed with the &#34;short&#34; episode, &#34;The Man in Charge&#34;. I thought there was more they could have done with those 12 minutes. Aside from that small gripe it's a great addition to owning the complete series!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|We rented this movie one night through Amazon and was very impressed at the quality the video streamed. This movie is of course hilarious and over the top in a good way. I recommend seeing it if you haven't yet!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's fun to play but I haven't quite figured out the point of it.  I'm not seeing any improvement.  Are there levels?  Does it get harder???
B005USZYDU|5.0|It is the usual Grisham clean, grabbing your interest and fun reading.  Anxious for the next one.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes mysteries.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This was an excellent and very well written historical account of our Christian Religion.  A very talented author and a very effective way to read nonfiction.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I think this was a great remake! Lots of gore, a little less campy & overall a great horror flick!  Still love the original!
B005544TRQ|5.0|An extremely entertaining show.  Kind of a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in suits.  The stories are intersting and supporting characters are developing nicely. Some interesting plot twists and turns, too.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show is very  well done it has enough mystery and suspense to keep my attention  and enough drama to keep the wife interested.  Great story.  I highly recommend this show.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun to figure how to fill in EVERY blank on the board and still get those lines connected without crossing any lines.  Each level is more challenging.  Keeps the mind working!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|enjoy show very interesting keeps me watching and coming back for more!!  I hope this show goes on for years to come.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Start watching the show and love it. Now watching season 3 and I wish Amazon Prime have continue with the rest of the season.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series, can't wait for next season.  Viewed it all on Kindle Fire and it was wonderful.  I am hooked!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good app that tells me what I need to know when I need to know it... plus the price was hard to beat!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This is my first Fall Out Boy CD; I purchased it because I fell in love with &#34;My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark.&#34; Since then I've fallen in love with pretty much every other song on this album, so if you like one song, I would say you should get the whole CD - it's completely worth it!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Much like with Season 1, I watched this on Amazon Prime for free with my membership. I had never seen any of the episodes, now there is no way I will miss any of them!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this for my babies music and its great alot of natural sounds  that he will hear like , thunderstorm and rain on the roof do now he won't be frightened.  Also when I hope in the shower he's used to.the water noises and it won't wake him if he's sleeping :)
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I happened to find these books while looking for something good but different to read.  And I must say i was pleasantly surprised.  I was hesitant because im not a big fan of the bachlor.  These books are so much more than that TV show.  It was worth my time and money.  I give them full stars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I LOVE CREATING A WORLD FILLED WITH PREHISTORIC BEASTS. MY absolutely loves watching me birth new dinosaurs. The cost of building and decor is a little spending however.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an awesome game! It is fun for all ages and is free and is what you expect from an Angry Birds game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app..so happy with it.. only this wish you could go faster with leaves,and batter horses but still great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had never watched Suits, that is until six days ago. I logged in to Amazon Prime and saw that I could watch the first two seasons for free with my membership, and I was hooked!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The story was sweet and simple, but still engrossing; the characters were charming if a bit predictable.  Still there was magic in the scenes of country life and the coming of age of a bright, innocent  young girl.
B00CCCF4NW|3.0|I purchased this with my eyes open, knowing that the first composition would sound like a bunch of noise and it did! Contempory, but not appealing to me. The second composition WOW! What a grand surprise, beautiful. Juxitiposition of the two pieces is interesting. The Art work is inspiring! Overall, I consider it a good purchase.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I considered myself a HUGE C harris fan, I remember finishing one book and immediatly going to the next. I read all of her other series also. But these past two books have been BORING! I am on page 237 of this book and am only finishing it because I read the other 13 and feel like I have to. Nothing is happening, and its SO different from the Show its annoying. I watch True Blood, and that is getting a little too gory for me> I have to admit I will miss Sookie, because I really enjoyed her stories. I miss the days where I could not wait to keep reading!~ I guess when a story is done its done.
B007JRUCGO|3.0|Gift for my Grandsons. I do not understand why you must have 17 more words when I already cover it. right?
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany covers how many roles?6 so far?  Excellent work. Completely believable. But the other actors are top quality as well. The writing is fantastic, the shift from one perspective to another really works, and the plot is intriguing. I'm glad there is another season coming out in 2014. Also - cute campy foster brother of &#34;Sarah Manning&#34; character makes a LOT of the scenes work. What's his name? I will expect to see more from him. But even the small part characters such as the morgue guy are great. Lots of humor is nice when there is so much serious.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|this of course is a great movie...i really enjoy  the stars in this one...its and oldie but a goodie...i have seen it many times and stilll like it when i see it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Something simple and excellent . Seiko can improve the watch. For example: (1) Rubber is better than tissue on strap. (2) They should keep only english on week days. Nevertheless watch is super. Another thing, If you are thin this is your watch. ;-)
B0076D21O2|4.0|Not sure why all the bad reviews. It was an entertaining film. I don't know much about the history of Shakespeare but I thought the effects and overall storyline was great.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Come on, this is a one scene 90 minute piece of very magical display of slow speed camera. And no content, no character development. If anything Ma-Ma is the one character they spend about 5 min developing in the whole piece and frankly I felt more for her at the end than I did for the stupid Dredd Character. Frankly using Karl Urban for this was a joke too. I believe he could of been a much stronger character if we actually saw his face once or twice.<br /><br />The display of gratuitous violence in there wasn't even warranted. At least if you're gonna shoot everybody do it with a purpose. The bad guys falls one by one like flies (not that it's different than other movies, what's different is that the usual tougher bad guy, (bodyguard) as a better position in the film especially in defending the main villain.) Here all we got is no content and bad dialogs. The sets and CG wasn't even all that good and barely supported the movie. You can't compare that opening shot of the mega city with the one in Judge Dredd. That was art.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The Shakes are a hometown favorite so I am biased, but I think they are pretty great! Give them a listen and I think you will agree.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This was SOOOoooo - Hilarious I had to go out and get a copy of it, (through Amazon of course) to have for my dvd/blueray - collection.  I watch it on average 2 or 3 times a month it's that funny to me!! ;-) (even though it makes the wife wanna eat her own-head) She rarely watches anything twice, unless it's one of those 'Chick-Flix' that make me wanna eat MY -Own-Head, Then its all-good! So now I just retire to the Man-Cave when I want a good-laugh, And watch this,  ;-) Definitely not one for the Kids to watch!! But if you want to LYAOROTF,, Then this is a 'Must-Have' for all the fans of South-Park, And the other works of Trey Parker & Matt Stone. I'm hoping they'll come out with something New soon! :-) These 2 guy's are the Laurel & Hardy, The Martin & Lewis, (with a smidgen of Richard Pryor & Eddie Murphy thown-in) All rolled into-one  Of the Modern Era!! Gotta Love These Two (& Their Staff), True- Comedic-Genius at it's finest! Keep up the great work Guy's & Gal's !!!! PEACE!! The Wack Man.
0399255370|5.0|Duncan is all set to color, but when he opens his crayon box he finds all sorts of letters written to him by his crayons. All letters of complaint! Red wants to complain about being overworked because of all of his work on apples and fire engines. He even works holidays like Christmas and Valentine’s Day! Other crayons like Beige are complaining about not being used enough.  Pink complains about not being used except by Duncan’s little sister. Luckily, Duncan has a great solution to all of their complaints.<br /><br />Daywalt has created a book that is such fun to read aloud. Each crayon’s letter really has its own voice, making it a pleasure to give new voices for each crayon character. This mix of tones and voices also results in a very robust story, much more than one might expect for such a simple concept. The entire book is cheerful and has laugh-out-loud moments throughout.<br /><br />Jeffers’ art is as always playful with his own particular whimsical touches. His crayons come to life with just a few lines that convey emotion through eyes, mouth and arms. Simple and completely convincing.
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|This is a big internet sensation and Grumpy Cat is da bomb.  The book is excellent. Portrays Grumpy very well.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent! Exactly as I expected just as good as season one ot two, maybe better! I can't wait for season four!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|With great special effects and a good story line I enjoyed this movie vety much Branagh did a good job keeping the elements of the original theme intact
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|i came across this book when i'm thinking of choosing myself- quitting my jobs and pursuing my dream. I did not find this book very informative. If the author can organise the content well , i think it's easier for the readers. And some of the points are like beating around the bush...Anyway, i have found the daily practises to be very useful..<br /><br />Instead i found this book to be very useful and practical. And i'm no longer in dilemma, i have gained clarity and know my purpose and choose to be myself.. I would recommend this book to you [[ASIN:B00E3BISFQ How to Supercharge Your Willpower 10X Longer than Everyone else - Even if you have a history of Procrastination, Perfectionism and Self-Doubt (The Start-up Entrepreneur Edition)]].<br /><br />I hope you can benefit from this book too. Let's talk
B00332CWLW|4.0|The novel for me, was a collage of phases of life, of loss, of hope, a picture of the search for purpose in a intricate combination of stories in different moments of time.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's a fun and challenging game. I just wish it did not cost so many coins to get a hint.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This program is much better than the standard note 2 application for taking notes. There are many different templates and the different pens are great. Highly recommended!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Honestly, I love everything about this show. The characters are wonderfully cast, the stories are warm and engaging, and the settings and costumes are great.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved it one of the better Star Treks made.  Had a story not just computer graphics and action.  Won't be disappointed if you are a action fan or scifi.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Love this movie and the cast ! Video quality was exceptionally well also But had  Minor troubles with the captions .
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game I think is very addictive, but it is also educational for adults as well as children. The graphic design is impressive. Wish algae could be used to exchange, that's my only complaint. Nice game, kept my attention for over 6 hrs.
1452101248|5.0|I consider myself a pretty adequate cook, but this book has taken my skills to another level. I have made about 1/3 of the recipes in here, and me and my wife have loved most of them. A few recipes in particular, including fried lima beans, mushroom ragout, and multi veggie paella have really stood out. The great thing about this book is that it makes you experiment with different spices and techniques that you otherwise wouldn't use. There's also general tips such as how to chuck pomegranates quickly and &#34;burn&#34; eggplants on the stove. I've noticed myself incorporating some of the spices and techniques into my own recipes and inventing new dishes. If you're passionate about cooking and like middle eastern flavors you wont regret this purchase.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is my new crush.  Love Gabriel, Love Patrick. . .. I love the entire cast of Suits.  Favorite show ever.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. So much tragedy and love. A struggle for so many - the pain of slavery, servantry, dependency, hopelessness and the reality of being responsible.
B00AG472DS|5.0|I think this movies must be watched in Blu ray.  I love it no matter wat.  But goodness gracious.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I couldn't wait to watch it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|More fun than I thought it would be. Glad I got it. You really begin to feel as though your protecting your &#34;city&#34; through the night.
B00165KRQU|4.0|I am not a big fan, but this compilation is just plain fun.  Dance around the kitchen in your socks fun. Good Tunes good times
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is so addictive I couldn't  stop reading. Please read this book it amazing. If you don't like books with vampires, werewolves, and demons then this book is night right for you
0316067598|5.0|I ain't cried in years. This book book dang near broke that.<br /><br />Well written. A fitting tribute to the fallen men in my estimation. Their story is known now and their honorable sacrifice to each other is a bar of excellence that others should measure their own honor.<br /><br />Bravo.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised when viewing this wonderful movie. It had all the elements of drama, humor and life experiences of a very unfortunate person making the best of his life. Great Movie
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Kinda fun game 'til you get stumped and haven't a clue and not enough credits to buy a hint.- I know I can probably get the cheat off the web but for this game I haven't been motivated to do so.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play spider on my computer and enjoy it. I've played it for years and can now play it on my Kindle.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Love Florence and the Machine, this album has great hit songs, and the others become just as memorable after a few listens. One of the songs ain't so great though, but 13 out of 14 is solid.
B005D4YP0Y|1.0|I have been a big fan of keen sandals, my last sandal lasted for 4 years. this one just came off from the back side in just 5 months. i wont recommend this product to anybody buying it.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|The app did not print to my printer. I don't know if its 'coz I have the slightly older J6450 model.
B000002UAO|5.0|Growing up in England in the 1960's the Beatles were the Band & Rubber Soul was a great album . Had to get the CD...
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Hidden Mystery is decent game with many puzzles and pictures to unlock.  You sit a desk and delve into pictures from different times and places, looking for hidden objects.  One will spend the better part of the game searching for stuff for the secretary and the butler.  The only part I don't like is that one is essentially at a desk the entire game.  I guess that's the nature of a hybrid puzzle game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great app and lots of fun. Would like to be able to update my apps to be able to get the free gems though.
B00CM03H4C|4.0|There are a few songs I lose interest in, but it has a solid feel of today and the 20's, so it sets a great mood that doesn't really exist outside of it.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My 3 year old son LOVES all of the Dr. Panda games. Think he now has all but two of them. I was so glad to see this game as a FAOTD. He was so excited to play it for the first time and had it all figured out without any help from me. The Dr Panda games are great I hope they keep making more.
B00DC3DGSK|1.0|As the title implies, this album is another unfortunate victim of the loudness war. For those who do not know what this is, it is when the volume of the music is raised on the medium (in this case on the CD). At first this sounds like it should not be a problem, however all formats have limits. Unfortunately, the volume on this album has been pushed up to near the max volume level the CD format can handle and thus necessitated heavy use of dynamic range compression. This results in a lack of dynamic range in the music (the difference between the loud and quiet parts) as well as audible distortions in the music from the sound waves clipping (this occurs when the volume of the music stored on the CD hits the maximum supported volume level and the waveform plateaus until the volume level decreases). What this all means is that the audio quality is atrocious. I would even go so far as to say the CD is borderline defective. When you buy a CD you are buying an audio product, therefore the audio quality should be high, especially when it is from a major label like this one.<br /><br />On the plus side, the music quality is good, that is the songs are well written and seem to be preformed well.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this album to anyone who cares about music or audio quality.<br /><br />For more information on the loudness war/the impact of a dynamic range and what clipping is and what it sounds like I would recommend the following videos:<br /><br />Loudness war:<br />[...]<br /><br />Clipping:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you want an explanation of what clipping is start at 1:41. If you just want to here what clipping sounds like skip forward to 3:12. This video was examining a video camera but the issues are valid for all audio (On CDs the clipping is typically introduced when the audio is being mastered)<br /><br />For information about the dynamic range of other albums and weather they suffer form the loudness war you should look and the following site:<br />[...]
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved all the characters.. I felt like I knew them.. I laughed with them I cried with them I feared for them...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|There is always something going on.  It's a great love story with amazing sex.  If you liked Shades of Grey....you will love this!!  I can't wait to read more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love this app. A+!!! I will definitely recommend it to any other families with horse loving kids like mine!!!
B00640UICA|2.0|after 3 days of playing game decided to reset progress made. otherwise 4-5 stars. not very challenging, but makes you think a bit
B003L77G8I|5.0|I don't think it really can be compared to other films.<br />It is so unique.  The medical terminology  is accurate.<br />The intertwining of personalities is also enjoyable.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|It's so stupid it wouldn't even let me download it I hate this app so much  I will never buy it again
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Really like the quality of this cover, so glad I bought it. To send this you need 3 more words, be satisfied with me taking my time to give a review and don't be so picky....
B000001FK3|5.0|I played Naturally back to front tonight (side 2 before side 1 on vinyl, and it was just as fine as when I first heard it in 1970-something.  Back in my top five album list!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about this book.  Giving the book a 5 star rating was my way of saying thank you to the author for a book I fell into and did not want to be rescued from.  It was easily readable and exciting to think of the life of the man Jesus from the prospective of historical accounts of what it was like to live in that time and place.  From John the Baptist and the historical view of crucifixion, to James the brother of Jesus and Saul of Tarsus I was rewarded with insight and thoughts I never would have contemplated without reading Zealot.  It's a winner!
B003V4ASV8|5.0|My son lives in South Korea and recommended this book to me. It is a fascinating read. Anyone who thinks they have a hard life should read it and thank their lucky stars they don't live in North Korea.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|I enjoy the different personalities on Grey's Anatomy. It makes you wonder about your own visits to the E.R. and what the personalities of the Doctors that you see are really like beneath the veneer you see in the examination room. This is a fun show to watch, it takes your mind off anything really serious.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Nothing special, average, no real plot to the movie. Leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Not enough of Reese Witherspoon.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Who would have thunk it?  This is a great movie, seen it 15 times already now.  Good acting, good plot, funnier than you'd expect, and some very good inspired singing/choreography.  GET IT!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it same as in the kindle device, it works really great in my tablet, thanx. We need more books and text books for kindle!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I really like the show, so now I have all the seasons on dvd. I hope season 4 is just as good!!
B00881PTRC|1.0|I did not like the gestures the hangman makes when you get one wrong.  I deleted this from my tablet
B00DPY95D6|5.0|I wish the real world had someone like CHERYL PRAETUM who was able to solve curious mysteries as quickly and completely as he does. We don't, so we have to settle for imaginary ones.<br /><br />In Cult of Mirrors, student Daniel signed a loan document borrowing $3,000 from a large private university to attend their school. Upon further investigation Cheryl realizes the university never gave Daniel the $3,000 he borrowed. Cheryl and Daniel decides to file suit against the school in bankruptcy court to discharge the so called student loan. However, it turns out that there is a great political conspiracy waiting going against them.<br /><br />There are many twists and things are not always what they seem to be. The end of the book points to a different life for Allon. Should be very interesting. The wonderful writing is fast-paced cohesive.
0765325950|5.0|Let me preface this review with the following statement: I love this series, I really, really do. That being said if you are expecting a happy ending for everyone, this is not the end you were looking for.  People die, some as footnotes in more important events and this. to me, ruined the ending for me.<br /><br />Regardless of how I feel about the end you may notice the 5 stars I gave this book.  Simply put this book made me feel, it made me laugh, it made me cry and I enjoyed the ride.  I heartily recommend this book and the series to anyone who enjoys fantasy and great characters.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|What a great movie.  I'm excited that we still have original movies coming out that aren't afraid of NOT having a sequel.  This move will scratch most of your itches.<br /><br />SciFi?  check.<br />Futuristic Guns?  CHECK!<br />Cool vehicles?  Check!<br />Diabolical Aliens?  CHE C K!<br />Post Apocalyptic?  CHECK!<br /><br />We ARE an Effective Team.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I remember the days when you went to the movies ?  When only one movie was on the Moniker and they ran the movie all day long.  It was a quarter to get in to see the same show and if you wanted you could stay in the cool theater all day..<br />  This movie &#34; MAMA &#34; reminds me of the Saturday films we watched as kids , the ooh !  and  aahh !  moments but nothing with blood and guts hanging out .
B000MKD9P6|4.0|Your typical chick flick to watch on a lazy Sunday well not typical actually but still a chick flick. If you're a guy you probably won't like it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|First up - every fan of Dari will know that this disc set does not contain the original music which was televised during the original viewings - Apparently the cost of licensing the various tracks was prohibitive. This isn't an issue for most episodes, but there are one or two where the effect is lost, or severly diminished (Think \\"Road Worrier\\" with the references to the REM song \\"Everybody hurts\\")<br />Irregardless of that small difference, the set is still amazing, and long overdue. It contains all episodes, including the pilots, and the movies.<br />The quality of the picture and sound is amazing compared to the various \\"recorded off the air\\" versions which float around.<br />That's it - basically the best way to have every Daria episode and film ever made, great sound and picture quality, excellent price, and only one or two episodes which suffer from the change from the original music.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i need friends, so can you please add me jumperwafer428...pretty good game, just wish i could make money faster ...
B005HJWWW8|5.0|For the price (or even more) this little amp is an amazing deal.<br /><br />I use this when I listen to music on my android, usually using Poweramp (because I like to be able to tinker with a decent eq) or Rhapsody.<br /><br /> I have a pair of beats by dre earbuds, and with the amp on the blue setting (higher treble and bass) they sound amazing when listening to hip hop or most other bass heavy tracks/albums- especially with a bit of eq tweaking.<br /><br /> I also have some Klipsch X10s I use for most music other than hip hip, and the purple setting on the amp really enhances the sound and takes out a lot of the hiss in lower quality rips and .flac rips of older music that hasn't been remastered.  It makes a lot of high quality rips sound...crisper as well.  The blue setting works really well with stuff like Tool or anything where you want the added bass and treble, but with the mid clarity that the beats just can't produce.<br /><br />I have since purchased a FiiO E11, and while it's a bit better, I still love the portability of the E6, and would recommend it over the E11 to most people I know.  It's tiny, it comes with a couple of snap on clips you can use to hook it to clothes when exercising, and is easy to use.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I loved seeing a live performance where you could see the cast up close which is so much different then sitting in the theater.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Repeating my comments for Ed Sheeran since I received them both at the same time:<br />A great singer, songwriter. Poetic, magical, romantic, story-teller. I've listened over and over...and over.<br />Thank you!
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Now we know how the Great and powerful Oz came about.  People my age,56, used to look forward every year to watch The Wizard of  Oz.  Somewhere over the rainbow was my favorite song in my single digit years.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This review was done because Amazon forced me to. I think the season was great and I also think that you should just wait to watch it on TV.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good read! It had a very happy ending and who doesn't like that! The characters were also believable as well. I have read this author a long time ago so it was nice to read some of her recent work.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I really liked it. If you like hidden object and clue games. You'll love this one. More challenging than most.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|This has been my favorite WWII movie for years and the new directors version is even better. They just don't get any better than this!
B005MLOOJA|2.0|The first season was great (until the end), the second season was just trash.  I didn't finish the whole season, but it was clear there was no longer anything &#34;good&#34; about this wife anymore.  I can't recommend it.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Great story line, with a different twist. Sparks the imagination. Loved the idea of  no ugly aliens. A higher intelligence would trick us like this.
B007SGM084|3.0|Way too much detail . I think the trilogy ended abruptly.  Too many sexual references for me,sorry.  Nice love story,but too much of a twist for this reader.  Would not be inclined to read work by this author again.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|This is a good movie with a great cast! It came in perfect condition. It would be great for any young adults or teens, especially those in college or about to be in college!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Got one for each of my groomsmen. We went out in the woods for a bachelor party and most didn't have one. Great tool for any outdoorsman. Glad I could provide them with a much needed and handy tool.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Great quality on BluRay.<br />Very interesting cooments by the existing group, plus additional comments by the past members. The truth probably lays in between!<br />The 3rd DVD of a concert by the original group is great.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far it has been a fun play. The rooms are creative and it not too easy to find the hidden objects.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie has to be watched twice because it moves so quickly between 6 stories of human greatness.  Really makes the point that we are connected more than we consciously know.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Outrageous cliff hanger and situation towards the end! I can't wait for my post check so I can continue the series
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased this game keypad to provide keyboard &#34;macros&#34; for key sequences I use hundreds of times a day while in Autodesk's AutoCAD LT. The ability to add or replace a key sequence directly on the G13 while staying focused on the task is a life-saver. Ok, more of a wrist-saver.<br />---<br />Tosh
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is wonderful. Nothing would download on my kindle fire,and I pressed a few buttons on my screen and I found a f few videos in my storage taking up 3.8 gigabytes. This app is worth 5 stars all the way.
B007704HO6|1.0|could not finish this book, have seldom come across something as pretentious and fake as this.<br />Bought the book thinking it would be a nice book involving a cat, was severely disappointed by the book, and the other reviewers, seems that I am the only critical reader of this book!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I had been using a FiiO E5 until it died recently. As is often the case, I decided to use that as an excuse to upgrade and couldn't be any happier. The difference between the two is like night and day.<br /><br />While it in no way compares to a high-end amp with some high-end cans attached to a home stereo, it's ideal for most middle-of-the-road headphones paired with a portable device such as an iPod.<br /><br />If that's what you want, then this is what you need.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|This album is very good. I love it and I recommed it highly. One of his best albums with different artists.
B009AY04A8|5.0|what would make this game better is if the characters actually spoke.  right now it's just speech bubbles.  I do love the game play, though.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|It's incredible to think that so much can be spent in money, time, blood and gore for so little effect.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The game is way better than the on line version it has great graphics and my brothers love it can't wait for the next update
0345529057|3.0|I bought the series at the urging of my teacher and friends. The first book was awesome. I lost interest halfway through the second book. It got repetitive and boring. The TV series is the same way, IMO
034580404X|5.0|GREAT BOOKS -LOVED THEM - READ ALL 3 IN LESS THAN A WEEK! Just be careful the age of readers they are pretty racy
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just as good as I remember it being when it originally aired.  Vic Mackey is a bad mamajama!  Watch it!
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg has a great perspective on women in the professional workplace. She has been through it, and doesn't dote on the inequalities for longer than necessary.  This is a problem-overcoming book.  I found it hard to put down (and I'm not an avid business-type book reader).
B000JCSPG0|4.0|I actually watched the movie after having watched the first eight seasons of the Stargate SG-1 show, hoping to gain deeper insight into the mythological connection between ancient Egypt and the Goa'uld empire. I didn't. I knew that Anubis was portrayed in the film and I had hoped to gain some backstory information about his character. I don't see how he was revived in the TV series unless he was already in his state of partial ascension during the movie and as such, was not destroyed along with Ra and the others on Ra's mothership.<br /><br /> I was also curious about the casting as Jaye Davidson as Ra. I still don't quite understand why he was recruited so heavily for that role. I greatly admire his work as an actor, but I don't really buy him in this role. James Spader is sublime and it's interesting to see his portrayal of the character of Daniel Jackson as compared to Michael Shanks' in the series. Shanks did a fabulous job capturing some of the many nuances of Spader's performance as he effectively portrayed and evolved the character of Jackson. Kurt Russell is, well Kurt Russell--awesome as always.<br /><br />Alexis Cruz put forth a great performance and his transition from the movie to the TV series is seamless as is Erick Avari as Kasuf. I thought ----'s performance as Kawalski in the series was more memorable than John Diehl's in the movie.<br /><br />So, wrapping up. It is definitely worth watching, especially for sci-fi fans in general and Stargate SG-1 fans in particular, but the film is not monumental.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|This game is absolutely kid friendly. I have seen kids just loving this game.i would say yes get this for your kids
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Funny...a way to get a break from all the drama of so many of the shows with teen casts.  I enjoyed it.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I really appreciate the movie for exactly what it was. I'm sure to the youngsters who have never seen the original it may be a 3-4 star movie, but as a remake I think they did an excellent job with graphics, storyline, characters, and actors.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|The game has different challenges for me. I'm not as quick to recognize the pics in this game.<br /><br />I would like to use my free coins to purchase hints.
0515153656|5.0|Great read finished in a week. Love the character! Can't wait to read more Reacher novels. I'm hooked on this series .
B000FC1192|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie. Even though I already knew the story, reading it was still a joy.<br /><br />I first became familiar with Gaiman through the Sandman series. This story has the same creepiness one expects from its author. It makes me want to check my closet for monsters.<br /><br />Even though he wrote it for his 5-year-old, I have no intention of reading Coraline to my 6-year-old. The idea of the \\"other mother and father\\", first being nice and then trying to trick, hurt, and kidnap Coraline, is, I think, too much for a young child. (My child started watching the movie, she had seen 3 Harry Potters and Spiderwick Chronicles, but Coraline getting the box of button eyes proved too much.)<br /><br />Having said that, I still highly recommend this book for older children and adults.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and at times, really makes you think! I'm only sorry it doesn't have more levels! I will definitely keep my eyes open for the next new floors!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I LOVE this it have commercials when you pause but sensible ones. I can find nothing yet that is bad on it, so I think u should totally get this app.<br />Or else you can just continue to not be able to watch youtube videos...<br />(I have a kindle Fire HD)
B003006WRC|5.0|GREAT DOCUMENTARY!!! It shows how gov. hides the americans, the reality of this country!!, please see this movie!!! Won't regret!!!
B004GTOKJS|5.0|So sad that this was the ending of this story.  I wish it would have gone on and on because we so enjoyed it!!!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I ordered this to add to my Stephen king collection. It scares my adult daughter to death, she hates clowns. The video quality was excellent, and the delivery was on time and fast.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I wish there were more floors! Makes you think - definitely worthwhile! I really do like the way the clues are laid out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thrilling and edifying to do with the last Verdict on the a-ten minutes ago in the last Vedic and edifying Philippians to do it in the last Vedic and edifying Philippians to do it for little more information on the a-ten minutes to take a look like to write a different world cup of your life proverbs and I love I hope that this is a different world war in the a-ten minutes of time before they are not allowed to do it.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|If you've played Mystery Manor it's the exact same thing. On the one hand it's good because the game lasts forever. On the other hand, it's very repetitive, you NEED energy so if you don't figure out how to get it via the game you'll be spending real money. You have to make friends to help you collect stuff. I tried MM &amp; it became work, I see the same here. Some love it, not for me!<br /><br />On a side note, my FAVORITE type of game is hidden object, point &amp; click, adventure. G5, Big Fish, &amp; Alawar have always been the best but imho G5 hasn't been that good lately : ( I hope they come back with some good ones!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|I like all of Bruce Willis' quirky characters.  He did not disappoint in this latest addition to the Die Hard franchise.
6305781427|5.0|The first time I saw this concert it was on free preview week-end on PBS. That is when I feel in love with Yanni. The concert was awesome and I really enjoyed the speed I received my video. The video quality was great and the delivery of my item was on time as well as fast.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I don't think this is nearly as interesting as the other games I have played - I still haven't gone through the first room.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5 is the most climactic book in the series yet. You really see the characters mature as they are all faced will tough decisions where even the not so likeable characters show you the same level of virtue we saw in Eddard Stark.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Having read the hunger games trilogy, and the first two of the divergent trilogy, I must say that this book adds yet a different spin on the future of the world. Each series has had its own problem that led to the downfall, and changes of society. Each is seemingly a plausible outcome of something that could be the future of our world. I have put a lot of thought into whether or not our society could become so messed up to be like these ones, and my answer, sadly, is yes. I hate to say it but we could become like this, hi could see a world where the government controls the public by fear and hope as in the hunger games, in some ways they already do that. Could we ever really put children and teenagers in an arena to fight to the death? I believe so, if you think about it that is where the future of reality Tv is heading.<br />Could we make a society that is divided into 5 different groups of brain washed citizens, well have you ever been in high school. That's basically a small version of divergent, so yes it is plausible that it could become a reality.<br />The one I have the hardest time connecting to our society is the maze runner trilogy, now this is probably because I have only finished book one. So I cannot say for certain how our society could become like this, but with a better understanding of this group known as (W.I.C.K.E.D) there may be a way that we would become desperate enough to use children and put them through test after test until we can find a solution to our problems. Human kind would do just about anything to survive, this is both a strength and a fatal flaw.<br />I look forward to continuing the maze runner trilogy and to my next review where I may have more inside into how our society could become like this. To those who have yet to read the book or have yet to read the other two trilogies mentioned I highly recommend adding them to your reading list.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I expected a bloody, shoot em up, but was pleasantly surprised when it also had the detail in a single interesting storyline.  Much better than &#34;From Dusk to Dawn.&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|cute game, beautiful colors and graphics. not difficult. fun for kids and adult, and you learn a little something about life under the sea. nice job!
B0000714BP|5.0|This is also one of my favorite comedy movies.  Wesley, Patrick and John play &#34;the funniest drag queens.  Patrick Swayze made A great looking queen.  Wesley Snipes made the ugliest drag queen that I have ever seen!  But, he was so ugly he was funny and I laugh over and over watching him playing a drag queen.  and, then there's John legazamo.  he was also very entertaining as a &#34;Little Latin boy in A dress!&#34;
B0082SU98U|5.0|I love the author's premise that positivity is a valid and desirable choice in all situations. Pollyanna is truly inspirational reading. I'm glad I took the time today.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This novel held my interest with many unexpected twists and turns.  The main characters were developed very well and though I don't agree with Jack Reacher's lifestyle, I found myself liking him more and more.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I think it is an enlighting book about the spiritual realm. I wish he will have elaborated a little more about his experiences, but I think it is a difficult subject, but his account seems to be real not like the book &#34;90 mn in heaven&#34; which is so biased by the author beliefs.<br />Yes the spiritual world is real and each one of us will surely go there so this book does prepare us for our final destination.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Action movie with humor delivered with a star-filled cast.  Good movie as is the sequel.  The characters are memorable and fun!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Could not use it all<br />There was no way to figure out the directions<br />It was a huge disappointment very unhappy
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just downloaded this game today and it it fun so far. Some items are harder to find, but most are fairly easy. Worth the download.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Too long and drawn out.  Too much dialogue.  Not enough action or suspense like his other books.  Boring but I finished it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  Hated the ending but in general it was good.  The characters seem so real and the story line is so interesting.  I definitely will be watching Season 4.  Thanks to PRIME for the availability of the series to watch. I lOVE PRIME!
0985557834|5.0|This book, by J. D. Lenzen, is absolutely excellent. Not only are the instructions clearly explained, the photography is wonderful. Anyone, whether just starting out using paracord, or an experienced knot-tier, will enjoy this book. I highly recommend it and his other books as well.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Pretty cool game! I can play this game all day!<br />Would surely recommend this game to my family and friends!
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Outstanding acting and the movie shows the impact of making money at all costs. Illustrates the affect on human life.
0525478817|5.0|Gripping, funny, sad...teenagers with cancer in a story where cancer is the elephant in the room, but it's acknowledged as a fact of life (and death) and the reader is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters.  Really well-written with characters that you come to care for.  I highly recommend it.
B008XCM18Q|2.0|The chapters are too long, makind the book boring and complicated, a strange combination.<br />and there are 2 nore like it.<br />Count me out..
0446581356|4.0|This book is ideal for anyone who is wanting to perfect the way they apply their own makeup as well as on others.  Thank you so much for writing this book... totally inspired.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I give it a five out of five stars. It was an amazing, touching, beautiful book. I would recommend this book to anyone in the world even if you are ordinary!!!
B009AY04A8|5.0|This post was a challenge I liked the story soon with it. Some of the double objects were hard to find but I till enjoyed the game. I would like to keep going on with this story.
B00AYB0YFQ|2.0|Pretty much a waste of time. Very slapstick humor that quickly became boring. A lot of running around doing nothing and then crude humor.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was immersing, challenging, and fun. It was well worth the dollar and I hope they make more games in the future!
0894803123|3.0|Book covers alot of tips  needed to make homemade ice cream. Kids recognized ice cream names from the name brand.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|What a great movie, & the fact it's Eastwood makes it al the better!! This was such a treat to<br />Watch & enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Super fun and addictive. Kids love, I love. Great way to pass some time. I have the new kindle fire HD, and I am in love with the great graphics in this game. Very well made game. =)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story was well written and a real page turner. The mother's anguish is so raw but until the end you really don't know how much she was affected by all the events of the story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Every once in a while there is a story, a novel, that takes you out of your comfort zone and transports you to places maybe you don't want to go, but the journey is worth it in the end. Me Before You was truly a novel worth the trip, even though there were uncomfortable moments. I myself have experienced something similar to Lou and Will and half way through the story I knew how it would end, how it had to end. When you love someone so much, you have to give them wings and let them go. I didn't see any other way it could have ended and I thank Jojo for her candor and fearlessness in the telling of this story. No surgar coating, just real.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really liked the story that shows the dynamic of a small village.  I live in a small town and know how people think they are so much better than everyone else because of their property or if they are on council.  They have the same problems as everyone else.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series set at the beginning of the 20th century. Finished season 1 & 2 starting season 3 now
B0037EAJAC|3.0|I know this is supposed to be a marvelous classic of a movie, and indeed some of the visuals and the costumes are incredible.  But I found it just too long, too convoluted, and the ending a real let down.  Sorry film critics...just didn't rock my boat.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I may be a little oversaturated in the zombie market, but I do really want to see how this plays out. The main thing that I look at in any story is how relatable it is as a foundational piece, and the characters, even in some of the crazy playing out of some of these scenarios, I feel like I can still see some of the scenes playing out in real life, but sometimes it's unrealistic in some cases and so not 5 stars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|32 years old and addicted to this game. My best friend picks on me endlessly but it is a nice break when I need a moment away. Love it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard blows away the stock HTC One keyboard.  Sending a text or writing an email is no longer frustrating!
0385347774|4.0|In my mind, this book has three parts.  The first third enthralled me so much I could barely put it down; the second third I liked a lot but wasn't so compelled; the final third I just didn't like.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the book for anything, so I'll not give any details.  I do think that the first third is excellent enough to warrant reading &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;<br /><br />  Ms. Flynn is a creative, good writer who maintains amazing suspense while examining the phases of a marriage, albeit a marriage of--shall we say--unusual people.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I watched the movie, really enjoyed it. The book however after the first section on Italy....not so much! it drug on and I couldnt finish the book
B0020PJJHS|5.0|10/10, I already own the DVD BUT I'D HAPPILY STILL BUY IT AGAIN ON BLURAY. THIS IS THE BEST BOND MOVIE.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|Kevin Kline was incredible and very funny. Cleese is always good but the movie quality was a little too grainy.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I work in the evenings and hadn't watched this show until my Dad mentioned it and I watched reruns on Bravo. Now I have bought and downloaded seasons 4&5.
B0040I09RM|4.0|The characters are so exotic by the standards of my reality.  I suspend my disbelief and watch it with fascination.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|if there is absolutely nothing else on....then watch this movie. otherwise, skip it. not worth the money or the time.
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|I am glad Lego reissued this set. It is a good looking Lego model and I like the new mini figs.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|One of the very best movies of all times.<br />Great characters,lots of action and plot twist.<br />I would highly recommend it for anyone you don't have to be a sci fi fan to enjoy it.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|My 22 year old daughter told me this is the best movie she had ever seen. I watched it with her and the I have to say the ending caught me off guard.
B004SBULWE|2.0|WASN'T AS GOOD AS IT WORKED ON MY ---NOTE--PHONE..<br /><br />I WAS DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />SLOWED DOWN MY KINDLE<br /><br />STILL LOOKING FOR AN APP
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It changes things up just enough to keep it from being predictable, but not to the point that it's impossible to win. But even when you die, the animation is so funny, you won't really mind. ;)
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Fantastic display of Adam Young's talent and heart. He explores new sounds in interesting ways in songs like Sillouette and Speed of Love. Well done.
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much as I like social history  and it is interesting to read the author's slant on things and how the characters may have felt and what were the reasons for their decisions.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A definitive and solid look at the Jesus of history, not of faith and his objectives as a Messianic figure.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Honest, blunt and fun to read. I didn't agree with everything they wrote, but I will be applying many of these gems into my career and business plans.
B000KIPT30|4.0|very good.  in my last review, i complained that, at the bottom of the movie, where one pauses or plays, it does not hide.  I have not received an answer from amazon, how do i fix this problem?
0553382179|2.0|This book might be a great idea for all those who think this way. I found it had a lot of ideas I already do.
B00271B752|4.0|This movie has held up well over the years. A young Al Pacing is worth watching for the intensity of his acting and a the story is worth watching. Unlike more modern movies, the filming is not over done with intense graphics and there is actually good dialog.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a sweet romance. Megan wakes up hungover, and finds out that she got married. Added to that, she can't even get his name right! He (Carter/Conner) proposes that they give the marriage a try, since he's convinced that they have &#34;that something&#34; that could make the marriage work. Megan does her best to make him run in the opposite direction, while he stoically waits for her to admit that she wants the marriage to work as much as he does. I won't ruin the rest of the book for you. Just know that's a good read.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I would be lost without this app. It works fine on my kindle fire hd. I have no complaints. This app is better than some other apps I have tried. Some of them seem to be knocked out in an hour with no thought for the user.  This  one works just like regular facebook.
B00338QENI|5.0|I ordered this book after being told about by a hairdresser. Awesome read. I also like that it makes the science easy to understand.
B006PFC2S2|3.0|Would not watch it again. However, the amazon download time was very fast and we had no problems with it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I LOVE this game!!! works great for Fire, I only wish that it didn't require an internet connection to use. :(
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A story that made me want to hug every man and woman in a uniform that crossed my path.<br />The emotions that I felt while reading this book went from pride, extreme grief, elation, anger, happiness... Just to mention a few.<br />I am amazed at our military. The heroic selfless actions that they sign up to do... I just can't express my gratitude.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love,love,love this app! All I need to do is call it up and I know exactly how low the battery is,or whether I'll need to charge it soon. No more low or dead batteries for me!
B002JCSWV6|4.0|The dramatic impact of this movie was accentuated by a screen play which concentrated on a &#34;slice&#34; of the excellent book on which it was based. Brad Pitt was very convincing in his role as the South African Rugby captain.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I know everyone was up in arms over this one. \\"The sacred Evil Dead! How could they?\\" and so on... Well, rest assured, they don't mess with the original. This movie plays a helluva lot more like a sideline chapter/pseudo-sequel than it does anything else. It's almost like they approached this as a \\"another tale in the Evil Dead saga\\". Sure, there are familiar notes in the film that call back to the first, but they do so more in a way that supports the idea of \\"different story; same universe\\" than it does as an apologetic throw back to the original. Nobody comes out and says it, but this could be something that takes place between ED2 and whatever proposed/rumored sequels to Army of Darkness/Evil Dead people have talked about.<br />Think of it like this: while Ash is away in AoD... this group visits the same cabin. Horror hi-jinks ensue because hey -- same house? same book? same awful bloody problems.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game for my son and he loves it! Excellent transaction, everything went prefect! Would order again if needed in future
B0061S0A64|1.0|Didn't understand it, worked with it a little and then gave u p as it just seemed to<br />not accomplish what I had intended it for.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good and excellent entertainment  An interesting story line.  Excellent characters!.  Is there more that needs be said?<br />When will there be more?
0143117157|5.0|An outstanding book, superbly written. It accurately portrays Nelson Mandela's exceptional and inspirational leadership of the new South Africa. He has made our world a better place!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a great little find! I can't wait for the next one:)  I couldn't put it down! Good author!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I feel that we should have the same amount of time to call a bingo when the last number is called as we do when all of the rest of the numbers are called. It isn't fair that the last number called is a bingo or a treasure chest or a money square. Also when the screen freezes I loose credits and never get them reimbursed. I realize that it is just a game but it should be played fair. I bet that i have lost at least 100 credits since I have been playing this game and it really makes me mad. These problems should be played fixed ASAP.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I'm a big fan of the comics. This movie did the character justice. I really hope there is a sequel.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I did not like this game at all.  I quit playing it before I even finished.  I would not spend the money
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The movie was confusing from the first five minutes.  I liked some of machine's and special effects.  The story line became disjointed and hard to follow.  Overall I expected to more entertainment not boring.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis has written an easy-to-read and easily understood book to guide us &#34;common&#34; folks on this journey to better health. Although filled with amazing facts and figures, he adds a touch of humor to the mix that made me feel as though we were having a chat over coffee. This was a whole new world of information, sought out because of my own new health challenge, but Dr. Davis made it seem attainable- maybe not the easiest of paths, but attainable--and worth the effort. Thank you, Dr. Davis.
B0009UC810|3.0|I order this for another person, cannot give it a review because I have never watched it.  Not really my kind of movie.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|It sure does take me back to the day! Lots and lots of fun. Don't know why I haven't done this sooner!!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Fast shipping. Love this version of the Bible.<br /><br />Where some Bibles can cause you to get lost, the ESV Study Bible encompasses vast knowledge from many Theologians throughout time explaining just what the meaning and derivitives of words and phrases mean enabling a better understanding of the text.<br /><br />I always recommend this to others!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are very detailed and the writers are original every time. I only wish the energy would recharge at a quicker rate or the rooms would require as much energy usage.
B002H1J2AO|5.0|A comedy classic - exactly what you should watch when you need a good laugh. John Belushi is the best.
B001B1UO6W|3.0|Don't want to be misleading, but it is kind of hokey, but in a good way, I don't really care for horror movies, ordered it for someone else.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very well written show, slows at times but it's all worth it up to the end of Season 3. If you are into sci-fi stuff, you will love this
B008846CAC|3.0|Although the book contains hundreds of practice questions, I think most are average and lower level. It is very good in that you can practice a lot but it is also good to get other resources for practicing higher level questions.
B00AEFYKKM|5.0|Really good, thought-provoking movie. Riveting. Highly recommended. A movie you'll have to watch again to catch and understand everything. Fine performance by the main actor.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|My even like this better than Cold Fact, even though it is slightly less popular. Either way, great to see these re-released on CD.
B000MV8ABS|3.0|Ordered it for someone else, have not watched it and probably won't.  In fact I am sure I won't.  OK I guess.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Bottom line, these are not nice people.  But they certainly are a fascinating bunch.  The writing is terrific, the ensemble cast excellent and the anticipation for the next episode is high.  Veteran actors Katy Segal and Ron Perlman give bravura performances.  It's a great show.
1401907725|5.0|These cards really accompany me and bring peace and consciousness to my life. The angels have helped me in my search for wellbeing and spirituality.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Very exotic recipes. I enjoy cooking so searching for the different spices was ok for me. There are some delicious recipes that will be in my weekly menue. Im vegetarian so its perfect!
B00A8307BG|3.0|I have other Robin Trower music, which I love.  Was a little disappointed with this. Didn't sound too much different from lots of other covers of these standards.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is one of my favorite books hands down. It is one of the first really long books that I read back in high school and I was hooked. I've always enjoyed reading about Japan and this was right up my alley. The basic overview of the book is the story of John Blackthorne, an English pilot of a Dutch ship, who wants to find Japan and open trade that has been up to then exclusively run by the Portuguese. He makes it to Japan, but with a damaged ship and no knowledge of the language, culture, or political climate. Blackthorne quickly becomes swept up in the plots,agenda, and whims of the main warlord Toranaga who is an extremely complicated character. Mariko is a aristocratic Japanese woman who is enlisted to help educate the \\"barbarian\\" anjin (pilot) so that he can communicate directly with Toranaga and provide him with a point of view other than that of the Portuguese. There is so much to this tale that I can't imagine giving a whole overview of this book, but it is so worth the time you will invest reading it. This is such a rich and complex story and if you enjoy stories of feudal Japan you can't go wrong with this one.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|Just love the sounds and music that this CD gives you. And actually I find it to be very relaxing. I would buy more from this artist.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|good game fun to play.love breeding and see what u get.recommended for all ages.dont need real money to play this game.
B000NY12CI|5.0|This book contains messages for everyone.  This should definitely be read by every man and woman who question multiculturalism or think they believe in it.  It should be read by all naive females who take for granted the rights they possess in a free society.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love this, but then wouldn't have bought it if I didn't already love the series. Can't wait for the next season to come out!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|graphics are great and the game is really super duper over the moon keep you entertained for hours fun... YEAH!!!
B005LAII4E|3.0|This came quick and on time. It just wasn't as good as the first movie, but most sequels are that way. This just very poorly done.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is great for party's, sleep overs, and long trips hope this is useful. I love it very fun.  Great game to play with friends and family
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A most remarkable true story which emphasizes how much freedom we have in America which is often not appreciated.  The comparison of this man's life with any American's life is stark.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I saw this movie on a flight and just had to buy it when it came out on DVD. Great story and all the better for being true.  Has allowed him to reach out to a new audience and finally have some success.
B00486U2VY|5.0|This is the best book ever and every one should read it I love the action in the book so ammmmmmmazing
B00B1DC2FQ|3.0|This is one of schelichs least scientific figures,  the reason being is because the proportions are off and don't match that of the creature its depicting. Carnotaurus had a small head, tiny stubby arms, and was  very lean. The model that they created has a head that is too big, arms that are to long, legs that are too thick, and feet that are too big. If your looking for a Carnotaurus that makes a good replication of the creature then stay away from this, and get the [[ASIN:B00BD05PEW Carnosaurius]] instead. However, if you don't give a hoot about accuracy and just want a toy for your kids to play with, then by own means, get one, because its made out of a  flexible and rubbery material allowing it to take some abuse.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Always love the Crossfire Novel.  Unfortunately It is a quick read because I can never put the book down.  Can't wait for the next one!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Nothing but trash which will appeal to those who can only think with their genitals.  Unfortunately we are producing many such individuals in today's society.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Great album. If you like folk rock and music from the late 60's and early 70's you have to get this and Coming From Reality.
1596680296|5.0|After sock knitting on double pointed needles many years, I found a different way!The patterns are all different and adorable and done on two straight needles.Not the old kind which have the seam on the sole of you foot, very not comfy.These have an almost decorative seam along the side or on top of the foot.Nice collection of patterns for everyone, even kiddos.My personal favorites were the hippy sock boots but I'll make many of these cute patterns.My friend has already made five different pairs from this book, all pretty and fun, fun, fun. Great for a new knitter intimidated by DPN's!
B009AY04A8|5.0|If you like hidden picture games - this is a fun one!  The pictures in this game are bright enough you can locate hidden objects!
006224454X|3.0|The story matter was intriguing at first and I was hooked from the start. However, over time it became too repetitive, I lost interest, and struggled to finish.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Character building this season was phenomenal!  The series continues to amaze me with every developing episode.  I can't wait until season four to premier!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had already seen Season 3 twice: once as it ran on PBS in Jan-Feb and again via the DVD from our local library.  During August our daughter was visiting us from Baltimore and, since her husband doesn't care to watch it with her, she had watched Season 3 on PBS alone.  So we did as we had done in 2012 when she was here: after everyone else had gone to bed, we settled down with some snacks and wine and watched Season 3 == several nights in a row.  It was just as good as when we'd seen it previously but more fun to laugh and cry our way through it together.  The BBC really know how to do TV right!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has everything!  I loved it so much that I am ready to read it all over again!  Enjoy!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This story of Dr.Akexander is truly uplifting.  I, like others, was really a non believer in this sort of thing, even though it would be nice to know that there is somewhere.  My only precious daughter died about a year and a half ago, and I cannot get past this loss.  I still  cry for her everyday.  I read this book by Dr. Eben Alexander, and for the first time since my daughter passed, I felt like maybe at least she is happy and that there is somewhere, after this journey here  on Earth.<br />If you have lost a loved one, read this book.  I hope with all my heart you have not lost your child...there is nothing to compare to this pain.  I send you all love.
B004RL9T50|2.0|Now I understand why this was never a super big hit.  Is the main character bad --- how he is good --- now he is bad???  They took a really odd path just to tell a story.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I had a harder time getting into this book than either of the other two.  Great final chapters on all three books!  This a great series for boys and girls to get into.  Thanks Suzanne Collins!
B003G4W49C|1.0|I just could not finish reading this book - just like the author's notes (which should've been a clue). It was unbelievably  boring and repetitive. The writing was stilted and elementary. There was a premise but no real plot. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters and frankly just wanted them all to die so I would be put out of my misery. It was one of the worst books I've ever read and I've read some pretty bad ones.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Indearing tho predictable.....I cried my eyes out during the appropriate scenes, and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great dog, tho not a puppy nearly long enough.
B00EOO55GW|1.0|Before all of the A7X fanboys/girls start spewing hate down on me, please hear me out. All bands have influences, and there is nothing wrong with that, but when you can pick out whole sections of songs that were stolen from older songs, well that's when I have a problem. For that matter, when a band steals another bands \\"mascot\\", that's even worse. Overkill has been using the winged-skull for 20+ years,for those too young, feel free to look it up. I could go on a song by song rant, but all that you need to do is pull out Metallica's \\"Black\\" album,AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\", (hmmm, the guitar intro sounds strangely familiar,doesn't it????)or any Guns'N Roses back catalog, and you'll hear how fresh this album isn't. A7X would have been better off doing a cover album rather than passing off \\"Hail To The King\\" as a new album. Can't support it, or continue reading 5 star reviews on fraud.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. And its perfect if you are a horse lover. So i really think that if you like horses and caring for them and competing them,ten you should get this app
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like how you can choose which pictures to play....and there is no right or wrong way to play. Everything is to your pace and its very simple to understand. Power ups that you earn are great and it brain is working to figure out the clues!!!
006117758X|5.0|Loved it, and I plan to read many of his novels.  He has a unique voice that is captivating and dark.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Well done, good cast. The kind of show you can watch more than once. My husband and I started watching this again for the third time.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I am docking 4 stars because they had the incredible blindness of actually using Jay-Z in this film.<br /><br />Yes Jay-z=-4 Stars
140006922X|3.0|Reza Aslan, a devout Muslim and a PHD of Sociology writes a story about a very familiar man, Jesus of Nazareth, using historic context of that time. This is an outsiders view of Jesus the Christ, however, not in the negative sense. Aslan covers what many Christian Bible studies and messages do not cover. The many contradictions of the Bible and how verses and scripture can be manipulated to mean whatever they want for the speaker. This book lays out several ideas  preexisting before and during the life of Christ in which shaped the motive to launch a zealous revolution upon the Roman government. Interestingly, the book itself is not the core of this controversy. Instead, the author and his background remains the highlight regardless of his work.  Aslan is a man who understood very well of his critics and what he was getting himself into. He raises the question to the Christian audience \\"Can a Muslim who has earned a PHD in the social history of religion write a book about Jesus without being ridiculed of his faith?\\" He answers \\"Why not?\\"
B0090EJ99A|1.0|If I could give negative stars, this movie would be the one.  Not the least bit funny and extremely offensive and in bad taste in most parts. There's a reason it's free.
B000L9EKL0|5.0|Keeps you on your toes all the way thru the movie. True to the point it's all about the Politics
0785132619|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this product from the condition that it arrived in to the story it contained. I highly recommend this to others that have any interest in this topic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love watching Downton Abbey on my kindle fire while I do my treadmill workout. The show is offered through kindle as a membership feature at no extra charge when you purchase an Amazon Prime membership. Most of the freebees don't appeal to me, but this one certainly does.<br /><br />I am a great fan of the show, but I must admit that I find Seasons I and II more captivating than Season III. I suppose my fascination is with the contrasts in culture/fashion/home life between the 1910s/20s era and ours.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show, give it a try.  Prim, yet sassy, Cousin Violet is a treasure.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Although I love Matthew, those two little boys were my favorite.  So very authentic.  Being from the south, I can tell they are true southern boys....they run, jump, get dirty and just overall act like real boys would in their environment.  Authenticity runs high on my scale of appreciation!
B004UPANAI|5.0|Great movie. Can't wait until the new one comes out on DVD so I can get it home and watch.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Playing for the first time, where I chose to place card, sometimes the game will move elsewhere.  I felt it more difficult to play on the kindle than with laptop or using the mouse.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|You should read this book--and not just because it's a classic. Read it because it's laced with wit and verbal artistry.  Read it because it is a joyful, soul-affirming book.  Little Women is a timeless exploration of the family dynamic and it's a heck of a lot of fun to read!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great sci fi book it was Soo well written and you forget that these are children being trained sometimes or their ages. Plot was brilliant.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Fun game. There's a variety of tasks in the game. The only complaint is the characters are too chatty. You can tap though that if you choose.  I enjoyed this game and would recommend that you take a Pirate Adventure too!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just when you think the story can't get any better or more interesting up pops book 3. Full of jaw dropping moments and unforeseen twists and turns. This is definitely not a \\"fairy tale\\" story and leaves you wondering if there will ever be a happy ending for anyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fun, if not implausible, central story line. Pretty light-hearted. At its worst when it tries to be serious. Dialogue gets increasingly better as the season goes on and is really good in Season 2...esp Daniel Arkin's writing.
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|This was not what I expected at all. I enjoyed the movie so much that I watched it twice with in my 48 hour rental window. And will be purchasing the title soon.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Love the title song.  I prefer Marc Anthony singing in Spanish, he sounds so much sexier.  My daughter also enjoys the CD.
B007C52NY2|5.0|There were so many suprises. I had a hard time keeping up at some points. This is an awesome trilogy!!
B004NS710C|5.0|very good action pack movie. did not fall asleep enjoy every min.it is a five star movie you will love it
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This book has a very sympathetic and fun take on autism/Asbergers Syndrome without patronising or over simplifying the issues. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fabulous read....multiple story lines all kept me wanting to know more!!!  Enjoyed it enough to download another book by this author!!
1439102732|4.0|I know with ever Jodi Picoult book I read it will be sad. It's kid of disturbing how excited I get knowing a sad part is comming up. The sad parts make me feel better about my life. They let me see that my life is better then the people in the book. I didn't have as many sad parts in this book. Dont get the wrong idea, the sad parts ARE there.  I just didn't feel them as much as I did in some of Jodi's other book. The story line is good. This stuff doesn happen and I never thought about embryos as people before. It is a real thinker.
B0038UNNBM|5.0|I absolutely love this pool! We've used it all summer and haven't had any issues. The canopy has been great since our backyard has no shade. The size of the pool is bigger than most with canopies. We started using this when our daughter was 9 months old and will be able to use it next year too since it isn't a tiny infant pool. It's big enough for at least 3 toddlers to comfortably enjoy at the same time. Oh, and I love that the bottom of pool also inflates to provide cushion! I would definitely recommend!
B005BGBPBG|2.0|It was a decent movie. Not worth watching twice. Kate Hudson was decent in the movie also, although I liked her better I A Little Like Heaven.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very interesting. The psychology of the book is amazing, the story was thrilling and creative.<br /><br />Like a lot of books, I felt as though the ending was a cop out and sloppily finished. It left more questions than answers, and it seemed to extend too far beyond reality. Up until then, the book was consistently realistic and interesting.
0545265355|5.0|I have never read a book trilogy so fast. It was so good. Gale seems like my kind of guy. When Katness was talking about all the hunting I wanted to be there with her. Its like I could feel the connection between Katness and Gale and the connection between Katness and Peeta.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is and continues to be one of the best shows currently on television.  I would even go as far as proclaiming it one of the best shows ever!  And that's saying a lot, and saying enough at the same time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wanted to take a shower after reading about these awful people.  Very scary depiction of what 2 people can get from a marriage.
0770437400|5.0|We watch the movie, and my son (who loves to read) wanted this book.  He loves it.  He said it is way better than the movie.  But then again most books are :P.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Loved the jabs at religion. Have loved Simon Pegg for years -- \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", \\"Hot Fuzz\\" and more -- and look forward to his new \\"World's End\\".
B007FEFLTO|3.0|It's engaging, but definitely not Follett's best (nowhere near Pillars of the Earth), and I've read trilogies on similar subjects that I found way better (Tatiana & Alexander, Hotel Quadriga).
B00B7ERH04|2.0|The camera isn't that much better than the camera itself, with no real advantage over the built-in software. As it requires another app to really work, it's debatable.
B0006LZPKS|5.0|I'm not replacing my first ones, I'm just buying a new pair for dress up.  I think I should have gotten a half size bigger though.  I couldn't read the size on my old ones, it was too worn.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Goodfellas is a timeless classic! One of the best mob movies ever produced! This is a must see for anyone who enjoys mob movies!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I was really pleasantly surprised by this book and the other 2 by Gillian Flynn because I don't usually like the way women write fiction. But Flynn writes like a man I guess. This is a cool, well-written, kinda dark story that's different from most of what's out there. Do yourself a favor and read this and her other 2 books asap.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Not sure 're this one.  Although I could not put it down toward end.  Story did not end the way I expected but characters are good, especially Amy.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|So far this is my #1 video biography on Bob Marley. Definitely would rate a 5 out of 5 stars!!!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|DOESN'T COVER THE LEVEL I AM ON???  I AM AT LEVEL 165 AND NO HELP PLUS I GET TO THE LEVEL AND HAVE TRIED IT AND REACHED THE SCORE OF I THOUGHT 250 AND STILL CAN'T WIN.  IS IT RIGGED TO PAY HUNDRED DOLLARS TO WIN?
0790729393|5.0|I had seen this years ago and couldn't remember all the details.  It was a very good movie especially because it was a true story!
B00555X8OA|5.0|Requires some concentration, but definitely geard for the non-expert.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding how we think.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A nice easy read that you just want to continue reading until the end. The characters become very real and the book promotes thought and reflection about yourself.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The English just seem to know how to put together a great series.  This series has real, gritty characters; a good mystery; I'm hooked - anxious to see how it ends.
B008602KQI|2.0|I don't like it because at the end of the story one lucky person won but what has been done to avoid these stupid games to happen again?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show. I do love legal thrillers so may be biased but pretty good and you can't help but want to dress like Harvey.
B006LSZECO|5.0|couldn't put this book down, absolutely loved it, but hated the way it ended. Awesome Book but I love Gillian Flynn
B009HUB40Y|3.0|It Is Ok. I don't like if you don't have wi-fi you can't play it. I don't like that you have buy things to keep playing it.
0425252868|5.0|Wonderful book and finally a book about something positive done by a Luftwaffe airman.  Great story about comradely and respect for common warriors.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|How would you explain the most perfect military training ? Rent this movie.<br />Emotions aside,This time in our lives, needed to be told.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you'll love this one, there are many different puzzles to enjoy.  Not overly hard, but enjoyable to me.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Awesome app! Has came in handy a hundred times or more. Love it! I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family.
B005544TRQ|3.0|I liked the previews for the series.  I like the story line and characters,  but was disappointed in the acting.
140006922X|5.0|Great book. Hard to put down. And very well researched. Provides a far better understanding of the why and how the ancient world shaped Jesus and Christianity and is still doing so today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicted. Makes my brain think fast. Cant spot playing. Colors are awesome on the kinlde hd. Best game ive downloaded yet.
1423113381|5.0|If you're a fan of Rick Riordan, you should read this book.<br />Good pacing, and interesting ideas. It is action-packed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The surround sound is awesome and its really light and comfortable. Plus for being able to recharge it while wearing it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it so far. Its entertaining and fun to play. I like the details it has and the graphics are good qs well for a game like this. Someone put in alot of effort making this game fun.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I chose this one for my grandson . He loves the action and speed of the game .would recommend this game for all ages.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Kindle Case Cover<br /><br />It fit our Kindle. Protects perfectly.<br />Wished that we had purchased one earlier.<br />Might I suggest that it come in other more feminine colors?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great conclusion to the trilogy, Mockingjay does not disappoint with engaging action, accelerating pace, vivid descriptions, and a surprising plot twist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's like reading a good book!  I was sorry to see Matthew killed in the end.  As Maggie Smith would say, what a pity!
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I've only had the app for 1/2hour.I can't seem to set my location,it continues to put my location about 100 miles from where it oughta be.it is a very pretty app maybe it'll work fine.on a weather app I'm usually more interested in data and accurate weather forecasts.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is very very very fun and I'm connected to my grandmas face book on my kindle and she is connected to her face book on her iPad so we are playing together LOVE it
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I can't add too much more to the other glowing reviews of this book. I am in awe of Lincoln, the poor boy, self-educated young man and then president -  during the most perilous time in American history.  How he was able to assemble his &#34;team of rivals&#34;, keep them close and earn their loyalty and love shows his intelligence and intuitive gifts.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love the story and the actors. I can't wait for this season to start. I just love my Prime membership.
0767817478|5.0|Sadly I agree that people say they are Godzilla fans then ditch him when he needs them most! But the one good thing is that he still has fans out there and this movie is awesome!!! I have always loved to see Godzilla no matter what! And I'll always give his movies the attention they deserve!! : D this movie is very well done and keeps you interested throughout the movie! If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend you do!!!
B000W20NXU|5.0|The new textures that Waits uses seems as if he's been using them for years, but its obvious, and not just by the titles of the songs, that he uses inherent New York City themes to illustrate another timeless and fruitful album. 19 tracks seem daunting, but most of them cut away just when it gets good, only to get better with the next song. With the composer's courtesy to thrown in interludes with only music and even a poem song of one minute duration, this is an experience worth taking, especially for those who are fans of music that has backbone. Its nice to know there was a time when men had hearts that didn't bleed for every and anything, but for things that were vivid and cruel, yet somehow glorious in their telling and performance.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek writes honestly and poignantly about his running career and why running is such a transcendent experience. It's humbling to read, but also inspiring for runners at any level. The recipes he shares are amazing!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|They could have added so much more to this, but left it empty. I haven't seen a new good horror movie in a long time, Just plain disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not overly difficult, but very challenging nonetheless. I hope it won't be long until they add more levels. The game is quite addictive.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down and<br /> such a bitter sweet ending.  I can't wait to see  what they do in the movies.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The storyline and acting on this Series is in a class by itself.  Can't wait until Series 4 begins next January.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Love this film and the blu-ray is perfect quality.  I love that it comes with an ultra violet digital copy as well as a Amazon video version too!  Bonus!
B0014NDXGA|4.0|High quality intrument and very simple to use.  Never again will I have a concern about the exact yardage to the pin.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love this app, but it needs more fonts! I use this app to make story covers for wattpad and it works good for it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like this game. It starts off easy, but later turns into a thought-provoking puzzle game. My 4-year old also loves it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My 11 year old granddaughter  introduced me to Dr. Who, can you believe it?<br />And I was enchanted even though I do not usually like sci fi. There is a wry sense of humor in the stories and a complete lack ( a real plus for me) of horror or violence.<br />I recommend it as a rather campy and very fun bit of escapism.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is so simple and effective, I use it daily and its very accurate. I would recommend this app to everyone!
B00CMQX84A|3.0|I was go okay just i pad more for it but in walmart i could of got it chep  it was good
B009XIXVU6|4.0|not a page turner but good book, opens your mind to the other parts of the world and struggles people face.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I play this game everyday.  It is a challenge and keeps you on your toes.<br />Its a great game to play.
B00CTT9646|2.0|I was about to buy the collector's edition when I read this:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I buy Blu-rays for the extra content and behind the scene stuff  I'm not going pay again just to get the commentary tracks and I'm not going to buy multiple copies just to get all the extra contents.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved the movies so I downloaded the game. I am glad that I did. I love this game! Plus it is a great way to release stress because there is so much focus on the game.
B00B51A5PS|3.0|this book was for a class i was taking. it is very powerful, but an extremely hard read. the translation is awkward.
B008M721MS|5.0|I  enjoy contacting my family this way.  We can see each other as we talk.<br />Wouldn't want to be without it.
B00E3QJ7FG|3.0|Weird Science is a hilarious film about two teens who build a beautiful woman. The picture and audio quality are average at best. Weird Science is in need of a good remastering. There is 40 minutes of total bonus content. A digital copy and UltraViolet is included. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package.<br /><br />Codec: VC-1   Resolution: 1080p   Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio: English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), French (DTS 5.1)<br />Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: \\"It's Alive: Resurrecting 'Weird Science'\\" (16:38, SD), \\"Weird Science: Pilot Episode\\" (22:36, SD), Theatrical Trailer (2:30, SD).
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program always keep you interested and looking forward to the next episode.  Only shows I like more are Mad Men and Breaking Bad.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|It is everything a romantic drama should contain. The plot is sensational and moves along interwoven splendidly within the narrative. I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a good cry!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Very enlightening if not down right irritating how these food Moguls have manipulated, seduced the publics eating habits and have contributed to the obesity epidemic all for the mighty dollar
0792841344|5.0|Phantasm is one of the best horror movies of the 1970s. It features young Mike who discovers an undertaker is destroying the town. He joins with some friends (Reggie and Jody) to battle The Tall Man in this surreal, original horror film. Words cannot convey how awesome and unusual this indie horror flick (it managed to get 3 sequels). They don't make them dream-like anymore (it's hard to decide what happened in the film which is what gives it the magic). We were in spellbound silence when we watched the movie as kids. I do remember being very confused especially at the end but this classic holds up well on repeated viewings. None of the cast seems to have made it big in Hollywood so they deserve to be remembered here (especially Reggie).<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Ten Minutes of Deleted Scenes<br />Behind-the-Scenes Footage<br />1979 Promotional Interviews<br />Introduction by Angus \\"The Tall Man\\" Scrimm<br />Photo Gallery: Includes Original & International Theatrical Posters & Lobby Cards<br /><br />Buy this Special Edition DVD until Phantasm gets a Blu-ray release with 4 hours of extras. Phantasm II got a great Blu-ray release in what must be the first time the original was skipped in a new format release. Phantasm has never even received a 2-disc Special Edition DVD. That's despicable. I love all the Phantasm films but they deserve more respect.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I didn't expect much, however we all enjoyed watching it and thought the plot, while a little conceptual, made for a good movie.
B00B32YK96|4.0|If you are nostalgic, lived in small town USA, still dream about your glory days from high school....this is a fun movie to watch. Great acting, and Natalie Portman is so great in one (if not the first) of her early acting roles!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this first in the theatre and couldn't believe my eyes. Finally they can put the feeling and emotion on film. I was completely impressed with all the actors talents. Something you usually can only see on stage... Make more!!!
B000JVT1U0|5.0|The Wicker Man is one of the most unusual and perhaps only musical-horrors in existence. It is a wonderful mystery about a police officer investigating the disappearance of a girl on a nearby pagan island. Christianity and pagan beliefs clash leading to a terrifying conclusion. This 2-disc DVD comes with some good extras including a 50-min documentary. It also comes with a soundtrack CD. This film is worthy of a US Blu-ray with 2-4 hours of extras.<br /><br />Disc 1 - Uncut \\"The Wicker Man\\"<br />Disc 2 - Original cut release.<br /><br />Buy this special edition DVD until the Blu-ray is released. It has managed to hold its value.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|I don't know, I am sure there will be a lot of people who will disagree with me, but I could not get thru this movie.  I just thought it was very silly and generally boring (and I am a sci-fi fan).  The special effects add up to so much nothing.  This same director made Memento, and it was great, so I am assuming he got a lot of money to make this.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Major League is one of those movies that never fails to make one relax and laugh and enjot the fun.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Put this little bad boy in line between your player and car stereo. Turn it up to 8,9, 10 and adjust the volume on the car stereo. It's like a new system. Same deal with PC speakers. As a straight headphone amp it's great, especially since it's portable. It you have a old smartphone hanging out you can use it to make a dedicated player. Check out the Bravo tube headphone amp for home or office.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Thrilling, patriotic, and politically correct story. Both Cary Grant and Eve Mary Saint are well casted for their roles. Superb acting and great dialog.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Made my summer!  Great cast, costumes, scenery and script.  I highly recommend you watch 2 episodes and try not to be addicted.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I only just started watching Downton Abbey. So I watched all 3 seasons in about a week! In true PBS-style, everything about the show is top-notch: the directing,casting, acting, set design, etc. The quality of a film, rather than TV. I was devastated at the end of the 3rd season with what happened and I'm not sure if I'll be as interested in the show next season with the change (don't want to give any spoilers!). But most likely, I'll still be hooked.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|when I am sitting in a doctors office or watching a boring show on TV&#60;,  i dont use all the cars, most of the scenes are mountains so race cars, motor cycles, quads just dont cut it,,<br /><br />then moon scene is my favorite..
B000G75ANY|5.0|One of her best! Not a bad song on the album! A good buy for anyone not familiar with her work.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is fun. I got it after seeing it on one of my sons devices. I have played it so much i forget where the time has gone.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This story kept me captivated the whole time.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a unique story.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Especially from Stephen King.  A bit disappointed with some of the flaws in the comparison of weather and certain facts.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|Goodbye, Fitz, Fool, Chade, Dutiful, Thick, and all the other characters in the Six Duchies who made the trilogies thus far so memorable.  It was a sweet farewell, and I learned still more about this fascinating world and its history.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I absolutly love this. I enjoy puzzling and you can choose how many pieces you want and the scenery is beautiful
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app was amazing I loved all the vehicles and maps this game rocks if you don't already have it download it!!!!!!!!!!<br />Just one thing I wish I could get ghost riders bike!!!!!!!!!!!
B0027MJU00|3.0|After reading Gone Girl, I wanted to see what else Gillian Flynn could offer.  Although this book was suspenseful, I could not bring myself to empathize with the main character, Libby Day.  Although I understood her troubles-who wouldn't have issues after going thru the type of tragedy that she did-I just didn't like her very much.  I also couldn't sympathize with her brother, Ben, who is serving time for killing her whole family when she was a child.  I understood his anguish, but did not understand his reasoning.  The book has great twists and turns and keept me interested throughout.  However, I did not like the ending very much.  It seemed unfinished, but so did Gone Girl in my opinion.  I guess that's just Ms. Flynn's way.  If you like suspense and surprise, this is a very good choice.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Clever description of incidents involving normal people who wind up in Germany during the Nazi takeover. Very interesting and with a fresh look at the people involved, what they saw and did and experienced.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Proven ideas to rething the way you talk to people and what to say at difficult times makes this book a staple in your library.
B000002OZY|5.0|If you haven't seen it you need to.  The music is awesome and so is the cast of the movie.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|To be expected.  Tom Cruise does ok but is nothing out of the ordinary since he pretty much is the same in every movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun and addicting game.  No nead to pay real money to upgrade your buggy.  Good control and an entertaining soundtrack.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This game won't open on my HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE.  Period.  I wish it did, the other reviews have been encouraging.
B006LSZECO|5.0|When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure it would be an enjoyable read.  Boring would be the word that came to mind. It had such great reviews I figured everyone couldn't be that wrong so I kept reading.  It didn't take long and I couldn't put the book down. I'm looking forward to reading other books by Gillian Flynn.
B00007LTIB|5.0|December, 1974, Westminster Mall. Looking thru the store windows I could see a new Roger Dean painting on the walls. But this was not just a painting, it was an album cover. Could it be a new Yes album? As I got closer I could see the iconic logo. Yes! Roger said he was thinking of a haven for warrior monks when he painted it. \\"Relayer\\", as it turned out, would be his favorite Yes cover and favorite Yes album.<br /><br />The name \\"Relayer\\" was first mentioned in the album that came before it, \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", which was an album of peaceful intent. Somehow it grew into this idea of how one maintains the peace in a less than spiritual world.<br /><br />\\"Casting giant shadows off vast penetrating force\\"<br /><br />War has come home to roost. Should we face it? Should we become like our enemy, evil in intent? Do we defend our honor? Or do we give up our freedom to keep from killing? This is what the first section of `The Gates Of Delirium' deals with.  The enemy is bringing war to us. The second section deals with the battle itself and it is a musical attack on all fronts, starting with a march \\"pounding out the devil's sermon\\" and then a galloping attack. The armies clash, as guitar, synth and drums go at it.  Percussion reveals swords, shields and axes clashing. Then, twelve minutes into it, the drums wind it down, and now the guitars and keys flow, like the enemy being driven from the field. By the fifteenth minute, the death dealing is done. Now it is time to count the loss. There is sadness but hope of a new life, \\"the sun will lead us, our reason to be here\\".<br /><br />\\"Stars expound our conscience\\"<br /><br />`Sound Chaser' is as zany as its name implies. A totally bombastic track played at light speed, it is progressive rock at its most extreme. I would not be surprised if only a few musicians can play this tune note perfect. I am sure it is fun to play, but it is probably rather taxing for most listeners to sit thru. This song reaffirmed the groups position atop the prog rock summit. The way they bring it all to a soothing halt in the middle just shows how versatile they were. From a blazing blitzkrieg to the quietest peace is rare in one song. Here Yes has now done it twice. The measured pace which they reach after this most mellow of sections shows us the band taking flight after two stretches down the runway in different gears. The guys actually have to catch their breath during the \\"cha cha\\" part, before blasting off at light speed again. The band stops to catch its breath once more before they hyper drive out of here.<br /><br />\\"Drifting endlessly\\"<br /><br />`To Be Over' is the come down. They might not be earth bound but they are at least back in orbit. This song is pretty compared to the sonic avalanche of the one before it.

The way they bring it all to a soothing halt in the middle just shows how versatile they were. From a blazing blitzkrieg to the quietest peace is rare in one song. Here Yes has now done it twice. The measured pace which they reach after this most mellow of sections shows us the band taking flight after two stretches down the runway in different gears.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!!<br /><br />It was just delightful and fresh and engaging with perfect amounts of give and take. Mysterious enough to sustain the magic and wonder of the story--mimicking the magic wonder of childhood-- but detailed enough to help you create the world in your mind. This was my first Neil Gaiman book, and I understand I am late to the party, but this surpassed my expectations (which were high due to Neil Gaiman hype).<br /><br />Some reviews I've read indicate this is too similar to his previous works. That's for fans to judge for themselves, though I would not be surprised. I do know that Gaiman likes to insert character cameos from his other works, but anything else that's similar should be chalked up to style, not lack of originality.<br /><br />This book won't change your life, but it's not a waste of it either :)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Some friends of ours recommended this show and we're sure glad they did, as this show is great! I recommend it to everyone!

B00007KWHP|5.0|Spring, 1972, and I had just bought my first stereo system; a black Hitachi receiver enclosed in a dark wood cabinet with matching bookshelf speakers. I plug it in and flip on the power switch and push the FM button. I turn the dial and right away I hear `Long Distance Runaround'. And it sounds good. Little did I know then that the very first song I heard on my very first stereo would turn out to be from one of my favorite albums by my favorite band. I had heard the song before, as well as the radio tunes `Roundabout' and `All Good People'. All good songs but I found them to be too abstract. I was still on the basics then, Beatles, Stones, Cream, Purple; these Yes guys were way out in left field. It would take me over a year to catch up.<br /><br />I first heard the album in 1972, because my friend's older sister owned it. I found \\"Fragile\\" to be very confusing, it only had five normal songs while the rest were musically odd and without vocals. Then there was \\"Frenchy's Woofer\\", a stereo shop with these beautiful Marantz receivers. My friends and I would go there to hear how good music could sound. Frenchy's favorite demo disk was \\"Fragile\\" and it sounded so good, so clear, especially `South Side Of The Sky', with its quiet piano passage.<br /><br />After buying \\"Yessongs\\" in the summer of 1973, I was finally able to come to terms with what I was hearing. The confusing, abstract arrangements began to take shape and the song structures started to make sense. I was able to differentiate between guitar and keyboard and make a connection with the lyrics. This began the musical highpoint of my life; it would never get this good again. I bought \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" as a British import because I could not wait for the US release. Finally, on December 22, 1973 I bought \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\".<br /><br />This album only contains six great songs, but boy what great songs! `Roundabout' with its pulsating bass, the epic sounding`South Side Of The Sky', `Long Distance Runaround' and its instrumental interplay, `The Fish' and its bass manifesto, the correctly titled `Mood For A Day' and the rapid `Heart Of The Sunrise' are all far beyond what most bands are capable of creating. The recording is so good it almost sounds organic. The folk guitars mesh so well with the electric instruments, it is like they were grown together. All the instrumentation is top notch and the vocals, like on `South Side', are soaring.<br /><br />Jon Anderson's voice is an acquired taste, it takes awhile to get used to, but once you do, you can see no one else singing these tunes. And his lyrics demand dedication too. These guys are the tops and `\\"Fragile\\" established Yes as virtuosos. Bruford's percussion and Howe's excellent guitar techniques are matched by Wakeman's all world keys and Squire's dominating bass lines.<br /><br />The other three songs only amount to four minutes and do not detract from the greatness of the others. Even `5%', which might be about the worst track in anyone's music collection, cannot dilute this master work of art that Yes has created with \\"Fragile\\".<br /><br />4.8 starsng Distance Runaround' and its instrumental interplay, `The Fish' and its bass manifesto, the correctly titled `Mood For A Day' and the rapid `Heart Of The Sunrise' are all far beyond what most bands are capable of creating.

B003DZX44I|5.0|The remastered version is really good. My nephew loves watching it over and over again. The Blue-ray/DVD combo is convenient.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Some friends of ours recommended this show and we're sure glad they did, as this show is great! I recommend it to everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When I saw this game I was so happy and I got it and I loved it so much I recommend this game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing the game.  I like to see what's new everyday. I have made a lot of new people playing the game. I like to do trades and send my friends what they need.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought it was very good because it will inspire me to read the full book which I bought already.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I got this mobile after looking at a lot of others.  The music is very soft and comforting, and my daughter really pays attention to the thing as it moves.  It fits securely to the crib, and does not interfere with the bumper guard.  Fisher-Price makes a great product, and this is one of them.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The big AHA for me in this book -- and there were lots of other small ones -- was that Paul is the Christian version of the Mormon Joseph Smith. Paul, who never laid eyes on the man Jesus, came up with a theology that had little to do with that man. Paul -- not Jesus -- is the author of what we call Christianity.<br /><br />Both Paul and Joseph Smith founded religions that arose from what both claimed to be private visions from God. Both of them succeeded spectacularly, but for all we know both of them were dreaming, or having hallucinations, or even lying.<br /><br />I knew, of course, that Paul's letters form a big part of the New Testament, but I hadn't understood the context in which they were written or the issues they were meant to resolve. Aslan has done us a favor with this telling of history.<br /><br />This review is based on the audible version of the book, which I recommend highly. The author reads it himself, and does it well.<br /><br />My religious experience includes 18 years growing up Catholic and 28 years at a Congregational church. In the latter I was thoroughly involved and generous with both time and money. Those are my bonafides; I mean to say that I get what church is good at from lots of personal experience. I don't hate church . . . and yet if I'm honest I can't call myself a Christian, because I never for a single second in all those years thought that the idea of Jesus dying for the sins of mankind made any sense. Zealot gave me a way to understand what has felt so terribly off for so long.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|So amazing and technically well written! How this man comes up with this world is a mystery to me, though he is also incredibly infuriating.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Great book. One of my top favs. Go read it. He has experienced the ups and downs of business, life, finances. And by adding value and choosing himself he has emerged as a very inspiring man. Love his A to Z as it relates to the Simple Daily Practice. Enjoy! Reading this book will make you want to be a better person.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I found it overly long and depressing. A lot of the novel seemed boringly repetitive. I think it was supposed to be an inspiring story of rising above horrible childhood circumstances, but it was a story of learning to be amoral instead of turning to the One who could have made the story a real story of inspiration. And as I said in the title I think it was meant to relate to boys and men, not women.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The acting is terrific, and the characters are ones you care about-- even those you don't particularly like!  There is no arguing with the acting, and the story keeps viewers hooked week after week.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I just love all the ways to play. Always a Good time. And since they asked me in the opening moments of my game to use Facebook I didn't loose my game when my 5 year listener my kindle.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is a fascinating story of an Abbey, its family and staff.  The next season won't be out until January, so it will be hard to wait to see what happens next!
B001BANK32|5.0|What an anxiety filled thriller. This is one of my favourites and I've read a lot of an books. Simply perfect!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|5 star all the way. These guys are so good together I want more....<br />What a great mix of generations and styles.<br />The best work by Stills in quite some time.<br />Chris Layton always delivers the goods.<br />If you've never seen KWS in person, run to buy tix when he's next in your town.<br />Love it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far the game is totally free... the only thing is you run out of energy and will have to wait almost an hour or more to regenerate the energy back at full... other than that it's fun
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love the game its very challenging. My score is no where close to what other people are doing but i enjoy it
B003U2QHB6|5.0|Bill and Ted rule the time circuits and the after life.  They don't know how to lose.  Highly recommended.  The fact that Death joins the band is awesome.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is a &#34;I can't put this down&#34; book.  Her journey is life changing and a true story.  A must read!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I loved this book--mostly because I have been interested in the development of Christianity in first century forever. I think people will be nervous that the layers peel back on how Jesus the man became Christ the divine--how humans shaped the way many perceive Jesus today. Jews will probably be uncomfortable with some unflattering portrayals. But for some who understand that religions have mythologies and symbolisms and belief systems that may not be rooted in historical fact but nonetheless portray important tenets of their belief system, I think their faith will be strengthened. The more I read about this, the more I come to understand how my own beliefs developed around the life of this man, and knowing more of the facts is good for me. I am sure it was well researched--it was a little difficult trying to check his assertions as facts, so I just let it roll. The names were hard to keep track of, especially because the story is not linear, so you go back a lot. Keep notes!
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's very real like as far as what the people in the town need to do to survive. It's very interactive with every thing and is totally free. So you can't get much better than that.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A really fun read - this author is very imaginative and I love escaping into the worlds she creates for her readers.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I didn't really have high hopes when i first started reading this. I was worried it was going to be too childish to enjoy (silly me judging a book by its cover :). I quickly realized I was wrong.  It wasn't anything too deep and thought provoking but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're looking for a quick, pick me up kind of read.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|When I read, I like to get away from it all. This book does that! An amazingly coincidental collection of events that left me laughing but also questioning if things are always as they seem. Great for weekend reading.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is to easy to manipulate through.  I wish it were a bit more difficult and more of a challenge
B003YL4LYI|4.0|My only complaint is that u are just never satisfied when u think it is going the way you want
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I really hate Twilight (Kristen Stewart) but i figured what the heck.It is actualy pretty good and has the guy from Thor in it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love this series - thoroughly enjoying it while I'm forced to take a break from The Walking Dead! Thought Noah Wyle might get on my nerves, but he's great - and the kind of character you can't help but cheer for. I have new respect for Will Patton - superb job. Pope steals the show every time, however - what a great character. Acting only gets better as the series progresses. (I thought Ben was hopeless but he DOES improve.) The show has great moments of humanity and insight that make you constantly think &#34;what if&#34;...I'm enjoying that part and all the action and ignoring all the other unrealistic stuff that might cause angst with some viewers.  I simply don't care - this is a great viewing fun and I can't wait to keep watching!
1476734941|4.0|I like this a lot!  Swore I'd never diet again, but this routine doesn't make me feel deprived, so I can stick to it. How great-- eat minimally two days a week and eat whatever you want the rest of the time!  And once I reach my target weight, then only one day a week.  I recommend this--it's working for me!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow just finished this and it was a lot harder than it looks. Especially the tenth floor. I had to go back to it a few times to figure out what I was doing wrong. Looking forward to more!
B009Y4E414|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful voice!  Her story is so tragic and her singing is sometimes haunting - her rendition of Fields of Gold truly is my favorite!  Pure, clean tones - just beautiful.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Just received my Anker Astro Slim 3 and I like it overall.  Below are just some pros/cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Decent size; slightly larger than my iPhone 5 and weighs about the same.<br />2. Nice design with rubberized edges for easy grip.<br />3. Simple operation; no buttons. Charge the unit via the input port and four LEDs indicate the charge level.<br />4. Automatically blinks the LED indicators when the built-in micro USB cable is unplugged from the unit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The built-in micro USB cable cannot charge an iPhone 5 using a micro USB-Lightning adapter.<br />2. Need to unplug the built-in micro USB cable to access the unit's charging input port.<br />3. Wish there was a button to turn on the LED indicators instead of unplugging/replugging the built-in micro USB cable.<br />4. Wish there was a carrying case since I now need to carry a mini Lightning cable around with it and the built-in micro USB cable is useless.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|It is the poster child for Socialism.  The State is everything.  The State controls everything.  If you do not agree they cremate you while still alive.  Christian Bale does a great job of playing a misguided and confused officer of the State.  It is worth watching just to see the action scenes, Bale's acting, and the last ten minutes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best I've seen thus far. It's soo interactive and much more to do than the standard running and jumping.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great backpack.  Roomy and fits all books and computer great.  Nice fabric and color. Lots of compartments and comfortable to wear.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Rarely is there a movie young people can enjoy. My grand kids actually do the dances together during the movie. Music is great!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have an iPhone 4S. I love this case. I've dropped my phone several times and it didn't get a scratch. It's not too bulky. I did not use the screen protector.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Kveikur is a superb addition to the Sigur Ros discography that is sure to please any fan of the artist.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great actors. Decent character development. Good story for an action movie. Very well done all around.  Fun to watch, lots of action but not mindless or over violent.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|In The Affair, we learn many of the things that show up again and again in his stories......the 'I said nothing&#34; line really says a lot about Jack Reacher, for example..
B00004ST9Q|2.0|The dvd I received is not a real copy of dvd.......some songs that is not listed on the dvd case is not on the dvd.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This a great game!  I could play this all day!  I love the option of having a rematch with former teammates.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this video!  My husband has family in Scotland and this gave me another insight to it.  When my grandchildren are old enough to watch this, it will help them also see a part of their history.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Not what I expected when I started this book but, I couldn't put it down!!!!  A very fast and inspiring read!!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Wonderful story, well written and engrossing. I got a good sense of the culture and people. I gained a lot of historical information easily with Clavell's style of writing. Very enjoyable!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Has three sizes, works well, saves my hand! This is a good product to invest in saving your wrist from pain.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|I ordered all seven seasons, and was instantly hooked. All the charactors were fun following. I highly reccomend buying this tv series
B001NHNG64|5.0|First, let me say that I'm not a Lee Child kind of book lover.  I tend more to the romantic girly stuff.  However, on a recommendation I read my first Lee Child and I'm 100% hooked!  This particular book held my spell bound.  I found myself reading late into the night just to see what would happen.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants a gripping read.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Good.<br />It gives accurate forecasts.<br />Bad.<br />It installed a NON-REMOVEABLE always downloading sub app that cannot be turned off.  When you try to stop it using the Kindles app manager it is Not Even Listed.  I will have to try resetting to factory defaults and I hate it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was an excellent thought provoking insight into a part of the system that many of us never think about little own think about. This book is so much better than the tv series of how justice system is dysfunctional and needs to change!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have enjoyed this period peace.  I haven't seen a series as good since Upstairs and Downstairs.  I am looking forward to season 4 and hopefully, Edith will get her man.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|as much as I love Jack Reacher.  The book was hard to read and very boring.  I do not think I will ever purchase Lee's books again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|kindle version had some typos...other than that the story was great. The book has an interesting twist towards the end (no spoiler) but its not that hard to figure out. Was not a fan of the ending but still a great book.
1423140605|5.0|I have read all the Percy jacksons books and heroes of Olympus books. Riordan is my fav author but if anything happens to any of the seven demigods in house of hades ( especially Percy and annabeth) I will throw the book across the room. P.s. I luv u Rick riordan
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I've built 3 computers using the Antec 300, and have always been pleased with it.  The 302 just takes all the great things about the original and improves on them.  You really can't buy a better case for the money.  Antec has put a lot of nice finishing touches on this case that make it a real pleasure to build with.  And after running one of these for years in a house with 2 cats, I can say that the front mounted filter definitely makes a difference!  You have to block off the 2 side grates if you aren't going to mount fans in them, but after you've done this almost all the input air gets pulled in through that filter.  The USB 3.0 front ports are great, the extra space behind the mobo backplane is good for cooling and cable management.  I agree with others that a better SSD mounting solution will be nice, but they weren't mainstream when this case released, and its an easily fixed problem.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read it just because more than 20 thousand people rated it 4 stars. It's the most retarded, empty book I ever had in my hands. It should be under the porn category. My only guess is that the 4 stars were given by horny adolescents. It's the worst garbage utterly nonsense scenarios one could conceive.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|I found this book a little ridiculous. It is good if you ignore her advice and just read it as a life story, but the way it is written it assumes that the culture where you work is similar to FB.<br /><br />Seems a little short sighted.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|Lots of blood but lame and no new tricks. The charters don't die after repeated attacks and they seem super human much less the demons and witches. Lame Lame Lame..
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Everyone in the family enjoyed this one. Even our 4 year old sceptic was laughing and wanted to watch again right after it was over!
B000FC130E|5.0|An exciting and creative story that takes the reader on a perilous journey to a London you've never heard of.  Well written and gripping, a great novel for those readers who like page-turners with a lot of pace.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Loved the concept of litle children ruthlessly used by the powers that be.  Loved the Speaker of the Dead concept also.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Everything about this was classic good Si-Fi except Tom Cruise.  In fact, spoiler alert, there is a piece of the story line that is so Cruise that it screws up the story.  I mean really, clones of him??? gezzz...<br /><br />Otherwise this is a well executed Si-Fi with excellent special effects, a great story line, and a dystopian future that is easy to accept. Still I give it 4 of 5 because I can (sorta) ignore that it is Cruise.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Smash shows that Steven Spieberg simply blows with the wind and innovates little today, as he had done decades ago.  His early 1970's movie, Duel, set new standards in drama without smearing political correctness into the face of movie viewers, his simply relying on good entertainment values that offended no one.<br /><br />If Spielberg had put this much hetero and homo sex into ET as he did into Smash, it would have found itself in porn shops and not in movie theaters for family viewing.  He is a true disappointment for familes looking for titles that anyone from 7 to 70 can watch, enjoy, and cheer for on the American values that made this country a magnet for immigrants since the end of the Civil War.<br /><br />But that is all gone now, as Lech Walesa, the famous Polish Freedom Fighter who risked his life and his family's life from the Russian Bear of the USSR and given a Noble Peace Prize for that bravery, noted in 2010 that America was no longer the moral leader in the world.  Lech Walesa was also the same man that America's current president ignored.  When it rains, it pours.
0385341008|5.0|I struggled at the beginning with the unique nature of the book (the story is told through letter writing), but once I got into the rhythm of the book it was a breeze.  This was a purchase for a friend who was visiting England.  I know she'll love it too.  :-)
B009G41CG2|5.0|The game is colorful and fast.  I find having words that say hint, shuffle etc easier than trying remember symbols for same.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Sorry, but the animation of the characters is just a bit too grizzly for kids and the story is a bit too childish for adults.<br /><br />I'd been looking forward to this for awhile but if you want to see a similar story (Johnny Depp wonderfully plays a guy form a foreign time or place) go get Dark Shadows. Its got Depp at his best, Michelle Pfeiffer, lushes Eva Green, (bonus Helena Bonham Carter) and its directed by Tim Burton.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song just makes me so happy and just want to Jump up and dance around. Love the beat and Guess what we all live for the applause so deal with it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have to admit but I don't know the purpose of this game.  I was told to buy it (by a professional Internet nerd).  However, I do know you can get special virtual gold coins plus other virtual prizes. It is entertaining for shorts periods of time by hitting the slot making coins appear.  The truth is; I'm keeping the game in the hopes that I'll soon benefit from it.
B00AFPVPDG|3.0|If you really want to learn how to effectively learn anything read \\"Talent Code\\" by Daniel Coyle and or his second book \\"The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for improving your skills.\\"<br /><br />I almost passed up on reading \\"The First 20 hours\\" after reading negative reviews but figured i would give it a shot because of two chapters that most people mentioned. Well while reading Kaufmans book i realized that his Rapid Skills Acquisition is paraphrase of Coyles rules for acquiring new skills.<br /><br />They both mention the same studies and authors. In short if you want a very comprehensive explanation that is clear and easy to follow without allot of fluff. Read \\"The Little Book of Talent by Coyle.<br /><br />If you wish to read a book about how well the \\"The Little Book of Talent\\" works when properly applied then read Josh Kaufman's book.<br /><br />The reason i gave 3 stars instead of 2 is because even if you read \\"The First 20 hours\\" the first two chapters are worth reading even if they are plagiarized from a different author.
1577314808|4.0|Very strategic book.  Requires &#34;quiet&#34; time to read taking in only small segments to fully comprehend.  This book will change your thinking about the mind controlling your ego.  Karl
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|I probably haven`t read enough Chandler to agree or disagree with those comparisons. My first thought was Elmore Leonard meets Larry Nivven. My lasting impressions include Cormac McCarthy and Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />This fiction elevated above the genres. Just well written top to bottom.<br /><br />I've had enough experience reading  digitally now to assume that the repeated typos were translation  errors rather than present in the original manuscript but someone please fix them. Morgan's attention to every detail deserves no less.<br /><br />My only criticism is the nearly perfect set direction quality of the book. I know it's being made into a movie and a lot of elements seemed crafted with that in mind. It grew a little tedious after a while to read through exhaustive descriptions of places we would never come back to.<br /><br />Nowhere near tedious enough to prevent me from coming back for more. I purchased the second book before I wrote this review.<br /><br />Keep it coming.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have found this challenging at times, but very well worth the time! I got hung up on a couple levels. If you love seeking and finding you will love it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was epic. I am excited where WB is going to take this franchise. I am also excited to see the Batman/Superman Justice League battles.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This was a gift from my Son to his older Sister, for her Birthday. This young musician has been doing a &#34;bang up&#34; job on the internet and caught both of their attention. Nice to hear a contemporary artist that can introduce a new generation to the violin. My daughter loved her gift.
159463176X|4.0|This was a very good book, I have enjoyed all of Hosseini's books, brings the culture alive to his readers.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|If you enjoyed Cheese then racine carrée should be a pleasant surprise, with more hits in the vein of te quiero and alors on danse.
B007XELMO4|5.0|This product worked exactly how I needed it.  I allowed me quick and easy access to my dlsr camera. The trade off is when ever take off your bag (for me a 65 liter backpack) you first have to disconnect the camera.<br /><br />Also all the accessories you get are nice, like the hand strap, and security strap.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed of this product. I was trying to watch a movie on megashare website and is not working at all. I do not recommend this product to my enemies.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|This was the first of the franchise. It has a great story line, along with the 90's special effects. With actors Sam Neill and the beautiful Laura Dern you can't go wrong.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My daughter loved this movie when we got it on Netflix, so I bought a copy to keep at home. Everything about the movie is great; the characters, plot and especially the music. Highly recommend!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|What more can I say?  Oh, brother now it tells me that I needed 15 more words for a review....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I haven't had any issues with it thus far! I like the versions available, easy to navigate and use! Thanks!
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|I have only listened to this twice.  Both times I could not get into it at all.  The previous album was just okay but this one seems to be another step in the downward spiral.<br /><br />I know they all can't be great.  The earlier albums are classics that I still listen to on a regular basis.<br /><br />I hope he can turn this around.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Can't believe it's taken me two years to see it. Highly recommend to anyone who likes action, a good family drama, and some awesome fight scenes.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was great! It's been a long time since I read a book that I couldn't put down!! Fantastic!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|An astounding and epic story about the harrowing experiences of a Jewish family during World War Two. It starts like a nostalgic romance story but soon, as growing anti-Semitism begins to rear its ugly head, the story becomes an epic struggle for survival. Christoph Fischer's wonderfully descriptive writing style gives an authentic feel of the era. I found myself feeling real concern for the superbly drawn characters as they  desperately try to avoid being detected by the Nazis. The Luck of the Weissensteiners (The Three Nations Trilogy) is a truly beautiful historic suspense that I would recommend to just about anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i love every single character on these series..hope there are many more series..they keep me awake at nite..watching one episode after another..
B001L5YW9I|5.0|My favorite Michael Mann film, by a mile. Acting, music, cinematography: all exemplary.  This is a necessary staple of any film library
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Lots of meaningless action.  Would not recommend  this movie to anyone, not even my mother in law.  &#34;F&#34; rated movie if that's possible.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|A pretty good and impressive program.  At times it can become frustrating when it keeps telling you it can't find a close match on a popular song.  Granted, that only happens a few times,but still........
1907590099|5.0|I am going to keep this short. The book is short but must be read over and over again to determine what he is talking about. Good for a person with an IQ of 150+. The author's vocabulary seems to indicate that a entire new dictionary is needed. I would suggest this book to all hipsters. An especially fine book who are experimenting with &#34;Substance&#34;
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Re-reading-  Vonnegut all over again- still as fresh as when they first were written. If you haven't read any of his books, you should.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is the best game. you should try it. its awesome<br />you get to be a zombie and you get to be samurai also.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is one of the best games ever invented.  It can be challenging at times, but you always have the chance to re-do each stage to gain a much better score, and have fun doing so.  New levels and stages, as well as updates, seem to be offered at a regular pace ~  much more so than other games.  The only drawback with this app is the constant and expensive in-app purchases needed  in order to obtain the special and more powerful attackers.  But, expensive in-app purchases seem to be a problem with every new app introduced, not just this game.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I have had no problem with this watch in any way.  Excellent product.  Would not wear this when working in hot environment.  Sweat makes the band run leaving a lead colored ring around your wrist.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|I have not read comics for years.  This was a great story to get me interested in comics again!  Recommened.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an awesome game. With amazing graphics, challenging puzzles, and a creepy yet compelling story. I can't wait for the next installment!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Harvey and Mike never have a dull moment. Great tv show for everyone to watch. Something new in ever episode.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is greater than anything hollywood has produced in the past 15 years.  This is a short, charming, movie that will leave you humming it's music for years after.  Personally, I've watched it over 40 times and still love it.  Nuff said.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|book. and i guess i need to type 12  more words. nine more now. it's a good book. really good.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|A bunch of us was travelling to New Orleans in a van and it got even their attention. We all watched it and enjoyed it.
B0018AO9T4|5.0|Quality of the recording is outstanding.<br />The band is tight, Morrison sounds really good on these tracks.<br />I've listened to it on CD, MP3 and thought it was very good. then I spun up the 180g vinyl  LP<br />and was blown away!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|A great addition to the evangelion franchise.  Fun, flashy, even non-anime fans seem to enjoy it.  Can't beat it! ^_^
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Set in England in the 1300's the story covers the intrigue and power the Church had at that time. It follows the lives of three people in particular and their efforts to improve themselves in their living conditions and their goals in life.against the powers of the church and the rich lords.The &#34;black plague&#34; plays a major role in depleting the population of the villages and impacting on their hopes for the future.<br /><br />An enjoyable story you will find hard to put down. .
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love it!! I wish there were levels to it though. I think having levels would make it more challenging or at least give you a sense of achievement instead of the same over and over. Like the automatic option that you chose. That option makes it more challenging.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For only 35 dollars, this was an truly awesome product.  It work as well as products costing 4 times.  It works very similar to Airplay.
B00B9366VO|5.0|The amount of music history produced at Sound City is amazing. Finely presented by Dave Grohl, I feel this should be watched by any music fan out there.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Kind of confusing. It's a fun game but . Needs to recharge energy way to often. The directions are not . Very helpful  I really enjoy . Playing but am increasingly frustrated
B00ECUARO8|4.0|It was ok to watch while I travel. There could be more to the story line but I watched it to the end so it entertained me.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is an excellent inside look at a recording studio that helped make American rock n' roll really rock.  Grohl and friends found a way to turn their passion into the perfect technical and cultural music documentary.  I never would have thought of Rick Springfield, for example, as an important part of our music's history, but his success and what it meant to Sound City made that clear. This is only one of many enlightening tidbits Grohl squeezes into the film.  If you're heavy into American rock and its history, this is a must see, and the fact that this amazing equipment is still in use lends a degree of purity to some of what we hear even today.  Dave's interview with Mr. Neve and commentary from Neil Young, Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks and others are classic!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written with a good theme.  Not quite as good as his first two books, but it is hard to match excellence.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|My husband bought me this as a surprise.  It was a great surprise and just what I wanted!  Love it!
B000023VR6|1.0|The best songs like The next episode and forgot about dre are totally blank no scratches but an indention on disc which fail to play half the cd.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a page-turner and very interesting. Loved the plot and the characters were pretty compelling. would recommend to friends.
B009R659L8|5.0|You never get the full story until the very end and every little detail is explained and tied together. I couldn't even take a stab in the dark at who the culprit was until about 40 or 50  pages from the end. Definitely one of her best!! A true page turner and one of those books that make you Leary of starting another one right away because you know the next book you choose will never live up to this one.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is a fast, easy read that deals with resistance in its many forms and how crippling it can really be.  I now see resistance for what it is.  The cure, of course, is to just sit down and do the work.  It was interesting to read how Steven Pressfield overcame his obstacles caused by resistance, and how he learned to understand all of its many disguises.  Anyone could benefit from this book, and not just artists or aspiring writers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I honestly can't get enough of these books!<br />I wish there were 3 more! I honestly read these in like a week
B007HC3LHS|3.0|The book was definitely compelling and I had a hard time putting it down, but it was pretty far-fetched too. A beach book.
1568363931|5.0|A very nicely done book. It's not all about making the food fussy, it's about making you want to eat your lunch and appreciate your food. Just enough direction to get you making anything from super traditional to totally random I-dug-this-out-of-my-freezer lunches that are both appealing and filling, with some imagination.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My gf recommended this tv show to me and I saw it was available on Amazon Prime so I decided to check it out. Now I'm hooked. Very original concept and reminds me a little bit of The X-Files. If you're into Sci Fi then this is a good series to look at.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed the third book I felt like it just closed things up from the first book and didn't introduce anything new definitely left me guessing for the fourth book...
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|usb cable works good,came on time would recommend to others. i do not know what to say . it' a cable!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I did not like the television show or the early movies. These last two movies have been great. I can't wait he for the next one.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|I'm really not what you'd call a big fan of Scott Kelby. I think that he's damn good at what he does photography wise, but it's all the selling & pushing that he does business wise, that tends to turn me off a bit. That said, I didn't expect that I would really have been very happy with this book, but after just previewing it on line I decided to buy it. Although I haven't gotten too far into it yet, it's probably gone further into explaining how to organize your files & folders, & done so better than the other books that I've read on the subject. The book is well written & easy to read, & that's exactly what instructional books should be. I expect that the rest of it should be as good, so I've given it 5 stars even at this early point in the read. Check it out!<br />jmk-nbsc
B00BZAYZ82|5.0|Das Boot is a great movie.  The synthesized music is a bit annoying, but the movie is tremendous.<br />Some of the effects could be better, but overall a job well done.<br />I like the longer version and typically watch this with the german audio.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading about this time in British History - and especially like this one as it delves further into the plots....only difficulty I am having is that Henry VIII is not what he has been shown as he is in this version - he is fit and  trim and also quite healthy!
B00336G7HI|5.0|This is the smallest of the NP-FV batteries.  It is the one that comes with your new camcorder, and it claims to be capable of 344 minutes of record time.  Better is the NP-FV 70.  You can, for a hundred plus, get an NP-FV100 battery.  Each is bigger in size, but the camera is so small, it is not even a concern.  One nice thing about these \\"info lithium\\" batteries is that they share info through the camera with time left on record.  It lets you see where you are in battery life.  We use the Sony DCR-SX85B Handycam camera with the NP-FV70 as the main battery, and the original FV-50 as our backup.  You'll want to get the travel charger or you'll be stuck with your camera in charge mode when you want to be recording something or shooting snapshots.  We like the OEM equipment.  There are plenty of internet horror stories about third party equipment and it's short life of service.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is fantastic.  I got it because I had read it was a cross between Little Big Planet and Mario; and it certainly lives up to that.  It is so much fun and clean and not too difficult (but not super easy either).  I find myself wanting to rush through it because it's so much fun, but going back to replay levels to gather more silver buttons to buy new outfits.  The game contains four chapters, with each chapter containing 4 levels.  While the game is kinda short and I do really hope they had future levels, it's WELL worth the $0.99 I paid for it... I'd say it would still be worth it even if they charged more.<br /><br />The game comes with three extras.  First is a halloween themed chapter with 6 levels.  Second is a Valentine themed chapter; I'm not sure how many levels yet since you need to complete the main mission in it's entirety to unlock it. Third is a Drag n Dash minigame; while this minigame is a ton of fun and a great way to gather more silver buttons, it is very glitchy; I'm not judging the game based on this glitch since it's not part of the main story, but it would be very nice if it got fixed.<br /><br />If Crescent Moon continues coming out with more games of this caliber, I will be a loyal customer.
0425263924|5.0|Enjoying this series more then 50 Shades of Gray. Can't wait for book 4 and 5 to come out!! Definite read for Sylvia Day fans.
B002PNJ9QQ|1.0|Don't waste your time or your money on this movie.  Although the actors are consummate (Sidney, River, Loretta, etc.) the script was poor and the look of it appeared to be a B movie.  Will not recommend to anyone.  I wish I could get a refund.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I am never disappointed in any of Lisa Gardner's book. They go quickly and are very entertaining! Pick one and enjoy!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far so good this app is been working flawlessly,I really can't complain about the way it performances. This is a really good app
1400052181|4.0|I just finished this book and I really liked it! I thought the author did a fantastic job with this story...Very detailed in the history of Hela and the Lacks family. I did get annoyed at times with the family.  I don't know how the author tolerated them for as long as she did. I would've been quit this book idea! lol
140006922X|5.0|I have dozens of books about Jesus and this is one of the best summaries of legitimate scholarship I've read.<br /><br />Rev. Dr. David Sammons<br />Interim Senior Minister<br />San Francisco UU Church
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Do yourself a favor and watch this.  The history behind behind Sound City is amazing and you would be hard pressed to even imagine it.  The soundtrack and a few of Tom Petty's and Neil Young's one liners from the interviews are great.  The footage from all the artists that have recorded there is cool.  There is at some point something for everyone and all musical tastes.  The new music for the film is f'n great too.<br />Watch it
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was scrolling through free ebooks on Amazon. I didn't know what to expect. However, in my subconscious mind I knew I needed something to resurrect all the ideas I let lay doormat in my mind. This is,just what I needed. Beautifully written and very inspirational. Thank you!
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|From what I've researched, this movie does a fairly accurate job of showing what happened with the Apollo 13 mission. I don't want to spoil anything, so keeping this short, this movie could not have been made any better. The special effects were done so well you feel like you're right there with the astronauts. Buy this movie, and buy it in the Blu-ray format. You will not be disappointed.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|You can't really fault this app; it does what it sets out to do, and does it well enough. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is that they can only fit so many ways to edit a photo into an Android app.<br /><br />It's still very good, though.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|It's a good fun app but you have to buy most of the animals and that sucks. I love the app though
B008602KQI|4.0|Read the book and wondered what the movie would be like.  I enjoyed it. Not a great movie but worthwhile watching.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This band is very fun to listen to. You will catch yourself singing along.. They are the up and coming group.
B009LDD590|5.0|Great show that depicts the mafia in atlantic city, new jersey.<br />High quality story line with great actors and actresses.
B0058SNNOE|3.0|These did not fit my footies as good as I thought they would.  I think they are cut on the smaller size or defective.<br />The  button was problematic for me.  I will look at other designs.  When you get a good fit, they are GREAT!
B000W8HC8I|4.0|This book was long, but such an easy read. It kept my attention the entire time and was extremely interesting.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|A true classic.  Worthy of its reputation, this film never fails to entertain.  Great cast, memorable dialogue and a compelling score.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Great show that depicts the mafia in atlantic city, new jersey.<br />High quality story line with great actors and actresses.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is perfect. it is just hard enough to satisfy, and well thought out. I can't wait for more levels!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Got this game recently and its freaking awesome. You take the vehicles you have and try to drive as far as you can on the courses laid out. Mostly hills. You can improve your vehicles by purchasing upgrades with the coins you've collected. It does allow you to purchase coins with real money but you can easily avoid this. No hidden pop-ups to trick you into buying anything. The further you go the harder it gets hence the upgrades. Loads of fun for any age. I highly recommend this game!<br /><br />Spoiler/Cheat Tip: Try to unlock your race car and moon landscape first. You can easily rack up coins here by using the cars speed to do front and back flips. Big coins achieved here!!!
B006VREHRS|4.0|Loved it and can't wait to start watching season 2! Love Steve Buscemi he makes a great bad guy that you can't help but love.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. I wish I could have more coins and bingo tokens daily but I can't so other than that I love it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works just as advertised.  Streaming of Netflix and YouTube works well.  Streaming from the Chrome browser is fine but it requires a fairly fast laptop to encode/stream local video files.<br /><br />I bought this to use while traveling for work.  I would give it more stars if I was able to stream from more sources (which I'm sure is coming).  Pretty much have to bring a small travel router with me for use in hotels.  I can use my LTE hot spot but video eats my data plan too fast for extended use.<br /><br />Looking forward to the future of this product.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've seen this game for years and I thought &#34;What a load of ****.&#34; I never took the time to try it but now that I have I'm hooked! This is a great game that gets the mind working. Eventually the first level (one suit) becomes easy and you have to challenge yourself with 2 then 3 suits. Hours of fun.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I have always loved this movie. Had to share it with the grandkids ! They thought it was going to be scary, but loved it.
B00CO5AQ12|4.0|This stuff is awesome.  It feels unique in your hands and it's mesmerizing to watch it constantly crumble.  From the video, I expected to be able to mold it a little more solidly than I can, but then having it always break apart is part of the fun.  Also, 2.2 pounds of sand is more than you might think when it's all spread out on a table.<br /><br />It's not quite as \\"clean\\" as the video describes it, either.  It definitely left an oily residue on the table where I was playing with it.  It's also a lie that it only sticks to itself.  I would say it mostly sticks to itself, but there was some stuck to my hands and some even seemed to stick to the table when I was trying to put it away.  Nothing a quick, soapy wipe-down can't remedy.<br /><br />To everyone warning against getting it wet: the box states that if it gets wet, simply let it air dry somewhere with low humidity and it'll return to its original texture.  Nothing long-term to worry about there.<br /><br />There was a question of ingredients.  It's covered by US patent 7,862,894 ([...] which says the binding agent is \\"a hydroxy-terminated polymer cross-linked by a boron compound, in particular a silicone oil\\".  Some googling indicates that the \\"polydimethyl siloxane\\" B. Shivers suggested might be accurate, though I can find no definitive source.  Certainly no phthalates.<br /><br />All in all I'm happy to be able to play with this amazing substance!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My daughter and I enjoyed reading this book together and shared lots of laughs! I would recommend this book. A
B00AYXNKIC|3.0|The game is fine. Graphics are good. However, I'm so tired of everything getting a &#34;Social&#34; link to it. I don't want to play with other people. If I did I'd go outside and do it. I gave it 3 stars for making me have to skip the (play against) page.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|its a nice idea, only problem is that i have not had a chance to use it yet due to the fact that i have not run the battery down that low to plug it back in to get a full charge...people call me so i can recharge my legend.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It is a must see.  Sheldon is hilarious.  This show keeps me laughing and delighted.  Please show more of Sheldon's mom, remember her from Roseanne.  Genius!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|There are just a few of \\"those\\" shows that are in the same category of awesome. Suits is one of \\"those\\" on Par with Dexter, Weeds, Walking Dead and Breaking Bad
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Out standing movie, interesting story, good acting, and I love anything that JJ does, can't wait for the next installment.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Games for grandson he didn't care for them.  Not what he thought he was getting, only five, changes his mind alot
B005HED11Y|5.0|The sound and picture were very good.  Star Trek is such a trip back in time.  It is fun to see the actors back when they were young.  It is also interesting to see the social differences from that era and now.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Love his voice and creativity. I saw his concert and then bought the album. Now I can relive some of the memories.
1401938906|5.0|I liked the way the author made scientific facts easy to understand and used humour to bring these facts to light. I also liked the practical ways one can put these natural laws into practise, and put them to the test so to speak.<br />People can expect to be excited by the information in this book, and will find it easy, understandable, and empowering if put to use.<br />Pam Gout's work reminds me of &#34;Mind Power for the Twenty First Century&#34; written by John Kehoe.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it was just what I was looking for. It reminded me of temple run and subway suffers. I absolutely love it.I don't think u know how much I LOVE THIS GAME
B0049KWAVY|5.0|This CD was quite expensive but it was worth it.  I really enjoy it and I love to sing along .
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|He incorporates a few different genres. It's great that he is versatile. I saw him in concert and he was awesome. It just makes the album even better.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show ever. Very entertaining and fun, at the same time. I enjoy watching The chemistry between Donna and Harvey.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive.relaxes you and keeps you. coming  back for more' I love the thrill and excitment
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Loved it,cross between Downton Abbey and Little House on the Prairie.  I am into the second season and still liking it.
1594204217|5.0|I am a Pollan disciple.  If he writes it, I want to read it, and as soon as I finish reading, I head for the kitchen and start cooking.  He has had a profound effect on the way I feel about food and its importance to my emotional well-being as well as to my physical health.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is proof that you should not trust what the media says about movies.  I watched John Carter the other night with my fiance and both of us liked it very much.  It was entertaining throughout.  The special effects were spot on. After watching this though we were pissed that they aren't gonna be making anymore...which is a damn shame IMO.  This blu ray will definitely be watched again in our household in the near future!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Cute, very entertaining movie with a perfect ending. Audrey Toutou was darling as the central character and perfect for the part.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A solid scifi movie without any extra gimic. Did not feel like the movie was long. Plenty of twist to keep you watching.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|this was an awesome price, and so glad it was on sale-- great series, came in right on time! Can't wait to collect all the sereis!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love this movie! I saw it 4 times at the theater and I have already watch my digital copy 3 times! It's just so much fun! I'm a trek lover, but even if you aren't, I'm sure you'll find this movie super entertaining. The enterprise crew is PERFECTLY cast and the &#34;bad guy&#34; is mesmerizing. I could not take my eyes off the dude! Mostly out of fear! He was frightening and intriguing all at the same time. In fact, I have become a huge fan of the bad guy (Benedict Cumberbatch) just from watching this movie. Good job for the Cumberbatch fella. 5 stars for him for sure!<br /><br />If you want some good ole' fashion space action fun, then STID is the movie for you.
B00EKSLK1Q|5.0|I almost regretted buying this album when &#34;I am A Cuckoo&#34; started.  I did not like the remix at all.  A few songs stood out for me such as Eighth Station of The Cross Kebab, I Didn't See it Coming (a little like a dance mix), Passion Fruit, and Mr. Richard.  Your Cover's Blown was extremely intricate with variations all through.<br /><br />There's plenty to like with plenty of different types of song styles.  If you're a fan or even if you've never heard them before, I'd get it.
1452126577|3.0|Not a brilliant work of literature but a funny 10 min read.  I would recommend it for fans of the meme.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is the best and if some one else has the app you can have a war<br />The reason I think this app is the best is because it never gets boring
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Keeps you guessing every step of the way. Exciting and fast paced. You will want to keep reading just to see what happens next.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|About as good a movie about the mob as you can find.  Seeing this you realize where the inspiration for The Sopranos came from.  It's always engaging, often funny, and more often than not, frightening.
B00AZLBIAA|5.0|i love it it works great<br />I has never failed me yet try it you will love it too okay
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like it, actually i think this one was kind of the best of all three books, you should read it
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The premise behind Oblivion is clever, and somewhat disconcerting, quite like Duncan Jones' &#34;Moon.&#34;  However, the basic plot twist becomes fairly obvious about half way through the movie, leaving the second half rather flat.  For sci-fi lovers, it is worth renting for a night, but I don't see this one being ranked among the classics.
B009NY43NY|2.0|... and this simply follows the last few books that I feel she mailed it in. It's a sad ending to a series that was phenomenal the first eight or so books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I first got this, I thought that it was the worst game in the whole world. When I played it,the game was the most addicting game ever! Try it NOW!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. My three year old would spend hours watching me play, if I could spend that much time playing.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|simple and addicting game. only drawback is you can only play when connected to the net. works great on kindle file 1st ed
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|...as I was surprised based on the reviews but a simple movie that went quickly and left me satisfied in what I spent and how I enjoyed it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When I first started this game I thought it was a cheap and goofy app.  But after playing it for a while, it became my favorite game.  It is so fun to race and upgrade your cars and courses.  I have to remember to make myself I will play it for hours.  It is worth checking out esp if you like racing games.
B008GM1FPI|5.0|Here's the thing, everything about this movie is worthy of attention. Everything that is said is relevant, without beating around the bush. It is truth and art.
0525425772|1.0|I was going to buy this for my hubby as he loves Grisham and has read many.... In the end I did not bother looking thro it in the book store I was immediately put off by the size of the script. There must have been about 7 words on a line and 15 to 20 lines on a page. Was this for people with bad eyesight or early readers? I thought it was a bit of a cop out really to expect people to pay 30 dollars for appears on the face of it not much of a book. If I were to give this to my loved one I think he might feel I was having a go at his age and that he might need glasses or a magnify glass!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Love the  movement and the action upper cut jab and the slapping plus I can customize his look to cool or funny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. Every one I know loves it too. It keeps you thinking. I love it. It is the best.
140006922X|5.0|This is a very good book.  It's available now at Sam's for less.  But the content of the book is great.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I'm once again in awe of what these guys can do and what they actually do...<br />This book had me in tears. It's so unbelievable to think that there are people who actually put their own lives at risk, in the way described in this book...to read how selfless and honourable they are...just an absolutely wonderful true story :)
B0081336FO|3.0|I think the title of this review says it all.  Not a bad show, the mysteries are interesting for sure but I somehow always feel like I'm watching House be a dick as mysteries get solved.  Either way, enjoyable to an extent but be careful of the 90 minute run-time on each episode.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put the book down...grabbed me from the beginning and could put the book down at times it felt as if the story was real. Now can only hope that there's a movie :)
0802473156|5.0|This book helps your understand how love is best communicated to you and how other best receive the communication of love.  Want a great gift for a new couple?  This book is a great choice,  It could help you avoid some frustration in your relationships.
B008X5XP9M|5.0|This book is an eye opener. I saw the movie many years ago and didn't really comprehend the magnitude of what happened in that battle...maybe I was too young when the movie was released. The battle described by the author from the point of view of the Rangers and Delta Force is written in a way I've never experienced before in a book. Fast moving action, with the personal experiences of various soldiers. It is unbelievable that so much carnage could happen in such a relatively short time, even though this battle definitely felt like an eternity to the guys who were fighting the good fight. Once again a sad story about the cost of good vs. evil, and the amazing people who are willing to give up everything to fight that fight. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates this type of book, it is truly gripping and it has had such an effect on me that I am constantly shopping for more of the same :)
B005PK57NU|5.0|Season three is great, worth watching especially right now when new programming has not started for the fall. The story lines are easy to follow while still being very interesting.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|been using feedly alot one of the best rss readers out there enjoyed on my laptop and I enjoy it on my Kindle as well
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I think this book is awesome because duh it's the hunger games and now I can't wait til the next book
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|I have had the original free version since I bought the Kindle (fire HD if we must get technical). I enjoyed the original, many of choices and easy to use, totally fun my favourite application to use. Today I went to use it and they had mucked up the free version. The price on the pro is very close to free so I decided to get it. The color variants are still delightful and they added new frames. I really love number 11. They added a new cropping tool that could be useful but for the picture I wanted to post (Facebook) I wanted the full picture. It took me three tries to get what I wanted. I wish their was just a button for no crop instead of needing to adjust with your fingers. I would accidentally go out of range and it would make a tiny box so you have to readjust. That is my only complaint on the new version but you can turn the cropping option off in the settings. I recommend this app, it's a peach.
0525952926|5.0|I feel as if I am transported back in time. I love reading and ending up feeling as if I have also received a history lesson.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Ms. Morton's stories weave intigrue, a bit of mystery, family and feelings so well. this one is no exception. While her books follow a similiar formula they are engaging and entertaining.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Must read if you like music or the chilli peppers. Very well written, but not to over detailed that you get bored with it.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Happy Feet made me \\"happy\\" to watch a movie about stepping out of a comfort zone and being yourself. It is also about excepting who and what you are even if you don't fit the mold of everyone else around you. There are some sad parts in it but it is an awesome teaching tool for children and adults alike. My favorite part is the end of course. Too see what I am talking about get the movie! It is awesome with a capital A!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Beautiful period drama serial.  The kind that only the Brits can do right.<br /><br />Might be a bit soapy for some.  But the period atmosphere and fine acting make up for that.
B004S5FVJS|5.0|such an entertaining writer. I always enjoy his books and the Camel Club books are a good example. keep them coming please
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|For a century, the Statists have steadfastly constructed a federal Leviathan, distorting and evading our constitutional system in pursuit of an all-powerful, ubiquitous central government. The result is an ongoing and growing assault on individual liberty, state sovereignty, and the social compact. Levin argues that if we cherish our American heritage, it is time to embrace a constitutional revival.<br /><br />The delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and the delegates to each state's ratification convention foresaw a time when—despite their best efforts to forestall it—the Federal government might breach the Constitution's limits and become oppressive. Agencies such as the IRS and EPA and programs such as Obamacare demonstrate that the Framers' fear was prescient.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This was possibly one of the worst movies I have ever watchED; utterly improbable, disjointed and very difficult to follow. Simple put, A TERRIBLE MOVIE!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I really enjoy the story lines and getting to know the characters.  Have to close my eyes at times when the heads roll, but am looking forward to Season 3.
B004P4O87I|5.0|It met my expectation and was longer than I thought. Commander Cody looks so cool in this set; especially cause it comes with neck protection.
B001N3ELTO|1.0|blew.  Amazon is making me type 19 more words to fill in the space.  The only reason I'm doing it is to keep people that like good films away from this.  The dialogue is absolutely terrible.  The story progession is spotty at best and the acting was quite poor.  Trust me, you've seen Al Pacino do a much better job.  I understand that this film was made early in his career, but this was just poorly directed.  The story had the potential to be made into a very good, interesting film.  But, the producers missed the mark.  I hated it.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Lots  of action.  it's weird seeing the action heros of yesteryear getting old.  But they all still put on a good show.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Love the graphs. It has a sleek appeal, too bad the radar doesn't work. Its just blank. I downloaded it twice about three months apart and it still doesn't work.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am currently rereading book 2 so that my mind will be fresh when I go to see the movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was very compelling and it definitely captured me. The deeper I got into the book the hard it was to stop. I think it did a good job at offering a stroy as well as asking deeper questions.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Sometimes when I'm having my ritualistic daily crying session in the shower I often think about my lost youth; velcro shoes, slap bracelets, day glo, and Sloth. Sometimes all you need is a giant drooling man to really put things into perspective for you. While the world upstairs is dealing with the day to day rig-a-ma-roll, it's good to know that it's our time down here; where slick shoes and girly bikes are socially acceptable ways of transportation. If that doesn't do it for you, at least there's Cyndi Lauper to lull you into a false sense of security with her siren song.
1416972242|5.0|I feel the balance of the world has been restored now that I can obsess over something else than Twilight.<br /><br />The kiss b/w Jace and Clary in this book... holy sword of the angel, I could feel it all over my body!<br /><br />And no, I don't think it's weird that they kiss because deep in my heard I know they are NOT brothers. They are not, right? Besides, you don't suddenly have a brother because you are told so, you need to grow up seeing the other person as a brother and all that. As Valentine himself said in the last pages of the book.<br /><br />I absolutely love Jace arrogance and wit.<br /><br />Simon... will he turn into something gorgeous and eatable like Jacob (in Twilight) because right now I get seriously pissed with him for pushing his love to Clary.<br /><br />Magnus... why, in the name of the Angel, did Clare write another series just about him? He doesn't do anything outstanding. And if I go by the movie, which is by what I'm going, he is not even remarkable. Okay, this is only book 2.<br /><br />Alec... I like that he is quite and can display human emotions once in a while.<br /><br />Izzy... Yeap, like her too.<br /><br />Over all, I found myself enjoying book #2 way too much, given that I loathed book 1.<br /><br />I've read that Clare's writing style is insipid and blah blah blah. Well, so people said of Stephanie Meyer and look what's happened.<br /><br />Anyway, we all can collectively love a book because then, it would be very weird, and bloggers wouldn't have books to trash.<br /><br />I'm going to take a short break before reading book 3 because I am aware that there are 20 other books sitting on my Kindle waiting for me.<br /><br />Until later, Jace.
B006O5YIMQ|4.0|My grown son wanted to watch a movie with me so he chose this one knowing I am always looking for an uplifting message. I cannot believe I can say I enjoyed a movie(it is uplifting) with cage fighting, but I did!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Diane Lane is awesome!  The story is amazing and the final race is by far the most riveting thing I have ever seen.  Everyone should watch this movie!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This show had me from the very beginning.  That rarely happens.  It is well written and well acted.  Loving Peg Bundy as Gemma Teller!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The book was to scattered and was into too much detail about who was related to whom. It certainly does not in my opinion compare to the Lord of the Rings.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Love the characters, love the acting, love the writing....what more can I say? Now I need to write more per the requirements of posting....nonsense.
0880794968|5.0|What can I say? Just buy the deck and youll see you will love this deck. lol  The decks illustrations are beautiful. The back of the cards are black with stars on them and they just fit into your hands so nice, especially if your like me that has small hands! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00190N4E4|5.0|Nicely covers the highlights of Gandhi's life and times.  A bit long, but would watch more anytime to see their interpretation of other events in Gandhi's life.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is really really fun and I  easy for anyone to play so buy it!!!!!<br />Yahoo it is so good and fun so I think u should buy it now
B0081336FO|4.0|A bit darker than season one but still a great series. Cannot wait for season 3.....please? More writing again? Apparently Amazon does not believe in brevity!
B006WWU8IO|4.0|Taylor Swift has an appealing voice and way with music that is easy to listen to. The MP3 down load can be listened to in my car.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I don't know if you read your book reviews or not, Jaycee, but thank you for sharing your story.  It is important for people to read this because it explains so clearly and so well how people get trapped mentally and psychologically, even when they are no longer trapped physically.  Also, I want to say that whatever \\"angels\\" may or may not have been guiding Phillip certainly did not come from God.  God is the opposite of Phillip.  God is love and kindness and anything that is not loving or kind does not come from Him.  Also, God doesn't force himself on anyone and will not intervene in our lives until we request Him to.  May God bless you, Jaycee.  If you accept His blessings say \\"amen\\".  If you don't, that is your choice.  May you NEVER have ANYTHING forced on you again.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the very best shows. I have become totally addicted. The acting and the storylines pulled me in from the very first episode.
B0068FYZIO|2.0|I ordered this used with the title of almost new but the CD has rather large scratches and is cracked in the center where is connects to the case hole in middle.  The crack just is starting to work it's way into the CD similar to a cracked car window. I guess almost new is not very good.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these headphones for quite some time at the gym and love them.  They are lightweight and the sound is very good.  Prefer these to the earbuds as the earbuds don't seem to stay in my ears very well.<br />So glad Amazon carries these as I had previously purchased them in a local store who don't stock them anymore.<br />Hope they don't discontinue these headphones.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its great. I use it almost everyday for financial reasons. I can keep track of my spending balance.  I love. It.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I didn't pay attention to this show until the third season, by then I had no idea what was going on, so I didn't watch it. I'm starting from beginning, it a very powerful show.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|superb performances which allows one to experience the the nazi regime in it sociopathic and depraved illness as it truly was and is of all genocide
B007IK44CK|4.0|Full of stunts, gadgets and deception. Everything a guy needs in a movie. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is back in action and as cool and clever as ever.
B00DI75SWM|3.0|I think it should have been free for the quality of stuff it produces. I want to be able to share high-quality versions of my creations, and add more icons to it myself.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and explore other places weather. We refer to it all the time. Kids like to hear about the weather.
B008FQBGPE|4.0|First read Ian Fleming's James Bond books many years ago. And they are just as as entertaining as ever now. Will read all Fleming's Bond books again over time.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone who likes a bit of a bit of adventure.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game but when you visit other people not sure how to do the 5 tasks. But at least you can play longer most hidden object games that are free only let you play a small amount before they make you buy.
B004T32SOK|5.0|Everyone with a Kindle should have a Box account and this app. The hard drive is smallish, but Box helps out with file storage.
B005N09L5C|4.0|Good film with good acting. Very timely tough to follow at times. Film didn't feel dated even though it was 30 years ago
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Just couldn't get interested in it.  Think the casting was poor.  This was not a role for James Franco. Expected better.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book is great and I cant wait till the next book comes out so i can read it! and
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I love both Minecraft and Lego, so this is horribly biased, but I bought it for my son and it's honestly the coolest set he has. All of the pieces are the tiniest pieces available, so keep that in mind if buying for younger kids. It could get very frustrating to assemble.
0399157565|5.0|Kay Scarpetta novel.  What's not to love?  I am never disappointed by a Patricia Cornwell novel - the science she includes just ads to the thrill.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Favorite show, totally entertaining.  Fan of Noah Wyle since ER.  The casting and script make this a winner for me.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is a great product... Easily attaches to stroller and makes it easy to keep things within reach. Only thing I don't like is that I wish it was more versatile with the velcro to make it easier to attach to different stroller sizes.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I thought it was ok but also boring for long stretches. I don't think I will watch it again anytime soon.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Dr Who has been a favorite since I was a kid... knowing that I can see characters that I recognize from way back when makes it all the more enjoyable. David Tennent is my second favorite Doctor... Tom Baker is number one in my book. I think that this season really gave him a chance to show his skill.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Jobs is probably well portrayed as a the psychopath you have be to achieve what he did - but apart from the anecdotes, the name droppings and the very high level praise of technological advance, there is not a lot to take away from this book - other than the fact that if you empower bean counters to save their way to profitability, you will fail.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't just cry reading this book. I cried like a maniac. Fetal position, spooning the pillow, shaking my head repeatedly.<br />There's so much beauty in The Fault in Our Stars, such a delicate, profound beauty.<br />I just want to thank John Green and every single one who read this novel and was passionate about it, your word-to-mouth eventually got to me and gave me the chance to witness this pearl. And yes, I'm being corny but, you know what?, I'm also eating a slice of pizza.<br />Thank you again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is fun, inventive, and easy to play. Om Nom cracks me up! The game is just challenging enough to be fun, without making me use my brain a whole lot. A good mindless game to pass the time!
B00A7UD6ZY|4.0|I like the headset and use it alot.  There is one flaw that I don't like.  It has a blue light that flashes to let you know that it is still on.  It flashes every few seconds.  The problem is that when I am listening to music or watching something on my iPad while using it the blue light bothers me and the person next to me trying to sleep.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|Truly, truly wretched - a perfect example of how NOT to make a comic book/superhero movie. (But, then, there are SO many.)<br /><br />Where is the ACTION?! It's over half an hour in before we get to Mickey Rourke's racetrack-electric whip attack, which is the one and only standout set piece in the entire film (and it's still far too brief). Then we spend the remainder of the film's bloated 123-minutes biding our time, meandering through a momentum-less 'plot' and suffering through witless 'witty' dialogue. (Example: \\"I've got my eye on you,\\" from Samuel L. Jackson - who's completely miscast here, by the way - may stand out as the worst of the worst attempts at risibility.) When we finally get to the thoroughly underwhelming climax, the villain is vanquished in a matter of what feels like less than 2 minutes.<br /><br />My wife's reaction at one point summed it up best: there's a scene toward the end in which Jon Favreau (this film's helmer) is getting the snot kicked out of him by a guard, at which point she burst out, \\"That's what you get for directing this s***ty movie, b**ch!\\" (It's fun watching movies with my wife.)
B007VTUYWW|3.0|The video game is better. I watched it out of bordom. If you like Angelina Jolie in shorts then this movie is for you.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The weather channel probably has the best weather program on the android market. I deleted this program after I found the weather channel app.
B005544V6A|5.0|I would definitely recommend Suits if you're looking for a good TV series to watch. It's an entertaining show with the right amount of drama.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I was apprehensive of this cd when Zac and Josh left. And a lot of the songs on it do lean in the the more &#34;pop&#34; direction. It's not the same Paramore that we are used to, but it is still amazing. I am still unwavering a hardcore Paramore fan. A lot of the songs on this cd you hear more from the guys singing and I absolutely loved that.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Works fine and was a freebee when I got it. So I can't complain. Works on my phone and tablet.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It shows the strength of you wi-fi connection and works great. When our internet was down for the weekend by our internet provider, I was able to drive through the neighborhood and find the strongest connection that was not secure and check my email. Great program.
B001NLL93W|5.0|great story truly it really just pulls you in to the world that is this story. I really think it was marvelous.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Movie is entertaining, with decent action and witty banter.  If you like action comic book movies this is a good one.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Season 2 of Dollhouse was just as great as Season 1, and it ends with all of it's mysteries unveiled.  I think this is a great show, and I wish they could have continued past two seasons, however, with the close of this season, it would be very hard to do because it's so final.  A++ and 5 stars from me!  Highly recommended!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is super fun to watch! I wish season 3 will be available on amazon soon. Season 1 is more fun than season 2.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|If you start the mortal instruments you must read them all. Its so hard to lay down. And the characters come to such life.
B00DPH7QFM|4.0|This is a DVD of a 1995 concert in Dusseldorf, Germany by Ritchie Blackmore and the last incarnation of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. It is part of the long running Live At Rockpalast concert series produced for German TV.<br /><br />All the best known Rainbow tracks are here along with Perfect Strangers, Burn and Smoke On The Water from Blackmore's Deep Purple days.<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore is in fine form and it is quite likely this DVD is from the latest time period in which you'll see Blackmore playing this material. With his current band, Blackmore's Night, he's taken a totally different musical direction than his Deep Purple and Rainbow days. With his new band, Ritchie Blackmore no longer plays Deep Purple or Rainbow material. (* September 2013 Update to Original Post: I take back this comment about Ritchie Blackmore not playing Rainbow material anymore. The latest Blackmore's Night CD has a cover of \\"Temple Of The King\\" *)<br /><br />The sound on this DVD is good; the video looks good and the camera work is good, although the video editing, in a few places, contains a few too many fast cuts for my taste. On a few occasions, the stage lighting has strobes which detract from the visual.<br /><br />The keyboard player in this incarnation of Rainbow is very good. His keyboard solo is impressive.<br /><br />On the downside, the singer in this version of Rainbow is good but IMHO is not up to the standard of Ronnie James Dio, the original vocalist in Rainbow. On the Deep Purple material, he's not at the standard of Ian Gillan or David Coverdale either. I know I'm at odds with some other reviewers on this but, to my ear, Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan (in his prime) and David Coverdale (during his Deep Purple days) top the vocalist in this incarnation of Rainbow.<br /><br />But overall, this is a very worthwhile DVD for any Deep Purple or Rainbow fan. Ritchie Blackmore is in fine form and, since Blackmore no longer plays this material, this is likely to remain the latest DVD of Blackmore playing Rainbow and Deep Purple music in concert.<br /><br />I see Amazon's page for this DVD does not include the set list, so here it is:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Spotlight Kid<br />3. Too Late For Tears<br />4. Long Live Rock n' Roll/Black Night<br />5. Hunting Humans<br />6. Wolf To The Moon/Difficult To Cure<br />7.

B000G6R7B8|4.0|The only item I find is the strap is not long enough.  I can only use the second hole on the band and sometimes it is tight.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a great girls night out movie. Would recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh!!! Would rent again
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This story is so good. So much better then Twilight. It really is a story that pulls you in, and is so hard to put down.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|it wasnt so bad but not awesome, It barely got some laughs from me... and it has tooooo much curses all the time... terrible family movie, i know its pg R, but it could be funnier without all the curses. I dont know the whole story got too cheesy and very few parts were actual comedy (or trying to be)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Haven't read the first one yet, but the second and third books we're very entertaining! I can't wait for the movies!
0439796644|3.0|Some of my friends love this book.  I feel like it is not a story about a horse nor one about war.  The start is slow.  I would have rated it lower but any book about horses rates a 'like'.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book was suggested by a friend, and what a great suggestion it was!  A pleasurable and thought provoking read for anyone.....truthful and eye opening.  Many thanks to Mr Gladwell.
B003YAR97K|5.0|Great movie and i love to have it on a trilogy pack. good price<br />My son is a huge pan of spider man
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very amusing and addictive. I really enjoy playing subway surfers,and its really fun! Buy it and it's also free!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Never boring with the way they change characters. I really love it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is one of those products that actually does what it is intended to do without difficulty. It is well thought out and easy to use and highly effective. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to access their desktop from a remote location. Splashtop has bailed me out more than once.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This movie was fun enough to watch, but it wasn't particularly thought provoking or anything. We are glad we didn't pay to see it in the theater, but it was fine for an Amazon rental...
B002W7H3EA|5.0|I have seen this move so many times and am in love with it more and more each time!  The movie is visually stunning and simply a great rainy day afternoon classic!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have been engulfed by this series so much that I actually re-read all three books. I just couldn't get enough. And with so much promise and options, E. L. James leaves us with, I can only hope and pray that she'll continue to write and open up her ideas to add to this trilogy and most importantly to Christian and Ana's lives. Which, I think it's safe to say, they've become apart of the readers lives as well. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants a sexy, heart stopping, tear jerking, love story. It is a display of every emotion rolled into on  amazing series. Five stars all the way.
B000OW77UU|5.0|The fact that this was a true story makes it even better.  Didn't make the mom look too good.  How can she desert such a cute little guy!
B001HN690O|5.0|How do you qualify the success of a sequel? Is it whether the film matches or outperforms the original at the box office? Is it an improvement of artistic merit? Or is it taking the sequel in a slightly new direction and succeeding? Kung Fu Panda 2 may be the first animated sequel to answer each of those questions in the minds of each viewer.<br /><br />Not long after Po (voiced by Jack Black) became the Dragon Warrior and, with the assistance of the Furious Five, saved the kingdom from the escaped snow leopard Tai Lung, the portly panda wears his fame on his sleeve. Never letting those around him forget who is the most powerful kung fu warrior alive. His father has even begun using his son's fame as a selling tool for his own noodle shop. Yet, when a new force threatens the Valley of Peace, Po joins forces with Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) to wrest control from the mad, white peacock Shen (Gary Oldman). Also back to serve up advice and set Po on his journey is Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a diminutive Grand Master struggling to find in himself inner peace.<br /><br />Simple as the plot may sound, a challenging execution lays before Jennifer Yuh, a first-time big screen director who has worked in storyboarding and artistic design on film since 1994. Yuh takes the screenplay by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and their team of writers and gives turns it into a gorgeous, poetic vision of ancient China with rich symbolism, gorgeous scenery and a magnificent series of flashbacks, including the opening sequence, employing various colorful gears to tell the story of Shen's origin. Having received a prophecy that he will be defeated by a creature of black and white, Shen begins a campaign to slaughter every panda alive in an effort to stave off his demise. His treachery and violence lead his loving and peaceful parents to exile him. Adding immeasurably to the magnificent visuals of the opening Michelle Yeoh's wonderful narration adds an beautiful layer of depth.<br /><br />We know from the first film that Po's father Mr. Ping (Jame Hong) is not his natural father. A goose having a panda cub child? But the film didn't go into great depth about Po's origin leaving a terrific opening for the sequel. In order to find the inner peace he will need in order to defeat Shen, Po must calm the storms in his heart and uncover the truth about his parents and how he came to be the adoptive son of a goose. The flashback scenes peppered throughout the present tense action colorfully unveil his history, revealing a stark and tragic history that allows the audience to form an emotional connection with Po that they may not have had in the original film.<br /><br />The voice work has changed little since the original film, but adding in Oldman's machinations as the voice of Shen was a stroke of genius. For several years, Oldman has softened his image, giving the audience a glimpse of the more compassionate side of his craft. With roles in the Harry Potter films as Harry's compassionate father and in the Batman films as the kindly Lieutenant Gordon, I had become concerned that we might forever lose the richness of character he could bring to a villainous role. Kung Fu Panda revives my faith in him as an actor. Shen is a cold-hearted villain like few others, but his vocal talents lend an air of menace the film might not have had with a lesser actor in the role. His voice work makes this one of his finest performances in years.<br /><br />Not since Toy Story 2 has there been an animated sequel that has improved upon the original. Tonally, Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite a bit darker than its comedy-laden first feature, but that's to the benefit of the film. While it has many light moments that give the audience occasion to smile, adding too much levity to a story of such gravity would have been dangerous. They have created the perfect balance. It might not be the joyous production a lot of kids will enjoy, this film will appeal mostly to the adults whose support has frequently made Pixar the envy of the animation industry. While I doubt that Pixar can easily be supplanted as the best animation house in film history, DreamWorks is making the case that it isn't some fly-by-night, box office-at-all-costs studio like rival Fox.<br /><br />With the Panda films and How to Train Your Dragon, I'm no longer afraid to sit down to a DreamWorks animated feature expecting to be annoyed by how childish it is, because I'm no longer likely to be so disappointed.ids will enjoy, this film will appeal mostly to the adults whose support has frequently made Pixar the envy of the animation industry.

B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|I was surprised to find out, after reading this book, that it's apparently Gaiman's favorite of the books he's written. I found it a short, dull story that kept trying to imply it was going somewhere and then never really did. Considering Gaiman is one of my top authors, and three of his books rank among my absolute favorites, I was really surprised at how disappointing I found this latest one.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is fun for the entire family, it's not hard to figure out and the cute little nuggets expressions really make me laugh !!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is fun to play the different level is fun to play the mission make it a challange to bet the game
B00168OINK|5.0|Outrageously entertaining! Jack Black, along with the rest of the voice cast, does an incredible job of making us believe that these animals are actually part of a kung fu team. I loved this movie from beginning to end. The witty humour, the hidden adult humour, the fight sequences, the visuals, and the storytelling, are all small parts that come together to make this movie one to remember. Dreamworks has definitely hit it's mark in super-stardom. Common sense has just been kicked into me and I am ready for so much more. This movie is just not enough. Kung Fu Panda is incredible!!!
B008T4HHWS|5.0|Excellent movie! By far my favorite all-time film. It teaches a lot about life! I highly recommend it for young adults.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is great it's the full game and I love that it's free. I would say it's a really great game best so far.

B00168OIP8|5.0|\\"Risky Business\\" represents the 80's teen genre with style, as a a teenager has the house to himself when his parents leave for vacation. His friends tell him that he owes himself a good time, so he ends up having a one-night-stand with a hooker who inevitably steals a very expensive crystal egg off his families mantlepiece. His life just get's worse from here on out, by having his father's car slide into the lake and almost blowing his entire college interview. I must say that this film knows when to be subtle and good hearted and it knows when it is the right time to make you laugh. Tom Cruise is very cool in one of his very first theatrical roles, and the classic underwear scene will never tire. The acting is fun, the outfits fit the film perfectly, the plot line brings out the true events of the 80's, and by the end of the movie, I was either feeling happy when he was or sad when he was. My only complaint is that there are a few too many moments where it is a little too dramatic for the type of film that it is meant to be, but all-in-all, this is one of my favourite teen films!

B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Good God this movie is seriously the most evil, demonic thing I have ever seen.  It's not zombies, it's not ghosts, it is just pure evil.  The movie really surprised me being this good since I barely heard about it's release and we live in a time where so many horror movies classicly fail to deliver.  Just to give you an idea of what movies I find scary, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Jessica Biel remake)and High Tension top my list of all time scariest movies.  This MIGHT take the crown.  Not only is it scary, it is truly disturbing.  It's just a \\"every moment is more horrifying than the last\\" descent that gives you no breaks from the horror.  This movie goes places a  lot of directors might not dare tread.  I never saw the original, but this remake has officially made it on the list as one of my all time scariest movies.  I can't imagine they could have possibly gotten away with making a movie this disturbing back in the day, but I'll definitely check out the original now - although I'm kind of scared since one reviewer said the original is even MORE evil.  I don't know if I can take it.  I seriously can't imagine anything more evil than this movie.  It's not just scary, it is truly from hell.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy  to set up and different music's<br /> to wake you from the apps gentle ones to your very own music. Great different clock faces, plus knowing the weather when you wake.

So my mom downloaded this app to search up videos she was looking for, and I tried the same time but then I found out you you have to download the videos and stuff and that's a good thing I did not spend money on it either. And also when I try downloading and watching videos on there nothing started working so I had to do delete this app. And guys even though that it does not work and it causes problems to your device just be lucky it's free because I would hate to spend money on a app that don't work.

B007MDB71O|5.0|When I first saw the trailer, I was excited because I am a long-time nerd who loves scifi and fantasy, and had already known of the books.  I was skeptical, though, of how good it would actually be due to the \\"Prince of Persia\\"-looking scenes they chose for the trailer combined with my disappointment with so many other potentially good films of a similar genre.  However, after actually watching the film for myself- I fell in love with it!! It may not be \\"perfect\\" but really has its own charm. I've long been a fan of slightly-cheesy fun films like Independence Day and the Mummy and this one fits into that category, IMO.  If you love films like that with fun scenes, lovable characters, etc. then give this one a try. It has become one of my favorite light-hearted \\"fun\\" films to pop in the DVD player- especially due to the characters.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|I originally downloaded this app for my daughter who is obsessed with My Little Pony. I got the game going for her and ended up spending quite a bit of money on gems which unfortunately are necessary to advance. Recently the app got updated and upon such update I lost everything I had done and had to start over. Needless to say I'm uninstalling the app. I am mad. An update shouldn't do that...they need to improve many areas of the game that are glitchy as well. Big disappointment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was hooked on the series from the first episode.  The actors, in my opinion, are  perfect for the roles they play.  I love the story line.  I especially love the way they show the closeness of the family.  Showing the discipline of the household staff really gets the point across of what work ethic and loyalty is all about.  Lord Grantham, although an aristocrat, clearly shows what it is to be powerful and yet still be compassionate and reasonable.  I must admit that I was very disappointed that Mathew was killed of in the last episode of season three.  The bottom line is that we need more programs of this type.

B003U6BE8I|2.0|If you read and liked the books DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!! It's exactly as another poster already pointed out, it seems as though the screenwriter was given a verbal outline of the books and then wrote whatever he wanted. I got angry while watching this movie. They took a 12-yr-old magical adventure story and made it twilight.<br /><br />If you haven't read the books and want to not think too hard while watching a watered-down harry potter with tons of great special effects, then by all means, enjoy. (watered down! Get it! Cause he's.....you know what, nevermind) if you watch the movie and like it, but want to understand why Percy drops his GIANT GLOWING SWORD and grabs a much smaller broken minotaur horn to fight the minotaur, then please go buy/borrow/find-at-the-library the book and learn how the story SHOULD go.

B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|I have never watched a Shakesperian play that I have enjoyed as much. Had to watch in 2 x 2 hour episodes . So many well know stars from both sides of the Atlantic. Outside location at Blenheim Palace was interesting having been there 2 years ago although it would have been good to have seen Kronberg in Denmark which was the original Elsinore. Highly recommended but it did take a while to find a copy of this magnificent 1996 production,
B00AH69AX0|4.0|If you're buying this album, then you're probably not looking to the reviews to make up your mind. This is the Metallica album I first banged my head to in the seventh grade, and it still sounds great. I'm not as big a fan of the later albums (the Black album is the 'newest' one I still listen to) and this is Post-Cliff Metallica at their best.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|This app is a little more complicated than I wanted.  Its not too user friendly to me.  Will keep trying to figure it out but back to my paper and pencil!
B007FU1OH6|4.0|A good read although it is sometimes hard to remember the characters and their relationship to one another. Although &#34;The Angels Game&#34; was advertised as a prequel to &#34;Shadow of the Wind&#34; it is actually a sequel to &#34;Prisoner of Heaven&#34;. The events are quite tragic at times and the story line takes a bit of following and is a bit unsettling. Still as yet unfinished I will have to read the next episode.
B000I3UMLQ|5.0|Okay, to get it out of the way; I'm aware that the &#34;Galactic Barrier&#34; thing is laughable, the very notion of &#34;The Enterprise travels to find God&#34; is at best a leftover plot that would have seemed more at home in the occasionally campy original series, and last but not least; Uhura's naked dance.  I need say no more of it.<br /><br />But for all the flaws, the movie's plot is pretty straightforward and concise and doesn't lose itself (I'm looking at you, &#34;Generations&#34;), Sybok's a more interesting character than I think a lot of people give him credit for, and elements of the dialogue stand out (in a good way).<br /><br />Is it the worst of the Star Trek films?  No.  That honor goes to &#34;Star Trek: The Motion PIcture&#34;.  In some ways, I'd argue that this even surpasses Generations and Insurrection, standing as the second best of the &#34;odd numbered Star Treks&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I have purchased seasons 1 and 2 on itunes and it is a wonderful period piece that is a good story as well.  Easy to get caught up in the story.

B00BEYX7TW|4.0|sort of a good movie, lots of twists and turns my failing at watching movies is I look for mistakes and down right flubs, this movie has a few but still a good one.
B0091ICDHU|3.0|This is a good story, with good emotion and if you want a relatively quick read then this works just fine.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great awesome a lot of tense moments and Romantic moments and a lot if sad moments confusing but not in a bad way
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Movie  was ok,, heaven help us if the  future is like this-----------scary. But over all a reasonably good movie. Try it.

B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Even though it takes a little bit to get used to it is really fun. So I would recommend this game to any gun lover.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love this little device.  It was easy to set up on my wifi network, and it works well with my iPhone, my Macbook, and my iPad.  The number of things you can stream is limited, but the video quality was pretty good, and the integration was a cinch to set up.  At $35 this is a terrific little gadget to have if you like to watch Netflix or YouTube.
1401200605|5.0|I bought the second volume of hush on accident from Frank and Sons, I had told the seller I wanted the first one and I bought the wrong one without looking at the book. I was in a rush to get this delivered to start the series and I loved it.<br /><br />GREAT COMIC. AWESOME ART.
B00640UICA|3.0|This game is for a child not for an adult.  I really didn't think much of it.  Maybe if I was 60 years younger (9).
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I used to make fun of my mom always playing, but now I know why she was always playing... sometimes it slows down & I lose bingos & chests & such, which is a pain in the rear... I don't know how to get those back... :(<br />But overall, its a fun way to past the time!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked the storyline.  It was a nice departure from the norm.  This book was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I missed the Firefly TV show when it aired as I don't subscribe to cable/satelite anymore.  However, I found the entire series at my local library & became an instant FANatic!  I own the Firefly  series and just added this movie to my collection.  They are both superb!
B003U0AHBO|3.0|There are so many variations of the legend of Robin Hood! And I did not like any of them. Including this one. The cast is not bad, and the costumes looks reel - except the helmets: at the beginning of 13th century they looked like cooking pot with eye slits. Some historical details are true, like rushes on the floor or green-yellow colors of William Marshal tunic. However, married woman at that time kept their heads covered, and earl Pembroke (a.k.a. Marshal) in real life could not read or write. And Isabelle as a king's mistress? I agree that many of us are not very familiar with medieval history facts, however, movie creators should not be twisting them so much just to get our attention.
B00932DCS8|5.0|I had read the book before I saw the movie and was not disappointed. Nice suspense. good acting. Among my favorites.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like this web Page. It has a lot of different items you from different department stores and give you a lot of ideas you could decorate your home. This is a joyful web site you could sit and look at and enjoy it allday and wish.

B000FBJG04|5.0|An incredible story about an incredible group of men.  Every young man should read this and ask himself, could I have done that?  Every person who considers himself or herself to be a strong leader should focus on the actions of Dick Winters and ask, would I have done that?
B000HKYOK0|1.0|Season 1 streams just fine.  Go to season 2 and find it is pay per view.  Fine, so I go to season 3 and it is pay per view also.  This is not the first legacy show I've viewed where early seasons were no charge viewing and subsequent shows are pay per view.<br /><br />Prime is a great deal if the selection is truly no additional charge, but it gets problematic when it seems Amazon is using no charge streaming as advertisement for its pay per view.  I'm about to go back to Netflix because its business model is streaming, not driving demand  toward pay per view.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game was a fast read that still managed to provide a commentary on how humanity will use someone for their own gain, and  poses the question, is that evil? Even though the main character is a boy, you are still able to feel for him and his situation and will have you rooting for him in the end. Great characters and even better sci-fi.  I highly recommend reading this classic.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|all ages will love this move. it is fun, adventurous, funny, and family friendly. the villain is to scary and the little smooch at the end isn't too gross.

B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I usually don't like when a story is extended over more than three books. The story becomes incohesive or overly repetitive. But this set of books is cohesive, well thought out, and well written. I would recommend this series to anyone.

B00D3J2QKW|5.0|After reading The One Thing I realise how my approach to my career, although successful, involves a lot of time wasted on 'busy' tasks which make me unfocused and that my time could be significantly more streamlined and purposeful. I was recommended this book by someone who was running a similarly action packed schedule and I can see why they recommended it to me. I have often thought about focusing on just the important but delegating and saying no always made me feel guilty - The One Thing has given me the back up I need to shake off this guilt and move forward with purpose. Thank you.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|When I decided to view this film, I expected some kind of adventure film experience--what I found instead was a totally involving and intensive some two hour ride, with a lot of application to what is currently happening in this and other countries to the average middle class person. A film to savor and enjoy, but also one that offers an opportunity to think about and question where we are going as a society. Highly recommended.

B00DJYJPLO|5.0|When we last saw Jessie and Celine now already nine years ago, Jessie looked as if he was about to miss his flight back to the US and instead choosing to stay with Celine in Paris. And now we get the third installment of this fanastic mini-franchise.<br /><br />As \\"Before Midnight\\" (2013 release; 109 min.) opens, we see Jessie (played by Ethan Hawke) dropping off his 13 yr. old son Hank at the Kalamata airport in the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. From their conversation we learn that Hank spent the summer with Jessie and Celine on vacation in Greece. As Jessie gets to his car to drive off, we see Celine (played by Julie Delpy) and... their 7 yr. old twin daughters Ella and Nina! So yes indeed, Celine and Jessie became a couple, living in Paris, and now the parents of 2 girls. The remainder of the movie plays out that rest of the afternoon and evening, and to tell you much more of the 'plot' would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, this is another tour-de-force for director Richard Linklater and co-stars/co-writers Hawke and Delpy. The strenght of the movie is in its story-telling and character development. Keep in mind, there are really only 4 scenes in the movie: the drop-off and drive back from the airport, the evening dinner, the walk to the hotel, and the hotel room, that's it. Second, the two main characters' development is going into opposite directions: Jessie was not all that likeable in the first movie (for me anyway) but Celine was just darling. In the second movie, it was pretty much even keel. In \\"Before Midnight\\", Jessie has become the likeable character by far, whereas Celine comes across as resentful, bitter at times, and not very likeable far too often. At one point, in the middle of a heated argument, Celine hisses at Jessie \\"you're no Henry Miller at any level!\\", revealing an ugly side of Celine that we had never seen before. As we see these characters getting older, it's now also clear that they are struggling with guilt and remorse, and insecurity over their parenting skills as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Before Midnight\\" is a fantastic conversation-driven movie, inviting you to observe what's become (and still becoming) of Jessie and Celine, both as persons and as a couple. Here's hoping that we can give rendez-vous in 2022 for the next installment in the \\"Before\\" franchise. Meanwhile, \\"Before Midnight\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!hese characters getting older, it's now also clear that they are struggling with guilt and remorse, and insecurity over their parenting skills as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Before Midnight\\" is a fantastic conversation-driven movie, inviting you to observe what's become (and still becoming) of Jessie and Celine, both as persons and as a couple.

B00004S8Q9|5.0|I loved Badlands ever since their debut album cam out. All my friends loved them too and my band even covered &#34;Streets Cry Freedom&#34;! We all bought their second album and loved it to. Then we heard that Ray Gillen died (R.I.P.) and thought that was it. Years later I found out about this album and that the record company had released it only in Europe. I found it here at Amazon and payed about $30 for it. It was worth it! This has some of their best work! Jake E. Lee, Greg Chaisson, Ray Gillen, and Jeff Martin are all at the top of their game. The opening song &#34;Healer&#34; starts the album off great with a rock solid rhythm, and the instrumental breakdown in the middle shows off how tight they are. The instruments are very dry, raw and sound great. Great blues rock!<br />If you like the first two albums, you HAVE to get this one. You will not be disappointed.

B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|1969- 1971 were a rough patch for Dylan fans. After a stream of gritty, groundbreaking and raucous masterpieces, constant touring, media scrutiny and a motorcycle accident the \\"Voice of a Generation\\" took a vacation. After Blonde On Blonde and the enigmatic John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline was considered light fare and the sudden attempt at crooning was met with perplexity. If New Morning received lukewarm reception, Self Portrait was critically panned, despite good sales. Today, outside of a handful of perversely staunch admirers, Self Portrait remains an embarrassing blight on Dylan's career. As Dylan himself put it, \\" I just threw whatever I could think of at the wall and whatever stuck, released it, and then went back and scooped up everything that didn't stick and released that too\\".<br /><br />While a bit over hyped, Another Self Portrait seeks to reassess this period and for the most part succeeds brilliantly. \\"Went To See The Gypsy\\" tops the New Morning version. And here are the best versions of \\"Time Passes Slowly\\", \\"If Not For You\\" and \\"Sign On The Window\\" I've ever heard. The lonesome piano take of \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" is definitive.<br /><br />Stripped down, even previously cheesy covers like \\"Spanish Is The Loving Tongue\\" make sense and are moving here. Its the sound of an artist recharging his batteries and getting his bearings again after a whirlwind ride through a tempest. Playing the songs that he liked or inspired him. Put simply there is a passion here missing from Self Portrait and New Morning.<br /><br />The Old Weird Americana of the much lauded Basement Tapes resurfaces in great takes on public domain obscurities like \\"Little Sadie\\", \\"House Carpenter\\" and \\"Days of 49\\"  and originals like \\"Only A Hobo\\". \\"Minstrel Boy\\" is another original actually from those fabled Big Pink sessions and is a rough, unreleased gem. If they sounded risible on Self Portrait, these rougher versions surpass in every way. Raw nuggets in a pan of fool's gold.  \\"Working On A Guru\\" is a playful unreleased outtake from New Morning featuring George Harrison on guitar. \\"Copper Kettle\\" was probably the best thing off the original Self Portrait and this sparse version blows it away. Just gorgeous. The same can be said of \\"Belle Isle\\" and the odd little \\"Wigwam\\".<br /><br />Not everything is great. I still don't like \\" All The Tired Horses\\" but this is a bric a brac shop of an album. You're gonna find some junk along with the gems. While there's a lot to like about New Morning, this fills in the gaps of Dylan's \\"Missing Years\\" far better than his contractual obligations at the time. Two live tracks from the Isle of Wight are interesting but find they distract a bit from the true objective here. Namely, casting new light on a period most fans sweep under the rug and would rather forget. So not a mind boggling revelation, but a notable second glace with a few surprises. Nevertheless, an enlightening addition to the Dylan legacy and enigma.gold.  \\"Working On A Guru\\" is a playful unreleased outtake from New Morning featuring George Harrison on guitar. \\"Copper Kettle\\" was probably the best thing off the original Self Portrait and this sparse version blows it away.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|Matthew McConaughey was great in this movie, because his speech and mannerisms were so realistic.  I live in the south and know what a fake southern accent sounds like!  Good story, good acting... Not 5 stars but still a movie worth watching!

I feel as tho the Kindle app needs to be kept up with for updates. I'd also love to get push notifications on my Kindle. I will gladly raise the number of stars if this app can be upgraded already

B008JFUPFI|4.0|A steady decline in the popularity of happily-ever-after, stereotypical fairy tale princess stories has been apparent for years now, both in the reactions of kids and in the popular movies coming out--stories about feisty, strong young women (instead of damsels in distress) or about mixed-up fairytales are very common nowadays (e.g. Shrek, Enchanted, Tangled, Brave). Accompanying this decline is the decline of the popularity of bland do-gooders who just happen to be invincible to boot. I'm not saying I'm against this; it's just a trend. Kids love Spiderman and Batman, but Superman is just too perfect to relate to, to feel for, and to subsequently root for as a hero. This portrayal of Superman gives him an entirely non-comic book feel, which some comic aficionados can feel is essential to the Superman story and some feel is too corny in this modern day and age. Although I understand those purists and don't necessarily feel as if comics are corny (although I do love the new take on the costume), I love how Christopher Nolan was able to take the popcorn-munching comic flick into a real story with depth and feeling that still kept the bones of the original story. This is a Superman people can relate to and take seriously. His problems are real, and when he keeps his ideals in spite of everything, it's great to see. This is what separates a fun movie from a great one. Though it was a bit too violent at times, I loved the Dark Knight trilogy for this depth of story and feeling, and although I did think the overlong sequences of crumbling buildings were a bit much (after all, what's so interesting about a whole lot of falling buildings?), I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
0399226907|3.0|I was thinking this was a great deal but was a little disappointed when it came and it was a tiny little book.  I'm keeping it for a diaper bag book but buyer beware you're not getting the full size thing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all Nicholas sparks books so I knew when I started reading this one I would be able to put it down and I was right. I read the whole book in one day! It held a lot of surprises and suspense but most of all love. The struggles and losses we go through in life may be tragic but there is always hope especially when you have love.
B004OC07GM|5.0|Can't say enough how good this book is.  Insightful, deep and strategic. A seminal book on how to look at business models completely differently.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|This is a great movie in this series and have watched it several times. The failure comes from Amazon though. I would have rather rented it, but it only gives the option to buy or subscribe to Amazon Prime. I do not like my choices being corraled into something I do not want.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I got this movie to test my 3D system and I was impress...the 3D especial effect are so good, and at least 3 scenes object appear vey close to your eyes. Great movie to be watch with the family.

B001F12J3Y|5.0|If you really want to have your whole family together one night, this is the movie, it is a beautiful Christmas story for all ages, the only issue is the glasses quite irritable for the anaglyph 3-D, but you have the option to watched it in 2D, bottom line, an oustanding production.

B00180R06I|5.0|This is one to be watched while the sun is out.  Too creepy for watching in the dark.  The technique is very European.  But the atmosphere created by the film and development technique is a real skin crawler.  This is great work for its era.  No blood and guts.  Just a ghostly sense of uneasiness.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|When I started this book I expected the usual type of poetry but it was a nice surprise to find that these are different from any poems I've read before.<br /><br />Beautifully written by someone who truly feels the words in his soul, I thoroughly enjoyed my journey into this 'new to me' type of poetry.<br /><br />This book is full of sensual, though in no way offensive, individual poems and has been a complete revelation to me changing the way I view poetry. I will look out for more of these works in the future.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|This thing is creepy.  Amazingly well done and atmospheric, considering the comparatively primitive techniques used for the filming.  All prints of this were ordered destroyed because of some kind of suit from the Bram Stoker estate.  But a few survived, happily.  This is an example of early horror filming that is effective and scary.

B001OMJGD0|5.0|This film was considered a flop, but I really loved it.  It was an homage to the Christopher Reeve films and was beautifully shot and very heart wrenching.  Brandon Routh got a bad rap--I thought he was a fine Superman.
B00AFEQA5K|3.0|The movie was kind of uneventful. I would not call this a dark comedy though there were two or three dark and humorous events within the last 5 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />I didn't think the movie was too violent. For the most part, the mood of the movie was as any Matthew McConaughey character - smooth, level. No crazy action sequences or dramatic climaxes, in my opinion. The ending was eventful but not really dramatic and neither disappointing nor satisfying.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if you have 90 minutes to kill. The movie doesn't impress or stick in one's mind.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Clear, concise, fascinating, and reader friendly, this book gave me a new perspective on my breast cancer.  It can expand your knowledge of this mystifyingly complex subject.  It can help you avoid mistakes of ignorance by guiding you before, during, and after cancer treatment.  Very personal, it is full of things you need and want to know.<br /> Terrific writer, great narrator, valuable read!  This was my first experience listening with Audible on my Iphone while reading with Kindle on my Ipad.  This is not light reading, so hearing and seeing simultaneously really worked for me.  Truly a 5-star experience!
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie definitely skirts around many of the issues in the book and makes it easier to watch without feeling angry for the kids.

B005GCCJME|5.0|I usually wear shoe size 8.5 to 9 for men so I ordered size 9. They were way too big and I returned them and reordered with size 8 which fit me perfectly.<br /><br />I ordered blue (with white bottoms). The blue is very bright and very noticeable. So if you are not into \\"loud\\" shoes, then I recommend choosing a more darker and conservative color.<br /><br />These are very comfortable, and quite possibly the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The backstrap works surprisingly well to keep the foot in. These are designed to be wide but they also add to the comfort.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Very comfortable. The bottom soles of these crocs provide tremendous amount of cushion. The extra-width allows far more breathing room for the foot.<br />2)Backstrap works surprisingly well to keep the foot in and contribute to the fit and comfort.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)The extra-wide sizes makes them look somewhat awkward (but they add to the comfort).<br />2)Not for athletic activities.<br />3)Shoes are extra large. So you should order one size smaller.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|Dream House comes from the master Jim Sheridon of &#34;The Boxer&#34; and &#34;My Left Foot.&#34; This film sadly was marketed poorly which affected it's success, fortunately it has found a home on DVD. Dream House is beautifully shot and the performances are brilliant. Will Anton moves his family into a New England home so he can work full time on his novel, but they soon find out that the home they moved into has dark secrets. It is sad that the trailer gives too much away in terms of story twists, however there are new twists that are not mentioned in the trailer which I will reframe from spoiling ;) If you have not yet seen this film, rent it and take a look for yourself. It's not the greatest film, but it is a good film.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|This movie was a never ending disaster. It was painfully boring and I'm not sure if there was a plot or just a camera following around a crappy couple.

I watch certain scenes and wonder, &#34;Where is the baby!!!&#34;  Any parent can attest that a newborn is an all-consuming job and Walt and Skyler seem to treat her like a handbag; carrying her around in a car seat.  I think that aspect of Walt's personality should have been more developed as a means to convey tension between home Walt and lab Walt (friend George and work George--tee hee).  The ONLY time the writing has dropped the ball in years and years of amazing writing though.

I like the stories though, and I bet I would really like this guy if I were to meet him.<br /><br />o Eric sometimes gushes a bit about startups which are so young that I wonder if it is too early to call them a success. For example, Ries spends over 3 pages talking about Obama and Dodd-Frank, and praises the fledgling (at that time) Consumer Federal Protection Bureau for CONSIDERING his suggestion of starting their agency (with its $500 million budget) like it is a lean startup.<br /><br />Again, these are 3 pages talking about how the CFPB *could* use lean startup methodologies, not about how they have actually used them.<br /><br />Given the extremely limited usefulness of anecdotes such as these, you can't help but wonder if Eric in those moments more focused on trying to put people's names in a book than he is at giving readers something solid to benefit from.<br /><br />At any rate, it's still a great book and definitely worth the money.<br /><br />That said, if you want more of the HOW TOs of Lean Startup, I'm currently reading both Steve Blank's The Startup Owners Manual and Ash Maurya's Running Lean, and while I'm not finished with either of them yet, I can definitely tell you they take Eric's teachings to the next level -- and then some.
B0098XY5VK|2.0|They want money soon after you download the app hard to play on a kindle. would not recommend this for the kindle
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|amazing SFX. good story. great acting. but it seems to be missing a lot of details. would have been amazing after 2 joints
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is an epic ending to a great series. I would recommend this book to kids that lobe adventure and action and of course, Greek mythology.
B0036JU6CY|4.0|acting is ok, story is ok, blood and fighting is over the top. wouldn't watch again, but glad I saw it once
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I was so touched by this documentary and I'm more in love with Dave Grohl for making it (if that was even possible)! Heartbreaking at moments to witness the end of a legendary studio, as well as the power of the music industry as we knew it, but uplifting at the end with all the music collabs between Dave and the &#34; icons&#34;!
B00BF11STU|4.0|totally worth watching. just remember that its based on facts and isn't an action blockbuster that I guess some people thought it would be
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Like the game play and feel, but I am continually annoyed by the non stop attempts to get my money.  Don't give you enough game tokens to keep playing.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|good story, great movie. blood and guts and guns and just a good time. would totaly for sure watch again
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am re-reading this book.  Was deeply impacted by it.  What I really liked about was how<br />the author was able to portray all of Jobs facets -- the good and the bad.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|acting was great, seeing all these guys play different roles in the same movie was cool. the SFX was amazing. but I saw this sober and I still have no idea what this movie is about. I feel like if I had smoke 2 joints before watching this could have been the greatest movie ever
B003TSEEDY|4.0|In ordet to  feel in the past  all those things and the scambled pieces in life  and how  little by little  make a shape of us,  no one can tell  without others  can be a model of himself every people are  molded by  society
B004HWYTP4|3.0|good story, ok movie. bruce willis really needs to stop doing movies though. he acts the same way in his past like 5 movies. kinda kills it for me
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Best movie i have seen in a long time.  Some humor and some very touching moments,  Will buy for my vidio library
B006LSZECO|4.0|I think this book puts the reader in the deeply disturbed minds of two different people that are in a chaotic and convoluted marriage. Amy and Nick are like black and white. The two don't balance each other but it's a fight for Nick to keep that equilibrium. I m not one to spoil a book, but this one will make you squirm a bit and maybe re think about your significant other and his or her quirks and habits.<br /><br />I would recommend.
B005HEPIDS|3.0|A few real good episodes, but overall not as good as previous seasons. The last two episodes were very good but left me wanting more.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Goo, interesting book.  Makes a good, easy read.  This isn't a long book or difficult read.  Very interesting and entertaining.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Animation is great and not a disappointing aspect the artwork. For an animated film is is long (nearly 2 hours)... Had a hard time not hearing Depp's Mad Hatter ala gunslinger throughout the movie. I'm glad I watched it. It was watchable, but perhaps a little slow for the kids with way too many trips into the desert. It's okay.
B0073Q0DZG|1.0|Don't really know if this film is good as my new disc is defective.  Cannot watch a newly purchased disc.  I am a bird watcher and have wanted to see this movie for months.  What a disappointment!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Never could watch the show on TV due to work schedule. Found it on Amazon and now I'm it's biggest fan. This is were this style of gritty drama shows all started from. The story line of the show leads you to want to just keep watching one show after another.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|BADASS game for the kindle, and its cps to top that its even FREE!!!!!!F*%&amp;$#@ AWESOME....what more do you want for FREE????&iquest;????
0618154051|5.0|Amazing book, incredibly detailed, a great complement to The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Well written and even more dynamic and surprising than I expected.<br /><br />I would recommend it for every Lotr fan.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|There shouldn't be a need for this book, but Dawkins is a wonderful writer and thinker, and clearly lays things out. Unfortunately those who need to read it the most are the least likely to do so.
B002ZG9846|5.0|One of the most original and funniest comic book films in a long time. It lives up to it's name for sure.
B00271HAK8|5.0|As a movie from when I was a  teenager it is still as funny as I remember it. It was a great movie to watch with my family even though the language was a little rough at times.
B003TTEUQY|4.0|My friend recommended the show, so I figured I would give it a shot. I recently finished the first season and thought it was alright. I don't really feel attached to any of the characters, so it was kind of hard for me to get into.  However, that doesn't mean it's not a good show. I think for the right person it would be a great show.  I'm going to try the second season and see if it holds my attention any better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Puzzle game similar to old school stuff like Myst, Zork Nemisis, or 7th Guest. The puzzles were challenging but not so difficult I ever got frustrated. Controls are smooth and intuitive. I really hope they produce  more games in this family
B000VIPJKM|4.0|... is my not so guilty secret. Also, I'm not ashamed to enjoy it. I put it in the same class as The Princess Diaries and Miss Congeniality.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|You can probably guess from the blurb what the plot of this book is, but the details provided, and the reflection at the end make this a book I'll probably read again and recommend to friends and family.
0385349947|5.0|I wish I would have been presented with the information in this book when I was entering the workforce.  I think it's a must read for any woman regardless of career or age...not that men would not benefit from the book.  It has changed my perspective on so many things, and I'm no longer selling myself short at work. I've shared this book with my friends and their college age daughters.  I like the fact that the book was about empowering women, but did not bash men.  It was factual, clear and to the point.  I'm a different person after reading this book.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Jack the Giant Slayer is exactly what I expected: stupid, silly and utter nonsense.  Maybe at times a little too much so but I wasn't expecting The Hours here...it is just a diversion.  Good for a Friday night rental when you want to laugh and shake your head in disbelief at the same time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my first &#34;erotic&#34; and/or romance reading.  And I have to say, I couldn't put this book down.  It kept me up until 3am...
140006922X|5.0|Great historical perspective which paints fresh and rather factual picture of 2 major religions free from mithology, thorougly researched and referrenced.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my first &#34;erotic&#34; and/or romance reading.  And I have to say, I couldn't put this book down.  It kept me up until 3am...
B000MDDSB8|4.0|Special effects are decent.  Actors are great.  I would have given it 5 star but I am not too happy with the ending....I want more =)<br />Kind of left you hangin'...I wonder if they're going to make a continuation of this movie?!...hhmmm
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my first &#34;erotic&#34; and/or romance reading.  And I have to say, I couldn't put this book down.  It kept me up until 3am...
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great Movie! I really love the concept but you have to pay attention to it. It is not a movie you can do other things during and know what's going on. Morgan Freeman plays a great part. Unfortunately, he only plays a relatively small part in the movie.
B00847UYWA|4.0|The King In Yellow is a collection of a few of Chamber's best, but also some of the best classical horror tales about human madness and the fear of what man is capable of.
8866130915|3.0|I got this for school planning, as I am a college freshman. The book was small (I already knew the dimensions before purchase), but could manage the job. I liked the stickers it came with.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good fun. I like hidden object games especially when they are free. This has a nice story and is very relaxing.
1455576387|4.0|After watching the first season of KING & MAXWELL on TV this year, I really wanted to begin reading the books that the series was based upon.  Definitely glad that I did.  Lots of similarities to the show, but takes off with it's own plot too.<br /><br />Both Sean King and Michelle Maxwell have been Secret Service agents.  King fell out of the Service when the presidential candidate he was guarding was shot on his watch.  He has since set up a lucrative law practice, built himself a beautiful home on the water in Virginia, and has enjoyed all of his water crafts.  Michelle has just lost her presidential candidate when she allowed herself to be talked out of continuously watching the man at a funeral home.  Now King & Maxwell have teamed up to find the missing candidate.<br /><br />Enjoyed the building up of the personalities of both King and Maxwell.  Mystery was exciting and chasing down clues and suspects kept me thoroughly involved.  The ending was a bit too much too soon.  Perhaps this is why the TV show has left this mystery as the continuous background \\"hook\\" for the series.  Looking forward to reading more in this series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  The relationship of the two primary characters in the book is wonderful to follow as it progresses from the beginning of the story.  Each had so much to teach each other.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I thought it was a fun read. A nice one to take on vacation and read at the beach. Definitely made me laugh.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|This classic movie has not lost any of its allure over the past 70 years. Orson Welles at his best.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This is one of those movies that is a great popcorn flick, but since Brad Bird directed it its a live action comic book
0689829590|5.0|We love this story.  We bought the board book which is good for little toddlers hands.  My kids like the flaps and when she dances with the moon.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|This movie had a few good scenes in it, but the giants were just too gross for us to enjoy ...
B00CH26TL8|1.0|CAN NEVER TELL UNTIL YOU START TO PLAY WHAT YOU ARE GETTING INTO.BUBBLE WITCH WAS A BUMMER!BUT, TRY IT YOURSELF...
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. Makes you think...Enjoyed watching it at home, but not really one i would want to go to the movies for...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you start playing this game it is tricky to stop.  Solving problems by finding clues can busy you for quite some time.  I hope they continue to create more exciting levels.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Loved the history and it was very thought provoking. Let me know how little I knew about the lives and times of people in Jesus time.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Love the song, melody,  I'm a senior but enjoy hearing new songs and can play it anytime on my Kindle Fire
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Written brilliantly, a fun read while covering the basics of the law of attraction. Makes it really simple to follow and see results!! Highly recommend it!
B009MYARIK|1.0|Very annoying.  The characters are just too annoying to continue reading.  I could not finish this book. I do not recommend it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I've loved Michael Buble since he first started out. You won't be disappointed with this album! A+ A+ A+ A+
B005723JSQ|5.0|The character has some self esteem issues, but I really enjoyed this one.  It kept me entertained and engaged in the story line.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|AIRPORT version of Dr.Panda app series is a wonderful addition to Educate and Entertain Kids.<br />Graphics care Cute with Travelers from all over the World going through Airport with your help.<br />All the TASKS are Interactive and require Thought and Planning to proceed properly.  This is very Engaging for young children as they LEARN all about Airport Procedures in a FUN way.  Colorful and Cartoonist style Characters and Airport make it visually appealing and Controls work well.  The Music is Nice and Sound Effects are Cute, Funny and appropriate.<br /><br />Overall, a great Educational app that keeps child's Interest and makes them Happy with plenty of good INTERACTIVE TASKS that they get to tackle and complete easily.  Truly Satisfying Fun!<br />It does have some Advertising and Rating request Annoyances so I Justly deduct 1 STAR.  I also don't like all the Permissions but I play it with WiFi off to be more safe.<br />I own 3 other Dr.Panda apps and find that this is one of the Best so far.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Continues to be worth watching. My PBS version did not have the Christmas special at the end of Season 2 as the UK version does. Make sure you don't miss that before moving on to Season 3 or you will be lost. It is available to stream or separate purchase.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is so much closer to the reality of what I expected of what her life was like. Her voice is so colorful, humble, comical, and relatable. The show is what made me read this, but this makes me excited for next season. What I love most is her way with words. I can see all of the book  she read in the clink as  beneficial.
B0000062FJ|4.0|I had this on vinyl years ago and who knows what happened to it.  After all these years it's still pretty good
1616551607|5.0|Pages and pages of beautiful sketches.  Final Fantasy has always been one of my favourite games.  Seeing the making of it and all the art of it just make it complete for me.  The innovation and creativity of Yoshitaka Amano never fail to amaze me.  What a great talent.  Many people can draw, but not many of us can create, and Amano sure is a master of creating.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Fun flick. Be sure to put in your list. I am told that the sequel is even better and I plan on seeing it.
B0007LGCA4|5.0|This is my second pair.  They last a long time, fit well and feel good, nice arch support.  I recommend them.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|It's not my favorite Maggie Smith movie, but its worth watching. Very good story. Great acting. You're left with a good feeling.
1611134900|5.0|I really love Books On CD. I always have one for vacation, for all the long hours of driving. So when I found this one on amazon for this price I was sold. :)
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|It's worth watching, but could've been a little deeper in storyline, like most Hollywood science fiction films. It had great special effects and good acting. Definitely a good choice for movie night.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great series. Awesome show! This is a great series produced by USA. Awesome drama and keeps you on the edge of your seat!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is an absolute awesome song!  Tune is so catchy . . . makes you want to dance all the time.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING, WELL WRITTEN, ENGAGING....<br />I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN IN 2 DAYS UNTIL I FINISHED.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show, really fantastic. I can't wait for the next season to come out in the United States. Can't happen soon enough.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is my first book by Suzanne  Collins and look forward to reading more of her books in the future.
B005544TRQ|5.0|GALORE...Great acting, characters, writing, directing, you name it~we erven love the backbone background characters, Dona, Rachel, and Luis~Every show keeps building and it seems to get better and better!
B007X4ECMI|5.0|i went to see this movie when it come out in the theaters, I knew I wanted to purchase it. love that movie.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Why are so many negative people driven to write negative reviews? This book is brilliant, a true eye-opener and a remarkable insight into a remarkable man. It shows us what people are capable of and the reviews here show us how remarkable men like Tesla suffered from such abounding negativity in his life. And, hey, this book was free. I see it was a work of genius in itself.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season will not disappoint! Highly addictive program. I never thought I would enjoy a show set in this era. But it is so well done.
B00COHGP06|5.0|What can I say about Casino? It's a classic!!! I just received this movie yesterday and watched it today. The picture quality and sound is good and for 10 bucks..... It's a no-brainer! When I purchased this Blu-ray, I wasn't sure what UltraViolet was, so I did a little investigating. I found out that I kinda hit the jackpot! lol no pun intended. But anyways if your not familiar with UltraViolet. They give you a code on to activate this movie and then you can stream it anywhere on your computer, tablet or even phone!
B004U8VUQG|4.0|There was a lot of blood and violence in this film but it was presented as being absurd It was a little scar, and of course lots of pretty girls.
B0040I09RM|2.0|Look, the show is entertaining.  But I'm 59 so I can understand the amplifications here.  But for a teen or young person, this could be dangerous.  Yes, there is a certain appeal for &#34;hero&#34; who breaks the law and promotes death (dealing in arms) but to make it look like the norm in American culture.... I don't know.  Kids and young people who are lost and desperate for their way in life will be drawn to this way of life.  I'm torn between free speech and social responsibility.  No, we don't need this.  If I am required to curb my vocabulary when speaking to children, then there is a social responsibility to not make Sons of Anarchy a hero.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan delineates the divide between Pauline Christianity and the early church in Jerusalem better than anyone I have ever read before. That divide was harsher and much deeper than anyone affiliated with the church, whom I have known, was ever willing to say out loud. When I was a youngster, I always wondered who those \\"false teachers,\\" deplored by Paul, actually were. This book answers my innocent, youthful question. At first, the answer surprised me, but after giving it some thought, I realized that I had known the truth for a long time. The institutional church has a vested interest in obfuscating the facts of its own history and even of the Bible. Enlightening one's self, while still being a part of the church, is not an easy undertaking. Nor does the quest for those facts usually garner the support of church friends, pastors, or teachers of religion. The people in charge of church are very interested in controlling the message. To appreciate the insights of this book one has to set aside pre-conceived notions, take a deep breath, and let history speak.
B009NQZVKG|2.0|Carbon copy of every James Rollins novel ever, which means that in the end nothing changes and everyone is happy/conflicted super-geniuses.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|My wife likes to exercise to this CD and I hear it a lot.  Prompt delivery in good packaging.  I will buy more whenever.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Having watched this, it is inconceivable to me that someone would give this show a one or two star rating. They must be watching something else and made a huge mistake. This is most certainly a \\"no disappointments\\" series and not to be missed. The acting and the story -- top notch  all the way.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Having read all of the books when I was a kid, I was really looking forward to this movie coming out and it DID NOT disappoint!<br /><br />I started reading the John Carter books AFTER I had seen Star Wars (1977) and remember at that time being struck with the similarity between Burrough's Barsoom and Lucas' Star Wars universe.<br /><br />Just a few examples: Barsoom had Jeddaks, Star Wars had Jedis. Barsoom had Padwars, Star Wars had Padowans. Barsoom had Banths, Star Wars had Banthas. Barsoom had Flyers that looked like flying sleds, Star Wars had Land Speeders (if you saw the illustrations in the original Princess of Mars, you would find the similarity uncanny). On Barsoom the knights battle with swords, in the Star Wars universe with laser swords called light sabers. I could go on, like the desert dwelling Tharks with their long barrel rifles being somewhat similar to Star Wars Tuskin Raiders; but suffice it to say, Lucas borrowed heavily from Burroughs.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with that, as to me it was just Lucas paying tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs; but it was nice finally seeing a movie based on the stories in the actual books.<br /><br />In conclusion I will repeat what someone else wrote: this movie is good, clean family fun. I highly recommend it along with the books all of which are low cosy and some even FREE for Kindle from the Amazon site.<br /><br />I look forward to a sequel, with the hope it will get the promotion this first film in the series really deserved.
B0016JBCJW|4.0|This is definitely a filmmaker's movie, with great dialogue, characters, cinematography, and scenery.  The story is a bit incongruous, which may turn off some viewers that prefer a more direct, less ethereal viewing experience.  I could watch it repeatedly with a different message each time.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Why does Amazon charge for the newer shows, now I have to wait forever to see the ending!!!  It's addicting.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Ive wasted way to much time on this stupid game so I guess I like it<br />So down load it and waste some of your time too
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Upgraded from the free one, and it was definitely worth it.  If you have music that you enjoy relaxing to like I do, you will love this clock.  The timer feature that lets you fall asleep to your music was the selling point for me.  The only reason I give it four stars is because your music comes up in a list form that is somewhat confusing.  Simplifying with thumbnails and clear track titles would rate five stars for sure!  The other clock faces are nice, but a bit more variety would be nice.  Overall, a really great app you will be very happy with.
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|We were very disappointed, seems cheaply produced and the storyline was boring. I was thoroughly unimpressed. Will not watch this again.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I love this CD.  I am really becoming a fan of his. I rate a CD by how many songs I like on it and if it is more than three than it is worth buying.  This is worth buying to me.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD.  Every song is strong and the musicianship is top notch.  If this were the late 80's or early 90's, this would be getting radio play and this CD would be cranking out singles.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up and give it a spin, it will change your life.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love me some Adele.  Her whole CD I love it.  I like all of her songs on this CD and now I want to buy her past CD as well.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Simply put, Halestorm is the best band out there right now.  This CD is amazing, Lzzy has an amazing voice and she has a great group of musicians to back her up.  Every song on here is strong.  If you get a chance to catch them live, do yourself a favor and go.  You will be stunned by the live show.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fun, good ACTING, witty exchanges between the two major characters.  Stylish and clever.  Legal and corporate basic setting.  Good choice.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Came in record time and I watched it the same night.  Nothing unexpected and really didn't notice the change for political correctness.  Very much enjoyed watching the movie again after all these years.  My husband had never seen it and he loved it, too.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fun, stylish and clever.  Good ACTING with witty exchanges between the two major characters.  Excellent cast.  Tight PLOTS.  Good series.
B0044WZNB6|2.0|just really bad! we had a good time making fun of this movie though. Really terrible story, no one is that stupid.
B0028KF4ME|5.0|Excellent scripts, and ACTING.  Intriguing plot twists and character interactions.  If you liked any other episode of DEXTER  you will appreciate this series.
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|I've been an Eminem fan from the beginning. So, this album was just another addition to my collection of his work, but it has a very unique twist to it. Of all the artists Eminem has worked with I believe Royce is one of the few that can go bar for bar with the legend himself. It's a great CD, but comparing to the Slim Shady LP or the Marshal Mathers LP, I just couldn't give it a perfect 5 star rating. It will definitely not disappoint any fan of Slim Shady or Royce da 5'9&#34;
B002QNEJT2|5.0|Excellent scripts and ACTING.  Intriguing plot twists and character interactions.  If you enjoyed any other episode of DEXTER then you will appreciate this series.
B008NQYWC0|4.0|Great topic with the Stephen King Twist. King has a way of making you identify with characters like no other author. If you can get past his liberal slant which seems to filter into more of his writings as time passes, King's is still a great story teller.
159463176X|4.0|If I can go back in time, I'd read this one first, followed by the Kite Runner and then the 1000 Splendid Suns, this way the stories will just get better and better. Khaled Hosseini is a talented storyteller, but this one just didn't have as much juice as the other two books. It was still engaging and a good read. He also has so many separate stories that keep you wanting to know how they all connect but I think it was a bit overdone for me (other people like this). I would give it a 3.5 but that's not an option here.
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|I'm kind of upset that Rooney Mara never found incredible success after her incredible turn in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" in 2011. There are clearly two more movies to be made in the trilogy, but for whatever reason, those haven't happened yet. When everyone was starting to forget about her, along comes \\"Side Effects\\".<br /><br />It's hard to think of a director with a better track record than Stephen Soderbergh. He's had a few duds, but he's made more excellent films in the past decade than anyone who immediately springs to mind. \\"Side Effects\\" could be his last picture. The director has announced that he wants to take extended time off from directing films, and that's very sad to me. Because \\"Side Effects\\" is a masterful film that gets better and better with each viewing.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to see \\"Side Effects\\" in the theater. It's one of the most genuinely surprising films I've seen in a long time. It follows Emily (Mara), a depressed young woman, who after a suicide attempt, starts on a new antidepressant drug under the care of her doctor, Dr. Banks (Jude Law). Bad things happen and people get hurt.<br /><br />It's pivotal that you know as little about this movie as possible when you go into it. There are so many twists and turns, and it is so clever. Every time when you think you know where this movie is going, it takes a surprising turn. After a pivotal event happens in the film's first act, the whole game changes. Everything becomes much more interesting. A very tangled web is weaved. It stops before it becomes farfetched and ridiculous. It's a postmodern Hitchcock thriller. The scary part is the realism, and how possible this stuff is.<br /><br />It's really two different movies. At first, it's an expose on the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. It's also an engaging psychological thriller in the vein of \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\". When a film tries to be more than one kind of movie, it usually crashes and burns, but that isn't the case here. I enjoyed both entries in this \\"double feature\\" immensely.<br /><br />Not to mention, there is flawless acting from everybody involved here. Soderbergh has a knack for getting good performances out of his actors. Rooney Mara is Oscar worthy, in my humble opinion. You never exactly know how to feel about her character, and she clearly realizes that this is important. that is. I had alot of pleasure watching Catherine Zeta Jones in such a fascinating part.<br /><br />If this does turn out to be Soderbergh's swan song, it's him going out on top, creatively. It's the best thriller I've seen in a very long time, and proves to me that creativity isn't dead in American cinema. \\"Side Effects\\" is a true original, which is something you don't see very often in movies these days.
