B002TVQ4HG|4.0|One of handsome Aussie Liam Hemsworth's early films. See it if you 1. can look at Liam for hours doing anything because you think his is gorgeous and 2. like old cruise ships from 60 years ago. Other than that, the plot is poor and a bit messy with blood everywhere.
B00915G6R6|5.0|i totally loved the show when is first aired when it aired in t.v. i don't watch it i wait until amazon .com to<br />have the good wife on dvd .then i will buy it .<br />if watch the good wife on t.v.  then i will know what is going to happen on each episode<br />i  have all of the dvds of the good wife seasons 1 to 4 . i i don't watch that much t.v. but this show caught my attention and i am totally<br />hooked on it. i love Julianna Margulies  and to what she bring to the show as an acterss but also  i love the different  roles she has played  on other  show such asE.R. and THE SAPRANOS. but also i love all the actors and actress on the show and what one of them<br />bring to the show.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We now have several of these little thumb drives around the house.  We borrowed one from a coworker to try it out and thought it was just okay, the only complaint was that the sound was too quiet.  We tried it again after we heard there was an update and now the sound was fixed and we absolutely love it.<br /><br />I even dragged out an old monitor (that had audio out on it) and put it in my garage where my art room is and I have plenty of entertainment while I'm waiting for things to dry or when I'm taking a break.  I can even stream my music while i'm working.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Worked great.  Connected to a Nexus 7 the FiiO had enough power to overcome the engine noise from the jet.  In conitiuous use for 2 hours and still had plenty of battery left over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game. completely addictive so you must be cAreful when you take on the challenge. it has all the qualifications of a game that you never get enough.
1451627297|5.0|Who could imagine Stephen King ever writing a love story? Well, he did and it's among the best of his books. Gripping excitement as the plot develops in an attempt to alter history by preventing Oswald from killing JFK in Dallas.  When the novel ended, I found myself with misty eyes. Misty for two reasons: 1)dancing, and 2)that the story didn't continue for another 850 pages. Sometimes, a book should never end....
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The difference between a decent book and an excellent book is something easy to forget. Until you come across an excellent book, like this one!<br /><br />The Way of Kings is a fantasy set in a world unique in a number of ways: the magic system, the mythos, the political struggles. Sanderson has created a captivating world filled with interesting characters.<br /><br />This is a long book, but a good one. I haven't enjoyed reading a fantasy this much in a great while. My only disappointment is that it is the first book of a series, and the second is not yet released (it's due March 2014). Nevertheless, I strongly recommend picking this up to read. Excellent writing, engaging characters, and a fantastic world.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time back in 1981. The double date went great, and I never forgot how close to a real concert this movie portrays, especially after a home theatre system is installed. I have seen some incredible shows live; The Stones '81, Queen '83, Doobie Bros. '80, Dead '83, Who '83, etc. etc., and never saw AC/DC & missed the opportunity to see Bon Scott. As close as you will EVER get to the real thing. This film is a TREASURE! It should be enshrined along &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34;, and &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love Emma. This show was well done, and I love the fact that the BBC made in into a series! I thought the acting was good and especially liked the choice for Emma. The only strange part was at the very end of the series, they used a doll for Miss Taylor's new baby. Odd... I loved the show, though, and will probably watch it again.
B008602KQI|4.0|This was the first video rental on my kindle. I was very pleased with the service and will be renting again.  The movie followed the book rather well.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|This seems like a decent game, but to be fair, I probably did not give the proper amount of time to playing the game. It is a challenging visual experience to find the hidden objects. Much harder than other &#34;hidden object&#34; games I have played in the past.
0786868724|5.0|We have several of his books. They are usually short tomes and we can always count on pithy and sweet and humorous content. A good read that you will pick up again.
B008EL25LE|5.0|Great game and more difficult as you progress. Concentration and quickness are the key elements to advancing. An enjoyable game to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it because it is the way one really plays it with card.<br />I like the winning deal as it shows how to look and win the random deal.<br />It demonstrates mistakes made when trying to win the random deal.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|A fun game, but harder than it looks. The graphics are great. I downloaded it to play for myself, but my 9 year old granddaughter is better at it than I am. Would recommend it with no problems.
B00EO10M54|5.0|I've always loved Miley and her music. She's got a really great voice which definitely showcases on this album. When I first listened to it, there were some tracks that I loved instantly (i.e. We Can't Stop, Wrecking Ball, FU), and some that I was eh about (i.e. Adore You, Maybe You're Right, Rooting For My Baby). But after I gave it a second listen the other tracks started to grow on me and then I kept listening and kept loving it more and more. Some albums you have to listen to more than once to really see if you will love it or not and I believe this was one of them. My favorite track is FU. Plus there are stickers which are all sorts of fun no matter how old you are.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I had the opportunity to meet Ed and Lorraine in person and go on. Couple of their ghost tours.  Made a believer out of me.  The move was great.  Be prepared for what you are going to see!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|At first I hated this show... could not seem to get past the zombies....  but I got hooked and now I don't want it to end.
B008G3N71W|5.0|A Girl's Adventure took me to places I have never been before, way, way out on the far extremes of my erotic imagination. The story: unemployed actress learns from a stranger she meets on a train how, through discipline, she can be anything she wants to be. Under her teacher's firm hand, she learns to obey, discovers the depths of her own sexuality and becomes a great actress, movie star and leading lady on the stage. This is a real novel, with a real story. Chloe Thurlow knows her subject and knows how to write in a way that will make your heart beat faster. It did mine. Highly recommended, five bright and shiny stars.
B004PGO25O|4.0|The book is a practical and encouraging guide to get off your butt and get it done. The stories and examples are based on the premise of get started and do the work. A great motivator for action.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Great actors.  Great plot. Boring outcome. Movie felt too basic.  Needed more action, more special effects and a faster pace. Maybe more twists and turns. It was very cut and dry and didn't seem to explode into a full blown action film.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great flick, nice effects and camera work. Easy to follow story was still interesting. I would recommend the movie, but they made writing this revue a pain in the butt!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Another great sequel to [[ASIN:B00846WWVM Sprinkle]] from the developer Mediocre AB. I played few levels and decided to share my experiences. The game runs beautifully, Nice looking graphics, physics and sounds effects are very good. If you have enjoyed the original Sprinkle game you will find this even more entertaining.<br /><br />As far as some people complaining about 'virus' or malware, I personally think it could be that Verizon antivirus scanner that is detecting malware as being 'false' positive. I tried with couple of my antivirus scanners and it did not report anything suspicious. I even downloaded couple more Antivirus apps today from Amazon app-store and google play store just to scan this game and did not find any virus. I find it hard to believe that Amazon's App-store could release something for the masses without scanning.<br /><br />Five stars from me.
006202406X|1.0|Dual POVs was not well executed making it hard to follow as there was no real distinction between Tris and Tobias.  I did not appreciate the ending for multiple reasons but it would have been easier to accept if it had been put together better.
B00E38KGF4|4.0|There are tons of free Virus scanners out there and they all do one thing scan & report virus and malware, Also most of them have evasive permissions that can scare the hell out of you (Even more scarier than the virus itself) This one on the other hand has minimalist permissions requirements. Also this super lightweight application that takes very little space on your device. The scans performed are fast (Some devices can be slow depending on files and contents) but some amount of waiting is needed to contact server (Cloud based) to give you the scan results.<br /><br />This application will not work without Wi-Fi internet connection as it needs to be in contact with the server before performing scans and give you the scan results. If the waiting on server (Sometimes more than 5 mins) can be improved by the developer I will revise my rating to 5 stars.
B004GXZ69W|3.0|This is the third evoluent mouse I've had since 2007 and I was very excited that they started making smaller ergonomic mice for those with smaller hands, like me. Everything about this mouse was perfect until about a year in (when warranty ran out and I couldn't return it anyway through Amazon) - the wired connection started starting and stopping and then just stopped working altogether so the entire $90 mouse is useless.<br /><br />I like having a vertical mouse, but I really can't be spending hundreds of dollars each year on a new mouse. Such a bummer.
140006922X|5.0|My husband enjoyed reading the book Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazerath. He stated it was well written and easy to follow. Considering he has vision problems he read it in just under a week. That says a lot for the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun to play. If you pay attention you can score the points, or just have fun and clear the jelly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm close to finishing this book.  It has kept my interest from the beginning to where I am now and I am having a hard time putting it down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always enjoy John Grisham books and this was no exception.  The main character Cassie Black is just out of prison for a crime that she  allegedly committed. What I wondered was, why when she had other opportunities did she return to a life of crime?  It is an engaging book with twists and turns, along with double crosses.  If you like a good mystery but don't need all the gore of some mystery writers you will like this book.  The ending is left floating somewhat and that makes for multiple scenarios, which I like.
B00006F2WY|5.0|Jon Lord is the best rock keyboard player ever. He composed this, played with young guys...<br />Orchestra is great, all the people doing concerts with orchestras moved from here.<br /><br />One guy is named Ian Gillan... and this Child In Time is soooo good.<br /><br />You don't need this if you like Deep Purple. But you MUST have this if you love Deep Purple.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|the dvd was exactly what i expected. it played without any problems :) and arrived quickly. the film has options for subtitles but doesnt show them atuomatically.
0545626382|5.0|My daughter and I love these books! She's read them twice already! Can't wait to see Catching Fire next month!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There are rules when it comes to young adult fiction.  Yes, bad things happen, and the main character can be killed, but not like this, when it doesn't make sense.  I'm so glad that I only started this series two days ago.  I hadn't invested a lot in it, and now I will return all the books.
B007ADIRDM|1.0|I cannot stand anything with the Monster High name. The toys are not very well made for the amount that is charged. The kids may like it but it is a disappointment.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was needing a weather data app for my kindle and this one in particular had the most starts.  I agree with the number of stars in that weather is available daily, hourly or up to a week.  A map of the location is also available on the screen.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This book involved me from the beginning. It was not the best &#34;do-it-yourself&#34; book that I have read but I did enjoy it. I was intrigued by the title which prompted me to buy this on my Kindle. I'm not so sure I would recommend it to anyone unless as a comparative to other similar books.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a great game I have been enjoying it I would like some more friends my code is 19cfce
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the presentation of this book. I have read other &#34;beyond death&#34; books and this one was right up there. I loved the explanation of someone on the medical side interpreting this death experience first hand. Parts of it were a little dry (scientific) but that was easy to skim over.  I would recommend this book to others.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Part two of a cool as hell funny movie! This movie rocks! You have to have this movie in your collection!  Buy it people!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i love the soothing music. the puzzles are a good challenge,too. when i've had a bad day, this game helps to relax my mind. i really enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game because it's not to hard or easy it's just right. Also because you can explore more things like the roller coaster part but your in a bucket. This game is a good one you should buy it
006202406X|1.0|I read the first two books of the trilogy and have been waiting for this book for months.  I loved the first two books.  I was so excited to read the final book.  However, I am extremely disappointed in the ending.  I just feel shocked that it ended that way.  I am irritated that I invested the time in reading it.  I feel that it was kind of a waste.  The only thing that makes sense is why both Four and Tris narrate the third book.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game. There are a lot of guns you can choose from and its way less complicated then grand left auto vice city. Thanks gameloft
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think this game is great! It has 2 ways to play ...There is challenge<br />and free play. I think free play is the best because you can make anything!
B00DQQSD2W|5.0|Ok, if you grew up with the original film or just want an amazing look inside the film making process, Rinzler's book is essential. Between the stories, pictures and multimedia elements of the enhanced ebook, you will be blown away at the exhaustive level of detail. I loved every second of it. :-)
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|I've read all the Sookie Stackhouse series books so I was keeping my expectations low for the tv series.  However so far season 1 is not that far off and I'm enjoying it.  We'll see how it goes with season 2!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have to uninstall and reinstall this app several times a week to get it to load my mail. But the web version doesn't work at all on the Fire, so I have no choice if I want to read my email.
006202406X|5.0|I took my time reading Allegiant, and I loved every bit of it! No, Mrs. Roth didn't have the ending you wanted or all the futuristic facts you thought should be there.<br />Instead she wrote a masterpiece, Tobias and Tris were amazing in there complexity and development. As a couple I loved them one mint and wanted to slap Tobias up side the head the next. Their relationship was so real and deep and sad. Yes I Cried my Eyes out and then I cried some more. I felt like I lost my best friend. I agree, Tris was so full of fire that at some point she was destined to burn out! Tris you will forever live in our harts and I feel a little braver for having read your story!! Thank you Mrs. Roth I look forward to your other works in the future!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I cannot put this book down, as Bill moves from one situation in 1927  to another, giving a great background on each!  I do like the way he delves into a subject and unearths things one has not heard, or only heard rumors of before.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandson loves this set. He is all about minecraft and he never gets tired of taking it apart and re-assembling it.
006202406X|1.0|This book is the end to my insanity. To begin with I was this books ultimate fangirl I obsessed over the series and read the whole book in less then a day... Now on to the review...<br /><br />This book is AWFUL! It starts of super slow paced with no plot point up until the halfway point. From here the conflict is introduced, but nothing even happens until the last 10% of the book when everything happens and the book starts to feel rushed. In the last 5%, the book ruins the reader, leaving them crying and not wanting to finish.<br /><br />I couldn't read the last 10 pages, the ending caused me no longer to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />Also, Veronica Roths writing style was terrible in this book. She told the story from both Tris's and Tobias's point of view and most of the time there was no distinction between what POV the book was being told from.<br /><br />My final verdict, this book ruined the series, isn't even worth 1 star, and leaves me not wanting to go and see the movie.<br /><br />TIP: DONT KILL THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE SERIES
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, I am so glad they finally developed it for Kindle Fire!! No glitches so far, just wish  I could have picked  up at level 149 instead of starting over.
006202406X|5.0|Intense. Funny. Sad. Mind-blowing. Wonderful. Well done, V. If you've heard bad things, please ignore them. Yes, the end it is heartbreaking, but it is heartbreakingly beautiful.<br /><br />Be brave, initiates.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|this is a good movie it's nice to see Hollywood get together once in awhile. these old school guys need to get together more often.
B002CGSYNU|3.0|Didn't read all the reviews before I purchased or I would have known that this was the wrong size lens cap for my camera. I have the Olympus Pen EPL-2, which apparently has a 37mm lens.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I majored in Rhetoric in college and am a voracious reader, and therefore have high standards for books. That being said, this book is one of the best I have read in a long time. The story is cleverly organized, giving the reader little bits of information at a time. Slowly, you begin to peek into the world of the silo, just as the characters themselves are understanding and uncovering their own world.<br /><br />It is brilliant, and this post-apocalyptic setting the author has created is so very detailed and thought-out, from the structure of the society to the colored clothing they wear. Shades of Brave New World (one of my favorite books)! I especially love the interweaving of current technology (IT, computers, etc) with old school stuff (pulp paper, short wave radios). There are no plot holes or discrepancies, loose ends, or parts that don't fit. The characters are fleshed out and very human, with flaws and imperfections. They are true heroes that any reader can get behind and relate to. I loved every minute of these books, and I highly recommend them. A true value at this price - hooray for self-publishing and indie authors!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great fun easy app love playing it on my kindle very addictive I would highly recommend this app great free game
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is lots of fun and I will definitely buy the next one when it comes out.  That being said, I wish there was more! Kept me entertained in the airport, but I was done with it by the end of the travel day. Still worth the $2 to me!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy!!!  I have been waiting for this game!  Only if you could use your extra moves.  But still fun.
B00BE909NO|3.0|A good read but I wasn't expected the darkness that turned up in the latter part of the book. A bit like game of thrones meets survivor
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This has become my favorite television show. The chemistry is great between all the characters. Best comedy drama of all time.  Love watching these episodes over and over.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|*****Review contains spoilers******<br />  -I was very disappointed by the third book.  I enjoyed Divergent, and thought Insurgent was a fine \\"middle\\", not as good as the first book, but a good filler.  I think Ms. Roth had too much pressure to get a third book out quickly, and this is the result.<br /><br />  -The shifts between narrators was confusing at best.  Neither had a distinct tone, and the primary was to know who was speaking was the note at the beginning of the chapter.  For two characters with such differing opinions and personalities this was disappointing.<br /><br />  -The death of Tris felt like a cheap way out.  It seemed as though Ms. Roth had cornered herself by shifting the storyline so many times and this was the only way she knew to tie it all up neatly.<br /><br />  -Four's reconciliation with his mother felt very trite.  Here's this power hungry woman who was perfectly content to leave her son, content to kill to get what she wanted, and all the sudden she just decides he is worth it?  Very unrealistic.<br /><br />  - The one paragraph grieving Four chapters were reminiscent of the blank pages in the Twilight series.  If you can't show depth and grief through writing just throw in a short/blank page and everyone will understand!  I expected a lot of turmoil from Four and instead we just got a couple of paragraphs.<br /><br />  - Overall, I wish I had stopped after the second book and made up my own ending.  It's sad when you are already hoping a fanfiction author will do a rewrite two days after a book comes out!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This has become my favorite television show. The chemistry is great between all the characters. Best comedy drama of all time.  Love watching these episodes over and over.
B00DYVUBYM|2.0|film seems to be mostly 18, 19 year olds breaking into houses, trying on stolen clothes (which is not interesting to watch), getting high and partying with other people's money (which is also uninteresting to watch), before getting busted by the law. characters themselves so unappealing, really nothing to hold my interest. unable to view entire film, not because it was boring but because not one character was engaging. felt the most sympathy for the unsuspecting parents suddenly called on to provide lawyers for their children, yet these were apparently the same parents who failed to teach their children not to steal. have no idea who'd be interested in this story, as told. part I liked best was the sequence where the young man first went to a new school; filmmaker captured how difficult it can be for a high schooler as an outsider, and how that made him vulnerable to the opportunistic Rebecca character - that connection was communicated well. The Rebecca character was really something else, and the actress who played her did a very good job, as I really disliked the character; total disregard for other people's property, but then all the characters shared that trait. so story was a fail for me, largely because disliked/disapproved of lead characters and the writer didn't do enough to humanize most of them. the best writing was done with the young man character, I sort of got him. most of the young women characters just seemed vacuous, except the Rebecca character; in another story, she'd have the makings of a really scary villain. on the plus side, the actresses/actors were all very good, and I got to learn how police execute a search/arrest warrant.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This has become my favorite television show. The chemistry is great between all the characters. Best comedy drama of all time.  Love watching these episodes over and over.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Spoiler alert: Overall, I neither really liked it or disliked it. Allegiant is definitely the weakest book in the trilogy. I understood why Tris chose to sacrifice herself for her brother; however, I thought the death was unnecessary to the overall plot. I was not bothered by the fact that Tris died-it was the way she died. Completely unnecessary. I feel that Roth killed her for shock value rather than to fulfill the plot line. That being said, her death would add to the plotline and Tris's character development if the death was meaningful. However, Roth decided to let her live through the death serum, only to have her shot to death right after. Makes no sense. I also found Uriah's death completely unnecessary to the plot.<br />I was not impressed with the alternating POV's. It can be done successfully, but it wasn't done well in the book. When reading, I had to sometimes go back to the top of the chapter to see whose POV I was reading-the characters were too much alike. There was very little character development throughout the book-I felt like the characters were merely narrators.<br />I did like that the book answered some questions as to the \\"world outside\\" and I did like the overall story line. I like the epilogue and the description of Four's grief. It wasn't a bad book per say...I just feel that Roth's inexperience was quite evident in Allegiant
0316219266|5.0|The other books written about Amazon were invariably lacking and/or incomplete. Not this one. Stone does a masterful job of tracking down key players, piecing together heretofore unknown elements, and remaining objective about his subject. This ranks among my top five company profiles.<br /><br />Reading the book gave me a new appreciation for the ruthlessness of Amazon and Jeff Bezos in particular. I admire what they have done, but not the way that they have done it.<br /><br />Kudos to Stone for such meticulous research and such a bold first book. I want more.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It's very fun but I like potatoes the graphics are ok and there's no walking but other than that very fun
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A very different book from the 'norm'.  I liked it but it was definitely not my favorite book to read.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Even if you are not a comic book fan, this movie is very entertaining. If you followed the various movies connected to this one, you will not be disappointed of how it all came together.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is so well researched and well written and very, very easy to read and understand. Of course many will dismiss the whole thing as heretical fiction because the commitment to their Christian faith is anchored in the gospels and the stories of Jesus as written in them. But in this book I believe that Reza Asian has written a clear, educated report of life, religion, politics and history that accurately reflects &#34;The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34; and thereby contradicts and dismisses much of the Gospels' contents.<br /><br />I am inclined to try to verify the veracity of most things told to me as being historically factual. Yet as I read this book I was quite shocked by how easily I had accepted some of the most improbable tales told to me since childhood simply because everyone else did. I know I questioned the logic of much of it, but never really dug any further.<br /><br />Thank you Reza Asian for bringing together all of the threads from so many available sources and weaving a more complete picture of Jesus of Nazareth and his times, We have accepted the gospels, and maybe have been led to believe that they are eye-witness accounts of the events in Jesus's life and the lives of his followers. But as Mr Asian says, they are simply testaments of faith written many years after the events.<br /><br />What I believe is one of the most interesting things I learned from this book is how carefully the story of Jesus was crafted and how fiercely the &#34;legend&#34; was protected by the key players, and how similar the politics of those days in that particular part of the world are to the selection, and grooming of today's political and religious figureheads in our own times.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am likely in the minority here but I really enjoyed the book. It's definitely not perfect but then again the first 2 weren't either. The middle plods along quite a bit and that stuff about the GP and GD's was mildly annoying. The first part and the last part of the book was great. I thought the action moved along fairly briskly but it was a little slower than Insurgent. I'm actually OK with the fact that she killed off Tris because to me her death represented the ultimate act of selflessness done for the right reasons. It brought it back to the beginning of Divergent for me when she wondered if she was selfless enough to stay in Abnegation... It came full circle. I like the fact there were two POV's, enjoyed seeing the world and events from Tobias' POV. I am absolutely OK with the fact that Tobias in Allegiant was different than Tobias from Divergent/Insurgent because in the first two I was seeing Tobias through Tris' eyes vs. his own perspective. The last 10 chapters and the epilogue were probably my favourite in the book.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out for months now. I was expecting an ending that left me completely shocked and amazed at the outcome, and that was not what I got at all. It started out very slow, and I was not even really involved in the story until about 60% though. Quite opposite to my reactions to the other two in the series. The ending left me feeling depressed and hopeless. It seemed slammed together and not nearly up the the standards set by the previous two books.<br />There were a few moment that completely shocked me and I enjoyed, but the ending really just ruined it for me.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Good guide to positive thinking.<br /> Especially for those who have tried it and stopped. Very easy exercises. Perfect for kindle.<br />This is not a book to read through. More a gentle reminder to keep near to hand.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|Let me first say that generally I love Joss Whedon's work.  His past works I have watched (Buffy, Angel, The Avengers, Dr. Horrible's, Serenity, Firefly) I enjoyed ever so much, and really looked forward to this movie, too.  I have seen modernized renditions of Shakespeare in movies and plays in the past, some wonderful, some just okay, but this, to me, is an embarrassment.  I felt like I was watching a group of actors recite lines and drink excessively throughout!  I am beyond disappointed!  There's no reason this movie should be this bad with such a cast of actors and such a director.  I really like Alexis Denisof and I love Amy Acker.  Denisof's acting in this movie is so bad - his delivery of lines, lack of inflection - it's like he wasn't even trying!  And Acker wasn't much better.  They play the main characters in this movie, and yet, there is absolutely NO chemistry between them!  How is that possible?  They played characters very much in love on the TV series Angel, and there was bookoos of chemistry between them on there!  I can't in all fairness blame the actors, though.  Generally bad acting is a result of bad directing, and it is rampant in this movie!  Honestly, I've never seen such a bad rendition of a Shakespeare play in my life!!  My daughter and I watched this together and were both deeply disappointed!  The next morning, we had to watch Kenneth Branagh's version of \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" to wipe the memory of this travesty from our minds.  If you want to see a really great version of this play, then Branagh's version is it.  In fact, Branagh's version is as close to perfection as one can get!  But, this, Whedon's version, should NEVER have been made!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This item is good for pages with no video.  However when displaying video the images halt and do not appear to stream in a fluid manner.  I would not recommend this product.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the story line. The love between Eva and Gideon is very passionate. It makes me want to continue reading the series to see where they end up. The only problem I had were a few grammatical errors, but their story kept me turning the pages.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Better than I expected. I forgot about the zombies. It held my attention. It was nice to see Pitt again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read Enders game when i was in college, staying up all night to finish it.  It is among my favorite books, sharing the top five with books such as &#34;The Eight&#34; and &#34;The Stand&#34;.  Plenty of other reviews will summarize the book, so i wont be doing that.  I will simply say that is masterfully told story with a brilliant ending and true character development.  The book is further enhanced by the parallel novel &#34;Enders Shadow&#34; which came out in 1999,  which add subtelties and complexities to the story that might not have been apparent in a stand alone read of Game.<br /><br />Ender and Bean are two of my all time favorite literary characters (along with PUG - magicians nephew, Harry Dresden, Matrim Cauthon (sorry Rand) and Jon Snow, and potentially Kalidin (way of kings, Brandon sanderson)).  If you have not read this book yet, do yourself a favor before seeing the movie and block out 8 hours and read it.  You will not regret it
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! Really enjoy the story and the acting. Definitely on the addictive side though, I breezed through the season in weekend. Worth watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it!  It kept me engaged through the entire book. I am reading the trilogy for the second time. It's a great story.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Thoughtfully written and gives insight into how being the underdog can sometimes be a good thing.  Great research by the author.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|This is quite an album especially the harmony but I really wish they had other songs. Songs like FOREVER, FALLING, DON'T SAVE ME, and GO SLOW were on past EPs so I felt a little cheated but the rest of the album makes up for it somewhat. The album bounces from a 90s R&B vibe on IF I COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND to a modern day indie pop groove like THE WIRE and DAYS ARE GONE (which sounds like the next single) and that I did enjoy.<br /><br />I keep wondering how folks feel about the album in comparison to their live shows b/c they definitely sound different but great.
1609611543|4.0|This was a very interesting book and I suspect it is quite valid in its information. I found the most interesting item was how wheat has been modified (GMO or just plain GM) so much, and that is what is causing all the trouble!
B0047SKR54|5.0|Trying to find something worth watching. I searched IMDB top 100 and Apocalypse Now was recommended.  I was presently suprised
B000PC0S5K|5.0|The most helpful and understandable work so far.  We can be an example to all around us with this understanding.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun relaxing game  doesn't require in game purchases<br />Great graphics easy to play characters are great  Fun for all ages
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Cheese-o-tronic! Mindless movie watchers would love this  - lame acting, bad science, predictable plot, nuclear explosions. Need I say more?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good read.  Really kept my interest.  Couldn't put it down.  A sequel would be great.  Good characters to follow.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|couldn't get it to work under any circumstances whatsoever I could not make this device work properly and there's no way you can screw up the installation
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Not at his best. The storytelling and examples given were familiar and less enlightening to an avid reader. I was prepared for an up close understanding of the mechanics of the battle to reveal how relate to our own battle which I think which was attempt bur failed in the examples provided
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Amazing graphics and fun to play. Best deer Hunter yet! Good guns to choose from and fun challenges. Free and fun for all!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm brand new to this game.  I trust the ratings of others but cannot adequately a game I've yet to play.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie.  A story with multiple twists and turns, fantastic scenery,  and looks fantastic in Blue-Ray.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging fun to play it gets interesting but not too time consuming and makes u think and try to remember
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Wonderfully crafted period piece spun around Grants boyish charm, supported by a group so perfectly type cast that are only upstaged by the scenery.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Thanks for this quick, easy app.. I love using it on my kindle. I never have to search through my purse when i need to do math :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun! It kind of reminds me of temple run, but this game is WAY COOLER!!!!<br />YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAY THIS GAME!!! ;)
B009APMNB0|5.0|I received the product today.  The software installation takes about 20 minutes but it is automatic.  The software detected that I had dual monitors and it calibrated each monitor automatically.  The process was very straight-forward.  I highly recommend this product -- it does exactly what it is supposed to do and the price is very reasonable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is cool everyone should try this!!!u will fall in love the minute u play. And the best thing is, ITS TOTALLY FREE!!!:)
B0035JNTA6|4.0|Witty comedy that will make you realize the duckface is actually called blue steel. Must watch for new couples, because if she hasn't seen it, fix that.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading Mr. King's books as long as I can remember and now w/ Kindle available, more than ever. The way Doctor Sleep segues from The Shining to this is almost seamless if you've read or even seen The Shining. I am truly his #1 fan and hope someday to meet him in person. I live in Massachusetts so maybe I'll see him at a Red Sox game if only to say hi.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Have enjoyed this game for about 6 months. It has it's glitches, but mostly minor. My only real problem is losing neighbors that I've been playing with since the beginning, during the last upgrade. They have been completely deleted, &amp; sadly I have no way to reconnect with them. This has been the best &quot;free&quot; game I've come across, so far.
6305428042|4.0|My wife saw this movie a while back and enjoyed it so much she suggested we get it for our collection. After viewing it I could only agree. Funny movie, just had to have it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great like most cables. Why I ordered this one is because of the 5ft length. I needed a longer cable and am happy with this.
B00DB624GS|5.0|Great music and a flashback soundtrack back to the 70s for me. Have not listened to this on headphones yet but will. Sweet guitar interplay between Green and Kirwan.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br />The setting reminded me of places and people I have had contact with.<br />Visualizing was easy and made it more interesting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Remember &#34;Upstairs,Downstairs&#34;? The first glimpse into the life of an English Estate? Well, Downton Abbeyis even better! Covering the tumultuous years between 1906 and 1920,the 3 seasons introduce you to the wonderful country estate and the lives of Lord Grantham, his wife Cora, and his 3 daughters as well as a lively  and conniving bunch of domestics.  World War 1 serves as a distinct character, and Maggie Smith, as the Lord's Mum (Dowager Dutchess) adds the right touch of elegant irony, sarcasm, and love.  Dring the last season, Shirley MacLaine makes our cup  runneth over with her incisive portrayal of Cora's rich American Mom, with homes in NewYork and Newport.  The dialogue is earnest and never boring, and the situations often riveting. Binge watch away!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is super fun. Every time I turn on my Kindle, I find my self opening this game to collect money and start New projects.  It's become my favorite game on the Kindle
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Each episode contains 3 charming and funny clips following the trials and tribulations of farm living for one very clever sheep, Shaun!  A funny and entertaining claymation program that the entire family will enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I choose this rating because it keeps me trying and trying on each level.<br /><br />It makes me very angry when I get down to one or two jellies and can't finish.<br /><br />I have played the word games and bingo but did not find them as amusing
B005PK56TA|5.0|I really enjoyed this season. Did the burned guy kill himself in jail or did he escape?  Either way, I really liked it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Wahts up with all the 1 stars??no prob for me. Anyway this game is awesome and addictive. Love it get it!!!!
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I have waited quite a while to write a review of THE CROW. I saw it when it was first released and was mesmerized by it for its unique style and by the death of Lee. I returned to it and I have watched several times once again this year. Film making has changed since this film was first released and that is what makes this film stand out. It almost looks like an artificial Gothic horror film, something very dark, something very strange, something very different, not artificial at all in reality. The characters are real, yet they seem to exist in a very unreal world, and there is its strength, its life. Its nightmarish quality is hard to shake. It looks like it came from another time, another era, all its own. It does not fit nicely into any genre. It is all its own. Brandon Lee's Eric Draven is such a powerful, subtle, vengeful, remorseful and tragic figure that he is almost hard to watch. I do not think I have ever seen such a performance. Brandon Lee's Eric Draven is the heart, body and soul of THE CROW. There is no other film quite like it.
0307341550|4.0|It was a different type of book than I normally read, and it was good to branch out.  I purchased used vs new.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|1960'S PSYCHO is probably one of Hitchcock's best known film. Its images and sounds are indelibly etched into the psyche of our culture. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the Bates Motel, Bernard Herrmann's score, Saul Bass' main title designs, the shower scene and many other elements are cinematic icons. One element of this film that has not been given due recognition is Martin Balsam's performance as Milton Arbogast the private investigator. Balsam embodied the personification of professionalism and determination yet he was cut off in mid stream. I think there is a statement being made about the very nature of justice and fate and that life is not always fair.<br /><br />This is a film that I can watch time and time again. I am not so sure what the fascination is. Each time, it never fails to captivate me and play with my emotions. I suppose it has that voyeuristic quality about from within the images and characters on screen and then again from the viewer's perspective of wanting to see more and somehow indulging of the shock value of it all.<br /><br />This review is for the Psycho: Universal Legacy Series (Special Edition) (1960)
0307341577|4.0|It was an easy read, kept my attention, and I enjoyed it.  Worth the time to read.  Purchased used vs. new.
B00A2H9X6I|4.0|Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie is unsettling, disturbing and still sympathetic in many was and always thought provoking. This version of this tale is dark and thought provoking. It is a very different version than that told by Brian De Palma. The cinematography and editing do this film well. Director Kimberly Peirce seems to have concentrated on the person and not the mayhem that can be unleashed. I felt this was closer thematically to Stephen King's novel in many ways. With the today's ability to touch people across the globe at almost any time of day with almost any message, be it unkind or bullying and downright hurtful in nature, this film seems very current. It also is so thought provoking from the biblical perspective. When is too much of anything enough?
030758836X|1.0|After the first two I thought it would have a better plot/ending.  Wasn't impressed.  Glad I purchased used, then sold.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|If you're a fan of Motorhead, you will love this album.  Vintage Motorhead.... hard hitting, loud, in your face rock and roll.  Has a feel of some songs from earlier days.  If you're not a Motorhead fan, or just a casual listener, whats wrong with you!  LOL
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My children love this game. They plays these for hours at a time. It is very fun to watch them compete with each other
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|When u play I'll get headaches from the hd . When I started it hurt my head super bad and hurts
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app! It's beautiful, very well-designed, lots of options. I go to sleep with rain or ocean. The timer and fade options are great. Couldn't<br />ask for more!
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|I'm glad this was offered as app of the day so I didn't waste any $.99.  I will be removing it from my device.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|This is the second season of Star Trek, a program I watched the first time around, in 1967, and loved.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I wish this dries could go on, but reading this, I know it has to finish. But it won't stop me from reading this series over and over. Even knowing how it ends.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />I have never been so disappointed in a book in all my life.  I literally could not sleep last night because I was so upset with how this final book of a trilogy was handled.  I love, love, loved the first and second books of this series.  I fell in love with the characters and found the plot lines to be riveting.  I felt like I was going to burst waiting for the third and final book to come out.  A third of the way in, I found myself to be trailing off and getting bored.  None of the characters felt familiar anymore.  The connections were gone.  The changing POV was pointless and distracting.<br /><br />I was left with so many questions.  Allegiant to who? What happened to the brave, strong girl we all fell in love with?? Yes, we got to see what was in Four's head, but he wasn't the same.  What happened to him? Why were the fight scenes and conflicts so repetitive?  Why would Evelyn just give up everything and all the factionless just be ok with everything at the drop of a hat?  Why do all the non-redeeming people (Marcus, Evelyn, Peter, Caleb, etc.) get to live while Tris dies? If tris was so desperate to live in insurgent,  why did she willingly sign get death card in allegient? Why would she go in unarmed? Who the eff kills of the protagonist in a YA romance novel?!?!?  What is the point of this book and subsequently the series???<br /><br />I frequently reread series over and over again. After finishing this book, I just want to delete this series from my Kindle and never think about them again.  I feel used by Roth and that she really DGAF about anyone or anything about this final book.  I can only hope and pray that the movie folks see the backlash from the final book and rewrite the movie so Tris lives.  What a let down.<br /><br />Eta, a better more clever ending would have included either tris or four putting their knife throwing skills to good use. Ugh, I could think of a zillion better ways this book could have ended. Maybe I should just go to to fan fiction. Still pissed 4 days later.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I like this it could youse some fixing and maybe a little more interesting other than that it is a really good game and I like it...
0399226907|5.0|This book is very cute and perfect for a toddler up to 1st grade. It teaches children how caterpillars evolve into butterflies!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I can't believe these books just get better and better. Gregory adds a layer to history that brings these historical figures to life as real people with hopes, dreams, ambitions, and faults. I'm getting The White Princess next!!
0345457684|5.0|I recommend this book.  I found it interesting and well put together. As do the majority of reviews, so I see no major reason to sing its praises.<br /><br />So this is mostly in response to some of the negative reviews, some of which did have some valid points:<br /><br />Warning -- spoilers<br /><br />1.  \\"It's too violent\\"  My response:  Set in a universe where the rich and powerful can survive for thousands of lifetimes, and people can be killed and brought back to life on a whim (for a price)?  Yea, boy I sure would expect all the \\"blood diamond\\" \\"poison gas factory sited in town\\" \\"crush the little people\\" problems to just go away.  Torture, murder, and intimidation are business tools TODAY.  In this book's universe the volume knob is just turned a bit higher.  There is also the point that the story takes place in the \\"bad part of town\\" and it may well be that the vast majority live nice happy lives.  That being said:  If you are the type of person who is going to freak out (and / or miss plot points) because folks are being tortured and killed:  This is not the story for you.  If you are the type just looking for torture, this is probably not the story for you either.  Just like in real life:  It happens.<br /><br />2.  \\"It's not William Gibson et al\\"  My response:  Thank goodness.  I've read many (most) of the books that these folks mention.  Some are ok.  Sorry folks, not all worship Neuromancer, some of us don't even like it that much.  I don't mind if you do.<br /><br />3.  \\"It's not a good noir/detective/sf/mystery/cyberpunk\\"  My response:  This is probably true to some extent.  If there is a checklist for each of these, I suspect this misses a few boxes.  I don't care.<br /><br />4.  \\"The writing style is (insert negative here)\\"  My response:  This is personal taste.  For example:  Some people love C.J. Cherryh and talk about all the action in her books, I find even a single page stunningly dull.  Since I am (of course) the only valid judge of these things, all disagreeing others are just wrong.  (that WAS sarcasm, unlike some folks)<br /><br />So, bottom line:  I say:  Good book, read it.  Unless violence bothers you, then go read \\"The Door into Summer\\".
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  I had never heard of orphan trains and what these children had to go through.  Didn't want the story to end.  Wanted to know what happened to the foster girl.  Good read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! Better than any I have used ever! It's so simple to operate and has a lot of extra functions that others don't.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|JUST GET THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the best book in the world you should  get this book now it was WONDERFUL!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game..However, I am on the 65th step except on my kindle. I had to start all over..
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|And sometimes we remember it, often only in dreams, but it<br />Is always there waiting to remind un who we are.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So many have given this book such low ratings, but I don't think it could have gone any other way. I think Roth stayed true to her characters and plot through the end. Heartbreaking, but loved it!
B00CHVJODE|4.0|a good movie for the grandkids, they loved it!<br />kept them quiet for the entire movie. they are 5, 4 & 4.
B00A88FLI0|3.0|My son loved all of the detail of this set, but he was constantly repairing it. On several occasions it slipped out of his hand as he was picking it up and lots of pieces broke apart. I think the design could have been put together better. It's fine if you just want to look at it all put together though, just not sure many kids will do that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one app that I just have to keep playing.My partner gets annoyed with me but it helps me to relax after a hard day.Tv is not very good so I play this whilst watching.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|Its really well done, holds you the whole way. Not light entertainment but not a big downer either. Phillip seymore hoffman is a favorite of mine and he is great as usual. I think I enjoyed meryl streep in this probably more than anything else I have seen her in. She really comes through
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Book is forgiving to sporadic readers.  Picked up and put down books many times. Had to sneak in bits and pieces here and there.  Beware...seems very realistic, those with vivid imagination should tread carefully!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is really entertaining  and great for a time consuming game when there is a need to wait for something or someone! Everyone uses it and each level shows more challenging!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not sold on ending, but kept me wondering!<br />Twists were intriguing and well planned--good character build of mostly sympathetic roles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u like this get the computer game I've Benn playing the computer game for a while soo yeah is boss
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great throwback to my youth.  Great Romantic Comedy.  Memorable one-liners and laugh out loud moments.  Check out the sequels for sure.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am hearing new sounds in my favorite songs that I did not before with these.  This is good but also a bit annoying, the jump in quality I had with these is unexpected...familiar songs sound different to me now.  Good quality, good price, trusted name, you cant go wrong with these.
006202406X|5.0|This is a very good book. Don't be deceived by bad reviews. It exceeds expectations. Read it if you're a fan of dystopians and young adult fiction. It is different from other books of this category (for example the Hunger games).
B008VLWE5E|2.0|This book is one of the worst examples of the all too common problem with kindle books: garbled nonsense replacing words in far too many instances. The translation from page to computer must be done by some sort of optical character recognition, understandably. But why not have a human proofread this thing? If someone were just looking for instances of gibberish, like  \&#62;p for example, the entire book could be proofread in a day. Given now much money Amazon will make selling the book, it's shameful not to spend the small amount it would cost to proofread it.<br /><br />Too bad, as this is an excellent book. Maybe Amazon's scheme is to get you to buy the print version after being disappointed with the horrible kindle version.
B00C7L2QCA|1.0|What a waste of my time, my money, and the worst waste of all using Mads Mikkelsen in such a poorly written role.  The film is too much Hugh Dancy in an overwritten, dominating, unbelievable role. And, as far as Fishburne, he speaks his lines as though he had his cue cards right in front of him.  Might as well let us read the cue cards, ourselves.<br /><br />Mads Mikkleson is a magnificent actor, but he has no personality in this role.  He, too, sounds like he is reading directly from cue cards.  When I rented episode 2, after watching  episode 1, I thought Hannibal's role would improve, but it didn't. So far, this series is not about Hannibal Lector, it is about Will Graham and his weird ability to see the past, filmed in such a way that watching him makes me dizzy.  Is that good filmmaking??? No, but it IS lazy writing.<br /><br />All I can say is that I'm glad I only bought two episodes and not the whole season. I wonder who should be blamed for this travesty of a good television show, the writer or the director?  Who????????
B00000JR2A|5.0|&#34;Seeds of Love&#34; broke up Tears for Fears. The protracted recording process and tour that followed pulled (and fight over management) Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith apart until their reunion album (the aptly titled)[[ASIN:B0002M5T34 Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]].<br /><br />Even if &#34;Seeds&#34; had been the last album the duo made, it would have been a terrific sent off--this is a brilliantly written, arranged and constructed album that varied from what came before with flashes of jazz, gospel and soul integrated into the band's sound.<br /><br />Oleta Adams shines on the album. Discovered playing in a hotel in Missouri by Orzabal and Smith, she adds a soulful quality to the album with her singing and piano playing.<br /><br />The remaster for this album isn't the way to go. Don't get me wrong, it isn't unlistenable but it is compressed and sounds somewhat harsh compared to the original issue on CD. If you're worried about the bonus tracks they are available on [[ASIN:B000001EFW Saturnine Martial & Lunatic]].<br /><br />The rich production here truly deserves to be heard on an uncompressed mastering.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's been like 4 months since this game came out.Why does amazon take so long to get great apps like this one.I mean like they don't even have a instagram and that came out before this game.But anyways this game is addicting,exciting,and so far not one problem.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Yes, I watch really great movies/series over and over again. The great thing about this one is that even my husband and my brother want to see it for the 4th time!  Now THAT’s great entertainment!
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Love stevie and this was a great price so I gave to my daughter for gift and she was thrilled
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I found the Divergent Series just a few months ago and could not believe what I'd been missing out on. I was eagerly awaiting the release of the third and final installment. I was looking forward to finally getting some answers and gaining some insight into the issues that plagued the main characters in the series. I was expecting angst and destruction, I was expecting an uphill battle that would ultimately lead to some sort of resolution. I was NOT expecting heartbreak of this kind. I understand that for good to triumph sometimes sacrifices must be made and I understand that those sacrifices sometimes may include death. However, I felt as though Tris made plenty of sacrifices throughout the series without having to literally die herself. I also understand that death happens, but in Allegiant I could not find a legitimate reason for Tris' death - other than perhaps 'shock value.'<br /><br />I will stick to the first two books - which I loved - and return this one and pretend it did not happen.<br />What a sad end to what could have been an amazing series.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Great game goog competition, I love the ability for rematch. A keeper great time killer. Try it you'll love it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great device to use to put your Chrome browser/netflix/youtube on the tv. but that's it! as of now, these are the only apps available. hoping google upgrades their system soon!
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is a wonderful app! It lets you go straight to the bible book and then chapter. You can keep up with anybody now! Thank you very much!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I purchased this with the idea of using aircast to stream my home videos & pictures to my living room tv. Google's new fail update has blocked third party apps from allowing you to play your own movies. Google has killed the chromecast. At this point, if you own an xbox or a ps3 your better off using those devices than the chromecast, there are no advantages to using the chromecast at this time. Maybe later on they will decide to allow third party apps, but so far its only good for hulu & netflix.
B008GAXUGW|5.0|I have always liked the Brilliant classic collections since they are a fantastic value ranging from $1-$2 per disk. This is no exception. This is very pleasant music which can be played while engaged in another activity or if you like focus on the music. The music is not exceptional nor is it mediocre or incompetent. But after listening to the 37 CD set you will not remember one piece standing out from another. So enjoy the string, cello, piano, guitar, and symphony CDs. You will of course remember the Minuet but that is all. Put it all on playlist on your iTune library and let it play as you go about  your business. There is nothing here to distract you or to carry you away,
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Saw the movie, hated it! It was slow and Will Smith slept through most of it! I really expected more action on Will Smith's part.  Usually like all his movies, but very disappointed with this one.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm disappointed with Allegiant.  I'm disappointed because I think it could have been so much better.<br /><br />First, the POV thing, while interesting, didn't serve much of a purpose.  Tris and Tobias could have been the same person if the chapter hadn't stated who was the narrator at the beginning.  There were times when I had to flip back to see who was talking because it was really that similar.  They're not the same character, and I think I expected more differentiation and didn't get it.<br /><br />Tris sacrificing herself for Caleb.  I was disgusted when I read it yesterday.  After thinking on it, I see why she did it.  Tris struggled with her Abnegation roots from Day One and there was no way she was going to let Caleb go in there and die.  No way.  It's like when Tobias said \\"Of course she did.\\" It made sense.  But really, Uriah is stuck in a coma in a vegetative state and there was no way to work that in there somehow?  Couldn't there be organ donation in their world?  I still don't like it.<br /><br />I felt the main story of the book was much the same as the first two.  Government control, uprising, more control, uprising.  This time it wasn't among the faction and factionless but GD's and GP's.  It was repetitive and boring.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The start was very slow. It seemed to go on and on but not say much. Once you get past those first sections or so it turns out to be an okay read. You can figure out who the killer is, or at least you think you have, but the kicker is that it's  a little more difficult to figure out how and why.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|At first I thought it was going to be a cool app. It worked only on four pictures. After that, the darn program wouldn't open any other pictures to edit!
B008ROG6E0|2.0|lousey acting with a story line that could have been much better. good premise, just poorly done. save your money.
006202406X|4.0|Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />The biggest problem with me was how Four acted in the middle of the book. Yeah, most of the reason Tris didn't trust Nita was jealousy, but Tris also has an uncanny sense of distinguishing people as evident in both Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />The thing that gets me though is how some of the people that are giving this book low reviews are basing off of the fact it doesn't have a happy ending. I'm glad it didn't, for the reason that Veronica is writing about war, and people die. I'm not all happy about Tris dying, but I do understand it and I'm happy that she died for actually accomplishing something instead of in vain. I did enjoy the ending as it's a reflection on real life. Not everyone gets happy endings. I know it's just books, but if every book in the world had a happy ending, then would it be exciting?<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire Divergent Series and I hope that Veronica keeps writing interesting characters and great plots in the future.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works awesome with all my devices (MacBook Pro Retina, Nexus 7 Tablet 2nd Gen and Nexus 4 phone). I love using my devices as the controller and the convenience I get from it.<br /><br />So far I enjoy Netflix, YouTube and Hulu Plus on but would like to have more Apps especially one that would enable you to Stream your own collection to Chromecast.<br /><br />The perfect I believe would be VLC app or something that could play all video files, formats and codecs to your TV that would just make Chromecast untouchable and PERFECT!<br /><br />I hope something like this is allowed on Chromecast if not then it seriously being crippled :(
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I watched \\"Pacific Rim\\" last night and was just completely turned off by it.  I know it got all of these rave reviews, but aside from the excellent CG, I was just totally bored by this turkey and couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  Most of the \\"acting\\" was so painful that it was as if all the actors were being directed to act as if they'd just graduated from the \\"Close Cover Before Striking School of Over-The-Top Over-Acting\\" or something.  I hate it when the characters are nothing but over-used stereotypes that we've all seen a thousand times in a thousand equally bad movies.  I did not find the forced acting styles cute or amusing; simply annoying.  Even Ron Perlman, who is a decent enough actor, sucked in his role; even he succumbed to this cartoonish style of acting.  In fact, the whole thing reminded me of some of the current crop of kid's cartoons.  I mean I get that del Toro was doing a kind of homage to the Godzilla movies and such that I actually enjoyed as a kid.  Back then, those were fun due in large part to the fact that they were so cheesy.  I loved looking for the occasional hidden sticks and such that would unintentionally pop onto the screen.  That's not to say that Pacific Rim did not have any good moments; there were actually a few fun scenes; a few (very few) actual funny gags and such sprinkled here and there.  But there was always a real earnestness and seriousness with those original monster flicks that I watched in the 50's and early 60's that was entirely missing in Pacific Rim.  I guess times have become way too sophisticated these days to try and accurately re-create those more innocent times and movies of the past.  For me, Pacific Rim only manages to come across as insincere and phony; purposefully light and airy-fairy.  The early Godzilla stuff was funny precisely because it took itself so seriously, whereas Pacific Rim does not.  To me, Pacific Rim was also one long, extended marketing ad designed to get kids 8-12 interested in buying Kaiju and Jaeger toys, the royalties of which I can only assume would kick back to Guillermo del Toro and company.  I don't know, maybe I'm just so old and cynical that I can't see the forest for the trees anymore.  But I just hated the predictability of it all, the horrid acting, the awful writing, etc.  The only thing of interest to me throughout was the CG stuff.buying Kaiju and Jaeger toys, the royalties of which I can only assume would kick back to Guillermo del Toro and company.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|If you enjoy a good musical performance, with some inappropriate humor and a dash of romance, you will love this movie. Rebel Wilson almost stole the show.
031623480X|5.0|This is an amazing book. With a history of Alzheimer's running through my family I've thought for years that my getting it was inevitable. Now I know better. I can change my brain's destiny. Thank you Dr. Perlmutter for this book.
8866135704|4.0|The 2013 planner was a 5 star product. However the international holidays page has been suppressed in the 2014 edition. The holiday annotation in the interior of the planner has been suppressed as well.<br /><br />Designers should not apply themselves to the worsening of a perfect product. Or, is it just another attack of the cost reduction people?
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|It was entertaining and funny at times. If you enjoyed &#34;Men in Black&#34;, then you might like this. It's funny, and both actors are adequate in their roles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Unexpected direction but still a fascinating story line and excellent writing. I hurt for the heroes, cheer for their victories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  It is hard to put down.  Works great on my kindle fire hd.  I don't have a Facebook account but I can still enjoy this game.  It just requires a little more patience because I can't ask for help.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Purchased as a birthday gift for five year-old grandaughter who loved it!  Even though this came out in Blu-Ray not in time for the birthday, I felt that this version was fine.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Great movie! We watched it on amazon prime on our ps3. It worked wonderfully! Gotta love robin williams in this movie!
006202406X|1.0|The author lost her voice, and there was a lack of character development. Cara is the most developed character or this novel.<br /><br />The plot holes are blaring. I completed this book so I could complete the trilogy. Now it's over and I feel jilted.<br /><br />I was expecting something more coherent and less \\"everyone is at the dawn of a new revolution\\"<br /><br />This story started so strong, and ended with a fizzle.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie. Good special effects.<br />Love to see and hear about anything involving history beliefs. Was very well acted and hope to see more.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I wrecked my bike going about 40mph and it barely budged still works like a charm very durable I love this product
B003EY7JH6|5.0|Well, I've read Asimov when I was young (16) and was amased by his clearly witful writing. Now at 32, I wanted to get that spiritfull reading-experience back. I was not sure why I wanted to read excactly this book but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />When he wrote this i 1988(?) he was really on spot with how we get information now. Youtube came online i 2006, and for me the desciprion of film-books are so similar that it has Nostradamus-like features. Well, He obviously hang around scientists all the time that knew how computernetworks worked. But still I felt he also described the Kindle very well.<br /><br />Well, it blew me away, and its a fanstasic plot, and a great ending too.<br />Well, I'm really looking forward to get on with th triology!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham pulls no punches in his main character's description of a topsy-turvey world where it's hard to separate the nasties from the good guys and the only people you can trust are the dear and not-so-dear departed. He let's the justice and our prison systems drown in their own degeneracy, malfeasance and idiocy leaving little hope for improvement anytime soon. It proves you have to love something to want to take the time to cleanse it using Drano.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so happy that the Kindle finally has Candy Crush because when I received my Kindle as a gift in July I was a little upset that I couldn't get it but now I'm happy :-)

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After hearing about this game, I decided to try it out. Super fun and, as others mentioned, very easy to become addicted to! My husband loves it and kids do to! With cell phones, tablets and computers, this is the new spin on family game night!!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The DVD audio version is better than the CD. I had problems with the CD after playing it many times, it started to skip. Although it might be my CD player. Not a big issue since the purchase through Amazon included a MP3 version as well so I will just burn it again.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome love it. Great way to pass the time when you are waiting on somebody or something. Playing it all the time
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These cans sound like they cost at least 100 bucks. There's a nice extended bass that isn't over emphasized and the mids/highs are very present. They sound really flat, except for the 7db spike at 8khz which can be very harsh when listening to cymbals/hihats. The headphones aren't too pretty and the ear cups aren't comfortable but one can't complain at this price. Do the notch filter circuit mod to get rid of the harsh spike and these should sound even better.
B006WMILQU|3.0|This was an just an OK movie. It was not a great movie. I Was hoping for a little more substance.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not as funny as the first two movies. Bur it doesn't really seem like they're trying to be that funny.  Its a bit more serious witg a lot of funny bits. Still enjoyed it though.
B008JFUORW|2.0|The movie has its moments in which it is funny, but in all it just can't \\"hang\\" with the others.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|We were so surprised when we got these. It was so much fun putting these up.<br />They go so well with the fairies and all the butterflies and flowers. You don't want<br />to leave the room. My granddaughter is two and when we visit the first thing she<br />does is bring us in her room. She says &#34;Come, Sit&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun at all levels so far. It's not progressively harder to get to the next level so once you're engaged you will want to keep it up. Great time robber!

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Gene Roddenberry would be proud.  The characters ARE the younger versions of the original Enterprise crew.  I was skeptical but this is a great movie.  Action packed, tense, funny, edge of your seat, I really recommend this to anyone who remembers the Enterprise NCC 1701.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is so cool it has a lot of levels and costumes for the minion. it even has a beach level. I will play this game forever but I could not but I will if I could.  and for the girl's. that did not ever and I mean ever played minion rush! there is a pony!
B0045HCJKS|5.0|My husband had been searching for this movie everywhere with no luck. Our daughter told us to try Amazon. Look what we found!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I was told by my friend to purchase this book because  she enjoy this book. When I purchase this book, I didn't read it right way. The reason was I'm not into spiritual book, but I must say its more then spiritual book it have a great story line. Life have obstacle that; we have to go thru to become a better person. I hope you enjoy this book like millions have!
B0087X728K|3.0|too smal, with 3g you can use it 2 to 3 times at moust.<br />Really... just get the 15g-20g instead...<br /><br />Otherwise, perfomance is awesome.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed Enders Game. It was an easy, mind blowing, well written book. I plan on reading the entire series. Rosen Scott Card captures his readers attention and keeps it through the entire the book.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a very easy devise to use and be able to watch netflix.  Also the price was right. Great!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is kind of gross at times, but it is well worth viewing. My only complaint is that Amazon charges too much. They should just let us purchase the whole season, instead of nickel and diming us.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is a great app for your smartphone or PDA it has given me lots of satisfation i would recommend it to everyone who prepares or reviews documents on hand held devices...

B009LDCXNY|5.0|Amazing. My mom loved it for her birthday..Show is great. Should check it out. Def a good show if you like suspense
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There may be mild, implied spoilers.  I am not sure if I would have given this book five stars had it not been for all the horrible one star reviews that this book does NOT deserve.<br />Ok, the negatives first.<br />This book has a different pace, tone, voice ( I don't know what exactly to call it ) than the other two books; not so much that it seems out of place but it is enough that when reading them together without a time gap that it is noticeable.  There is quite a lot of character death in this series which can be incredibly depressing.  Tris continually comes across as way more \\"right\\" than a sixteen year old girl should be.<br />Now on to the positives.<br />Typical books aimed at this demographic are horribly unrealistic and usually follow the exact same plot line over and over again.  They are written in such a way that the main character is supposed to be completely average in every single way yet somehow manages to steal the hearts of everyone with two of the most handsome men to ever grace this planet fight over her.  The girl is generally incapable of making the \\"wrong\\" choice.  Take Twilight for example:  The girl falls in love with her stalker who would like to eat her, lets another boy that she doesn't love take care of her while she is pretty much suicidal over the loss of the man who wants to eat her, then chooses an immortal life in which she doesn't have to give up her family, friends, the ability to have a child, or even have to suffer the desire to eat everyone who still possesses a heart beat.  Seriously, there are absolutely no consequences for her actions and that is how this genre tends to work.  I really do not think it is a good idea to keep filling teenage girls heads with that.  In this book Tris has to actually work at her relationship with Tobias.  They have issues and they fight but they also have to approach things in a mature way and work things out.  It isn't some fake soul mate crap that sets girls up for failure.  It is completely believable.  There are constant consequences for their actions.  News flash people, in real life there are good and bad things that happen based off of your actions and nonactions.  I love that both are addressed in this series.  I love that this series doesn't make it out like every person has to lead a poor sap on in order to determine if the girl actually loves the first guy or not.  I love that Tris went through a phase where she was putting herself in unnecessary danger and then she actually matures enough to realize that sometimes trudging into a situation head first is the wrong call.  We watch a girl actually grow up and not just get her way.  I really love that.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It was awesome! The characters where looked great and their papers where so good. I will play the crap out of it when there is more levels!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This is a great show for people that like a good mystery with a lot of twists and turns. Enjoy
006202406X|1.0|Such an awful book, I was expecting something great but all I got was a silly book that made no sense. I hated the ending most of all, killing of the main character just for shock value? Ugh. I won't be watching the Divergent movies, and I won't read any of Roth's future books - and I'll make sure to tell all my family and friends not to do so either.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been impatiently waiting for this day! Sat. night I looked at New apps and thought I'd been dreaming. It's finally here!!

B002PD9JNE|5.0|Bicycle riding. You turn the pedal and you go fowards. Go down a hill and you go faster, Go up a hill and you sweat. You keep pumping your legs and maybe you go faster, depending on your fitness.  This is a great soundtrack for bicycle riding. I love bicycles and the Tour de France and I love this album.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Like the game overall but dislike the way you can get stuck at a level FOREVER, and the fact that you are asked over and over to purchase &#34;helps&#34;, so you can get to another level. I refuse to spend money on a game.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|After reading numerous reviews, I decided to purchase this multi-tool over some others. After using it for a little while now, I have to say it is worth the money. Now it is not perfect but it is almost there. I would have to breakdown the review into a few different categories:<br /><br />The knives - This is an area where this tool thrives. They are easy to get to, lock in place and then are easy to stow away…. Moreover, they are good knives.<br /><br />Handle and Pliers – Have to receive high marks as well. The grip is solid and strong (I have larger hands) with a nice feel. The pliers are spring loaded and just work really well.<br /><br />The other tools – Overall the other tools are solid (minus the scissors). The two things have hold this tool from being perfect are the scissors which are just lacking overall and the fact that you have to open the tool it to get to any tool not a knife.<br /><br />The other tools are useful and everything is well made. I definitely do not regret this purchase and will continue to use this tool for years to come. It is really well made and gets the job done. I recommend this tool because it is well worth the price and like I said almost perfect.<br /><br />ZS
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting! I love that it changed for the Halloween season :) they should create a new location like in space or on the moon that would be sweet!
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|Over the years I've found that if I can find an actor or actress that can pick a smart movie, then I never have to worry about wasting my time on a bad film if they are in it.  This is another of the growing list of smart films for Chloe.  I gave it four stars, but I've never given any move five stars - so this one ranks high on my list.  If there's any theme to the films Chloe picks is that she goes for strong feminine roles - which is all the more interesting considering her age (roughly 12).  Kick-Ass broke the mold for action heroes with Chloe as Hit Girl, and this film once again places a young female in a position of authority and power.  The movie itself is a combination of several successful themes.  It's a love story for one, it deals with the supernatural for two, it addresses bullying in a meaningful and honest way, it teaches acceptance and tolerance and - as mentioned - portrays a young woman as a hero figure.  At its core is a film about adolescent love and coming of age that will resonate with just about anyone that has lived through (or is living through) their own adolescence.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game gets you hooked and you will no matter what, have hours of fun and pissed off moments. But the game is fun, 5 stars.
0142418471|5.0|John Green has written a truly amazing book. For me this was a page turner. I had to force myself to put it down and go to bed most nights
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A fantastic read, keeps you on the edge of your seat and still leaves you wanting more! This series is a must for all fantasy fans!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed this follow-up to The Shining. Danny was a very real, very complex character, full of flaws. I won't give anything away, just that I really enjoyed the book.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|This game is just AMAZING! Props to Not Doppler. I haven't even finished the first level and yet still AMAZING! I recommend this as rated E10+ it T.
0316322407|1.0|With the exception of few parts, the rest of the book is just a pack of lies. It is not Malala, it is Christina Lamb (actually the \\"wolf\\")in Malala's (the \\"lamb\\") clothing. Perhaps Christina is taking revenge of the time when she was officially kicked out from Pakistan on account of her suspicious activities. The book should have been a narrative of Malala's personal experiences instead of calculated attacks on Islam and Pakistan. I am very much disappointed to learn that Malala's father, Christina Lamb and many others are using Malala's innocence for their own heinous purposes against Islam and Pakistan.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|We, to often, fail to appreciate our adverse experiences as the paving of the path to success.<br />As we work hard in educating ourselves to how the world works, enlightenment appears and shines on our achievements.<br />Gladwell, a researcher who uses his perceiving brain, makes sense in depth of what he learns and interprets from others  experiences, places them in context and understands the implications.<br />HIs writings, as in &#34;David and Goliath&#34; and his other bestsellers, change our minds about what is possible and give us advice on  how to use his recorded knowledge in our own lives.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Great suspense.  I haven't been this scared during a movie since I saw The Exorcist 25 years ago.  If you want a movie that will give you nightmares, this is the one for you.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Totally absorbing!  Especially interesting because it gives a German perspective on WW II, at the level of individual combatants and civilians.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|Best or in the very least, \\"enjoyable\\"/\\"listenable\\" tracks:<br /><br />1.\\"Love To Love You Baby\\",2.\\"Love Is In Control\\" 3.\\"I Feel Love\\" 4.\\"Hot Stuff\\"<br />6.\\"Bad Girls\\" 7.\\"Sunset People\\"(version on deluxe edition Not dub version)<br />8.\\"La Dolce Vita\\" 9.\\"MacArthur Park\\".<br /><br />The rest goes from \\"mediocre\\" to \\"plain old horrible\\", Summer's production cheapened, not modernized!!! Energetic brilliance stripped. Donna's music and especially her vocals were about magnificence. Alot of that is lost on this collection.<br /><br />More upsetting is fear among fans, that if we're honest about this Cd,and not say it's the best thing ever, we may not get future releases, especially vaulted stuff from Summer's Estate. Well if this project is supposed to be what determines those releases, then it failed.<br /><br />The idea of this Cd was great, but \\"some tracks\\" should have been left alone.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was painful and difficult to read. The narrative was confusing, the passion lost (almost mechanical), and the messaging I am still uncertain after having sit on it for a few days. The arc of this series is not something I seem to \\"get,\\" because what I was \\"sold\\" on (the human spirit, courage, and passion) in the beginning, turns out was not the purpose of this series (or maybe I missed it). I realize that maybe it is my fault for not seeing the author's vision for this series, but I can see that I am not alone. I, like many, am sorry I ever read the final installment. Did I have certain expectations? Yes. But it was only to have a satisfying and \\"full circle\\" revelation/ending. To see it all come together, but the way it was delivered, I ended on the last page feeling hollow and hopeless. Maybe I am not Abnegation enough to see this is not about me, but about the author's vision. However, with every book I read I take away some lesson, and I have taken aways one from reading this series. It has to do with trust and risk. With every book you open, you take a risk that it may be what you need and you learn to trust that some authors are able to give that to you and others are not. I respect the author's vision, but I do not trust her to deliver what I need as a reader.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved that it wasn't super easy or impossible to solve. It would have been nice to have hints on level 10.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When I got my first I was disappointed in the limited content I could stream from a phone or tablet. But still liked the idea.<br />I got down to my vacation home and discovered that Charter was going to start scrambling it's signal and each TV would need a box. The Chromecast provided the solution. when used with a laptop or Chromebook I can stream anything in my browser to the TV. So now I can get my Comcast/X-Finity channels and On-Demand  in charter country. Performance will depend on the device used to stream to the Chromecast. The Chromebook is a choppier motion than a more powerful laptop, probably due to the more limited buffering capabilities. Very Happy with the results and the possibilities going forward.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I love that Fishdom is available for my kindle fire, the same great game I've always liked. My only complaint is that the playing screen is very small, it doesn't even fill up the whole size of the fire, making it harder to see and harder to tap the right pieces even with a stylus. If they could make it fit the whole fire screen I would give it a five + rating. The graphics are great and it it's easy to work, but if they could just make that screen bigger.

B0092S4WLY|5.0|It's a free game, but it's a free game done well. Puzzle solving is pretty fun. This is my first time with a Kindle Fire HD and this is a very good game for it in my opinion.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Got this super fast, thanks to Prime. Needed a new cord for my kindle. The person I spoke to on the phone was so helpful
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love Chess and this is a good implementation of it for Kindle. Definitely recommend, and also, it's FREE. There are other options out there that seem to be better, but then again, they cost money. And with this, I don't feel it necessary to spend on something &#34;better&#34;.
B00DJYJPLO|2.0|What happened to Celine?  How did she turn into such a bitter angry b****?????  and on top of everything ridiculing Jessie's first wife with his son?????  Is she mad????  Not helping were the 10 minutes of Julie Delphy's boobs in your face.<br /><br />I fell in love with the romance of these 2 characters an dtheir sweetness and cleverness and all the possibilities.  Sure real life steps in but honestly this last installment was ridiculous.  Did not see any shred of romance or love or respect between these 2.  ggggeeeeezzzzzzz.  very sad.
0316322407|5.0|I had a glorious day today...I had bought two copies of this book.  Today, I donated one to my local library.  I felt almost ten feet tall; I think I felt 9' 11'' tall in remembrance of those who died on 9/11.  However, this is so much more about this young woman than the Taliban or those waging war.  She is a true-life &#34;Hunger Games&#34;-child.  I am halfway through the book. It is a must-read for educators and anyone who works with they young.  The political opinions expressed are a little muddy as to the origin (as she admits to taking credit for the works her father has written, and she changes person a bit) but I never doubt it is inevitably her voice and her story as she wishes it to be heard, and that is all right with me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks Amazon. I love candy crush best app ever .it is so addictive to play all day.get this app now.
B00915G6MG|5.0|If you're into NCIS this is a &#34;must have&#34; along with all the other Seasons.  Since Zeva is no longer with the hit show, you can watch her over and over by collecting these sets.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Love to hear her sing! She has such a strong voice! A very talented woman.  I normally listen to the country genre but I enjoy listening to Adelle!
B00AEFYW64|5.0|Excellent, but not for the little guys!  Sean Connery and Mark Harmon played beautifully together!  Suspense, excitement and lots of action.
1476727651|5.0|Vintage Stephen King. A master storyteller. You need to read The Shining first to fully appreciate this book. Look forward to more from King.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Family oriented and very entertaining!!!  Once again Mark Harmon and Jamie Lee made a great pair.  Would recommend to anyone.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I have read all of Khaled Hosseini's  books. This book was just as well written in terms of his writing style and character development. I just didn'd like the way the story line was disjointed and somehow didnt get a feeling that all the characters in the book were necessary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is the worlds best GAME EVER!<br />I LOVE THIS GAME! Iooooooooooooooooooooooove  this game ! I wish I had this game a long time ago.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game but get rid of the bombs!!  Most of the levels are  easy to beat. Level 147 was the hardest
B0014VQGX4|5.0|This Loader Backhoe comes assembled and not tied to the box that it takes 30 minutes to get it out.  All part are movables and what a great addition to a collection of truck
006202406X|1.0|Loved the first 2 books.  Could not wait for the 3rd to come out.  Should have named it detergent, because the last 50 pages of the book need to be washed.  Was excited for the movie next year, but now am not going to bother.  Hint--if you don't like it when the main character dies for no reason, don't read this series.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was going to order this on Amazon but then found it was available at a local retailer, so I went and bought it there since I wanted to see what it was about rather quickly. Set up was easy, plugged into TV's HDMI port, synced with wireless network, and was able to cast youtube content directly from Samsung tablet and Android phone using Chromecast App (available in Google Play store). Then downloaded the Chromecast extension to Toshiba laptop (Windows 7), with Chrome browser (the only way you can cast content from a laptop), proceeded to cast content from within the browser using the extension.  RESULTS: NOT SO HOT.<br /><br />Granted, the extension is in a beta process, when it does work it is okay, you can go full screen, decent pic, but when it lags, forget it. Options to \\"tweak\\", setting the pic to \\"TV standard\\" rather then HD standard, help a little, but there is a LOT of buffering and lag between audio and video. If the developers can step it up and improve upon the extension component of this product the potential is awesome. So if you are looking for a consistent and stable way to actually surf the net on your TV via computer--this is not it, yet.  If you are looking to be able to stream some video content via Hulu, Youtube, etc. via an App--then for the price, this will probably be okay vs. spending money on another type of pricier streaming device.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The narrator of this book, Clay Jannon (an appropriately grounded personality), has got a great voice; in a way, he's the story itself in human form, an amalgamation and a crossroads of contemporary modes and mechanisms of communication and analysis (technology, computers, coding, Google) and older (downright medieval, some of them!) ones (books, codes, story, fantasy, oral history, archaeology and secret societies). His unusual relationships with unusual characters are important to the story, for example Mr. Penumbra, the arcane bookstore's ostensible owner who hires Clay on the basis of his stated favorite book.  (His name refers, by the way, to the area of shadow -- of \\"partial illumination\\" -- where darkness and light overlap). The story is wonderful. It's a mystery, a thriller, a little historical fiction. \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore\\" isn't like Neal Stephenson's book \\"Cryptonomicon\\" (which is also a marvelous read) but the interactions between time frames and the people in them in Sloan's lovely, much shorter, book brings it to mind.<br />I couldn't put either one of them down.
B008Y78GYI|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie until the intermission when I googled Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein and discovered the movie does not follow their true story.  I felt cheated because I was buying into this movie story as the real thing.  Anyway, the music and staging are fabulous and so is Barbara Streisand and the other characters.  Enjoy, realizing that this is fiction with a slice of truth.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is my new favorite show. I am late to the game, but now that I am watching, I can't stop!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Everyone I know loves this series.  As usual, I didn't start watching from the beginning.  A friend loaned me the first two seasons and I was hooked.  She couldn't find her copy of Season 3 so I had to order it.  Total soap with a  British accent (the language sounds so much better when spoken by the English) - great acting - historical piece - storyline that jerks you around (emotionally).  No spoiler here - but I was completely frustrating with the ending of Season 3 darn it.  Almost don't want to watch Season 4 - but, of course, I will...
B000002IGP|2.0|It sucks when you cannot find a remastered version of great bands from the past. I was hoping Ratt had remastered versions of the first three albums, or at least an extensive hits remaster. I will keep checking.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I hate to say it but I actually got stuck on this one and can't get out of some rooms!! I love the idea and it's a great game, but I guess I'm not really on top of what I have to do, lol..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am soooooooo  glad they finally put this amazing game on kindle fire now they need to make a back facing camera kindle grabbing! LOL!!!!!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|This story could have been a good thinker if it ended as an acquittal then he gets back on the plane and never learned anything from his experience and continues to drink and . . .  I think Denzel Washington is a very good actor butthis story was so corny at the end that I was disappointed.  The dirty language was so unnecessary that it got in the way of dialogue.  Very disappointing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't play enough. I love this game. I like that when I run out of lives I can take a break, making it that much more fun to come back to.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|There is so much action in this film that it was hard to see.  It also is dark and focusing is difficult.  It is strictly the younger set movie since little acting is needed.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This book was a revelation.  I regret that it has taken me so long to get around to trying Joe Abercrombie.  The book was smart.  It was exciting.  It was funny.  The characters were engaging.  The world shaped by the author was fascinating.  Again, I regret not having read Mr. Abercrombie's work years ago.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|It's been a long time since I got caught up in a movie that I needed my guy to keep me safe.  I thought this was a really good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, wish lives added up quicker though...maybe one every five minutes do I can play more. I'm hooked!
B002EDH0FE|4.0|Not bad. Not bad at all.  This is surely different for science fiction.  I would have never guessed the ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot and was disappointed that there were only 10 levels.  Hope there is more to come soon.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Finally, a decent movie for older kids.  The acting was good especially Will Smith's son.  He has a good future ahead of him.  Kids need heroes to watch without so much blood shed to humans.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|This works well and syncs beautifully which most task apps fail to do well, if at all. I would rate it higher if there were more customization features.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|It was really good but I'm not sure if this is the end of a trilogy or will there be more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As a senior citizen I spend hours on the internet. Candy Crush is one of my favorite places to be. I am working on level 120 and it makes me use my brain and keeps me sharp. Although it takes days and sometimes weeks to get pass a level it remains a lot of fun
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love it!!!!!  There was way more action than the other books. I hope there is a 4th book coming out soon.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|It is the great pay back movie. Intelligent realistic and great actors also . Highly recommended.<br />Get ready and enjoy although the subject matter is far from entertaining as it is unfortunately close to what's happening in prisons
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Divergent was great. Insurgent was so-so. I was beyond excited for Allegiant's release. Then I read it. This book is, by far, the most contrived, sloppy mess of a book that I've ever read. And the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end? That's not a plot twist; it's the twist of a knife in the readers' backs. The readers who've been holding out hope for a positive outcome over all the madness, only to have that hope destroyed.<br /><br />After reading Allegiant, I now know that I have wasted my time and money on a trilogy that I will never reread. BUT... at least I will not be wasting my time or money on seeing the movies, nor will I ever buy another book by Veronica Roth.<br /><br />How does that shock value feel right now, Mrs. Roth? I hope you realize how many readers you've lost because of the train wreck that is Allegiant.
B0038P80CO|5.0|I am a HUGE Sci-Fi nerd so I don't say \\"one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made\\" easily. I am a 40 year old female and have been watching Sci-Fi, horror and suspense since I could talk. I'm that chick sleeping out in front of the Comic Con convention so I can be one of the first people to get into the panel room to see the cast of Walking Dead eight hours later so yep.....I'm serious:) This movie is PHENOMENAL and I've seen it easily 50 times. Lovely little performance by Norman Reedus too if you're a fan...I sure am. I would kill to see a sequal or better yet PREQUAL to this film. PLEASE????????????????!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow this book is graphic I guess!! I can't wait to start it ll jj ff fed the gig ff
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />I have never cried so much or felt such a deep connection to a book before. This series is the most incredible one I have ever read and will be one of the stories I hope to pass down for generations to come
B00E0SX118|5.0|Awesome, funny and memorable for the kids. Great for after a long hard day at work. Enjoy it with your family and friends; not by yourself.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This is for any Beatle fan. I rented disc 1 of this and instead of renting part 2 I decided to buy.  I know I will watch this again and share with others.
006202406X|1.0|What a disappointment!  I absolutely loved the first two books and have read the short stories.  Was this book a rush job by the author?  It did not have the same suspense or excitement as the first two books, and the ending was HORRIBLE!!!  I am wishing I never read the first two books and have decided that I will not be seeing the movies either.  :(
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|this is an entertaining, colorful, educational book and if you want a teaser read what babe ruth did on the floor at a hotel
006202406X|2.0|What I liked about the first two books was Tris and her struggles. I actually always thought Four's fell a little flat so having half the novel from his point of view wasn't very interesting to me. Four and Tris don't have unique enough voices, they sound the same and I had to go back and check a couple times to remind myself whose chapter it was.<br /><br />But my biggest issue is that life outside the City is not very interesting. It seems like a few miles outside the city is a huge airport that no one in the city ever noticed? You'd think those smartypants Erudites would know something about geography. So they get outside the city and the action stalls... and stalls.. and  stalls.. and stalls. Frankly, the entire storyline is kind of boring in this book. I would have rather read a story that stayed in the city and had some kind of story about the power struggles than see what was outside Chicago because no one outside the city is particularly interesting.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|It's still good but starting to get old. There are only so many silly things they can do over and over.
B005DZ35RC|5.0|Excellent<br />I recommend to everybody. To get the Blu Ray version<br />It can be an excellent Christmas Gift<br />So order ahead
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|The best of Shakespeare's tragedies, the acting and performances are outstanding<br />Being able to watch this through Amazon streaming the instant I needed to for class is phenomenal
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the minions are so cute who couldn't love them and it is so fun to play I get too addicted to playing
0395905079|5.0|Paddington bear is one of my favourite stories. This is a classic treasury. It starts of at the very beginning where Mr and Mrs Brown meet him for the very first time at the railway station and how he is named Paddington. Paddington is from the darkest Peru. He is not used to the way of life in England. He has impeccable manners but without fail finds himself in the stickiest, funniest situations. It's a classic story with good values and simple basics of life. Definitely a good book to snuggle up with under the covers with your little one. My children are much too young to read it on their own, but I enjoy reading it to them for now, and the enjoy listening to it. I think Paddington bear is a must have for all ages!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|well I tried to install. it on my kindle but it just does not download I hope Flu Mobile Inc. fixes. this problem. I already. have a hunting. game from these people I love that other game and its older please do fix
0765338149|5.0|my 12 year old sister grudgenly accepted this book (i read it when i was younger and it was just perfect) if you are an older reader you will enjoy this and if you are looking for a book for a younger reader i still recommend this book
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been dying to play this all my friends play and I was out of the loop. The only thing that I don't appreciate is the money thing that pops up all the time, no, I'm not paying to play.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Honestly, I haven't even read any of the reviews and I'm not going to.  People that follow the crowd (sheep) will try to compare every song to some other &#34;Insert Wildly Successful Band&#34; here.  I have been a die hard fan since the first time I saw Unholy Confessions on Headbanger's Ball in 2003.  The CD has its ups and downs like every single other CD that I've ever listened to, but I really like it.  If you want the same exact CD over and over and over and OVER then you probably won't like it.  Ultimately, for those of you that may be on the fence, it's a solid edition to an amazing band's career.  The bass recording is some of the best I've heard on any CD in the past 5 + years.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The season that started it all...excellent!...great introduction to the series..it keeps you entertained, it got action , drama, and comedy!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This match 3game is fun. I loved playing it on my PC and was so thrilled to see it available for the Kindle Fire. The color and graphics are beautiful and sharp on the Kindle Fire. The game is very entertaining and relaxing.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Really good sound quality and very useful. This is the best handy recorder I've seen! I really like this product!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, I can use my Kindle for one of the most addicting games on Facebook.  What took so long, Amazon?
B005BHNCO8|5.0|This kit is very versatile and is very easy to set up! Great for location shoots! And best of all the price is easy to manage!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show has a great cast and characters you love and hate or love to hate! I cant wait till the new season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad Candy Crush Saga is available for the Kindle. This game is very addictive. It is a GREAT GAME. I personally think it is the best game every created.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of the most addictive games available -- so(!) glad it's now on the Kindle Fire. It's easier to see than on my iPhone and so easier to get thrum level. Do NOT get suckered in to buying extra moves -- trust that you will eventually get tutu a difficult level. Do dovthis one thru Facebook; friends can send you lives and &quot;tickets&quot; to unlock adduditional levels. Lots and lots of fun.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This app is not good for me. It does not load the game. It always says the game its not responding. That's why is not good.
B00DU74U74|2.0|Movie was predictable, childish, and overall stupid. The story line had a LOT of potential, but it seems that the producer and the director were too busy making money to make a decent movie. Wouldn't recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game to come out on kindle fire.  When It finally came out I almost screamed. I just wish that you didn't have to get tickets to move on and you need a Facebook for getting tickets. Really good though.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|I know they might not have followed the comics very much, but over all I feel that this was a great movie
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a great coming of age story that I feel shows the truth behind the hardships of teenage hood, especially going through high school pregnant but it makes the story funny. Ellen page is a great actress and plays the role perfectly!!
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Interesting character development. Parents should be able to stand watching this once in a while. Nicolas Cage was the WRONG voice for dad... should have been played by John Goodman or something
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I love this movie! It's an awesome chick flick but the guys can watch it too! It's a great movie to sit down and watch with your lover.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|This movie pissed a LOT of trekkies off because they didn't follow hardly any of the original movies (The director bothered to watch some of the movies, but not catch all of the details...) I think they did a HORRIBLE job of re-enacting Kane (The bad guy) The Kane from the original Star Trek 2 Wrath of Kane, was freaking creepy (Esp because of the mullet!) This one they made WAY too refined...<br /><br />Yet, I gave it 4 stars because I feel that it was a great movie, and shouldn't detract people from watching it if they've never seen a star trek movie (Even though they may not get half of the references)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|currently reading the rest of his series.  like the character, not quite the usual detective mold.  probably why i like it.
B005OMU5U4|3.0|I got this album after some people recommended it to me, but it doesn't really hit me in the right places. Its good, but certainly a different sound than I was expecting compared to other Moby tracks.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|There are times when I want to determine if there's a free wifi signal where I am located and this app will find all signals and give you details about them, quickly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game, keeps me from my responsibilities and duties, thank you, at least a nice distraction when I need one. And when I don't. Lol
B001GF8WPI|5.0|Most peple will see Will Ferrell on the front and think \\"oh great, another comedy.\\"  But it's more than that - it's an incredible story about one man's hardship through knowing the inevitable. I don't want to give away the story, so I will just say that I do recommend this movie, both for Will Ferrell fans, and those who love a good story.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Sorry, but artist purity aside, the author must know readers aren't going to trust what she writes in the future an ending like that. Especially when that ending wasn't necessary to achieve the goals of the series. What a waste. I feel cheated that I wasted my time on this series. I for one won't be seeing the movie. I can't support it after this.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game really pulls you in and holds on extremely fun and challenging. The moment I think I've got it conquered, it throws me for a loop;).
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great series great show! Sad to see it go after 6 seasons. Great writing and also very good cast of characters.
B00021R7CG|4.0|Three seperate stories, one focused on Powers Booth and Rebecca Demornay to see who the Alpha Male.  One on Martim Landau and the vice president and the other on how the characters handled the thought on nuke war
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Why was this soundtrack not nominated for an Oscar? And why did it not win? Probably because it was from a fantasy film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's a shame because Basil Poledouris conjured a magical, larger-than-life score that really enhanced the visually striking world that director John Milius put up on screen. And now we can hear every composition recorded for this classic '80s film. Awesome.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I chose this because sometime on the move I wold get an email with a  word document I may have to edit or send a document out, this app makes it easy for me as I'm on the move regular and not have to run back to the desktop computer to complete stuff.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this
B008EL25LE|4.0|I like this game a lot but for some reason just more of a fan of the first one. Still excellent though. Especially considering it was the free app of the day.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|this app does everything I want to do in a reader and the layout is exactly as the printed form.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Was so addicted to this game. I started going through the game again trying to beat my scores. When # 2 came out for free on the Market I had to jump at that too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find the calculator a needed app on my kindle when I order from Amazon.  I often think of something I want figure out while reading and it's right here. It is easy to use.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|It's a fun challenge figuring out where the clues are. Sometimes I had to leave is alone for awhile and come back with a fresh mind. I wish there were more levels.
006202406X|5.0|I finished \\"Allegiant\\" by Veronica Roth this morning. It's the ending to a trilogy that I have waited months for. Those of you that know how I feel about the book \\"Mockingjay\\" know that if I don't like a book- I will shout it from the rooftops. I've read the reviews for this book and many readers are upset about how she wrapped the story up.<br /><br /> Not me. As a reader, I am not in control of the story. The writer is. She knows the characters inside and out and I don't. As a writer I know that you invest in your story and your characters. I know that you can't just slap a big bow on the end of a story just because readers may be uncomfortable with how things go. You stay true to your story and the people in it.<br /><br /> So- for the record, I loved the book. I feel it ended in the only possible way to stay true to the characters. It made me feel deeply. I know that Veronica bled on every page of this. It was beautiful.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson is a great teller of stories.  Even the obscure becomes riveting.  He makes you feel as though you are living in the Summer of 1927.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Mike Mangini projects a big strenght in the compositions, I admire Mike Portnoy, but I didn't miss him with Mangini in previous and actual CDs, especially the last track, Illumination Theory, the drums are spectacular, and of course Jhon Petrucci shows his mastery with classical scales and hallucinating riffs. Jordan Rudess makes agreat job in keyboards, creating all classes of moods, from high spirit to melancolic ambients. Jhon Myung is the man behind the rythm section scene, he makes a seamless fusion with Mangini, setting the space for the rest of the group, and finally James LaBrie, projects the brand of the group with his powerful voice and style. A great addition to my Dream Theater collection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 books are very good, hard to put down and leaves you wishing for more. Thank you E. L. James, you did not disappoint!
B000SW2ER2|2.0|slow. The pace was dawdling and bogged down the plot belabored at best.<br />In theory the story is good, but the execution was excruciating.<br />It is just as bad as everyone said it was.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|As always King comes through with original and haunting story lines  glad he didn't kill off Dan. Read a bit dated. Maybe that's what he had in mind
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and can't seem to put it down.  They don't give you enough lives.  I think I need a twelve step program!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|A well acted movie with just the right amount of humor and pathos.  For those of us that lived through the 60's and 70's, it is a trip through memory lane.  This was one of the first movies I remember that used a &#34;photoshopping&#34; technique to put Forrest in real news clips.  The John Lennon clip is a classic.  I am not one that likes to watch many movies more than once, but this is one that is always a treat to see again.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Not the best season but good! Es Don 2 was the very best so far in my humble opinion.  :)
159562015X|5.0|The idea that we should determine our strengths and focus on them, rather than spend our lives focusing on our weaknesses... what a concept!  What a positive, inspiring perspective for a change!  I loved the premise, and found the results of the test (taken online using the code inside the book) accurate and encouraging.  The online test provides your top five strengths out of 34, describes what the traits appear like in you, and recommends ways to use them.  I had no problem spending the $15. to find out my top five strengths.  I have already recommended this book.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show.  Good monsters. .. believeable characters. .. pretty scenery. ... what's not to love? Now that's goods tv right there :)
030758836X|3.0|I had a difficult time getting involved in the story. I was still not into it until about pg.100<br />then it got better..
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Magical, suspenseful an the light displays were delightful. Actors did an excellent performance.  Kudos always to Morgan Freeman. Keep up the good work.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|This is an entertaining story but it's not a movie I wish to watch twice. The special effects were good but overrated as was the story itself. I didn't find it particularly thought provoking which was definitely one of the most hyped aspects of the movie. Characters were represented by animals who, in turn, represented various human traits such as courage, greed, etc... This would have been more interesting if it all wasn't so heavy handed.<br /><br />In the end, a movie is watched for the purpose of entertainment and I was entertained. The story progressed at a nice pace and the underlying emotion was strongly felt which is a fairly rare thing in so many modern superficial blockbusters. So while my criticisms might seem a bit harsh it was definitely a good movie, even if it was only good for a single view.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|My daughter loved it now she wants to buy the movie so we have to go buy it now at walmart
0765350386|5.0|Dune, The Matrix, Star Wars, Zorro, Ocean's Eleven, steam punk. It's all there. The mistborn are a combination of jedi, Zorro, and the heroes from the Matrix. The Lord Ruler is similar to the god emperor of Dune and the Emperor from Star Wars, and the setting is steam punkish. The relationship between the 2 main protagonists is reminiscent of Obi Wan and Luke and the driving force of the plot is a mission undertaken by a team that anyone familiar with ocean's Eleven won't fail to recognize.<br /><br />While this is all very very derivative, it's also very interesting, and in the end, that's all that matters. The main character, Kelsier, is an interesting and enigmatic person. He lives in a world where his people are slaves, but personally, he has everything. Why bother? Why does he risk such relative power? The Lord Ruler is also kept mostly hidden from the reader which makes him that much more interesting. Kelsier's apprentice Vin is a little bit more of an open book which makes her a bit less interesting, but only slightly less so considering the book hints at her eventual ascension as an Anakin Skywalker type character. Will she become Vader?<br /><br />All in all, this is a very dark medieval fantasy which I find interesting and the story seems crafted with much passion. The author succeeds masterfully in imparting the feelings of the characters and the general atmosphere of the book in a given moment which makes this a masterpiece of fiction. As you can tell, I really like this book and I look forward to reading more.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|It was sooooo funny and my family and I always watched this and it has with it a lot of fond family memories connected to it also.It is a 5* to all of us.That is the real Frankenstein.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is very awesome  I love this app because I like subway surfer.i really like this game because you colleced bananas
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|Play It Again, Sam is one of Woody Allen's funniest and yet underrated movies. Definitely in the top ten on my list of Woody Allen movies.  I would like to see them restore and remaster the movie in Blu-ray but this standard DVD will do just fine for now.  The movie title and story is based on Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart with a comedic twist ala' Woody Allen.  I highly recommend this movie to Woody Allen fans or anyone who is looking for a little clumsy neurotic humor to satisfy their comedic palate.  Does anyone remember laughter?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my fiance loves the movie so I downloaded it and it is so addicting. the missions I think are what makes it addicting though.
B00C1E8TWY|5.0|I am very happy with this album because I am not a fan for current pop music and this is just my type.  The music is excellent.  I have been a fan of Paul Anka since the 1960's, and the duets with other people on this album are a good choice.  Would recommend this for anyone who appreciates good music.
B00AZUYR1I|4.0|For me the first three minutes are hilarious thanks to the Rodney  character, the writers finally used him in a way that's entertaining.  I actually stumbled across the episode looking for something sci-fi. I haven't gotten past the first three minutes.<br /><br />Laugh, rewind, laugh, rewind..<br /><br />My rating isn't for season 3 it's strictly for that single episode.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I'm glad it's finally available on kindle. I'm completely addicted. Who ever came up with this is a genius!
B00FN811SY|5.0|It makes Bible research and study really fast!  It is easy to understand and navigates through 5 translation of the bible.
B00E38KGF4|2.0|I had a hard time down loading and I NEVER USED IT.Maybe my Kindle wasnt compatible.It was too confusing.I got frustrated and never used it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book ends on a cliffhanger and keeps u hooked threw out the book and there is a lot of surprises so don't underestimate this book at the begging because if u do u will regret it
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I have read most of Bill Bryson's books. He has a sharp wit and clean writing style that I genuinely like. This particular book is fascinating and presents not only well researched information about the year 1927, and a view of a wide variety of famous/infamous characters in the news at that time, but also a sense of the overall culture of the era.<br />Bryson is a master at fleshing out details that ordinarily aren't explored but give an insight into events and actions of individuals.
006202406X|2.0|So I read it and I loved it except for the ending... I can't believe that she killed Tris!!! That was the worst ending of a book series I have ever read and I wish I had never read it... I thought the hunger games ending was bad..
B00C6B9H46|5.0|Great movie<br />Vin Diesel<br />Scary ass monsters<br />Blu Ray & DVD & Digital Copy<br />Steel book case (VERY COOL)<br />Great price!<br />Do I need to say more???<br />Get this NOW!!!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Good storyline, plenty of action. Good action and a developing storyline. Well developed method of helping discover what happened in his past to help understand why he is the way he is.
B00BV0FK58|5.0|I loved the book. It's given me hope in my marriage. As I started to feel unsatisfied and empty in my marriage I didn't know what to do. I am one who does not believe in divorce especially without exhausting all alternatives but now I don't have to worry. This book works wonders!!
1416563156|5.0|My little guy had an Indiana Jones adventure party for his birthday.  He is the kind of kid that brings his Indiana Jones satchel, full of skull heads, a whip, and compass, if we go out to eat, so this was the perfect party theme.  I surprised him with this journal as one of his presents prior to the party.  He is too young to enjoy all of the book at this point, but he was so impressed with the idea that this is the real journal, and all the children at the party thought that this was really cool.  I think it will be a neat book for him to grow into, and he will still treasure this as an adult.
B003Q6D5PM|5.0|Beautifully written and organised. If it sounds relevant to you, then your life will be changed. It changed my life.
006202406X|3.0|There's so many reasons this book didn't live up to my expectations. Like many others have stated, the POV switching isn't ideal. It's easy to get confused when it switches back and forth and I had to reread parts to realize who I was reading from. I also hate that so much of the book is spent in the compound ultimately being confused and doing nothing. It seems like such a huge stretch of book devoted to feelings of confusion, panic, upset, and really it drags. There was very little \\"action\\" and from the last 2 books that was disappointing. The ending obiously isn't my happy ending. But besides the fact that it happens, HOW it happens is irritating. The girl has been through 101 fights and chaotic moments and has been shot, and that's how she goes down? Idk. I just think if it had to happen it could have been a different layout.<br /><br />It was ok. The first 2 books were IMMENSELY better. But it wasn't AWFUL and definitely doesn't deserve 100 1 star reviews because of the ending.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoyed the game primarily because it makes you think and it does not take s lot of time to complete it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Playing this game is a lot of fun.  It is challenging at times and makes you want to play More often.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Sequels often disappoint me, but this is the best of the Ironman movies!  My husband and I saw it at the theater and watched it again with our children and grandchildren (that's ages 9 to 62); we all loved it!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I have read all of R Ford's fiction. This work succeeds. I think it will resonate strongest with mature readers, and especially with mature male readers. Accepting this book will be easiest for persons who have some knowledge of America in 1960, and some knowledge of the American-Canadian plains. Here is a time when a person could get in a car, travel 500 miles, and willfully vanish. (There is no willfull vanishing now.) The tale is fine, well-told and chilling. People act irrationally, against their own interests, and ruin their lives. Then, they construct justifications which ultimately they do not believe themselves. Just like real life. Scores of images will compel readers to reflect on their own lives, decisions and experiences. I welcomed the occasional intrusions by the older narrator/author into the boy's story. I hope you do,too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too east but not too hard either. This was fun, I wish it had a few more levels. Although it looks like more to come at a later time.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was amazing! It is a wonderful story about love, tragedy and life. I would highly recommend this book not only to teens but also adults.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|This game has an original format, decent graphics, and it functions well on my Kindle. After all the lame apps Amazon has offered lately for the faotd, it's nice to see one that actually has some promise. There have been a boatload of overpriced do-nothing apps lately, but this one really is worth getting.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Loved this book - couldn't put it down!!! No repeating as in some of John's previous books. A good read!
B00005UNCL|5.0|THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK [1997/2013] [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + ULTRAVIOLET] Return to the Adventure of Jurassic Park! Something Has Survived!<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg takes us back to the scene of Jurassic Park in ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park,’ the blockbuster sequel with even more dinosaurs, action and Academy Award® nominated for Best Visual Effects (Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Randal Dutra and Michael Lantieri). Four years since the disaster at Jurassic Park, two groups are in a race against time that will determine the fate of the remote island’s prehistoric inhabitants. Featuring an all-star cast including Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite, this action-packed thrill ride will leave you on the edge of your seat...again!<br /><br />FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Academy Awards®: Nominated: Best Visual Effects for Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Randal Dutra and Michael Lantieri.

It is their adorable miniature relatives known as “companies” (a.k.a Procompsognathus triassicus) who scamper through the underbrush like a gang of famished street urchins playing cute, bloodthirsty games of hide-and-seek and follow-the-leader with their prey. In the film's stunningly creepy opening scene, a young girl wanders away from a British yachting party picnicking on the misty beach of a remote jungle island off the coast of Costa Rica. As she peers into the fringe of the forest, a bony little creature skitters out of the woods and gives her a pleading look. No sooner has she allowed her strange new friend to nibble on her roast beef sandwich than it is joined by a crowd of companions chattering and leaping around her, their sharp-toothed mouths gaping for treats. We don't see their attack; we only hear her as she screams, nice!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this first sequel is proof that lightningrarely strikes twice, even for the likes of someone as highly-regarded as Steven Spielberg. 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' which shares only a title  with the novel by the late Michael Crichton doesn't necessarily try to repeat the success of its predecessor, but it clearly wants to relive the same sense of wonder and exhilaration. It's doesn't quite succeed at capturing our imagination or sparking that same awe-inspiring level as the first film, but that isn't to say it doesn't come close at times. Then again, there's really only one scene which comes to mind, involving a pair of T-Rex’s, and their new-born dinosaur, a large, extended RV trailer and lots of loud crashing roars amid a rainstorm.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, viewers are forced to waddle and stumble through a clumsy display of what is essentially an explanation for why Dr. Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum] returns but not the other two. And as before, one precocious youngster, but this time via Dr. Ian Malcolm's daughter Kelly Malcolm [Vanessa Lee Chester] joins an expedition team to another of John Hammond's [Sir Richard Attenborough] dinosaur resorts, a top secret location where the extinct animals live freely, until now of course. Dr. Ian Malcolm's group, which brings Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, and Richard Schiff together, is there merely to explore and observe. John Hammond's nephew [Arliss Howard], however, has his own plans, and hires a separate team of big game hunters lead by the wonderful Pete Postlethwaite, who as we know, sadly passed away a few years ago and is a very sad loss to the acting world.<br /><br />What distracts from enjoying a second trip through prehistoric fantasy is a very apparent lack of characterization. The make-believe CGI creatures and animatronics often display more personality and charisma than their live-action co-stars. It is strange seeing characters so underdeveloped and two-dimensional in a film that really requires the human aspect to sustain believability. Audiences are continuously reminded that corporate greed is bad and sometimes just as selfishly ravenous as the Velociraptor depicted on screen, but rarely are they allowed to connect emotionally with a particular character, which greatly diminishes the film's attempts at suspense. Nevertheless, the sequel has its moments of fun action with a silly, purely for the visual whimsy conclusion in San Diego. The key to the film’s success is that the dinosaurs are more varied and lifelike than ever before. Their interaction with the actors is astonishingly realistic. There are sights here that are unforgettably strange and scary, such as the grassland trails left by velociraptors hunting their human prey. Steven Spielberg shows once again why he has made six of the top twenty highest-grossing films of all time. This will probably join that list as the seventh. It is far more frightening than ‘JAWS’ and certainly among the most spectacular motion pictures ever made.<br /><br />'’The Lost World: Jurassic Park’' never takes itself too seriously. Yes, it can be seen as a fiendish millennial fantasy of our prehistoric past catching up with us. But it also doesn't pretend to be much more than a messy, full-blooded adventure yarn with cardboard characters and a story that doesn't track. It winks at the acknowledgment, as much in a throwaway moment when the escaped Tyrannosaurus Rex is shown rampaging through a video store. On one wall is a gaudy poster for a non-existent film of '’King Lear’' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ knows it's coming from roughly the same angle and place.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The sequel to the mega-blockbuster arrives on Blu-ray in pretty much the same condition as the first is in good shape, but showing its age. Because it features more CGI effects than its predecessor, the 1080p encoded image and with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio also brings with it more scenes of blurriness and poor resolution. Digital composites are probably the worst, since they come with plainly visible black crush and very soft outlines, especially at night-time. Nevertheless, the transfer does offer plenty of nicely detailed sequences in daylight, with sharp, clean lines and great visibility of background info. Contrast and brightness is well-balanced, with crisp whites and deep, rich blacks throughout. Colours are bold and vibrant, while flesh tones seem quite natural. The picture is far from perfect, but it's still an upgrade from its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – Much like the first film, the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is sure to wake up the neighbours. Because the majority of the film takes place within a jungle setting, the back speakers are almost-always alive and kicking with various sounds of birds, creatures and movement amongst the trees. Directionality and pans are flawless, creating an enveloping sound field that's highly engaging. The front soundstage is spacious, with excellently balanced channel separation. Vocals can, at times, feel a bit drowned out by the all the commotion, but it's rather clear for the most part. Dynamic range exhibits exceptional, room-penetrating clarity and strong differentiation of the upper frequencies. No surprise, low bass is deeply powerful, delivering an effective force to every gunshot, dinosaur stomp, and roar. 'The Lost World' is lots of exhilarating fun in high-resolution audio.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Feature and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: Finding The Lost World [2013] [1080p] [28:00] This new documentary from Laurent Bouzereau picks up where the first film’s materials left off. Steven Spielberg, Jeff Goldblum and other key creative team members discuss the making of the sequel, which Spielberg sees as the first direct sequel he was involved in. He views the Indiana Jones films as an adventure serial, a different animal altogether. Jeff Goldblum is the only actor other than Peter Stormare to participate here, but Jeff Goldblum makes up for it by telling some very funny stories about the film’s production. On-set video footage is shown, and there is a discussion by several of the principals about how the San Diego coda came about. Spielberg mentions having had a different idea about the genesis for a sequel (he wanted to see what happened to the shaving cream can lost in the first film) until he read Michael Crichton’s second book on this subject and went with that. Spielberg admits that the “Something Has Survived” idea was really just a promo line that didn’t have anything to do with the actual story in the movie. He also admits that the first film really had less than 65 CGI shots in the film that something he quickly topped with the second film. There’s some really fun stuff in this piece, particularly the admission that the big cliffside scene was filmed on a covered area of the Universal Studios parking structure!<br /><br />Original Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: Something Survived [2013] [1080p] [17:00] The fifth segment focuses on the more technical aspects of the production, particularly the film's conclusion and how it was essentially written into the story on a whim. The digital and practical effects are also talked about extensively, often closely looking at specific action sequences, while several interviews mention the great deal of fun everyone had. Like the previous pieces, viewers also learn quite a bit about the sound and effects, which is amusing.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes [1997] [7:09] Two deleted scenes are included here from the initial DVD of ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park.’ The first scene shows Peter Ludlow [Arliss Howard] usurping control of InGen from his uncle at a boardroom meeting. The second scene gives a proper introduction to Pete Postlethwaite’s character as he beats up a tourist out of both honour and boredom before agreeing to go on the film’s expedition. These scenes cannot be accessed on their own, so to watch them, you’ll need to select the menu item and then fast-forward or rewind as needed.<br /><br />Original Feature:  Original Documentary: The Making of The Lost World [1997] [480i] [53:41] This documentary is an earlier work by Laurent Bouzereau, and it’s just as thorough as his more recent pieces elsewhere on this disc. And some of the footage from here is recycled for those pieces. The interviews for this piece date back to the time of the production, and the documentary is date stamped 1997.<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: Making of the Film [1997] [480i] [13:17] This shorter documentary is pretty much a filler, but it’s still interesting to see the cast at a younger age of nearly.<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Jurassic Park Phenomenon: A Discussion with Author Michael Crichton [1997] [480i] [15:27] A good 1997 interview with Michael Crichton is included here, and it may be the most interesting extra on any of the discs. Michael Crichton talks about how he was once known as the author of The Andromeda Strain but that Jurassic Park thankfully changed that. Crichton recounts a story of being shown around the Universal back lot by a then-young director named Steven Spielberg. Michael Crichton also discusses the differences between books and films, even when the movie is an adaptation of a book. He mentions having spent 10 years writing “Jurassic Park,” which only makes sense if you realise he was actually working three different films and another book before putting his focus here. The differences between characters in the books and these films are also discussed, with the main focus being John Hammond, who Michael Crichton describes as a dark Walt Disney. There’s a brief coda to the piece. Shot in 2000, this bit shows Michael Crichton enjoying that a new sub-type of dinosaur has been named after him (It’s known as Michael Crichton’s Ankylosaur, or more scientifically as Crichtonsaurus bohlini.) The interviews were conducted by Laurent Bouzereau, who mines a bunch of the first interview for use in his more recent documentaries.<br /><br />Original Feature: Behind the Scenes:<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Compie Dance Number: Thank You Steven Spielberg from ILM [1997] [480i] [1:38] This is a quick CGI dance number performed by a kick line of compies. I can’t say that I think much of the music, but the compies look like they’re enjoying the steps.<br /><br />Original Feature: ILM & The Lost World: Before and After the Visual Effects [1997] [480i] [20:44] This is another collection of before/after shots where CGI dinosaurs were added to live action. This batch is presented in a different way than the first film. Here we have a split screen, where the top frame has the live action and the bottom frame has the live action infused with CGI.<br /><br />Original Feature: Production Archives [1997] Production Photographs, Illustrations and Conceptual Drawings, Models, The World of Jurassic Park, The Magic of ILM, Posters and Toys [480i] This is a collection of archival material divided into multiple sections: “Production Photographs,” “Illustrations & Conceptual Drawings;” “Models,” “The World of Jurassic Park,” “The Magic of ILM” and “Posters & Toys.”<br /><br />Original Feature: Storyboards [SPOILERS ALERT] [1997] [480i] Storyboard assemblies are presented for the following sequences: “Stego Attack,” “The Round Up,” “Eddie’s Death,” “Death in the Waterfall,” “Malcolm vs. Raptor,” “Sarah Harding vs. The Raptors,” “Getting the T-Rex Off The Island,” “The Cargo Ship Sequence,” “The T-Rex Visits San Diego,” “The Revenge of the T-Rex,” “Omitted Air Attack” (an abandoned Pteranodon sequence) and “The Original Ending” (another sequence that would have involved flying dinosaurs, abandoned in favour of bringing the T-Rex statesidefor a quick bite…)<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1997] [480i] [1:58] Here we have a standard definition copy of the theatrical trailer, as presented on the earlier DVD edition.<br /><br />BD-Live: The more general BD-Live screen is accessible via the menu, which makes various online materials available, including tickers, trailers and special events.<br /><br />My Scenes: The usual bookmarking feature is included here.<br /><br />D-BOX: D-Box functionality is available for those home theatre enthusiasts who have the proper equipment.<br /><br />Finally, just when you'd think that scientists would realize dinosaurs and humans don't mix, along comes ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ to prove you wrong. In this sequel, John Hammond [Sir Richard Attenborough] summons chaos theorist and onetime colleague Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum] to his home with some startling information so, in the final analysis, ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ has more dinosaurs, better dinosaurs, the realms of FX seemingly limitless. It has thrills like no other film. It has moments of directorial mastery, sublime visual notations that catch the breath. And it delivers fun. T. Rex-sized fun. For that any sized queue is worth it. The special effects and dinosaurs are bigger and better and, for the rubbish ending there are lots of redeeming directorial set-pieces. This sequel to Jurassic Park boasted even more impressive special effects than the first film, though the acting and screenplay aren't always at the same level, so all in all, despite ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ not being quite up to the first film in this trilogy franchise, I am still glad I have this in my Blu-ray Collection, as it has its moments now and again and it gives your Home Cinema a real treat and will have your friends hiding behind the couch, as they will feel the Dinosaurs will be invading your living room. But one sad fact is why they couldn’t have brought this film out in 3D like the first film. Especially with the computer wizardry of modern technology today, very strange.

And some of the footage from here is recycled for those pieces. The interviews for this piece date back to the time of the production, and the documentary is date stamped 1997.<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: Making of the Film [1997] [480i] [13:17] This shorter documentary is pretty much a filler, but it’s still interesting to see the cast at a younger age of nearly.<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Jurassic Park Phenomenon: A Discussion with Author Michael Crichton [1997] [480i] [15:27] A good 1997 interview with Michael Crichton is included here, and it may be the most interesting extra on any of the discs. Michael Crichton talks about how he was once known as the author of The Andromeda Strain but that Jurassic Park thankfully changed that. Crichton recounts a story of being shown around the Universal back lot by a then-young director named Steven Spielberg. Michael Crichton also discusses the differences between books and films, even when the movie is an adaptation of a book. He mentions having spent 10 years writing “Jurassic Park,” which only makes sense if you realise he was actually working three different films and another book before putting his focus here. The differences between characters in the books and these films are also discussed, with the main focus being John Hammond, who Michael Crichton describes as a dark Walt Disney. There’s a brief coda to the piece. Shot in 2000, this bit shows Michael Crichton enjoying that a new sub-type of dinosaur has been named after him (It’s known as Michael Crichton’s Ankylosaur, or more scientifically as Crichtonsaurus bohlini.) The interviews were conducted by Laurent Bouzereau, who mines a bunch of the first interview for use in his more recent documentaries.<br /><br />Original Feature: Behind the Scenes:<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Compie Dance Number: Thank You Steven Spielberg from ILM [1997] [480i] [1:38] This is a quick CGI dance number performed by a kick line of compies. I can’t say that I think much of the music, but the compies look like they’re enjoying the steps.<br /><br />Original Feature: ILM & The Lost World: Before and After the Visual Effects [1997] [480i] [20:44] This is another collection of before/after shots where CGI dinosaurs were added to live action. This batch is presented in a different way than the first film. Here we have a split screen, where the top frame has the live action and the bottom frame has the live action infused with CGI.<br /><br />Original Feature: Production Archives [1997] Production Photographs, Illustrations and Conceptual Drawings, Models, The World of Jurassic Park, The Magic of ILM, Posters and Toys [480i] This is a collection of archival material divided into multiple sections: “Production Photographs,” “Illustrations & Conceptual Drawings;” “Models,” “The World of Jurassic Park,” “The Magic of ILM” and “Posters & Toys.”<br /><br />Original Feature: Storyboards [SPOILERS ALERT] [1997] [480i] Storyboard assemblies are presented for the following sequences: “Stego Attack,” “The Round Up,” “Eddie’s Death,” “Death in the Waterfall,” “Malcolm vs. Raptor,” “Sarah Harding vs. The Raptors,” “Getting the T-Rex Off The Island,” “The Cargo Ship Sequence,” “The T-Rex Visits San Diego,” “The Revenge of the T-Rex,” “Omitted Air Attack” (an abandoned Pteranodon sequence) and “The Original Ending” (another sequence that would have involved flying dinosaurs, abandoned in favour of bringing the T-Rex statesidefor a quick bite…)<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1997] [480i] [1:58] Here we have a standard definition copy of the theatrical trailer, as presented on the earlier DVD edition.<br /><br />BD-Live: The more general BD-Live screen is accessible via the menu, which makes various online materials available, including tickers, trailers and special events.<br /><br />My Scenes: The usual bookmarking feature is included here.<br /><br />D-BOX: D-Box functionality is available for those home theatre enthusiasts who have the proper equipment.<br /><br />Finally, just when you'd think that scientists would realize dinosaurs and humans don't mix, along comes ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ to prove you wrong. In this sequel, John Hammond [Sir Richard Attenborough] summons chaos theorist and onetime colleague Ian Malcolm [Jeff Goldblum] to his home with some startling information so, in the final analysis, ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ has more dinosaurs, better dinosaurs, the realms of FX seemingly limitless. It has thrills like no other film. It has moments of directorial mastery, sublime visual notations that catch the breath. And it delivers fun. T. Rex-sized fun. For that any sized queue is worth it. The special effects and dinosaurs are bigger and better and, for the rubbish ending there are lots of redeeming directorial set-pieces. This sequel to Jurassic Park boasted even more impressive special effects than the first film, though the acting and screenplay aren't always at the same level, so all in all, despite ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park’ not being quite up to the first film in this trilogy franchise, I am still glad I have this in my Blu-ray Collection, as it has its moments now and again and it gives your Home Cinema a real treat and will have your friends hiding behind the couch, as they will feel the Dinosaurs will be invading your living room. But one sad fact is why they couldn’t have brought this film out in 3D like the first film. Especially with the computer wizardry of modern technology today, very strange.

When `The Lost World' did almost the same, a Third film was inevitable and so the unimaginatively titled ‘Jurassic Park III' was born into existence. Relatively speaking, ‘Jurassic Park III is a slight disappointment, but not a total disaster. With Steven Spielberg gone from the director's chair, is now replaced by Joe Johnston, ho was the director of the disasterous and embarrassing film ‘Jumanji' and so the Jurassic Park saga has been slightly downgraded to its B-grade monster film roots. The first ‘Jurassic Park’ was a well-paced adventure movie wrapped in a magical package that used state-of-the-art special effects and digital sound to make us believe that dinosaurs could once again roam the earth. ‘The Lost World: Jurassic Park II,’ while panned in some corners, basically offered more of the same tightly-paced action and adventure. Unfortunately, Jurassic Park III not only re-hashes the two previous outings with hapless embarrassing humans hunted by hungry dinosaurs, but does it with far less style and human interest. This time around, there's no build-up to the first appearance of the dinosaurs and they are suddenly there. Character interaction, never is a strong suit in this particular film, even worse than perfunctory, it's virtually non-existent. Every action piece is staged in a generic fashion, leaving no room for suspense or tension. And the whole film is over so fast, especially sans credits, only about 1 hour, 20 minutes, that it hardly seems to have happened, still it is not a total disaster and I still enjoyed viewing it, as I still love this franchise.<br /><br />Anyway despite this, here is a synopsis of the outline of the film. When a young boy is left marooned on the island of Isla Sorna, his parents Paul Kirby [William H. Macy] and Amanda Kirby [Tea Leoni] trick Dr. Alan Grant [Sam Neill] into flying with them over the island to help find their son. But when the plane crashes and they are left stranded, it's every man for himself. This time there's no fences, no weapons and absolutely no protection and ensuring this won't be a normal walk through the park.<br /><br />‘Jurassic Park III' entered production without a completed script and whilst Director Joe Johnston does the best with what he has, it's reasonably obvious that production was difficult. Barring the lengthy end credits, the film comes in at a scant 80 minutes and very short for a modern day film. Still, this is completely about the dinosaur action scenes, of which there are probably more than the first and second films combined. It also marks one of the last large projects for the Stan Winston's animatronics studio, who have become a victim of the fast growth of CGI animation. Stan Winston himself sadly passed away a few short years later.<br /><br />‘Jurassic Park III' isn't really terrible, but as the third entry to a much loved film franchise series, who has a sizeable fan base, like me. Compounding this is the troublesome ending that materialises, rather than coming to a natural conclusion. I just hope that Universal Pictures can make Jurassic Park IV happen, if only to give the series the conclusion it deserves, but I doubt this will ever happen, as too many years have passed us by, oh well, we will wait and see. ‘Jurassic Park III’ may not offer much in terms of originality or story, but it is still a fast-paced and fun thrill ride that doesn't wear out its welcome. Like its two predecessors, there is little doubt that this latest instalment has sort of done well, and that the pteranodon's seen flying into the sunset at the close of the film will somehow end up in ‘Jurassic Park IV,’ let’s keep fingers crossed and find out.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – ‘Jurassic Park III' is presented in the awesome 1.85:1 aspect ratio (original aspect ratio), and a stunning 1080p encoded image. Again, it's fairly obvious that Universal have used an off-the-shelf transfer for `Jurassic Park III,' but its relatively young age makes this the stand out of all of the trilogies, so it isn't all bad. The transfer is very sharp and offers a pleasing amount of fine detail. The upgraded texture maps on the computer generated dinosaurs, especially the new-look raptors and the Spinosaurus look very realistic and convincing. However, it's very easy to tell the CGI and animatronic creations apart. ‘Jurassic Park III' was released in 2001 when film colour grading was starting to get increasingly popular and the film looks strangely dark because of it and almost like the entire film was run through a neutral density filter one shade too dark. It's always looked this way, so this is not a fault of the transfer, but in comparison to the other films, it just looks weird. I noticed a handful of small, butrelatively unobtrusive film artefacts, but certainly no film-to-video issues. Overall, this is a pretty decent transfer, just hampered by some of the original production methods.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The main audio track is encoded with 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Just like the Blu-ray of the original, the audio track is the stand out performer, which represents a significant (and I mean significant) upgrade from the 5.1 Dolby Digital 5.1 track on the inferior DVD. Again, the audio has been extrapolated into a 7.1 experience, using a variety of techniques. This is by far the most aggressive of all the Jurassic Park audio mixes, and the films emphasis on action certainly allows this to come to life. I never thought I'd say it, but the .1 low frequency effects are a little 'too hot' and overly aggressive. Take for example the T-Rex vs. Spinosaur fight early on in the film. Almost all the low frequency is diverted to the subwoofer channel and hardly any is given to the full range channels. So, if you don't have a subwoofer, or have it turned off, it sounds like they are tip-toing. I don't believe this is film mixing as it should be. The channel should be to support the films bass, not provide it solely. Unfortunately, John Williams bowed out of composer duties for the third entry, being replaced by Don Davis, who was at the time hot off The Matrix. Davis uses the irreplaceable Williams' cues and main theme, but his original work is mostly pedestrian. Overall, an extremely pleasing and definitely awesome inspiring audio track.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Special Effects Team: The conversation features the special F/X team Stan Winston, John Rosengrant, Dan Taylor and Michael Lantieri, providing an enjoyably detailed technical look at the film. Granted, the men focus their attention primarily on the animatronics and digital effects, but it's also precisely what makes it such a fascinating listen. Understandably, their exchange is scene specific, but they fill in the gaps with recollections on the production and thoughts on where practical effects now stand in modern visuals. For fans, the commentary track is informative and very interesting.<br /><br />Special Feature: Return to Jurassic Park: The Third Adventure [2013] [1080p] [25:00] The final instalment to the six-part documentary features certain members of the cast and crew reminiscing about the production and working with director Joe Johnston. Viewers can enjoy lots of good Behind-the-Scene footage while everyone talks about practical effects, set design, shooting on location as well as in a soundstage and the choice of the Spinosaurus as the new villain. Really interesting stuff, especially if you're a fan of the film.<br /><br />Original Feature: Original Documentary: The Making of Jurassic Park III [2001] [480i] [22:43] This Laurent Bouzereau's 2001 documentary includes a look at the special effects and animatronics made for the motion picture, ‘Jurassic Park III’ [2001].

These can be viewed individually or a &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: The Process [2001] [480i] Again starting with an introduction, this shows various stages of the creation of various elements and shots. &#34;Models&#34; includes an Interview with an ILM CGI worker who shows the various stages of a CGI dinosaur model, including wireframe and muscled versions. There is a second option, to simply view the model in close up as he describes the differences between versions. &#34;T-Rex vs. Spinosaurus&#34; includes an interview about the creation of the scene, a production plate showing the live action without CGI, and a look at the final shot as seen in the film. &#34;Pteranodon Air Attack&#34; includes an interview about the scene, an animatic of the shot, and then the final shot of Allesandro Nivola meeting a Pteranodon the wrong way. &#34;Raptors: Returning the Egg&#34; includes an interview, a production plate of the scene without CGI, and then the final shot adding CGI raptors to a shot that already had a puppet raptor to one side. All of this can be viewed individually or via the &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: Muscle Simulation [2001] [480i] Beginning with an introduction, this section focuses on the addition of simulated muscles to the wireframes and models of dinosaurs, thus making their movements more lifelike. The introduction is followed by a demonstration of the technique. Each part of the section can be viewed individually or via the &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: Compositing [2001] [480i] The final subsection here covers the work of combining a finished CGI element with live action to make it appear that the CGI creature is actually in the room with the characters.

Each part of this section can be viewed individually or via the &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: Dinosaur Turntables [2001] [480i] [6:23] This is a collection of rotating views of the various dinosaurs seen in the film: &#34;Corythosaurus,&#34; &#34;Parasaurolophus,&#34; &#34;Brachiosaurus,&#34; &#34;Velociraptor (Male),&#34; &#34;Ankylosaurus&#34; (not the Crichton variety), &#34;Stegosaurus,&#34; &#34;Triceratops,&#34; &#34;Pteranodon (Baby and Adult),&#34; &#34;Compsognathus,&#34; &#34;Billy Brennan&#34; (a model of Allesandro Nivola for his maiden flight shot) and &#34;Spinosaurus.&#34; These can each be viewed on their own or via the &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: Storyboards to Final Feature Comparison [2001] [480i] [6:08] Three storyboard assemblies are presented here, each time in combination with the actual film footage of that part of the relevant sequence. The three pieces are &#34;The Lab&#34;, &#34;The Aviary&#34; and &#34;The Boat Attack&#34;. Each can be viewed individually or via the &#34;Play All&#34; function.<br /><br />Original Feature: Production Photographs [2001] [480i] [2:50] This is a series of photographs taken during the production of the film.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [2001] [480i] [1:16] The film's Original Theatrical Trailer is carried over from the earlier inferior NTSC DVD.<br /><br />BD-Live: The more general BD-Live screen is accessible via the menu, which makes various online materials available, including tickers, trailers and special events.<br /><br />My Scenes: The usual bookmarking feature is included here.<br /><br />D-BOX: D-Box functionality is available for those home theatre enthusiasts who have the proper equipment.<br /><br />Finally, `Jurassic Park III' is not quite as good as the first but on the whole a lot better than `Jurassic Park 2.' It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically `Jurassic Park III' in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great film, but it sure has its moments, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. It's great to see Sam Neill return as Dr. Alan Grant and same goes for Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler (although here role is pretty small but yet important) Alessandro Nivola is a great addition to the cast as Billy Brennan. The other characters are more for the comedy elements which works pretty well. So my conclusion: An entertaining film that is good for a few laughs and a good action packed film with some nice scene's and better than ever special effects for the dinosaurs and now it is complete, that I now have the Jurassic Park Trilogy and now I am a happy bunny and so good to add this 3rd film to my Blu-ray Collection.

It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically `Jurassic Park III' in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great film, but it sure has its moments, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. It's great to see Sam Neill return as Dr. Alan Grant and same goes for Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler (although here role is pretty small but yet important) Alessandro Nivola is a great addition to the cast as Billy Brennan. The other characters are more for the comedy elements which works pretty well. So my conclusion: An entertaining film that is good for a few laughs and a good action packed film with some nice scene's and better than ever special effects for the dinosaurs and now it is complete, that I now have the Jurassic Park Trilogy and now I am a happy bunny and so good to add this 3rd film to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Andrew C. Miller – Your Ultimate No.1 Film Fan<br />Le Cinema Paradios<br />WARE, United Kingdom

B000QCS8TW|5.0|GOT/SoIaF is unlike anything I have ever read, and I read A LOT!  I can not compare it to any other fantasy series for that reason - utterly original when I had nearly excepted all great ideas had been thought:) Thank goodness George R. R. Martin was able to develop his many unique ideas into a masterpiece of fantasy.<br /><br />  I won't be including the obligatory summary because I simply can not do it justice.  I will explain why.  GRRM includes an enormous rang and number of very varied characters AND somehow he does so in a way that the reader can fairly easily keep even minor characters straight. The major characters stories are told from their POV in chapters titled with their names, ( you can easily look back if you do get a little confused).  The characters good, bad but mostly both are so fully fleshed out I found myself reluctant to leave each one to go to the next at the end of nearly every chapter. Who and what was/is good, or bad altered greatly in my own mind when the POV changed.  I have never experienced this in this extent and found it refreshing.<br /><br />  GRRM was not issued the how to write fantasy rule book, and that's I good thing.  The back stories of several characters will challenge one's assumptiond about their morality.  He reveals details in a natural order or as the character's find out. In doing so the plot twist and turns in a masterfully executed manner.  The good and bad are in no way clear cut.  The most surprising risks GRRM takes is killing off a few much liked characters (don't get too attached you won't see it coming!) which was brave anda sense of truth to story, humanity to the characters and a driving forse to the story overall.<br /><br />  I simply can not do this magical tale justice here.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  I believe you wil love it but I am certain it will be an unique experence!<br /><br />~Karina149

B001NMAFXQ|5.0|This is my favorite album of the decade. BY FAR. There is something to be said on the craftsmanship of this album, each song sounds masterfully produced. The genres of pop-punk and hardcore are blended effortlessly. Fans of For Those Who Have Heart might be a little saddened by the decrease in the metal-influenced songs but for the most part will be pleased with Homesick.<br />Songs like The Downfall of Us All and My Life for Hire show A Day to Remember's ability to create songs that have fantastic gang vocal sections and upbeat pop-punk influenced choruses.<br />The Downfall of Us All is one of the most commercially successful songs that A Day to Remember has ever released thanks to the extremely catchy slogan and upbeat guitar riffs followed by an energized breakdown.<br />My Life for Hire has a bone-chilling breakdown with the chill inducing lyrics &#34;This is a battleground!&#34;<br />and who could forget the best track by far on the entire record, Mr.Highway's Thinking About the End. The track starts off with a chilling intro and ends in one of the most intense breakdowns in the genre. You aren't likely to forget when Jeremy screams &#34;Disrespect Your Surroundings&#34;<br />For those that enjoy music more akin to being played on the radio, you will most likely find enjoyment in the tracks Have Faith in Me, If It Means A Lot to You and Homesick.<br />If you are a fan on post-hardcore and pop-punk music, you owe it to yourself to give this album a chance. It is THE album that I point to when I want to show off the best of the genre.<br />Favorite Tracks: My Life for Hire, Mr.Highway's Thinking About the End, You Already Know What You Are, If It Means A Lot to You

They monitored her constantly, why don't we know more about that conflict?<br /><br />I am also very disappointed in the ending. What about the thoughts as Tris was lying in the table in Insurgent about NOT wanting to go? Not wanting to leave Tobias yet? Not wanting to be risking her life anymore? WANTING to live?<br /><br />I almost feel like Roth just got tired of writing the story halfway through the book and took the easy way out.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravity director, Alphonso Cuar&oacute;n said that after this, he will never make another \\"space\\" movie.  Thankfully, the \\"space\\" movie that he did make is nothing short of spectacular, and should certainly make any director think twice before making the next \\"space\\" movie.<br /><br />Superlatives abound when describing the intensity and the mind-blowing visual effects of Gravity.  Set in space, Gravity opens with the words, \\"Life in space is impossible,\\" and five better words do not exist to serve as prologue for the film that follows.  Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are on a NASA satellite repair mission 600 kilometers above Earth's surface when rogue debris from a Russian satellite detonation rip through their station at 50,000 MPH, decimating their ship and sending the astronauts hurdling into space.<br /><br />Cuar&oacute;n majestically dazzles the viewer in the opening scene with epic silence, sweeping camera movements, and sensory immersion that rivals that of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  He magnifies the strangeness and utter complexity of being suspended in space as Stone and Kowalski are shown performing a variety of tasks as they complete their mission while communicating via radio between each other and their contact at Mission Control in Houston (Ed Harris).<br /><br />The peaceful, serene tone of the film's first ten minutes is mesmerizing but unsettling as a twinge of impending doom is resting uneasily in the audience's mind.  The thrilling contrast of the sudden catastrophe that befalls Stone and Kowalski is also handled with pure terror.  Tonal comparisons can be made to the 2003 film Open Water where primal fear is explored as two scuba divers are abandoned in the middle of the ocean hundreds of miles from shore.  Gravity taps into that same primal fear with expertise and style.<br /><br />Gravity is a true cinematic ride.  While not deep in content, the film is absorbing, terrifying, and authentic.  Clooney and Bullock carry the movie with ease and with a tight running time of 91 minutes, the small cast merely emphasizes the ironically claustrophobic nature of space.  Cuar&oacute;n's choices of point of view are magnificent as he allows the camera to effortlessly and seamlessly transition in and out of first-person at the most opportune times.  Few films give an audience such awareness and consciousness.  In once scene Bullock's character is suddenly sent spinning into deep space.  She loses radio communication and the camera assumes Bullock's point of view.  The audience abruptly is thrown into a very real experience of spinning, attempting to gain a point of reference, discovering oxygen levels are low, and likely literally holding their breath.  This is a movie to experience in a theater!  A<br /><br />Gravity is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 31 minutes.  See it on the largest screen possible; it is playing in IMAX and XTreme theaters and can be seen in both 2D and 3D.  The People's Critic saw the film in 2D, but many critics say this is a film worthy of the 3D surcharge.Clooney and Bullock carry the movie with ease and with a tight running time of 91 minutes, the small cast merely emphasizes the ironically claustrophobic nature of space.

B008JFUN6E|4.0|What if Wall-E were real?  That's the question director Matt Damon and director Neill Blomkamp try to answer in Elysium.  Actually, there have been plenty of films depicting world-ending scenarios this summer, nonetheless, this is the one that stars Matt Damon, so pay attention.<br /><br />The word \\"Elysium\\" actually refers to a Greek notion of the afterlife where those chosen by the gods would spend eternity.  Blomkamp's Elysium reveals a similar idea with the ironic twist being that the \\"chosen few\\" are simply the world's wealthiest and most privileged.  Here Elysium is a space station constructed miles above Earth's atmosphere designed to house the planet's most fortunate, so that they can maintain their lavish lifestyle without the burdens of living on an overpopulated Earth.  The year is 2154.  Max (Damon) is an average guy living in L.A. who finds himself in a life or death situation that can only be cured by the advanced medical treatments available on Elysium.  Elysium's strict immigration laws prevent unauthorized travel to the haven, leaving Max to desperate measures.<br /><br />Blomkamp's film is wonderfully directed.  With brilliant juxtapositions between Elysium and Earth, he designs a very well made story that looks all too real!  Scenes of sweeping, Eden-esque beauty are shattered by guerrilla-style wildness of a civilization clinging to existence.  Slightly reminiscent of Minority Report, Max's humanity and loss thereof is accentuated with symbolic intensity and careful pacing.  His decent into despair is marked by a crude cyborg-like surgical implant that Blomkamp uses to remind us of how close we are from becoming a race of data transfer capsules.  The film's various villains are united and yet compartmentalized representing a visionary balance of complexity that while slightly excessive could have been tremendously overbearing.  Blomkamp's previous film District 9 was in a similar topical vein, and while it was a better film overall than Elysium, this latest film is a finer directorial effort, perhaps worthy of Oscar's attention, although unlikely given the film's weaknesses in other areas.<br /><br />Elysium's main problem is in the writing.  The problem is that Elysium should be more upsetting than it is.  It attempts to invoke the spirit, the outrage, and the temperament of the Occupy Wall-Street movement, showing a wealthy 1% looking down on a struggling and desperate 99%.  However, this is done in a rather heavy-handed way that comes across simplistic and, at times, stereotypically vapid.  This is most apparent in examining Jodi Foster's Secretary Delacourt who attempts to plan a coup for seemingly no better reason than because her fascist ways are more fascist than the current fascist in charge.  Foster does her best with what she's given, but a complicated issue is reduced to a shred of viability, turning what could have been a deeply stirring sci-fi commentary into just another by the numbers hero tale.  Questions are left unanswered especially in the film's closing act, which offers a naive and, while plausible, uneven resolution.  Not to mention that the film fails to soften the reality that Damon, Blomkamp, and company are pandering to a low to middle class audience about the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  I had a similar issue with Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby from earlier this Spring.  This is the \\"Catch-22″ of A-List Hollywood in the economically polarized 21st century.<br /><br />Pompousness aside, Elysium offers a fast-paced, stirring, visually well-made exploration of a slice of humanity.  While it may not accomplish what it set out to do contextually, it is still a worthy film deserving of some credence.  B<br /><br />Elysium is rated R and has a refreshingly appropriate running time of 1 hour and 37 minutes.

B004LQEYAG|5.0|One of my favorite western movies - I loved this when it first came out, and loved it all over again. The camaraderie between Newman and Redford is unmatched by any other pair.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|In the opening scene of Captain Phillips, Tom Hanks' character, Rich Phillips, has a frank conversation with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) while they drive to the airport.  As a teacher, I took special note of this conversation, as it pertained to Phillips' concern regarding his son's performance in school.  He tells his wife that he's worried that the world is far more competitive than it used to be and that even putting in the minimum is not enough to rise above and have a chance at success.  I've delivered various versions of this message to my high school students and while this conversation stood out to me for a different reason than it will to many other theatergoers, this seemingly innocuous scene sets the tone for a far more substantial and contextual film than I had expected.<br /><br />Adapted from Richard Phillips' memoir, Captain Phillips tells the somewhat well-known true story of an American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in the Spring of 2009.  The surprisingly rapid turnaround between original incident and major film production speaks volumes to the merits of the story.  The film presents a form of \\"bio-pic\\" that forgoes the melodramatic retelling of fact, and instead uses real life to make a statement, in this case about globalization.  Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum), aims his \\"shaky\\" camera not only at the heroic protagonist, but also at what leads these Somali pirates to take such risky action.  By the time the pirates board Phillips' ship, we are thoroughly disturbed and authentically frightened for what they may be capable of doing to take over the vessel.  The four pirates are meticulously realized through some menacing bilingual performances by a group of first-time Somali actors.  As the film unfolds, their story and motivations are every bit as fascinating and gripping as those of Phillips and his crew.  Phillips' opening conversation with his wife about the stresses of competition and the vanishing opportunities for those less fortunate becomes realized as we see this despair front and center.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is sure to earn an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.  In fact, this may be the performance of his career, certainly his best since Philadelphia.  His pragmatic performance is captivating, and he is never over-the-top.  In a scene where Muse, the lead pirate, invades the cargo ship's control room, Phillips squares off with the pirates for the first time.  Hanks responds to this scenario so well and so realistically that it is easy to forget that this is a movie and not real life.  As the film goes on, Hanks tempers his performance for every new development culminating in a scene towards the end that is nothing short of brilliant, heartbreaking, and stirring.<br /><br />Captain Phillips is another great movie for 2013.  While the story is still relatively current and many film-goers will be aware of its outcome, Greengrass, Hanks, and the supporting cast ensure a thrilling experience.  The film also works on a deeper level by examining the motives of the pirates and theorizing about some of the policies that should, perhaps, be revisited regarding freighter security measures and the \\"acceptable\\" risks that are taken for the sake of transporting goods overseas.  The film resonates with vivacity but Hanks' performance is the film's true strength.

Hanks responds to this scenario so well and so realistically that it is easy to forget that this is a movie and not real life.  As the film goes on, Hanks tempers his performance for every new development culminating in a scene towards the end that is nothing short of brilliant, heartbreaking, and stirring.<br /><br />Captain Phillips is another great movie for 2013.  While the story is still relatively current and many film-goers will be aware of its outcome, Greengrass, Hanks, and the supporting cast ensure a thrilling experience.  The film also works on a deeper level by examining the motives of the pirates and theorizing about some of the policies that should, perhaps, be revisited regarding freighter security measures and the \\"acceptable\\" risks that are taken for the sake of transporting goods overseas.  The film resonates with vivacity but Hanks' performance is the film's true strength.  A-<br /><br />Captain Phillips is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 14 minutes.
0316228583|2.0|Boring.....I gave up 3/4's of the way through.  The story is boring, the characters are boring. This is a good book to use as a sleeping pill.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool isnt on Itunes so I ordered their cd. great cd from a great band. highly recommend this cd if you dont already own it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I looked forward to the end of these books and am terribly disappointed in the ending.  I will not go see the movie(s).  I do not know why the author chose to end the series with no hope.  I will not read anything else written by this author.
B00CHVJODE|3.0|I bought this cause of my kids. I bought this to let them like it. They love it and I found it to be a good store and a good family flick. If you got kids you should buy it. Or like a few people I know like it when there drunk and its funny to watch them laugh on there butts.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Alex encompasses several genres - serial killer, horror, mystery - but I think police procedural is the primary one, and as such it is one of the very best.  Unlike many books that start with excitement and promise, and then do not seem to know how to end  (many of John Grisham's books in my opinion), the wrap-up here is welcome and satisfying.  The author keeps you involved and wondering throughout. The cast of quirky characters is not a distraction, but left me wanting to understand a little more about them.  Perhaps in the next volume..
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I am given the movie a 4 star cause I love were they are going with this and how they are pulling in old things with the new things of James T Kirk.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Good, but I don't think it was a good as the first season.  Still worth the time to watch it, though. IMHO
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I gave it a 3 stars cause its new and I am liking it really well and its cool to play with.I have so far used it to play with you tube and to also Netflix and I am liking it very well. I need to see what else it does so look around on the you tube and see what you think from others. It is worth the money and to get it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I really did not think the American version of House of Cards could possibly be as good as the Britsh version starring Ian Richardson. After all, most contemporary American re-makes of British films (or even of old American films) usually cannot measure up to the original. I was proven wrong by the series, however. It truly is a well-done work. The writers have adapted the original British novel to fit American culture and political landscape. Kevin Spacey is absolutely perfect as Francis Underwood (FU), and Robin Wright is just as good in her role as his wife. Great series. A little too graphic in some of the sex scenes, so it definitely is not for children, however. I recommend this series to all who love a villainous tale well told.

006202406X|3.0|I got into this series late, and loved the first two books.  And I loved this book too - well, the first 80 percent of it.  Suffice it to say (no spoilers) that fans of the characters will not be getting much of a happy ending out of Veronica Roth.  If you don't like unpleasant surprises, I highly suggest that you find a review that talks about the ending so you're not as shocked and disappointed as I was.
0316204366|4.0|As in his other books, Gladwell turns things over to examine the unexpected.  Always thought-provoking, and that is the intent of his books.  But if you've never read anything by him I wouldn't start with this one.  Start with &#34;Blink&#34; or &#34;The Tipping Point.&#34;
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I really love this album; it's a different direction for Katy Perry but it works. This is a very mellow easy going album. Roar is probably the most upbeat song on the deluxe edition. It's a very honest and relatable album that I can listen to endlessly. It's also got a nice unique throwback feel to it. 5/5
0062014536|1.0|Lauren Oliver is one of those authors who I will read LITERALLY anything she writes, it doesn't matter what the subject is. Oliver has this raw, beautiful ability to create such lyrical, unparalleled prose and Requiem is no exception. Despite my complete adoration for Oliver's writing, I had been extremely nervous about reading Requiem because the reviews have been less than stellar. I wasn't a huge fan of Delirium, but by the middle of Pandemonium, I was completely infected with deliria nervosa for this series. Though the Delirium series isn't the best, I didn't want Requiem to tarnish my view of the series.<br /><br />  To be honest, I'm not a huge supporter of Oliver's decision to break this book up into both Lena and Hana's point-of-views. Hana's point of view was interesting, but I really felt like it took away something from the bigger picture. I know Oliver wanted readers to see how essential love is in life, but we never really see how love affects Lena.<br /><br />  Considering the Delirium Trilogy is all about love, why is Lena's romances such a negligible part of the story. Why is Alex barely apart of this story and why does he barely interact with Lena? Even Lena's so-called romance with Julian takes the backseat for Hana's point of view and story. I honestly would rather have read about either Alex or Julian than read about Hana who was concentrated on too much in this book.<br /><br />  Requiem takes the cake for being one of the worst series conclusions ever, considering I have read Dead Ever After (the conclusion to the Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood series). Requiem isn't the worst conclusion that I've read because it does have some great moments, but these positive aspects are overshadowed by the ending. The ending is extremely unsatisfying and inconclusive; so many of the vital questions that fans had weren't solved at all. In fact, I feel like Requiem left more questions unanswered than it actually answered.<br /><br />  The way Requiem ended, I felt like I was missing a few chapters or an epilogue or something. It really felt like my copy was missing an ending and the sad part is that it wasn't my copy because readers everywhere were cheated of a legitimate ending. It's truly upsetting how Oliver managed to ruin one of the most-anticipated books of 2013 for so many people.<br /><br />  Though the Delirium trilogy had it's ups and downs, I really felt like I had wasted my time reading the entire series all because of Requiem. For those who haven't started the series yet, I would definitely avoid starting it due to the terrible, non-existent ending. I have a feeling that most people who have read the 2 previous books will read this book, despite the extreme controversy. I guess it was too much to hope for a satisfying ending, Lauren Oliver really let me down with this one.lt like I was missing a few chapters or an epilogue or something.

All that remains for me now is to mourn this beloved friend as there are no more pages to read and comfort myself that I may know her again at any time I please and have the strength for the journey.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|My son, who is 11, is reading this series of books so this movie was perfect for him. While the movies are never as good as the books, and some of the details get changed, it was still the same story. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as well...adventure, humor, and a lot of greek mythology made for great fun!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great story line with a little difference in speech and words that are not English but yet charming.  Look forward to reading more from this author.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know there are several reviews critiquing the ending of this book but I feel like the ending gave justice to Tris's character.  Her story ended on her terms; brave, selfless, and full of love.  Although it is very sad, I may have been disappointed if it ended the way all the other books in recent popular media usually do.<br />ETA: Now that I have more time to add to this,  I have to agree with other reviewers in saying that it is hard to distinguish who is narrating since it is written so similarly between Tris and Tobias's perspective from chapter to chapter.  I would find myself forgetting who was narrating in the middle of a chapter sometimes but I did appreciate getting to hear things from Tobias's point of view.  I feel like Tris and Tobias had a really rough break since everything they ended up involved in was crooked and so to hear that the government outside the fence was also corrupt was a bit of a let down to me.  However, I do see where the author needed conflict to keep the story interesting. I was entertained throughout the whole book. I also really appreciated grammar and editing in this series.  Of the three books, I only noticed one error in grammar (which I believe was in the first book) which is refreshing these days.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had been trying to get this game for ever!! I played it on the comp<br />uter but it kept freezing up, so I quit. I hope this one doesn't do that.
0062073613|3.0|I am almost reluctant to write this review as the vast majority of reviews are glowing with praise for the author.  I found the book interesting enough that I couldn't put it down once I got about halfway through and continued reading into the wee hours of the morning until I had finished.  At that point, I was very confused.  This book deals with two murders, one of which makes perfectly good sense (to the murderers and the reader) as the victim's death will prevent the victim from receiving a large amount of money which will go to the perpetrators instead.  The other death involves a young village girl lured to a hotel by the murderers and also killed.  The clothing of the two victims is exchanged, one body ends up in the library of a respectable couple and the other body ends up in a stolen vehicle which is set of fire so that the body can be identified only by a shoe and a button.  The death of the young village girl made no sense to me, nor did the exchange of clothing, nor did setting one of the bodies on fire, since identification of the victim would be necessary for the murderers  to inherit the large amount of money.  I reread the book carefully thinking that I had missed some important clues, but I didn't find what I was looking for.  Perhaps I am exceptionally dense, but I was disappointed that the book provided no logical reason that I could discern for the murder of the village teen-ager.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I like it.  It's easy to use.  Takes clear pictures. Great for group pictures.  I don't know what else to say.
006202406X|4.0|::NO Spoilers:: I'm saddened that so many readers have been turned off by the conclusion of this powerful series. I get it. Perhaps I'm one of the few who was really touched and appreciative of the storytelling that Roth has produced with this series as a whole, culminating to this powerful series close. Her bravery and dauntless-ness in telling a story in unconventional ways is encouraging. Don't get me wrong. I love to read stories that are predictably happy and &#34;all's well that ends well.&#34; Yes, (as many readers have commented) novels are a way to escape from real life and not feel pain and hurt; but it's often that we are made more aware of how precious and fragile life is through pain and hurt (as horrible as it feels). [Side Note: I was weeping nearly all my water weight out during the last 1/4 of this book.] Are these feelings pleasant? No. But neither were my feelings while/after reading other well-read, well-loved novels such as &#34;The Scarlet Letter&#34; or &#34;The Giver.&#34; All that said, in my opinion, Roth has crafted a unique and thought-provoking universe and story. Is it the greatest novel of all time? No. But this 30-something reader was left with many things to think about, and that, for me, is enough.

0375836675|5.0|I picked up this book a few times at the library and read the back cover and put it back down.  After reading The Book Thief and absolutely loving it, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect, but from the first page, Zusak had me laughing out loud.  While humor never left the book, the story became increasingly touching.  He has the ability to tell a story that flows so easily that it grabs you and doesn't let go.  His way with words and how he describes scenes is unlike anything I have read before.<br /><br />Here are a few examples:<br /><br />\\"Our feet dangle.<br /><br />I watch them, and I watch the jeans on Audrey's legs.<br /><br />We only sit there now.<br /><br />Audrey and me.<br /><br />And discomfort.<br /><br />Squeezed in, between us.\\" p. 120<br /><br />\\"There's a streetlight standing over us, watching.<br /><br />There's a breeze, cooling the sweat on my face, and slowly I see my shadow step on Gavin Rose.\\" p. 170<br /><br />Ed Kennedy takes the journey of a lifetime and I felt like I was right there with him.  Through his eyes we see the world as it really is.  We see the abused, the lonely, the poor, and realize that simple acts of kindness (or hurt) can make a big impact on people's lives.<br /><br />A truly touching story.  One that will stay with me forever.  I am grateful to Markus Zusak for helping me to realize that we all have the potential to be something great, and to use that greatness to help those around us.<br /><br />For those of you who are looking at the Book Level for your younger readers, be warned.  This is definitely a Young Adult novel, and I wouldn't recommend it for children.
0061950726|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Earlier I had learned a folk song entitled &#34;The Orphan Train&#34; on this same subject, so I already was aware of the subject matter.  It's important to note the title of each chapter and the scope of time for each chapter so one can keep clear in one's mind which one of the two main characters is being written about.  It's a fascinating story and based on some real life events.
B001N09F7U|3.0|I must admit that I am relieved to be done reading this book.  As is per King's style, this book is chock-full of description.  At times (and I hate to admit this), I found myself skimming ahead in the pages to see when the action would pick up.  While the story moved along, and we followed nine year old  Trisha's plight through the woods, there wasn't a \\"gotcha\\" moment until very late in the book.  For me it was page 190 of this 219 page book.  Waiting for that moment at times made this a somewhat laborious read.<br /><br />Stephen King is still a great writer, but for me, this isn't on the list of one of his better books.  That being said, as I have mentioned in previous posts, I was forced to stop and reflect on my own nine year old child and consider whether he is equipped with tools that would help him cope with such moments of distress.  So for that I am glad that I stuck with it.<br /><br />While this book did not make it to my list of favorites, it is still classic King and worth a read if you are a fan.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Since downloading the app, I've used it a few times.  Just kind of a distraction more than anything else.  Novel at first but only for a few minutes at best.
1400032717|4.0|The first thing you need to keep in mind when reading this book is that it is written in the first person as the voice of a special needs boy who happens to be brilliant.  If you don't like run-on sentences, take a deep breath and soldier on because they are prevalent here.  I must admit that I had an easier time with the sentence structure than I did with the complex technical passages which rendered me somewhat cross-eyed.  Having said that, I really did enjoy the story and the way I was able to connect with the characters.  Mr. Haddon's work with autistic children is evident in his portrayal of Christopher and his daily struggles.  A very moving book that had me hooked from the first page.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Having read the book &#34;Wave&#34; by Sonali Deraniyagala, which was about one woman's loss in the same Tsunami, this movie seemed more Hollywood than real to me. It credits as being based on a true story, so maybe the ending of the movie was true to someone's experience, I don't know.<br /><br />The acting was good, the kids were very good, and the special effects were pretty good, but the movie never really caught me in the story. I rented it from Amazon, and it took me two nights to get through the movie. I stopped halfway through the first nice, mostly out of boredom with trying to believe the story.<br /><br />I am sure that if I hadn't read Wave, I might have been better able to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />The one good thing, it was only a rental, so I didn't waste a lot of money purchasing it.
0375842209|5.0|This story is written from Death's point of view, so at first was a little bit hard for me to follow.  Once I kept reminding myself that this was the case, it was easier for me to get into the flow of the story.  Although a work of fiction, if you know anything about the history of World War II, it is not hard to imagine hundreds of actual tales like this one.  As if Liesel didn't have enough worries (a harsh foster mother and her love of the stolen book), she is faced with harboring a Jewish man and all that it implies. The bravery and compassion in this book are at times overwhelming.  I can't count the number of times that I cried.  Both tragic and beautiful, this book is one that I recommend to all of my friends.
B004PJG7MW|5.0|A nice story.  Great for the whole family.  A precursor to WALLE.  I would recommend this movie even given its original date of release.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|Storywise \\"Chronicle\\" may not offer anything new perhaps, but it does provide a new perspective on familiar sci-fi fantasy topic by focusing teenage anxiety. The story itself about three high school students with newly gained special abilities is rather contrived and even predictable, but with considerable storytelling skills, fine performances from the young actors and slick direction, \\"Chronicle\\" delivers.<br /><br />After touching some blue-ish glowing object hidden under the ground, three Seattle high school students Andrew (Dane DeHaan), Steve (Michael B. Jordan) and Andrew's cousin Matt (Alex Russell) develop telekinetic abilities. For the kids the new abilities are just fun, especially for a bullied boy Andrew, until things go too far and get out of control.<br /><br />They say, \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\" But what would ordinary high school boys do if they got some special powers? They are most likely to use them for something silly or trivial, if not evil. In \\"Chronicle\\" the kids are quick to find a new way to use their powers and enjoy themselves, but never attempt to be heroes of justice.<br /><br />Thus what is really impressive about the film is its realistic characters. Even with these new powers, some just cannot find their places in school or family. You may not like the film's found-footage style which is overused in recent years, but \\"Chronicle\\" still makes for an engaging ride.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Like most of you, I've been waiting for this book to come out since Insurgent.<br /><br />And like a giddy school girl, I stayed up late waiting for my Kindle copy to arrive and got to reading.<br /><br />And then I got on a downward spiral staircase of disappointment<br /><br />1. An experiment? Really? What is this,  M. Night Shyamalan's The Village? That right there set the tone for the book, in turn setting me up for complete disappointment in the story line of Edith Prior's tape<br />2. Why is Tris right about everything all the time? She emasculates Four ALL the time. And he became a crying, nagging man. Completely different from Divergent Four I loved so much<br />3. Her death. No. I started to really dislike her character in this book and even so, I don't think killing her off was appropriate AT ALL<br />4. I didn't believe she was dead until someone told Four. Even then, the chapters after that I kept waiting for her to wake up. It wasn't until the chapter where it's 2 years later, where they have her ashes in an urn, did i believe she was actually dead.<br />5. I'm just....disappointed. I was emotionally attached to the books, story line, characters, and in the end...Roth changed so much of it.

B0079XPUOW|2.0|This novel had a wonderful premise, which caused me to buy it and the first half was reasonably interesting. After that, it increasingly faded into incoherence. Scalzi had a good idea (that owed a lot to &#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; I think) but once the premise was developed had no idea where exactly to go with it or how to end it. This probably would have been better as a short story or a novelette. The last parts seems tacked on just to make it long enough to sell as a novel. I loved much of his previous work but will be more careful before taking the bait next time.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is basically a homage to almost every zombie movie before it. It does a lot of things right: the pacing, camera work, and of course the gore. The plot is very simple and there's no character development, but you won't care as you laugh and scream along with the main leads.<br /><br />If you like zombies and Brit comedy, this is a must watch. Better than Hot Fuzz in my opinion.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|\\"New\\" is a solid release from Paul. If you're a fan, pick it up. Some Paul is better than no Paul.<br /><br />As an admirer of most of his work, I am a little dismayed that an artist who once was able to write, produce, and play virtually every instrument on his early solo work, has to hire the likes of Epworth and Ronson to produce his stuff these days. I get that he is trying to stay \\"relevant\\" and these young producers certainly delivered a contemporary-sounding record for him, but the combination of his aging voice (and the choices he makes vocally to sing in his higher register at age 70+), plus the production choices and relative weakness of the songs makes for a mediocre listen unfortunately. Whatever strength the individual songs may have gets lost in the synthetic drum samples, buzzing, and echoes.<br /><br />I wish he would have gone in another direction, perhaps producing himself and collaborating with another songwriter with strong pop-chops (Elvis Costello? Jeff Lynne?), or seeking out a more seasoned producer collaborator. We need a bare-boned no frills Paul McCartney record --one where he sings in a comfortable lower vocal range, and where the songs are showcased, not the production. Anyway, my .02 cents.<br /><br />Standouts on \\"New\\" for me were the tracks \\"New,\\" \\"On My Way To Work,\\" \\"Queenie Eye,\\" and \\"Get Me Out Of Here.\\" I am glad he is still recording and hope he doesn't wait as long for his next album of original material.

B008KYOCA2|5.0|I just started using the Jorte calendar today and so far I'm loving it! Another reviewer mentioned you didn't have to sync this with an email calendar and that decided it for me. It's exactly what I was looking for in a planner. The one wish I'd add to a list is for by-weekly events. I attend a lot of meetings and functions every other week. For now I'm adding as one time events until dev can add that functionality. Thanks so much for your hard work on creating a superior app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is about the love and friendship between Augustus and Hazel. They go through so many ups and downs, despite being only 16 years old. What's amazing about this book is that the characters have so much depth to them that I felt the pain and sorrow they went through.

B00DEFW998|5.0|This album was inevitable. The two daughters of Ravi Shankar, both talented in their own fashion, have come together in honor of their late father and produced an extraordinarily fine album of contemporary world fusion tunes with an Indian flavor, thanks to Anoushka Shankar's sweet and precise sitar. Except for one track with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Shankar is the composer. She had the assistance of producer Nitin Sawhney, who was personally responsible for arrangements and electronic programming. Instrumentation is fairly minimal: chiefly the sitar, the piano of Norah Jones and Sawhney, cello, hang (\\"han\\", a hollow-sounding, flying saucer-shaped metallophone of nitrited steel played by hand), some percussion (mridangam, ghatam, tabla), tanpura drone, shehnai double reed, bansuri flute, and on one track guitars, ukelele, and glockenspiel, plus electronic programming. Jones sings on three tracks. The music varies from the style of Hindustani dhuns and thumri (light classical and folk melodies) to free jazz (Scandanavian style) to Vedic chant. Some tracks are based on ragas, Shree for \\"In Jyoti's Name\\" and Manj Khamaj for \\"Monsoon\\". In the notes, Shankar provides comments to each track, reflecting on her father and on Hindu philosophy. Lyrics to Jones' songs and the Vedic prayer are also included. As mentioned by Shankar, Jones'  song \\"Unsaid\\" is similar to her father's theme music to Satyajit Ray's film Pather Panchali, music that she never heard. [I just compared both and it does raise eyebrows.) This is Anoushka's finest nonclassical album to date. The famous German classical label DGG, which long ago had issued some raga performances by Ravi Shankar, recognized her work as a wonderful, beautiful, and meaningful cross-over album. Ravi would have been proud. 56 minutes.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I played this game for 10 months.  As your village gets larger the game slows down.  Mine crashed and I had to start over from the beginning.  It's very frustrating to only receive 550 coins per day when I was used to getting 1000000 per day..  l did report it and Blue Sky did give me a ton of coins to help me recreate my village but not the acorns which some of them I bought.  That's frustrating but I do like the game when it works.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Enthralling story I read years ago and saw it as a free book and decided to read again. I usually read quickly and had to slow down to enjoy the descriptive narrative as told in 1st person by Buck. He told of his many lives beginning with his theft from his comfortable family home to his harsh life as a sled dog. The story continues as Buck is sold, several times. Often beaten, Buck describes the other sled dogs including the vicious fights to be head sled dog, and the unfortunate deaths of his friends not able to keep up. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and if like me, you read it years ago, you will also enjoy it again.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|As a long-time Marvel fan, I expect great things from movies about their characters.  Some of the previous efforts have fallen way short.  This one is nearly perfect in every aspect.  The characters are true, the story and dialogue are dead on and the action is more than just things going boom.

B00821OX98|4.0|My wife & I are not much on any series, but happened upon this & gave it a try. I must say that it is somewhat addicting. I enjoyed the story-line & hope the rest of the series is as good as the first one. If you like sci-fi shows, you will enjoy it I am sure!
1608871827|4.0|I was waiting for this book since I watched the movie and finally it got republished!!! Yea, ordered and it arrived in pristine condition as all Amazon purchases would. Took just a week for an international shipment despite having to pay a bit extra, but well worth all of that and some!<br /><br />This book completes everything we would be wondering about while watching the movie. One funny thing though...<br />Cherno Alpha is listed as a Mark IV in this book as well as the movie novelization, but Pentecost mentioned it as \\"the last of the Mark Is\\" in the movie. Which of it should be true...? Small matter, nothing to fret about though. Art work in this book is excellent along with all the info and blueprints.<br /><br />However, I didn't grade it with the 5 star it deserves, because I got TWO Cherno Alpha blueprints. The Crimson Typhoon blueprint was missing, and the additional Cherno's pasted on it's place. Bummer...<br /><br />Can I get the Crimson Typhoon blueprint please. That's the only blot.

B00364K6YW|4.0|I love this series and have watched it many times.  It is a wonderful romantic story.  However, the quality did not seem to be as good as I remember from previous times I have watched it which was some time ago.  Maybe it is because TVs are much bigger nowadays and have more pixels.  The quality is not so bad that I wouldn't watch it again and again but I was hoping for a better quality picture since it says &#34;restored&#34; version.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|In Allegiant, the third book in a promising and much anticipated trilogy, Veronica Roth delivers a novel that wouldn't have ordinarily made it out of the slush pile of any reputable publisher. Her prose barely rises above the complexity of \\"See spot run\\", and her endless repetition of the same weary adjectives makes me fervently hope someone buys her a thesaurus for Christmas. I am similarly underwhelmed by her ham-handed use of point of view. The previous two books were written solely from the point of view of Tris while this book's point of view alternates between Tris and Tobias. Roth's plain Jane, junior high style prose never achieves a difference in voice between her own narration, Tris, or Tobias. This is especially disappointing because Tobias is such a complex, mysterious character and should have delivered riveting chapters. The finale is the most monotone book I have ever had the misfortune of reading, and if you're perceptive, you realize early on why she has to write from the perspective of two characters. Many people are howling about the ending, and while I maintain it was not the ending I hoped for, my opinion is that Roth is too poor and weak of a writer to achieve the shocking, hard-hitting ending she desired. Never mind all the intricate plots, subplots, and endless revolutions. She couldn't achieve resolution. You could argue that not all dystopian futures will be  or have to be resolved and that her book is actually realistic, but given the scores of weaknesses throughout the book, I'm going to guess that Roth couldn't tie up her loose ends.<br /><br />I'm not sure what happened to the most anticipated young adult novel of the year, but my primary theory is that having released three novels in three years and a slew of forthcoming Divergent-related short stories, Roth was really just looking to cash in big while she could. This trilogy could have been great, and I am sorry a better author didn't come up with it.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love my lifeproof case.  I have not tried it in water, other than to test it but have ran in the rain with it.  Listening to music is a little muffled when just have the music on while cleaning.  Have accidentally dropped the phone and it protected the phone.  Not a hard drop or very high up.  Disappointed in the fact that only got the case in August and it is already coming apart.  The grey is cracked and starting to come off.  Don't know if this will affect the dust/water proofness.

0307744434|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus. The first few pages immediately catapulted me into the dreamy, mist-filled world of Celia and Marco and the magic of the Night Circus.  We first meet the main characters as children who are unwillingly committed to a mysterious challenge by their respective guardians. The story swirls around their journeys as well as that of an odd collection of individuals who design and establish the Night Circus.<br /><br />We read this for my book group. Some thought The Night Circus should have been refashioned as a YA novel and couldn't finish the book. Others, myself included, loved the mystery and intrigue of the story, although I agree that it would have made a better YA novel and could have been easily enough by having Celia and Marco meet when they were younger. There is a slight lull in the middle of the book, but then the story starts moving forward thanks to the larger role played by the younger characters -- an ordinary boy named Bailey and a pair of twins born to the circus.<br /><br /> We all agreed that the fantastical circus was described so vividly so that it was easy to envision the main setting of the story.<br /><br />To answer my question, this is a book for adults who loved Harry Potter and Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, and it should appeal to young readers who don't mind sifting through lots of description to be rewarded with a uniquely enchanting story.

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|While I think the rash of 5-star reviews are a bit more due to the bleakness of Q2K and beyond, this is a really good album.<br /><br />What it has:<br /><br />1) Mostly a return to the sound and feel of The Warning, which is probably very much a result of guitarist Michael Wilton's prevalence throughout this album<br /><br />2) Phenomenal work by new vocalist/front man Todd LaTorre. His low range is different in sound than Tate, but the upper registers recall early 'ryche; this part of their music has been gone for a long time. Anyway, the band (and LaTorre) proved my once-held assertion that the vocalist of this band was irreplaceable<br /><br />3) Distinctive Queensryche harmonized guitar melodies<br /><br />4) Proof (through live performances) that they can rock older material. Heck, I'd love to hear them do some of my favorites live, because I'm certain that LaTorre can pull them off in a way that his predecessor no longer can<br /><br />What it lacks:<br /><br />1) Lyrically, there isn't the depth of some QR offerings. However, take this with a grain of salt because it's essentially nine tracks (2 are instrumental shorts) and because I think that, as they work together, the songwriting will improve (QR's history proves this point)<br /><br />2) Slow arpeggiated QR greatness a la 'I Dream in Infrared', 'No Sanctuary' and songs of the like. There's a little in this album's 'A World Without', but this (historically) has been something we'd find in a quarter or more of QR's songs in the past<br /><br />3) Hook melodies that make it memorable. I like the album, but I've listened to it non-stop in the car since it arrived, and still have no song that I can't shake from my mind (something that never happened until Q2K in my QR memory)<br /><br />Anyway, plusses far outweigh the 'missings' and I'm finding my excitement about the band renewed.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think the story got a little overly complicated in the middle of this book. It didn't have the fast action or the thrilling romance of the first two. I thought some of the characters got a little lost. I don't mind the killing off of main characters for the message that it gave. I liked that actually. It probably should have been two books to better flush out some of the story line. Great themes, though. I certainly don't agree with all the bad reviews, which I'm sure are due to the loss of a certain main character. Look a little deeper, folks, and find the deep messages in what you read!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really wanted to love this book.  I had looked forward to its release.  I was sadly disappointed.  In this book, Tris and Tobias seem to just be going through the motions.  Character development and voice in this book are MIA.  Tobias and Tris might as well have been the same person, because they had the same monotone delivery in short simple sentences.  Halfway through, I was begging for imagery, emotion, and at least complex sentence structures.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this story is that our familiar and beloved characters were almost impossible to recognize, as they had been completely different in the previous books.<br /><br />Finally, I don't want to be \\"preached to\\" when I am reading a work of fiction.  I get the moral and social dilemmas at hand, but I don't want to be constantly hit over the head with it.  There was entirely too much telling and not enough showing in the book.  Overall, I disliked it.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />Like many of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in the third and final installment of the Divergent trilogy.  I loved the first two books and eagerly awaited the series conclusion for months.  After finishing this book, I felt that in her rush to finish the series, Veronica Roth completely let me, and all of her fans, down.  The story line seemed thrown together -- as if she was in a hurry and had to wrap up loose ends. Not only that, but the characters that we've come to know in the last two books underwent complete personality changes in this one.  Tobias acts completely out of character when he joins a resistance movement without even once questioning the motives of their leaders.  Tris, who gives her life in the ultimate sacrifice, only does so because she doesn't want to feel guilty because Caleb was going to do it for the wrong reasons.  Peter, who has been despicable throughout the series, suddenly gets a conscience and wants to wipe his memory and become nice. Evelyn miraculously gives up her desire for control and power to get her son's forgiveness, when that never mattered to her before.  Marcus puts up no fight when he's told that he isn't the leader of the Allegiant.  If it were just one instance of a character undergoing a complete personality change, I could overlook it, but nearly everyone in the story became different people.<br /><br />I also had a hard time dealing with glaring continuity errors in this book. At the end of Insurgent, as Tori stabs Jeanine Matthews, she says her Divergent brother (whom Jeanine had ordered to be killed)was named \\"Jonathan Wu.\\" But in this book, her brother who has actually been living outside the fence is named \\"George.\\"  Really?! Did no one read the last book before publishing this one?<br /><br />Again, all of this makes it seem like Veronica Roth was under pressure to complete the book and just threw something together.  I was anxious for this book to be released, but I would have gladly waited a few more months for a more satisfying conclusion.  As it is, I feel like the last book ruined the entire series.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Bad, really bad. I like will smith movies, but this was just to make jaden known. No story. No need of that.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|As a frequent reader of YA books, I honestly can't remember a worse conclusion to a series.  If you've read the first two books, I would recommend reading the synopsis of this book on Wikipedia than actually reading it.  It is just plain awful.  The &#34;surprises&#34; that occur at the beginning of the third book are shockingly bad.  The remaining &#34;middle&#34; of the book is incredibly boring, with really no action occurring.  The majority of the &#34;middle&#34; section of the book is just never ending ramblings of existential teenage angst.  And the ending?  Un-redeemable.  The ending is terribly depressing and the fact that the book is so boring compounds your sense of disgust as you conclude this series.  Avoid this book at all costs.

From the couple of Sanderson books I've read, he's always been top notch with world/environment/scenario details.<br /><br />Things I'm looking foward to from the next book...<br />-Megan and how things play out with David<br />-More awesomeness from Prof.<br />-More post apocalyptic detail<br />-More Epics!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I could've sworn I wrote a review on this book but I guess I didnt...(lol)<br /><br />I'm just going to keep this short & simple.  This book has everything I want in a book.  It starts out SLOW, but if you can make it past the first 150-200 pages it starts to take off.  Sanderson has to build a massive world for you.  and it's crazy how well it all makes sense and comes together.  Sanderson literally created an ENTIRE world and presented in a memerable way.<br /><br />This is one of those books where I can remember almost everything about it.  I've read it twice.  It's like LOTR or something on that grand of scale.  It will not disappoint.<br /><br />This book is an adventure in itself to read.  If you're looking for a quick read you might want to skip this one for now and come back when you want to be committed to a grand story.<br />Everything is in-depth, characters feel so real, and there are some unforgetable magical moments in this book.  It'll make you tear up, smile, and fist pump throughout the story.  It has solid closure (considering it's book 1 of a series) so some things will be left unresolved or still a mystery, but I was satisfied with the closure and Words of Radiance is at the top of my list for anticipated books.<br /><br />Let's just say, you're missing out if you pass this book up.

Is trying to be sensational worth letting down your readers?<br /><br />Advice to all: caveat emptor-- spend your time and money elsewhere.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great novel! Wanted to read it for several years and at last time for it has come. I thought it's like Harry Potter in space but it turned to be more complex and interesting.

034580404X|5.0|Boy were my expectations of this book completely different than what really is.  While this story does have some of the S&M qualities it is very mild in comparison to what I expected.  There is a very good story in this series and it truly has a romantic side as well as a little bit of a thriller.<br /><br />I will say I was surprised by the psychological component in the book.  I don't want to give a lot away but I work for a Child Protection Svcs type company and I loved that it really delves into that world but shows that with love and compassion, trauma can be surpassed.<br /><br />Wonderful read!
B00E0KPG7S|3.0|Of the five tracks here there are only two worth your time.<br /><br />The stand out is track three. James Chapman, who operates under the name Maps, knows his way around a keyboard and beautifully embellishes an already great track from 'Delta Machine'. His mix would sit well along side the songs from his recent album, 'Vicissitude', which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Track two, the 'Little Vampire Remix' is worth a listen and is similar to the Maps remix in that it doesn't try to reinvent the song too much but rather adds to it.<br /><br />The 'Jim Sciavunos from Griderman' remix is awful, just awful. It's an attempt to make the track heavier and more rock 'n' roll. This idea worked nicely with the song 'Nothing (Headcleanr Rock Mix)' but it absolutely does not work for 'Should Be Higher'. However, I will give this mix a score of one out of ten but only because it isn't track four - 'The Jim Jones Revue Remix'.<br /><br />Dear God, what the heck is going on here?! My first reaction was to laugh out loud. Someone thinks that more having instruments is better. Someone thinks that adding any instruments is better. Again, we have a rock theme applied to a beautiful electronic track and once again it doesn't work, it SO doesn't work. The Jim Jones cult famously finished themselves off in Guyana in 1978. This remix could have easily helped send them on their way - I know it depresses the hell out of me.<br /><br />Track five is a radio edit of the album version. Why do we need this when the album version is perfect in every way?

B00D6QUMWG|5.0|\\"Electrifying\\" is probably the best word I can find to describe this recording. Netrebko's Lady Macbeth and Leonora almost made the hair stand up on my head. The passion is incredible, and the voice itself just overwhelms the senses. I've listened to the recording over and over, and each time I do, I hear some new depth or nuance. It's not just the passion or the sheer power of the voice, either; it's the way she develops the musical line. For example, I have to admit that \\"Macbeth\\" has never been one of my favorite Verdi operas, but Netrebko brings out the music in it for me the way no other soprano has ever done -- and I'm old enough to have heard the \\"greats\\" of the 1950s and 1960s. At first I was a bit doubtful about her Elisabetta (again having heard some of the greats of the Golden Age), but on listening to it several times, I'm hearing a real richness of music and personality. As for the \\"Miserere\\" scene from \\"Il Trovatore,\\" hearing her voice blend with Villazon's is almost worth the price of the album in itself. But it's all an almost sybaritic experience -- like being slathered in warm dark chocolate, with embedded sugar crytals in the upper register.<br /><br />These days, after I've listened to other recent sopranos, even the ones held up as the \\"best\\" of the new breed (many of whom I do appreciate, by the way, and enjoy listening to), I put on a Netrebko CD or DVD and find myself instinctively thinking, \\"Ah, that's more like it.\\" I definitely recommend this recording.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely a must read..had me hooked from the first page.Highly recommend. Nicholas Sparks has done it again. I loved it
B007FXLWKW|5.0|A great movie for kids and adults alike , some hidden adult humor here and great visuals the colors are so vivid.<br />It's about time they made a new easter movie .
B007T8BYWE|4.0|Considering the fact that this is free, it's a rather nice game. My only complaint is that it is rather easy if you are used to this type of game.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book deserves so much more credit than it is being given. I understand people are entitled to their opinions, but 2.5 stars? I realize the end isn't what everyone wanted & there are also some story issues, but I have a feeling so people may just be hopping on the negativity train...<br /><br />Give this book a chance, anyone who hasn't read it, please. I really did enjoy it. It cleared up a lot of questions and also spoke of Chicago's backstory, which is something I had been waiting for. I loved the romance, the descriptions, and the destruction. I'll agree that the story could have been maybe a little more gripping, but this book really shouldn't be looked over.<br /><br />I personally believe this was a great book to end the series with. Sure, I was angry at times (pissed actually), upset, frustrated... but isn't a book supposed to get right at our emotions and make us crazy? Make us feel for the characters and what's going on?<br /><br />All I'm saying is, please don't be turned off by negative reviews. Just because someone else hates it doesn't mean you'll hate it! Be your own judge, and decide for yourself :)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is amazing definitely the best free hunting game I definitely recommend everyone to get it. I have only been playing 10 minutes and I am hooked

B00BD99JMW|5.0|The final book in a trilogy is always going to be the most scrutinized, especially when it is the finale to a series that has been as beloved as Divergent.  As this is one of my very favorite stories, and some of my most beloved characters, I was anticipating this book more than any other this year.  I felt fully invested in what was going to happen and told myself that no matter what, I was going to trust Veronica Roth's vision.<br /><br />When I was thinking the other day about series endings, I actually found it hard to come up with ones that I felt were really and truly bad.  Why?  Because they're not my books and I think an author can end them however they see fit.  Roth was always up front in interviews that she's known how the series was going to end from day one and she laid the groundwork for that calculated ending right from the first page.  So, now that I'm seeing some quite vicious reviews of Allegiant, I would encourage readers to 1) absolutely not post spoilers in reviews so the ending isn't ruined for others and 2) to remember that the only person who knows the fate of this world is the author.  If you're not happy with it, that's why God invented fanfiction.<br /><br />My biggest question going into Allegiant was this -  what's on the other side of the fence?  Roth gives us the full, detailed explanation fairly early on.  It was similar to what I was thinking/hoping, albeit more complicated and planned out.  It was a good combination of psychological and scientific and felt in line with the rest of the world we'd been given.  The reader learns some interesting information about the history of the US and also about Tris' mother, Natalie.  What Tris and crew learn about what's beyond the walls of the city ultimately sets the final conflict into motion.  Roth, as she has over the entire series, brings up some very difficult questions and themes.  I found myself pondering things like how society divides itself, nature vs. nurture, how we manipulate eachother for both good and bad, why we make sacrifices, trust in others and in ourselves, science and taking knowledge too far, etc etc etc.  Even though Allegiant is a very long book, I felt like Roth covered a lot of ground in a small space.  Everything - plot lines, characters, symbols - felt purposeful.  I'm finding it hard to believe there are readers who think Roth didn't know what she was doing because, despite some small missteps, the choices she made as a writer were quite calculated.<br /><br />In terms of things I wasn't pleased with, they were minor.  The world-building has been a complaint with readers and while it's never bothered me before, I did feel like there's a bit of an info dump in the first half when Roth explains what's been going on outside the walls.  Not sure how else she could have done it though, so there's that.  Also, the chapters alternate POV's between Tris and Tobias.  I think this was absolutely necessary to get the full picture of what was happening.  But, especially at the beginning, the voices did not feel as distinct as they might have.<br /><br />The best part in my experience with this series has been the relationship between Tris and Tobias, as well as their individual journeys.  In Insurgent, Tris was the neurotic mess and Tobias called her out on it.  In Allegiant, Tobias is the basket case, which was so fascinating for me to read.  I'm such a psychology person and seeing how Tobias' worldview changed as new information was added completely reeled me in.  I think that Allegiant, like Insurgent, is also a grief book, but in a different way.  Tris was dealing with the death of her parents, and now Tobias, and everyone else, is dealing with the loss of an idea, a lifestyle.  And sometimes the consequences of that are even greater.  I loved seeing Tobias come to terms with the changes in his life, trying to reconcile his feelings about his parents, and the choices he made because of those things.  I've always felt that the romance was realistic - actual people have arguments and work through then, shocking! - and appreciated that although the setting was extraordinary, the conversations and feelings and hiccups along the way for Tris and Tobias were not.<br /><br />And then there's the ending.  If I think about the actions of the characters throughout the series, who they are as people, what they value and what they've overcome, the choices Roth made in how to conclude this novel are not surprising at all.  I understand that lots of readers are feeling entitled and upset about those choices, but not me.  I am but one reviewer, but it all makes total sense in my mind and I applaud Veronica Roth for being brave and doing what she knew was right.  After all, she's the author.<br /><br />4.5/5 for Allegiant, a huge 5/5 for the whole series.<br /><br />A gigantic thank you to Veronica Roth for giving me what has been one of the best reading experiences.  I love these characters, will always love them, and I am so grateful.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Love this album! Drake shows maturity and really reaches his audience.  Every song on the deluxe version is magnificent.  Do not pass this item up you are missing out!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|If you like Tedeschi, and I do, you will want this.  Trucks is just a bonus, but a great one.  I would buy \\"Just Won't Burn\\" first, but I have a lot of Trucks and a lot of Tedeschi in my library.  They are both great as individuals, it is good to see them put it all together.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|It's great to see a scientist telling a spiritual experience with such honesty and clarity. This book hopefully will inspire us all to seek out our authentic self and connection with the universe.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Quite possibly the most drawn out, depressing story I have ever read. I LOVED the first TWO books. The characters and the story of the society was intelligent, creative, and thought provoking. I actually thought about which faction I would choose. It was unique and intreaguing, especially to fans of Hunger Games and other such dystopian novels.<br />This story however took a horrible turn for the WORST. The story between switching narrators was rather annoying because they always switched before something good happened to keep you in suspense... But I liked the other books because they DIDN'T do this. It just annoys me that Veronica Roth would so completely change the writing style in the final book.<br />Also after the eerie feeling this book started to give me about a third of the way through, it never dissipated and culminated to what I would call the worst ending to a young adult trilogy that I have ever read.<br />As an adult female I choose to read young adult fiction to keep my reading light and cheerful, but this depressing and dark ending was horrible. It completely ruined the storyline that had been built from the first two so much that I wish I could UN-READ it and go back to my imagined ending. I would have preferred the annoying lack of ending to this depressing novel.<br />Do yourself a favor Divergent fans, don't read this novel, and only stick to the first two movies! I feel as though my hatred of the third book should not cloud my love of the first two books too much. I just hope I can still enjoy the Divergent movie coming out soon.<br /><br />Thanks a lot Veronica Roth for ruining my favorite book series. I don't care if it was your original \\"vision\\" for the storyline, times change, and that was your vision before Divergent was a best seller. It would have been in your best interest to modify the third book to meet your growing audience. But sadly instead you have likely tanked the success of the Divergent movie. I certainly won't be reading any of your other works!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I play this game a lot I love it I like to see how fast I can finish each game
006202406X|3.0|I fell in love with this series when I read Divergent in less than 24 hours, and read Insurgent just as quickly. I bought the short stories and read them in a heartbeat too. I was so excited waiting for Allegiant that I could hardly read any other books in the meantime, and let me say, what a disappointment.<br /><br />Allegiant is monotonous, not nearly as well written as Divergent, and because of the flaws in the writing, makes a poor ending. When the means justify the end, you understand, sympathize, but you know it is unnecessary, then you wonder what the author is trying to get at. Is it a shock value? Some deaths were absolutely unnecessary and just leave a sour taste in the readers's mouth. Not so nice Veronica, so after you had us fall in love with your characters.<br /><br />The POV style could have been good if I could distinguish who was who. I often had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was &#34;talking&#34; because Tris and Four had the same voice pretty much. That was disappointing, they're supposed to be quite opposite personalities in some cases.<br /><br />I was so excited to watch the movie, couldn't wait. Now I'm not even sure I can enjoy it if I watch it...
B00942Y35S|4.0|This movie surprised us with more depth. Hey, you know what its about and whats going to happen, but the characters did a great job of drawing you to the conclusions and understanding how people with real issues (or irrational) feel. Good little movie.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Fantastic movie!  I forgot that it was a kids movie while watching it. So fun! I recommend for any young kids
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|To cut to the chase, when it works, it works great.  However, despite being fairly adept at home networking, I couldn't get it to work with my Windows 7 laptops, but ironically, works fine with my iOS devices.  On those devices, it works with a limited set of apps.  Overall, it is far less useful than my Apple TV for flinging content from all my PCs and devices.  It was, however, very cheap with the Netflix promotion, so can't complain too much.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|I missed it in the theaters. Glad I waited, since I will watch it several times. However, this is the second time I tried to download or access the Ultraviolet feature of a movie I purchased. The site kept spitting me out and frustrated me to no end. The iTunes download version of The Dark Knight Rises and Star Trek In Darkness worked perfectly.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|(Actually 2-1/2 stars) Based on other works from Wan, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Finally saw it at the theater and realized, I should have waited for the rental.  Although there were a couple of decent scary moments and the storyline/plot was good, I felt there was some really good material and opportunity for potential, but those were not taken advantage of or fully explored and were allowed to die.  Without giving anything away, I thought the ending was predictable and in some cases corny.  However, all in all it was not a bad rental if you are a horror fan and enjoy Wan's work.  Just don't expect anything close to the Exorcist or Poltergeist cause you're not going to get it.  Also, it's important to note that every person is different.  Just because I didn't find it scary enough, doesn't mean others won't.  ;)
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love this CD! Justin Timberlake is awesome and he sounds great with the Tennessee Kids! You must buy this!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Quite different from the classic movie, which I love.  Didn't expect it to be gruesome, and the ending seemed to drag on forever.  I guess I'm so attached the movie adaptation. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book! It is very descriptive, but I read it in three days. I enjoyed it---a guilty pleasure indeed!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I have this tucked into the center armrest of my vehicle. I don't have a case on my iPhone so I've never had the issue some have complained about but I could see how that might be a problem.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I love this CD to add to my JT collection! I especially loved that it came with a free digital copy on my Amazon Cloud player!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It keeps me entertained whenever I have  time to kill or just want to be entertained. The colors and graphics are fun.
B00C7607BC|5.0|This DVD was better priced than in stores and I didn't have to worry about it being sold out! A true Disney classic.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it when you want to know the exact time that it is. If you are like my household, many<br />clocks tell a different time than the next clock. So this helps with that.  As far as the &#34;Alarm&#34;<br />part goes.... it did not go off when I needed it for the first few times. I think I may have gotten<br />it. Anyway, I would love to rate this a 5 ..... because I love it! I love the blue color and everything<br />else about it.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I was fairly shocked at the facts about the ,GF, factor in our everyday eating habits.  I was more interested in the MIND and the effect of GF.

B00BF11UM0|5.0|Great Movie, calling out the dedicated folks who were listening when our president said:<br /><br />&#34;Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.&#34;<br /><br />Amen.

B00BJS7104|5.0|I saw this in theater and it was, needless to say, pretty amazing. I decided then I'd someday buy it. Turns out that day has come, aaaaaand I can't really say I recommend buying it on Amazon Instant.<br /><br />I decided to dedicate my rating toward the movie itself, but as far as Instant goes: It's not a bad service, by any means, and I'd be happy to chuck more money Amazon's way, but I didn't realize the copy would have DRM locking it down. You can download it for offline viewing with the mobile app, and then there's a desktop app that does the same thing. But. That's not what I was looking for.
0545615402|5.0|I bought this product as a gift for my daughter,,because she has a great number of Harry Potter's products.As always the products and service Amazon offer to the customer is more than number one.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I immediately played through the whole CD, actually it was the digital download that amazon offers for CD purchases which only adds to the great services offered by Amazon for buying CD's. What can I say it is a really great album it is kind of all the older albums rolled into one, I love it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love books that I can read again, and this is definitely one of them.  So good, especially since I know the area she's talking about.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I purchased this as an addition to my weather app, kinda wish I hadn't now.  It's loaded with adware for other products and my security app was rather insistent that I not keep it.  Don't waste the money if you don't like saying &#34;no&#34; every time you use it.  I thought paying for the app meant I wouldn't have worry about that...
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great series! Really keeps your attention and the characters are fascinating. I have had trouble putting it down. Martin weaves a tapestry of history and fiction together superbly! Well done!
B004U7JYXS|5.0|The shopping was great. I received the film before my camera so that was good. Ummm yeah I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love the layout of the rooms and the easy transitions between the levels. i like how it goes between word clues and shadows of the objects.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I learnt very important things for business, any other business textbooks don't have.<br />This book also lights up his character, not as gossip but portrate.<br />I'm so glad to meet this book. This will be one of the most influential book in my life.<br />Thank you for Steve and Walter !
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I absolutely loved the story. It is very sad, but I just kept wanting to find out more. I went through it fast. It's so hard to think about, but it's a real problem. This book was amazing.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I had to read the book after watching the series on Netflix. The season's ending disturbed me and I wanted to know if it was based in fact. I didn't think it was, but I needed to read it for myself. I was glad to find out that the series had way over dramatized things, not that real life wasn't dramatic enough. I thought the book was really interesting and compelling, not only for her personal story, but for her insights into the system itself.
0920668372|5.0|I bought 3 copies of this book.  One for each of my grown sons, and one for myself to keep.  It so captures the extent of a mother's love.  It is a timeless story and a must have for any mother.
006202406X|4.0|First of all, I love this series. I've loved it since I read Divergent over a year ago. I gave both other books in the series five stars for how amazing they were. But in Allegiant, it really slowed down for me about 1/4 of the way through. I really reached a point where I had to push myself through. That has never happened before with Roth. Now, it could be because I was resisting what was happening in the story. It was just falling really flat for me and I was hoping that the series wouldn't go out so ... blandly. Oh, and I guess that it needs to be put out there that it is written in both Tris and Four's pov. Annoying? A little. But I can't imagine the story being written any other way. I think that it's important for us to get inside both of their heads at this point in the story and it really paid off for me in the end.<br /><br />But. Veronica Roth really reestablished my love and adoration of the Divergent story. I had lost my way in the big picture of this dystopian society but she pushed it back into focus for me. Man, she is an amazing author. And to think that she started writing this while she was in school ... I see amazing things to come for this lady and I'll be the first in line for any future works.<br /><br />Now, before I get too derailed on how awesome Roth is, there is this one quote that Tris says that I absolutely adore ...<br /><br />  \\"I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.\\"<br /><br />How awesome is that?!? I'm telling you, you've got to pick this book up.<br /><br />There's not much to say about character development, writing style or any of those other things ... Roth really sets up her stories beautifully and you become invested quite quickly in the outcome of the character's lives.<br /><br />Anyhow ...  I really can't say all that much more about the book ... there are too many things that could be given away. But I will say this ... I didn't latch onto this series because of the warm fuzzies I got while reading it. I like it because of the grittiness of the characters' feelings and the constant internal character struggle between what you should do and what you want to do. I wanted the last installment of this series to rip me to shreds and leave me just sitting there wondering what in the hell happened. Well, to say it plainly, it did. I'm still sitting here wondering how the series could be over and mulling over what took place. Now THAT, makes a great novel.r /><br />Anyhow ...

B00G24KKAS|5.0|So far I like the new series. It has more gore than last season. I didn't like it when I started watching in season one, but after a couple of episodes I really got into it and I've been hooked ever since.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is not written by a professional writer, it is an actual first hand account of the experiences of a Navy SEAL and his battle with the Taliban.  If you read it without tearing up, you are not a true American!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|When I signed up for Amazon Prime, I started watching The Good Wife from the beginning.  I am &#34;hooked&#34;, up-to-date and can't wait until the next showing.  An excellent show with an excellent cast !!!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really addictive. The prompter's voice is really creepy and really funny...the graphics are great  too. I would have given it five stars but I don't like the 30 minute wait time if you fail a level and they want you to purchase &#34;lives&#34;. I would rather have just paid a fee for the game than have to pay to move up levels...that is really annoying.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is another great King novel, a psychological thriller, best towards the end when it all comes together. Loved it, now I have to go reread the shining.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|You may not remember or know about the Sandman comics but read this startling book and you will want to experience more of the authors view of different worlds.<br /><br />I was ill and read this in a day.  Now it is time for you to read it.

0066620996|4.0|Good read, a lot to learn from and very interesting. Jim Collins research team has captured the difference between Good and Great Companies. In the book it was respectably elaborated. Great job!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I have lots of sit and wait times and this is a pleasant empty space filler.  Some are easy some not so easy.  A nice change from Match-3.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|I read this book thinking that this is full of stories about jungle book.  But them also this book is good to read with varying amount of humour and suspense. The last story was not that much good compared to the other stories. Overall this book is good for the children.
B007MG360G|5.0|Very fun and addictive.  You can play for a few minutes waiting for the bus or spend an hour happily absorbed in this game.  The controls are easy to use and kid friendly.  Although I would love to see quest challenges for this game like they have for Doodle Good HD.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This is such a good book, and a great way to lead on from the first one, though in my opinion the first one is better. if you are going to read it, you HAVE to read the first one though. i think it is an AWESOME book and a must read for anyone who's read the first one.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My son loved this movie. I also liked the fact that it was not your typical Disney movie with a princess who falls in love etc. This showed females in a more heroic light and I appreciate that.

0756407915|5.0|I have never loved, hated, feared, or respected characters in any book, like I have in the King Killer Chronicles.<br /><br />I have never been so moved, or so hurt, like I have by this book.<br /><br />The entire Novels serves to build one character, many others are developed but they all serve to build up Kvothe, the main character. and it is done beautifully.<br /><br />This book WILL be a classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I certainly waste a lot of time playing this game when I should be doing constructive things.  However, I consider it therapy and I think everyone has to spend some time doing mindless things--well not mindless because you do have to use strategy--so I suppose it is actually good for your brain, right?  Some of the levels are super hard and I end up stuck for weeks but overall it is a great game.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|You don't have a be a video game lover to love this movie.<br /><br />The Characters are as cute as they can be and you love them to death.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been using the Chromecast for two weeks as my main streaming device went ylod on me. So far it's really good, and the future of this device should be brighter. Not as easy to handle from your ipad vs the ps3 controller, but it's something.<br />I give 4 stars to the fact that I was used to stream netflix from my ps3, which is better in my opinion. If more apps/functionality is given into this device, it easily can get a 5 stars.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is a great historical fiction that shows you what government can become, and it isn't pretty.  A fast moving drama that puts you in the middle of Stalin's Russia and scares the hell out of you.<br /><br />By the way I just read 1984, and Child 44 does a better job a illustrating the spirit and mind of the government entity.(if &#34;government entity&#34; doesn't make any sense to you, read this book, you'll understand.)

B00APJLEGA|3.0|The movie just wasn't up to par with what I would expect from the Sandler crew.<br />Many of the jokes fall flat and there are not enough laughs to make up for them. It was a little heavy on the toilet humor and it didn't  have a professional feel to it, like it was a low budget movie.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Unlike other reviewers, I don't find Chris' writing difficult to read. The hardest part for me is reading all of this information knowing the author is no longer with us. Some of the war detail is amazing, some is confusing (I'm no veteran), some is vague - it's just the style of honest writing. My heart goes out to his family and I am thankful he was able to share his story with the general public before his time was up.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|As a big fan of the first book and someone who still liked the second one, I went into Allegiant really excited and optimistic. I was looking forward to Tobias's perspective, and to see what went on behind the fence. I agree with other reviewers that the largest problem in Allegiant is not the disappointing ending but the entire novel. The largest is that there is virtually no difference to Tobias vs. Tris's perspective. Like other readers I constantly had to go back and see wait, who is this again, or figure it out based on context. Second - recycled plot. There was virtually nothing surprising about the Bureau plotline, it mirrored the first two books almost to the chapter number. Next - plot and character inconsistencies (this plot is a mess from start to finish, and more than one character does a complete and ridiculous 180). To avoid spoilers I won't point them out but it was maddening while reading (Evelyn, most of all)! Finally, the ending. I am not someone who seeks the happy ending but to me it has to serve a purpose and make sense. The ending was just awful - there's no excusing it. Readers who were perhaps more deeply invested than me were devastated, and rightfully so. To be honest, it seemed obvious that's where she was going and the dual POVs serve only to carry the book forward to the end.<br /><br />Last point: [spoiler] when Tris miraculously survives the death serum I was laughing. Of COURSE she would - it started to become comical how bad this book is. Volunteering for Caleb for no real reason other than he was doing it to avoid guilt and therefore she wants to avoid her guilt? The bit about still loving him would have been far more believable if they had any tender moments after the end of the first book. But to sacrifice herself for him, when she cared infinitely more for Tobias? Entirely unbelievable from what we've learned about this character, yet totally predictable thanks to the obvious and poor writing.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't readthis book again. It's a shame because overall the first book was really fun, and I thought it could be a nice series.<br /><br />Finally, all of that when the experiment might be shut down anyway. Saving the world? Hardly. It's really hard to

006202406X|1.0|I have never written a review before so please bear with me. There are *spoilers* so beware. I read the first two books and I absolutely love them. Divergent may have been my all-time favorite book. It had everything I crave, romance, action, suspense. I reread books over and over again when I really like them. I reread the Harry potter series over 15 times since the first book was released. I have reread the Hunger Games 7 times to date. I read Divergent and Insurgent twice so far. Yesterday I finished Allegiant with the intent to reread all three when I was done with Allegiant. Now after reading Allegiant I will have to put this series away to never read again. I do not know if I am sadder about losing Tris at the end of the book or losing the whole series. I understand that the author may have wanted to write an honest book and in reality Tris probably would have died. I realize there are many series before that the main character should have died and didn't. Usually though I can trust these kinds of books especially YA books to have a happy ending. I like a happy ending. If I wanted tragedy I would read Nicholas Sparks or the newspapers. All in all I enjoyed the book up until the end. I did not want to finish it when I realized Tris was going to die. I realized it moments before said death but unfortunately I am not the type of person who cannot finish a book. I will mourn the loss of this series as I get so attached to a good story but I will never read it again nor will I ever trust this author again.<br />I am adding this note a week or so after I wrote the initial review. A week after Allegiant was released another book by the name of Horde by Ann Aguire was released. Horde is another final book YA dystopian fiction trilogy. After the complete devastation of Allegiant it was really nice to read the final installment of a good series. This book ended the right way and it was as interesting at the end as at the beginning. I only mention because the release dates were so close and they are similar in category, and yet it is amazing how one I gave one star and the other five. Veronica Roth should definitely pick up the Hunger Games, or the Enclave series, or one of the many other series out there just like it and learn how to end a trilogy. Sorry about the epic fail.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|It is an excellent movie.  As with Part I it is faithful to the graphic novel.  One thing I wish the writers had done was include the internal narration Frank Miller's Batman provided in the novel.  Overall an enjoyable viewing experience.

It's a thrill watching these two bicker like an old married couple as The Doctor & Donna Noble go across the stars in search of new worlds, & new people(or aliens, & well, trouble as it always seems to find the Timelord) It's a great series. The DVD does not include the Specials from 2008-2010, & does not include The End of Time & The End of Time Part II. It's still a great addition to any Doctor Who fan.

B00BKZUVGM|1.0|Despite a few flaws, I have enjoyed Roth's Young Adult merger of Hunger Games and Harry Potter. That is up until this book.<br /><br />It begins with such promise. The gates of the secluded city of the factioned have been opened and a whole world of developments await. Roth initial capitalizes on this well, with a semi-funny glimpse into our world through our characters eyes. And of course the origins and explanations for the whole premise (which I will not spoil here) which do not disappoint.<br /><br />What does disappoint is the lack of developing the new setting. Obviously there are going to be some new challenges, but one feels like Tris, Fourbias, and co are still in the sterile environs of Faction-city. While there are new themes and ideas of memory manipulation (and misuse) this doesn't gel well with the over-arching plot.<br /><br />Finally the story simply lacks genuine tension. Ok sure there is action, violence and  some form of teen angst and discovery, but ultimately one feels like this book is just a tired action movie with plot thrown in to try and justify its existence.<br /><br />A quick word on the ending - it seems to be that Roth has attempted to shock, or be hard-hitting and 'real-world' with the finale. My thoughts are that when the majority of the content of a story doesn't sit right a gutsy ending feels expedient and attention-seeking rather than genuine.<br /><br />In short, if you've read the prequels to this then obviously you're going to pick this book up, but perhaps by lowering expectation one may still enjoy it OR fair warning.

They appreciated the great plot, directing, and the fact that a superb movie can be made without explicit adult themes, crude language, and special effects.
1582701709|1.0|The entire book is about the so-called `law of attraction'. From beginning to end, this book is comprised of quotes from various `Living Masters' as the author calls them.<br />In essence, the book's message is, \\"Your thoughts are magnetic, and they attract the things you think about - like attracts like - hence, the name, \\"The Law of Attraction.\\" This message is made to appear newly discovered by calling it, \\"The Secret\\", but the message and all the techniques quoted, have been around in various self-help books and courses for many decades - affirmations, positive thinking, creative visualisation, etc. all teach the exact same message, and repackaging the message does not make it any more accessible or any more effective than it has been in the forms presented by hundreds of other authors over the past one hundred years or more. The message sounds exciting because of the great benefit it promises, especially seeing as it quotes a law of attraction - makes it sound like if one follows the instructions, one simply cannot fail, and in fact, this is true - what the author and her cheer leaders fail to make clear, is that like anything else, following the instructions is nowhere near as easy as it sounds. The great difficulties to be expected when attempting to apply this law, are not mentioned because the masses are after a quick fix - an instant effortless way to success - so, to pander to these masses, the truth is withheld so that they may become excited and carried away by the simplicity, speed and ease of this newly rediscovered, but ancient `secret'. In the exact same way, A New Earth creates the impression that instant enlightenment is feasible, quick and easy - give the masses the message they want to hear, even if it is not true. The obstacles to applying the law of attraction are the exact same ones one encounters when trying to apply Tolle's `non-thinking' path to instant enlightenment - in both cases, the obstacles are the very same thing you are trying tocontrol, manipulate and suppress, namely, your own thoughts. And your thoughts are extremely difficult to control, even for very short periods of time. The reason for this is very simple - you are surrounded by, and immersed in your everyday, physical reality, while at the same time, you are being bombarded by unwanted, unsolicited, negative thoughts and images both from yourself, your peers, other people in your universe, and from your environment - and these beliefs are deeply ingrained, and a permanent part of you - these beliefs are as solid and real to you as a brick wall, and simply knowing some `secret law' does absolutely nothing to the power of these beliefs. How is one supposed to hold a new, extremely weak hope (at this stage, the new information is nowhere near being a belief) alive, while one is being constantly bombarded by one's own beliefs, which tell one that this new idea is wishful thinking, and while one has to keep shifting focus onto one's day to day problems, which simply keep coming at one like an unrelenting tidal wave? This problem is not mentioned, let alone covered, because that would alienate the readers looking for and effortless, quick fix. If this `secret' worked so well, it would save countries billions in donations and food aid - simply teach the poverty-stricken nations this easy, little secret, and all the world's food problems would be solved.<br />All the cheer leaders give little pep talks and one-liners about you getting what you expect, and all you have to do is be happy and love everyone and everything, and the universe will respond by flooding your life with unlimited riches and goodness. This hyped up pep talking is nothing new, having appeared in countless guises throughout recent history - it contains traces of the truth, but commits the sin of omission because it does not present the whole picture, leaving out either by design, or due to ignorance, some absolutely critical pieces of information and steps to the process.The exclusion of this information and these steps leaves the reader to fail, and then to blame himself for his failure - because after all, it is so easy - all one has to do is believe, right? Wrong - it is neither that simple, nor that easy - what applies to, and works for a handful of `Living Masters', does not necessarily apply to mankind in general - it is did, we would all be successful `winners', but obviously, this is not the case.<br /><br />The reader is advised to start his day by thanking the universe one hundred times for the abundance in his life. The author also reports that we speak to ourselves about 60,000 times per day - now, with a negative person, that would be 60,000 negative messages per day - so, exactly how much impact is 100 \\"Thank you for the abundant universe\\" statements every morning going to make, when immediately cancelled by 60,000 complaints about the crappy universe?<br /><br />To excite (con) the reader, some self-serving lies are thrown in, for example, it is first stated that the universe is completely unbiased, and will therefore give you whatever you ask. Then it is stated that the universe is extremely biased, being hundreds of times more likely to grant a positive request. \\"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive\\" (Sir Walter Scott).<br /><br />Then one cheerleader states that it has been scientifically proven that positive thoughts are hundreds of time more powerful than negative thoughts. Now, no explanation is given about how the power of positive versus negative thoughts were compared scientifically, neither is any reference given for one to examine this claim. Many dishonest authors use such ploys, because the vast majority of people accept things at face value. Like the dishonest advertising one hears every day; \\"Clinically proven!\\" \\"Tested by a leading university!\\" \\"The one most doctors recommend!\\" - completely meaningless statements with one purpose, and one purpose only - to con the gulliblecustomer. Common sense, the evidence of one's own eyes and one's own experiences shows this claim to be false. Nothing to do with human beings is simple, and a very large part of the reason for this complexity is because no two people are the same, think the same, or react the same to the same stimulus. But for the sake of simplicity, let us imagine for the moment, that we have only two kinds of people - those that are 100% positive - the eternal optimists, and those that are 100% negative - the eternal pessimists. Now, let's take the previous statement that a positive thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought: For the eternal optimist, this is true because a positive thought is in tune with his 60,000 other positive, daily thoughts, so it is instantly accepted, and resonates within that person.<br /><br />For the eternal pessimist, this statement is false, because a positive thought clashes with his 60,000 other, daily thoughts - it is not believed, therefore it will not even be considered before being summarily rejected. An example of this type of situation is where the author says that obese people should stop thinking fat thoughts.  Now, these people are their obese bodies twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. They feel their feet, ankles, knees and back aching from the abuse of constant overload. They have to stop at each landing of a flight of stairs to catch their breath. Everytime they look in the mirror they see with disgust and despair their reality. Their family, friends and colleagues constantly comment on their weight. They have tried and suffered through every diet they have ever heard of, and their every waking thought is about the embarrassment of their appearance. And the author's advice is, \\"Stop thinking fat thoughts\\"?!<br />Of course, not all people are 100% positive, or 100% negative, but the same principle applies - unsuccessful people, who have been struggling all their lives, enduring circumstances and jobs they despise, are in that situation because they are predominantly negative thinkers - and who buys self-help books? People who are unhappy with their lives - those very same predominantly negative thinkers<br /><br />The Secret correctly points out what people are doing wrong, and thus sabotaging themselves - what it fails to address is the root cause for this self-damaging behaviour - this is completely ignored, and readers are treated as if they are all alike, and will all respond identically to this `one size fits all' approach.<br /><br />Simply knowing that there is a way out, does not get one out. In fact, even knowing the way out does not get one out - one has to take the way out, in order to get out. Now, in the absolute first place, one has to know the way out - the technique to achieve freedom from one's default thoughts - this is not presented - instead one is given to understand that simply ignoring one's thoughts, in fact, denying one's thoughts, will free one from them - this is wishful thinking at its best - the lazy man's way to enlightenment - akin to, \\"Sleep yourself fit\\"<br /><br />If the author:<br />Really believed that the law of attraction was infallible, do you think she would deceive her readers in the way I have shown above:<br />* Pretending that her book contained not just a secret, but THE Secret, when all it contains is old, stale ideas?<br />* Lying about the universe being 100% unbiased, yet greatly biased in favour of positive thoughts?<br />* Lying about having scientific proof that positive thoughts are much more powerful than negative thoughts? Of course, no proof is presented, and neither can any be--ask any scientist, and after he stop laughing, he will tell you that there is no scientific instrument capable of measuring the power, frequency, duration, polarity, subject matter, or even the existence of thoughts.<br />Well, do you believe the author would use such negative, dishonest tactics is she really believed that she would be attracting negative consequences to herself? Of course she would not. So the fact that she has employed such dishonest tactics and that instead of negative consequences, they have attracted to her positive consequences in the form of a huge amount of money, means that the law of attraction does not work the way she claims it does, and that she knows that it does not--so, another lie.<br /><br />Not only does the author's behaviour show how dishonest she is, it also provides perhaps the most glaring proof that this whole law of attraction story is a con, and does not operate the way the author claims. The author and her gang of cheerleaders are unable to explain the operation of the law of attraction, because firstly, what is driving the entire process is not the law of attraction--they don't even have the name right--that is because they have seen some symptoms of the process, and have confused these symptoms with the underlying cause. These people cannot explain the process because they don't understand it--but that does not stop them from making a lot of money from pretending that they understand it. In the very first place, calling it \\"the law of attraction\\" reveals a complete ignorance of what is taking place. After reading You Are Free by John Richard, one understands that the process is one of creation, of which attraction is but one component--there are a number of other components, and each and every one of these is components is analysed and explained. If, instead of the so-called law of attraction, one applies the law of creation, it immediately becomes clear how the author (and the authors of the other two books I analyse in this context) can be so dishonest with her readers, yet in spite of that, make a fortune.<br /><br />Still not convinced--still desperate to cling to your belief in the law of attraction? Ok, then consider this:<br />* If positivity, caring and honesty attract positive consequences, why are so many billions of honest, decent, caringpeople either dirt poor, or struggling to make ends meet?<br />* If negativity, uncaring and dishonesty attract negative consequences, why are most of the richest people on the planet those who are prepared to exploit, deceive, rob, plunder and make the lives of billions of people a living hell?<br />Still not convinced? Then I give up. According to the law of attraction to which you so desperately cling, your ignorance should attract lots more ignorance--good luck with that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is easy to learn, fun to play, but can be addicting! Some of the levels cab be quite challenging and will require you to use some strategy, but that keeps it from getting boring.
0452289963|1.0|The writing style lacks a structured flow, which makes his book really difficult to read, so much so, that a number of people of my acquaintance, have started the book, and then decided not to finish it at all. This lack of logical flow has the author saying the same things over and over, for page after page, and reaching conclusions, seemingly out of nowhere, because he does not explain his sources, or the thinking processes which lead him to those conclusions - most of these conclusions are simply presented as pronouncements from the `Authority'.<br /><br />The author writes in esoteric-sounding terms, using extremely vague language, so as to create the impression that he is operating at some exalted level from which he can talk down to his readers, many of whom, according to the author, are simply too unintelligent to understand his message--although, true to form, he insults these readers in vague terms by stating that those who do not understand him are not ready for enlightenment. Saying in effect, \\"Any lack of understanding is due to your inability to rise to my level, not my inability to stoop to yours.\\" After all, he wants these unintelligent people to buy his book so that they have the chance to read it, profess to understand it, and thus prove that they are not too unintelligent after all. Being completely unable to explain himself (perhaps because he is not yet ready to understand himself? Or perhaps because he has switched off his thinking mind, as he instructs his disciples to do?), he waffles on and on page after page, chapter after chapter saying nothing of any substance whatsoever, leaving the reader's head spinning, thinking, \\"What! What is he saying?\\" For example, he speaks at great length about `enlightenment', referring to it as `enlightenment', `awakening' and `salvation', but offers no definition of this term so that his readers might recognise this state if they stumbled upon it. This is especially important because the word `enlightenment' is a word in everyday use, and could have infinite shades of meaning. Instead the subject is covered in the vaguest terms possible, so that a thousand different readers might have a thousand different interpretations of what the author's version of enlightenment is. One only has to read the book reviews to see how confused, intolerant and dogmatic his disciples are--yet, just like their master, completely unable to explain his philosophy in anything remotely resembling practical terms. One of these disciples told me that the message is extremely simple and can be conveyed in one single sentence. Well, then why on earth does the author need more than four hundred pages to write this one sentence? And why does the author need to write book after book after book to convey this simple, one sentence message?<br />Tolle tells his disciples that the ego is the great enemy, yet he simply cannot prevent his own ego from trying to inflate his image even more by giving his story one more tweak here and one more tweak there. The problem with this little ego trip is that it gets him into a few holes from which he cannot escape. One such hole is first claiming to have been a regular person just like the rest of us before his spontaneous enlightenment--so regular in fact, that he sank into deep depression. But he simply could not resist claiming to have read Stephen Hawking's mind while he (Tolle) was still just a regular, unenlightened person. This little(!) slip of the ego generates some very interesting possibilities:<br />* He was never like us--he has always had special abilities,<br />* Operating at this exalted level, brought on, or at the very least, could not prevent his severe depression,<br />* If he was always at this higher level than the rest of us, then either his story of spontaneous enlightenment is a lie, or this spontaneous enlightenment raised him to an even higher level,<br />* If he could read such a brilliant mind as Stephen Hawking, he might be implying thathis own mind was even more brilliant,<br />* If his mind was more brilliant than Stephen Hawking even before he became enlightened, one can only imagine how far ahead of Stephen Hawking he is now. Small wonder he cannot understand his own thoughts well enough to explain them,<br />* He is simply lying about being able to read Stephen Hawking's mind.<br />\\"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive\\" (Sir Walter Scott).<br />Another example of his out of control ego getting him into a deep hole, is when he claims to be smarter than God--but, I'll get to that shortly.<br /><br />Tolle seems to be trying to suggest that enlightenment is an aloof, indifference from a perspective above one's thoughts, denying them and spending one's life in this state of denial [the only way I have ever achieved this (I want to say `experienced this' but in fact, one does not experience this mindless state - one realises that one has experienced it only after the event - but during the event, that part of one that records (consciously) the experience, is switched off, so one does not experience it, nor can one describe it) this thoughtless state, is doing meditation, where the conscious mind switches off. Sometimes, after repeated (in the same day) sessions of meditation, there is a lethargic, mental indifference, which lasts for hours, during which time one's rational mind is not fully on, and one's rational thinking is impaired - this is not an unpleasant state, but is not conducive to performing one's daily duties effectively. First of all, this state is not accessible by merely realising, \\"I am not this body, etc.\\" - this does not switch off your thinking mind - it takes much, much more than that, which is why the ancients invented meditation, and why adepts meditate for most of their day for many years - if simply knowing they were not their thoughts (which they know first-hand) were enough to cause enlightenment, then why would they meditate away years of their lives? Secondly, because we have daily duties and obligations, walking around in a half-minded stupor with our rational minds switched off, is counter-productive and dangerous.<br /><br />Similar ideas have surfaced throughout history, but the situations in which these have been applied have been very different to a modern, Western lifestyle. Practitioners who did not have families to support, mortgages to pay, and who could retreat from the world of daily stress, into monasteries and isolated mountain caves where they would meditate for twelve to eighteen hours a day for years on end to stop their thoughts. Even without all our possessions, responsibilities and lifestyle, these people could not simply stop their thoughts as Tolle suggests - so to imagine that we can do so, is a complete denial of reality. Furthermore, to state that simply realising that we are not our thoughts, puts us on the path to enlightenment, is just plain nonsense, because it does nothing to alter the constant relentless onslaught of millions upon millions of thoughts throughout any given day.<br /><br />The author talks about the importance of living in the now, and not in the past or future, and that the future never comes, because when it does, it is simply now again. Again, this is meant to make him sounds so clever, but it is in fact impossible, because every decision one makes now, has an impact on a future now, and when that impact occurs, it occurs because of one's analysis of information from a past now - time never stops. So, long before one has finished analysing new information, that information has become part of the past, and by analysing that past information, in order to make a decision, one is living in both the past and the future, because the outcome of one's decision now, will of necessity manifest itself in the future. Simply put, we are in time, and we cannot escape from it, and playing silly, pedantic games with words serves only to confound people but has no practical value at all.<br /><br />Not satisfied to portray himself as a higher being than us mortals, Tolle portrays himself as the new messiah, but not just the new messiah, the new, improved messiah, because he says that he is not making the same mistake that Jesus made--or, if you believe that God sent Jesus, then Tolle is saying that he is not making the same mistake that God made: Tolle claims to be appointed to deliver the exact same message as Jesus, but states that whereas Jesus delivered his message at the wrong time, he is delivering the message at exactly the right time. The ramifications of this claim are simply astounding:<br />We have two basic premises to consider:<br />1. Jesus was sent by God<br />2. Jesus was not sent by God<br />If Jesus was sent by God, either:<br />1. God made a mistake, sending His son at the wrong time<br />2. God sent His son at the wrong time on purpose--to prepare the way for Tolle 2,000 years later<br />If Jesus was not sent by God, then:<br />1. Of what value is this message?<br />2. Tolle claims to bring the exact, same message, therefore his message is also not from God.<br />One can almost imagine Tolle telling God, \\"Listen dad, don't screw up again like you did with Jesus--don't waste my time by sending me before my disciples are ready.\\"<br />Tolle cannot have it both ways--he cannot claim to bring a message from almighty God, then claim that this almighty God makes mistakes which automatically disqualifies him from being almighty God, and hence, automatically disqualifies Tolle's message from being from almighty God.<br />\\"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive\\" (Sir Walter Scott).<br /><br />Or, one can save a huge amount of time, cut through all the nonsense, and ask the obvious, logical question: If we were meant to ignore out thoughts, why do we have rational, thinking minds, designed to do nothing other than think--did our Creator make a (another) mistake?<br />Or why did we evolve rational, thinking minds if we did not need them?<br /><br />Surely, the quickest and surest way of achieving the mindless state waffled about by the author, would be to have a lobotomy--that would put an end to that damned thinking once and for all.

1610390938|5.0|Banerjee and Duflo write beautifully. This book is an easy read that summarizes an astounding number of studies of the microeconomics of poverty in developing countries. Despite not having one single sweeping conclusion, the authors manage to synthesize the literature into a compelling and insightful narrative of the lives of the very poor. The authors use almost no economic jargon and yet are able to accurately convey important and sophisticated economic concepts. It is quite a feat to be able to write in a way that can be understood and enjoyed by people with no background in economics as well as PhD economists.<br /><br />I had heard about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in development economics. This book improved my view of them substantially; while I had a prior as to their usefulness, my prior was not very well informed. While it is true that the trials are not replicable and require external validity, Banerjee and Duflo are acutely aware of this limitation. Furthermore, many of the experiments are reproduced in other settings suggesting that much of the time the results do have external validity. When a seemingly similar experiment yields different results, the hope is that there is something to be learned from that. Banerjee and Duflo discuss cases of both types.<br /><br />I do worry that the very high cost of running such experiments may narrow the set of researchers that are able to publish development studies in the top academic journals. As such, we may be narrowing the range of viewpoints (e.g., macroeconomic perspectives) on development. I hope development economists working on RCTs continue to be open to other approaches of looking at development.<br /><br />Perhaps the most useful insight I took away from the book is the point that a lot of the same behavioral biases that cause the poor to make suboptimal decisions are shared by people in rich countries. How many times have you heard someone overweight, or who smokes, or who doesn't save enoughfor their retirement complain that the poor still have flatscreen TVs? The consequences of biases in decision-making and the processing of information are just much more severe for the poor. Rich people simply don't have many life or death choices (e.g., whether to purify drinking water) in their daily lives. This is a crucial point and should enable us to think about poverty with a little more compassion.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has even a passing interest in poverty and development.
B000023VR6|5.0|I wasn't too particular about the skits. I did love every song.<br /><br />Overall this album is better than &#34;The Chronic.&#34;
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't understand why everyone is so angry. Veronica decided to write it the way she did because she wanted us to understand what was going on in Tobias's head. To me, I think they should have had thier point of view to be similar because they were in love and therefore, were one flesh. Sh even states that sh wishes she was a part of him instead of her own individual. The reason she kills off Tris is because she wants to keep it interesting. As nerdy as this may sound, I will mournn over Tris, just as Tobias is, but I'm not mad at Veronica for finishing  the series the way she did. Who knows, maybe Tris isnt dead after all, and Veronica is in the midst of writing a fourth book... ;)
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|To me, this is the best new music since Gun n Roses and Bjork.  I love her voice and singing.  As an audiophile though, other than vocals, the instruments sound like they are all electronic (and not in a nice Moog way).  I wish they had used real instruments since I don't like the sound of these instruments when listening on a high resolution system (it's not too harsh of a sound, but sounds like some square waves are used, etc.).  Most people will probably not hear the difference between these keyboards and real drums, bass, etc.  I don't know whether the lack of instruments and musicians was a corporate decision driven by greed and the low fidelity MP3 market or whether they did not know better.  But overall, this is some great stuff and my best music buy in a while.  I hope that she can be as creative on the next album (take your time, don't let them push you) and that they can afford real musicians on real instruments.<br />Don't let my discriminating ear dissuade anyone - even audiophiles should get this album if they like the samples - I love this music.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book! I'm glad he finished something that he started such a long time ago. Like always Mr.King didn't disappoint.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|It's all absolutely amazing. At times stars fill the room and invade your space so that you can almost reach out and grab them. But one scene in particular just blew my mind. At about 14:30 minutes into the video the shuttle's robotic arm juts totally out of the screen in the most jaw dropping and spectacular 3D effect I have ever seen. I have a projector and a 200 inch diagonal viewing surface. So this is a giant robotic arm that stretches out across the room (it's probably as big as the actual shuttle arm). It extends out across the full length of the room all the way to where I'm sitting 14 feet away. I can raise my foot from the recliner and \\"touch\\" it. I've never experienced anything like that with 3D before.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I liked this movie because it offered more about Khan's story and had good effects.  It has the same cast.  Still had funny banter between bones, spok, and kirk.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|Darling truck but the mirrors and other small pieces will be broken off by the end of the day I am sure.  This is for a child who takes care of his toys and doesn't play too hard with them.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game and play for hours.  I have started having trouble visiting friends and sending gifts to friend.  It just shut down and reload when I try to visit.  Help please.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have had this around two months. I am an android phone user and I have an Ipad Gen 3 tablet so I can Facetime with my friends while traveling. This is the perfect solution for keeping them both charged when driving around. Typically I have a 30-40 minute drive to the airport and this is an ideal charger to keep everything juiced up. The fit and finish is nice. The packaging was good quality. Not fancy or flashy but enough to protect the charger during shipping. I will be purchasing a second one soon so I can leave one in my car and keep one in my travel bag. I originally thought I would want one in black, but the bright white color stands out in the rentals and has kept me from forgetting it more than once.
B002PYW26O|2.0|I saw this many years ago and thought I'd enjoy seeing it again.  I guess my tastes have matured as much as I have in the last 15 years.  It doesn't quite have the appeal at 70 as it did at age 55!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought into all the hype and bought one of these ... Mistake! It dropped connection or froze up more than I could stand (during several Netflix movies too) but the last straw was: it interfered with my Mohu Leaf antenna. I discovered this by accident during one of several &#34;Chromecast Can't be found&#34; dropped connections that had me plugging and unplugging the unit. When it was plugged in to my TV it was static city and clear HD when unplugged. I sent it back. My suggestion: buy a Blue Ray that has wifi. Google rushed this to market and has the public beta testing for them ...No Thanks!
B000NV55RY|5.0|This horror-comedy by Roman Polanski stars the beautiful (and soon to be murdered) Sharon Tate. Production quality is very high for a movie of this type, and Ferdy Mayne puts in a performance worthy of Christopher Lee as the vampire Count Krolock.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Much better than the book! I really liked it and there were some seat on the edge of the chair moments for me (very unusual for me)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I loved playing this on Facebook.... NOW I CAN TAKE IT WITH ME ANY WHERE!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!<br />Also this game is addictive... I was so happy when I got th email from Amazon... and what took so long. But still....SO EXCITED!!!!!!!
B00F5FBE82|2.0|I love DRAKE...but, not feeling this MIAMI VICE sound of the 80's! Sorry. The last 2 albums are his best.<br />Wish him continue success, this album is NOT my favorite at all.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I LOVE this movie. The last time I had seen it was on a recorded from TV VHS probably 20 years ago.  The quality of the dvd was quite good for not having been updated digitally and it was everything that I remembered.  Thank you so much! I am very excited to add this to our family DVD collection of favorites. It's a MUST SEE.
0156034026|4.0|A focussed and relentless narrative of the travails of rootlessness, faith, and fate.  Very readable. Puts you in the heart and mind of someone \\"other\\".  It reminds me of The Confusion of Stones\\" by Marwan Hassan, which is in my view better written.  \\"Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is not the best title --- this man is not yet a fundamentalist but rather someone reacting exponentially to his life so far.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved hearing about life from a dog's point of view. The information on auto racing was interesting. Good reading!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie. Perfect halloween movie. I can not wait until they remake it. Just hope it is as good as this one or even better.

B0028R3NCU|5.0|This micro sd card reader is a lot better than my old sandisk m2 that broke within 2 months. This one is made out of metal while the m2 was made out of plastic.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I bought this for my sister and she loved it she watches it all the time and i came earlier then expected
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game and it is very challenging. I play it every day and it keeps my mind sharp.
B003ZFVI8U|5.0|Absolutely hands down the best band ever.  LOVE them live.  I will see them 3 times in Nov. I cant wait
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|First let me say  I really like this mouse. It looks great with my Deck 82 Blue LED Keyboard and my Nostromo, Blue LED Gamepad. The software, which i had to download from their web site was easy and intuitive to use. The quality and features for a $40 mouse was awesome!  Programmable colors and keys, braided cable, and I have been using it for 8 months and it still works and looks as good as new.  So why 3 stars?  For me it has a serious design flaw. The thumb rest is curved so that when i try to pick up the mouse, my thumb slides right up into the thumb keys. I noticed that no one else has mentioned it, but I cannot figure out anyway to over come this except to grip the mouse with my thumb on the very bottom edge of the mouse, forcing me into a claw grip rather than my preferred palm grip. I gave this 8 months and cannot go on, I'm looking for a new mouse.<br />By the way shortly after purchasing this I bought an Anker Verticle Mouse for work and love it.<br /><br />P.S. Anker offered a full refund, but since I felt the quality of the mouse was good and there was no deception on their part (I knew what I was getting), I couldn't take it. I just hope they take this into consideration for future designs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing! It is very fun and addictive. I'm so glad it finally came out for the kindle, I have been waiting for months.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is sooo fun with the hills moon lava. It has all this cool stuff like the race car.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like that this is an easy accurate weather app. I love that it is specific to the area you live. It's a great app, reasonably priced worth every cent!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I would recommend this book.  The book had a great story line and was well written.  The story will capture your interest from the  beginning through the end.
B0000009XP|5.0|Can anyone put a name on an album more powerful and with more heart and soul than this........I think this should be required listening in school music programs, elevators, nursing homes, malls, blasting from blimps at sporting events . This is a man, his voice ,and his guitar. I still get goose bumps when Buddy turns  it up to 11 which he does soooooo well. .Why music like this with soul and character is still relegated to the back eddy's is beyond me.  Im glad im still floating along in my little Johnboat with that BIG BIG smile on my face. mylee who????  Thank You Mr. Guy!!!!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Although the movie is good, the quality of the HD was not good at all.  It was fuzzy and not smooth
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad there is finally Candy Crush available for Kindle! I have been waiting for so long. The game is very addictive and the colors are so bright! My 4 year old likes playing too :)
B00007KWHG|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this CD.  It has every song that I remember listening to by Frankie Valli back in the day.  Great addition to my collection.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book, easy read!!! Stephen King is at his best, and darker than ever...highly recommend for fans of The Shinning and Stephen King.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just the right amount of challenge.  Love the power-ups. The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have is that it makes you ask people for help or you have to pay to advance, but that's all games now.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|we went to see this in the drive in theater (yes we still have one). It is like a bad video game. No plot and horrible acting. I fell asleep and didn't miss much! The only thing I regret is staying up for the ending...that is 2 hrs of my life I won't get back!!<br /><br />My 13 yr old autistic son was the only one that liked it in our group!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love My Horse.  I think it is really good because you do not have to spend money.  I also like it because my friend plays it as well.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I have been telling every one of the snippets on the history of this company. Fascinating how one man can change the lives of so many, with a laser sharp focus on the customer
1439156816|5.0|Real. Truthful. Inspiring. And disturbing as only Stephen King can be. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn the craft.
038536315X|5.0|I love ALL of John Grisham's books.  I pre-ordered this book several months ago.  I only received it two days ago and have not started reading it.  But I know I will enjoy every page when I do get it read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy the game. I wish I didn't have to wait to get more lives. otherwise I am addicted ;)
B002PNJ9QQ|4.0|Sidney and River worked well together in this film. The story was good and I felt for the characters. I liked the fact that Sidney had a love interest played by the talented Loretta Devine. Recommended for all Poitier fans.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I really liked this movie but prefer to watch on netfix, because I'm older and I am hard of hearing. On Amazon I could not get subtitles while on netflix that was not a problem
B008AVXGA2|5.0|I bought Firebird: Adventure One for my younger son, and it is now his new favourite book. This from a young boy who is most likely to be found on some computer device or watching the likes of Power Rangers on TV.<br /><br />Julia Gousseva has taken a traditional Russian fairy tale and brought it to life for a whole swathe of new readers from all over the world. I am not familiar with Russian folklore, but this book has certainly made me want to read more.<br /><br />The story itself is absolutely charming, about brother and sister Alex and Katie who go and stay with their rather odd Aunt Karina when their mother and father have to go away on a trip.<br /><br />The language is really engaging, as are the characters and the more magical beings in the story, the nasty witch Baba Yaga and the beautiful Firebird whose feathers heal.<br /><br />Firebird: Adventure One totally captivated my boy (and me!) and it is truly a wonderful, delightful thing to find such a good tale to snuggle up with, and watch a little one's eyes grow wider and ask what you think is going to happen next.<br /><br />Colourful, new and eminently engaging, I can highly recommend this book for both younger and older readers.<br /><br />And the most important question, 'which was your best bit?' (which is what my son always wants me to ask him) - without doubt, the Firebird. And the painting through which brother and sister step to enter into another realm. And then, 'can we get one of those in our house, mummy?'<br /><br />Perfect!
B007REV4T8|5.0|EXCELLENT JAMES BOND OUTING ON THIS ONE...I AM A LIFE LONG 007 FAN AND THIS MOVIE IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BETTER ONES THE ACTION IS SUPERB.
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|The figure looks great but i also received an opened package, so its useless for collectors and also the blue meth was missing.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Writing was rushed. Plot development sketchy at best. I still haven't come up with any good reason for Roth's \\"bold\\" ending - It was a good reason for me to NEVER purchase another book by her. I've been saddened by the endings of other books, enough to carry tissues around with me the whole next day - this ending didn't make me sad. It made me angry! I spent the following day in a bad mood and I'm still not over it. It was senseless and left so many strings untied that I feel cheated by the author. I won't be purchasing, let alone reading another book by Roth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the bomb its better than any other running obstacle games. if I could recommend a game it would be this one. it will keep you satisfied
1847940323|5.0|I bought this book because it was required reading for one of my grad school classes. I'm very glad I read it though. It was a very engaging and interesting book.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|well I like the game but if you fail a level 5 times you have to wait 20 minutes just to try the level one more time
006202406X|4.0|I was shocked by the heated reviews that came so soon after the book was released. Seems most of the negative reviews are readers who are angry by how Roth handled the relationship of the main characters. What has been lost is plot commentary and there is plenty to talk about. Some spoilers ahead...<br /><br />This is the final book in the Divergent Trilogy. A story about a dystopian Chicago that has been turned into a genetic experiment, one of several in that part of the United States. In the final book our heroes find themselves outside the walls of the city and face to face with the scientists who have been watching their every more. They learn of the country's history of genetic wars and are told that their city has been the most successful of all experimental cities to date. What they also find, however, is that the behavior of those outside the city is as bad, if not worse then those within. Citizens have been divided into genetically pure (divergent) and genetically damaged (everyone else). Tris and friends have escaped one revolution and have stumbled into yet another as the damaged, like the factionless, are preparing to rise up.<br /><br />Unlike the two previous books, Allegiant is told in alternating voices. We hear from both Tris and Tobias. Roth does not handle the change of voice well, and as many reviewers have noted, the voices sound alike and it is often difficult to remember which character is speaking. I found it very difficult to read Tobias' view as I had already created a voice for him in my head. I found Four to be weak which did not match his character from the two previous books.<br /><br />There is an influx of new characters and a dropping of those from the previous books. I believe that Roth made a huge mistake when she left rich characters such as Marcus and Evelyn behind in favor of new one dimensional villains. There were so many rich characters in the two previous books and we simply lost them. Even those who left the city with Trisand Tobias (Peter, Christine, Caleb) were left behind as we saw so little of their personalities.<br /><br />The story concept was very strong but Roth tried to handle too much in one book and lost the magic that made the Divergent series so wonderful. I did give it 4 starts because I thought that the story concept was sound, just handled badly, and the book is worth reading for those new concepts introduced. The divergent books could have been extended beyond three and this would have allowed Roth to incorporate the new ideas solidly into the story line.<br /><br />I would have preferred 3.5 stars so I rounded up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its tha bomb. It keeps everyone entertained. it keeps children busy and keeps the adult more busy. the challenges are great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. My dad likes to watch Youtube on his nexus, but it was always too small for him and has to squint his eyes. So I bought this so he can stream it to the big screen. So far he spends about 3-5 hours a day watching Youtube on the Chromecast. Bought another one to put in my parents' room.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Thrilled to own this album. Jame Labrie's vocals remain stellar, and Mike Mangini shines on the skins. While Images and Words will always and forever be my favorite DT album, I think I've found my new second-favorite.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|If you're a Stewart fan, you'll like this album.  It's a bit nostalgic in its sound and it seems his heart is in this album...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for challenging the mind. Wish there was more levels. Can't wait until they get more levels. I played this against my son as a challenge to see who could find the clues faster to get to the next level.
B00FN811SY|5.0|An excellent app useful for any bible teacher or student for that matter.  Now I don't have to pull out 5 different versions of the bible to compare verses.  They're all right at your fingertips.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book was good but not the great big bang of an ending like I hoped for. Everyone hates it because they didn't get the fairtale ending they wanted. Of course I was hoping for a different ending but I still enjoyed it. This book was no t as good as the first two and didn't have me not wanting to put it down. I almost didn't read it after the reviews but am too emotionally invested to not know how it ended. Even though I was somewhat let down ( and probably wont sleep well for awhile) I recommend people to finish this series and have your own opinion of it.
B000T433CO|5.0|Winter in Utah and the Holidays drawing near, I look forward to viewing this movie many times. I enjoy it immensely. Let it snow.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I've never looked at historical employment/unemployment and skills/demand data that way.<br />It was insightful and thought provoking.<br />It's also short & sharp, no waffling on. Great read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game its highly addictive can't stop playing even got my husband playing. now he is into the game also
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is Stephen King at his best!  He is just like wine... gets better with age.  What can I say that others have't already said... It is funny, suspenful, dramatic, magical and fast paced.  Less words... more action!  There is not a single borring part.  One question I do have for Mr. King.  Is this a new trend?  Will you write a continuation of Duma Key (my personal favorite).  That would be absolutly wonderful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best puzzle game ever....I`m in 290 level and going up....I really love it.... addicting...uffff I can not stop
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br /><br />I waited a month for the name of this book to come out. I waited another month for the cover to come out. I waited six months for Allegiant to come out.<br /><br />I thought that Allegiant would be the best out of the trilogy, but my assumption was proven wrong. Roth, while she may be an aspiring, talented author, really must have let her fans down in this book. I opened to the first page excited for what awaited me, and by the time I completed Alleigant, all I wanted to do was throw my Kindle at a wall,but then I took an arrow to the knee. (Just kidding)<br />It was quite ironic how even though there were many kissing scences throughout the book between Tris and Four, the novel as a whole lacked any real romance.<br />After reading both Divergent and Insurgent, I was positive that Allegiant would turn out just as good. The ending leaves you with too many questions. There should have been some form of resolution between the GDs (or GPs, I'm not sure) who still ached for war. Literally, the only reason you should read this book is so you can finish the trilogy. It would be much better if you made up a seperate ending.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|a  lot of people have watched dumb ways to die on YouTube The biggest surprise for me was that is was created by metro.<br />still they do more like create an app just for train safety and i think that is amazing. its a great app that you will enjoy.<br />I cant wait to see what metro does next
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  So happy it's on kindle now.  Being on a larger screen really helps.  Very addictive!!  One of the best games out there.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't know this game will be that addictive...it's fun and even the kids can play. CANDY CRUSH you done a great job.
B00F8OUBXE|3.0|This CD is full of chunky guitar riffs and blistering solos by Kurt Vanderhoof and Rick Van Zandt; innovative, powerful, and at times complex drumming by Jeff Plate, who also locks it down tight with bassist Steve Unger; and let's not forget vocalist Ronny Munroe, who REALLY steps it up - those folks who have felt for years that it's just not a TRUE Metal Church album without David Wayne's unique vocal stylings (I've been guilty of this myself) will be happily surprised - Mr. Munroe sings with a conviction and passion that fits perfectly with the intensity of the songs, and his upper register wails and shrieks are right out of the Wayne handbook, which puts him in elite company. He has really found his niche on this record, and has never sounded better. That being said there are however flaws with this CD !!!Songs like \\"Scream\\", \\"Dead City\\" and \\"Jump The Gun\\", no matter how often I listen to them , just don't do it for me musically and or lyrically (the lyrics are really weak on these songs). Now the rest of the CD -- really is awesome and fun to listen to and is very reminiscent of old Metal Church, from the first Cd and \\"The Dark\\" era. Which is what I was hoping for when I bought this CD. Songs like \\"Bulletproof\\",\\"Generation Nothing\\", Noises in the Wall\\", \\"Suiciety\\" and \\"The Media Horse\\" , will have you clamoring for more !!!!!!
006202406X|1.0|While I know that everyone is fuming about the ending, to me, the ending is the strongest part of the book... And that's really saying something.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that the Divergent series (until now) was my Harry Potter. There was nothing I cared about more than these books. I've re-read Divergent and Insurgent more times than I can count. And at first, when I started reading Allegiant, I thought that maybe that was why I didn't like it. Maybe I had been waiting too long, maybe I had too high of expectations... But after getting half-way through the book, I realized that that wasn't it at all. The book is just plain bad. Like, really, really not good. The characters' voices sound absolutely nothing like they did in the previous books. They are completely and utterly unrecognizable. And, while I was first thrilled at the idea of dual chapters between Tris and Tobias, I quickly realized that there was absolutely no difference in their voices. I'd be reading a Tobias chapter and think it was Tris, and so on. It got to the point where I thought that this book must be written by someone else. That was the only explanation for why it was so different and bad compared to the other two books (which are flawless in my eyes). But alas, it was actually written by Roth, which leaves a hole in my gut. I couldn't even finish the book, it was that bad. I didn't care about the characters anymore because they weren't the characters I cared about before.<br /><br />But besides the characters, the story was full of more plot holes than plot lines. It was repetitive, monotone, boring, and lifeless. There was way too much going on for it's own good and it asked more questions than it answered. So after desperately trying to like this book and failing miserably, I quit and skipped to the end, just to find out how she concluded a series that was once so dear to my heart. And once I realized what happened, I wasn't even mad. I think Tris' actions at the end of the book are the only thing in the entire novel that stay true to character.<br /><br />So basically, I made this review to say that we need to stop focusing on the ending as the only bad point of this book. Truth be told, the book was a wreck from the first chapter and a shocking ending doesn't change that. It's not a matter of being upset and sad over the end, it's a matter of good versus bad writing. And while the first two books were phenomenal, this book was anything but that.<br /><br />It's with a heavy heart that I say R.I.P to the Divergent series that I once loved more than anything else. Veronica Roth, I don't know what happened when you were writing this book, all I know is that I wish you'd never wrote it at all.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|As an Amazon manager, I can tell you that this book is extremely accurate regarding the culture. I can also tell you that I am professionally fulfilled and proud of my company. This book is proof that Amazon has the ability to reinvent itself and compete in multiple markets and industries. It is remarkable how far the company has come in just under 20 years...and it is still Day One.<br /><br />The story is inspiring and the author was very forthright. It was well-written and I strongly recommend reading it.
B00FRBMA8W|5.0|This collection of short stories, as I see it, is about relationships and circumstance. Some stories are written in the language of feelings and subtle touches, an imagery that borders on the tactile, like in \\"Autumn leaves\\" and \\"Alone.\\" Some stories are the \\"What if?\\" scenarios, like the \\"Land of our Fathers,\\" and some are clever, contemporary pieces like \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Coasting.\\"<br /><br />The style of writing varies with the theme, underlining the author's ability to handle multiple and varied genres. My favorite stories would be \\"Giant Sentinels,\\" a speculative fiction that shows us how things that we take for granted can become the stuff of nightmares, and \\"Ophelia,\\" a rather peculiar take on William Shakespeare's Hamlet.<br /><br />All the stories, even those that are clearly a fiction, are heavily grounded in reality, making it easy for us, the readers, to relate to the characters and experience what happens through their eyes.<br /><br />\\"No Man is an Island and other short stories\\" by Sonya C. Dodd is a very well written collection of stories that will appeal to a wide audience, especially those of us who enjoy this particular format. Recommended.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app makes it fun to learn a language.  It has short lessons that help you to understand conversational Italian (my language of choice, but several others are offered). The lessons are well organized and build upon one another.  The format allows the student to have success, which makes you want to continue the process.  Since the format is similar to a game, it challenges you to go to the next level.  I also like the review process that allows you to go back to previous lessons. I'm currently on Level 3 so I don't know how comprehensive the entire program will be, but it definitely appears it will give you a very good foundation in a new language.  The only criticism I have is that the native speaker is sometimes hard to understand and I have to listen to her several times to make sure of pronunciation.  However, that is becoming less of a problem as I become more accustomed to her voice.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm not upset at the ending, despite my admiration and attachment to the Tris character.  It's still a powerful message - how a person deals with grief and guilt can't just be escape, bravery can just simply be deciding to go on.  I'm also not a person who insists on happily ever after endings.<br /><br />While I didn't completely buy the whole genetic experiment thing, I still found the characters engaging enough that I could manage a certain level of suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />However, like with others, my main problem is with the dual POVs.  When I first saw that, I was reminded of GRR Martin and curious to see what Roth would do with it, but was dissappointed when she made it that hard to distinguish between the internal narratives without searching for a 3rd person reference.<br /><br />Still worth reading, but certainly not up to the level of the first two books.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a good book, Stephen King is my favorite writter.  Can't wait too see what he writes next.  I'm happy that I have a Kindle to read on.

B00DW1WR14|4.0|My expectations for Lightning Bolt were very high with the early release of \\"Mind Your Manners\\" and \\"Sirens\\" which are two of the better songs that I have heard from Pearl Jam in a while.  However, I believe those are two of the strongest tracks on the cd.  The cd is very diverse with a wide range of music which I really enjoy.  I wish there were more fast/high tempo quality songs like \\"Mind Your Manners\\".  I believe the top tracks are the slower/acoustic songs like \\"Sirens\\", \\"Pendulum\\", \\"Yellow Moon\\", and \\"Future Days\\".  In all, I believe half of the songs are very good and the rest are good but I don't believe there is a bad track on the cd.  Solid effort.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Sad, alarming, engaging, and heartwarming -- this is a story that'll stick with you.  Neil Gaiman wove a full and original high fantasy that managed to also feel homey, achieving that rare balance between fulfillment and a little hunger for more.<br /><br />The Hempstocks have set up a farm in my head, too, Mr. Gaiman.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Would much rather pay a dollar or two to just have the game without the scammy in app purchases. Bought fruit drop instead and uninstalled candy crush.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|The first time I heard this I searched the radio station playlist with no success! Then ....finally I found it on Amazon ! This song is HOT!!!! And is right on time, the words really hit home . This song is one of my fav's for 2013, no FOREVER!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I know a lot are mad about the ending, which I am too, but there was more that let me down with this book. I could tell there was a break in writing. Divergent and Insurgent both flowed together nicely, this did not. The flip flopping between Tris and Tobias was an epic fail. I would forget who I was reading most of the time. No differences in the writing between the characters. I got bored with the book, but pushed through to find out the ending. Sucks to look forward to something for so long to be totally let down.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|one word.shoot. great graghics fun to play and online multiplayer. get the game its worth taking up a lot of storage
006202406X|4.0|** SPOILER-FREE REVIEW **<br /><br />It took me a long time to realize this series is not about a dystopian society or war or the dangers of scientific progress. Rather, one of the biggest themes in the series is the power of choice. The characters, especially Tris, learn how to choose love, forgiveness and sacrifice instead of the easy way out. What unnerved me most (in a good way) was that Tris was always a completely normal girl, but she continually chose to act extraordinarily. As the reader, I felt inadequate next to her, knowing that she had no super powers which I could use to distance her choices from my own. The other characters make some pretty heavy decisions too, and it is nice to see how much they have matured from the previous books.<br /><br />I was less pleased with the corrupt government/revolution storyline in this series, the justification for the faction society setup, and the scientific reasons that led to and perpetuated animosity between divergent and non-divergent. I understand the parallels that Roth meant to draw between her world and ours, but I could never really suspend my disbelief for it (probably because I have taken a few genetics courses that delved into the nature/nurture argument).<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the lessons within this novel, and look forward to reading more of Veronica Roth's work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just love it on my kindle fire. Bigger screen and so addictive. I can take it anywhere I go. Yea!!!!

B001NOD0Q8|5.0|Bought this for our 10 yr old and its an amazing read.  He received and has enjoyed the action and suspense of this book.  Wonderful to see a child reading good books.  His reward will be to see the movie.  Awesome!  (We know books are always better than the movie).
B004J4WLB4|2.0|On the plus side, I did appreciate the setting, my San Francisco, where I lived for many years, and surrounding areas. And it is endlessly entertaining to read about flowers. BUT the main character, Victoria, was so tiresome, I regretted having to spend so much time in her company, indeed, any time. Her endlessly sour attitude was so annoying and repellent, I just wanted to escape from her. I certainly couldn't develop a friendly relationship with her. It took too long for anyone in that book to learn to forgive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time!! I've had my kindle fire for over a year, thought I would never be able to play candy crush on it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|At first glance I thought there were to many characters to keep up with.

B00DURHYWC|5.0|This is my favorite group!  Their style is reminiscent of old world jazz with meaningful lyrics, great instrumentation, and music from all over the world.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This was a fantastic read, one of my faorites of 2013.  I am almost motivated to go hiking the PCT, but I don't think I am as tough as Cheryl, and maybe I will just set my sights for sections of the Appalachian.<br /><br />This was a refreshing break from all the non-fiction I typically have my nose in.  A great story of healing, growth and adventure.  This was a rightful pick for Goodreads Choice awards, and I can see why Oprah loved it too.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like this app, I can use it on all my devices. It is simple and even the free app gets the basics done
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  I downloaded it the day it came out.  No, its not &#34;The Kiterunner,&#34; only The Kiterunner will be the Kiterunner.  Its still a beautiful tale with complex characters spanning multiple generations.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game just getting tired of it freezing and not being reimbursed for the lost tokens.  Also dislike getting kicked off so much.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|***SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars as I reserve the lowest star for books without flow or character development.  I don't often write reviews as I have a very high respect for art and dislike chewing a piece apart simply because I have an opinion about it.  (This is also not the best review--I am not a writer or a teacher so take from it what you will.) However, this novel was such a disappointment for me.  I agree wholeheartedly with the numerous reviews that have also scored this book low.<br /><br />There is no distinct character voice between Tris & Four.  If you disagree, read partway into a chapter and put it down for a couple of days or overnight.  When you pick it back up and read a few paragraphs, a few pages even, can you tell who is narrating?  I couldn't!<br /><br />There are numerous character development flaws/inconsistencies.  These are mentioned in previous reviews and I don't have the heart to retype them here.  One major inconsistency and the biggest problem I have with the climax event is that to the core, more than she was selfless, Tris was a fighter.  And Roth had her choose to fight up until the very end where she so easily gives up because she see's her Mother?  I just didn't buy it.  I might have been able to justify Roth's motives to kill Tris off, if she hadn't taken her fight from her at the end.  And why did she kill her off?  What did it accomplish except to rob hope from and create anguish for the reader?  If I wanted to experience those feelings, I would choose to read a Jodi Picoult novel.<br /><br />I desperately tried to justify the ending of this book and have tried to reason it several times.  One of the reasons I read fiction is to discover new perspective's that can help enrich my world.  I believe that one of the essential elements of good fiction is a sense of realistic character development that allows me to identify with the main character.  I think Roth did a decent job of that early on in the seriesbut not with this novel.  What new take away message is the author giving us?  How is she improving/enriching the reader's world by creating this void? If you've lived for a certain amount of time you learn to understand the meaning of the phrase: life is unfair.  We are constantly thrown challenges that shape us; we are robbed and robbed again of so many things throughout life and it is a never ending process.  At the end of the day, each of us holds on to some type of hope--even in grief.<br /><br />I think Roth tried to put the novel back together by giving Four the grieving process.  But replicating the grieving process is an extremely sensitive and time consuming event and Roth didn't give it the extreme attention it needed to help the reader resolve his/her own loss of Tris.  Roth spent an entire 2 novels creating a link between Tris and the reader.  Killing her off so quickly severed the link as sharply as it severed the link between Tris and Four.  At the end of it all, and still days later, I have no sense of closure from the void that this novel created.  It would have been better if I had not read it.
B002NTGKSM|4.0|Very entertaining and imaginative movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.  We are always looking for movies that younger children and ourselves will like and this fit the bill.  It might have been a tad too scary for our four year old but so far no nightmares.
B00EUEWRUI|5.0|I was 7 years old when the MKII lineup were together in 1972 so seeing them was not an option, nor did I know who they were at the time anyway.  By 1985, I was a big Blackmore fan, still am to this day, and I played soccer with him on Long Island just before the DP reunion was announced.  Perfect Strangers is a fantastic album and this live CD/DVD is a treat for those who never saw the lineup in the 70's.  Everyone sounds great here.  Ian Gillan is in fine voice and the rest of the band are just cranking.  The new songs mesh very well with the classics.  Highly recommended for fans who really appreciate what a great band they were before inner turmoil ruined them for good.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|She had very good detail.It would draw you in and you couldn't get out!!<br />I  love it and I would prefer you read it!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a page turner that snaps to a finish in the final pages.  Interestingly conceived and written from the perspective of deep experience in the law.  Definitely worth the read.
B000002J1O|5.0|Although Stagnation, Musical Box and Supper's Ready are my sentimental favourite Genesis compositions, SEBTP is, I believe, their most sustained and consistent effort. It has 3 genuine masterpieces : Dancing, Firth and Cinema. Inspired  melodies, thought provoking and satirical lyrics, and instrumental interludes that are just plain breathtaking. This was the pinnacle of progressive rock and very little that came after could hold a candle to it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|King's writing is page turning as usual, but this one could be as good a book if half as long.
B007DKNEI0|5.0|If you are, like me, slowly replacing your old TD albums and cassettes with remastered versions, this is a great place to start (along with the companion 74 - 78 box set). Sure the packaging is basic, but 5 CDs (7 classic albums) for the $15 I paid is just a steal. I don't have to tell you that there's some great stuff here from the German electro-pioneers so if you're deliberating, don't. Now, if we can just have a Jive years box set!<br />[[ASIN:B004D5H2M2 Virgin Years: 1974-1978]]
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've been consumed by this show.  I was late to the party ... and I binge watched the two seasons available on xfinity ... and Amazon got me to do a trial of their Amazon Prime so I could watch season 3.  I was NOT disappointed !  Season 4 coming in January.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|The best pop/rock album by a female composer ever? When you hear this immaculate piece of work, you may be asking the same question. There's true genius here in both the compositions themselves and the way the tracks are sequenced, maintaining  an emotional intensity throughout the album that seems to transcend time. Where do you start? Waking The Witch, Hello Earth, Cloudbursting, Jig of Life; everything is simply breathtaking. Wow, unbelievable (to quote a phrase).<br />Thank you for this gift, Kate.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is played on a Kindle HD Fire 8.9&#34;.  The game is engaging and entertaining but requires other players to progress at certain stages or a monetary purchase.
B00775D77Y|5.0|A genuine classic. Everything came together for Talk Talk on this album after the dance oriented cuts prevalent on earlier releases. It was quite the step forward. Brilliant compositions - the uplifting Happiness Is Easy; the inspired single Life's What You Make It; the driving Living In Another World; the atonal Chameleon Day (a foretaste of what was to come on the groundbreaking Spirit of Eden); the anthemic Time Is Time. Every track a gem. Unusual arrangements, diverse instrumentation, massed choirs, fantastic rhythms, and the amazing Variophon. Of all the so-called New Wave bands of the '80s, Talk Talk were genuinely the most experimental, and by that very token, the most interesting and lasting.
B00EEXST2K|5.0|I always heard about Linda Lovelace, but seeing the story changed much of my opinions.  My husband and I enjoyed watching it.  It doesn't hurt that the star is a local w/ my wife knowing her mother.
B003IODNJA|5.0|For the longest time I had the Do Well cassette blasting in my car. This was basically a 20 minute mash up of the wonderful track Jewel from the album under review here. Jewel was one of the best tracks I heard in the '80s, and I couldn't get enough of it - in all its forms. That wonderful chorus and Claudia's enticing vocals. But that song is just one highlight of Secret Wish. There are the great techno beats of The Murder Of Love and p-Machinery, the lovely melody of The Chase, and does anything compare with the 8 plus minutes of ecstatic electropop that is Dream Within A Dream? I have had the cassette version, the original cd version, the remixed version (Wishful Thinking), the Do Well EP, and now this great remastered release, and it still finds frequent time on my player. It's The Human League meets Amon Duul II, with some Alan Parsons thrown in. No, it's like nothing you ever heard before at the time. A classic.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT! READ AT OWN RISK! I was very excited for this book to come out since I've been waiting 2months for it and finally got it. Although I am very disappointed about this book. It drags on and on and on until maybe the first 300 pages then it gets pretty good.<br /><br />  What I'm most disappointed about was that Tris died for no apparent reason. And Tobias having to go through all that pain for no reason. I would be fine if she died for a good reason or became a hero for it. Do I regret reading the other 2 books? Well I guess you could say that. Overall I'm not very happy about this book I know you can do better then this Veronica Roth
B000I0XLYO|5.0|I love this move. It has been a favorite of mine for years. It is such a stupid movie, but incredibly funny.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game BUT it is frustrating and addictive at the same time. Some levels are mind boggling. I keep going back for more, more, MORE!!!! Frustration.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love that this game is finally on the kindle, but the only issue I'm having is connecting to Facebook to compete with friends

B009LDD5E0|5.0|I started watching all of them just recently. Glee Karaoke brought me to liking this song because of Total Eclipse of the Heart. I love&#60;3 Lea Michele's voice. I wanted to know why she was singing that song and my cousin was like she used to date him is dating him but they broke up and she wants to b with him. blah blah blah. So i was like cool, I want to watch. I love the story....some parts i didn't think required a song or it wasn't the right song to b sung but its whatever. I love when Kurt did the single ladies. And I cried more tears in the last 3 seasons then I did when i was watching breaking dawn. I really wish Cody Monteith didn't have to die :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited a long time to get to play this game. The wait was worth it. It is addictive and I don't mind the forced breaks. I just do something else and come back to it later.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|It is now my favorite edition of the Bootleg Series. The songs have an immediacy and clarity that didn't exist on the original releases. Unreleased tracks like &#34;Thirsty Boots&#34; and &#34;This Evening So Soon&#34; are masterpiece additions to Bob's already amazing catalog.<br />Most highly recommended.

B00005JK8K|3.0|John Woo was a hot director in Hong Kong and when he had to flee, Hollywood was happy to snatch him up. The transition was rough and he didn't translate well. \\"Windtalkers\\" is evidence of that.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. During WWII the U.S. military began using Navajo Indians to speak code so the enemy not only can't break it because of the code. They can't break the language. Nicholas Cage is a sergeant assigned to one of the Navajo Windtalkers to protect him and make certain he doesn't fall into enemy hands and divulge the code. Cage has some serious baggage so the task proves a difficult one.<br /><br />This is a very uneven film. Woo, known for his directing of action scenes, does a poor job in the opening scene. It's stiff and clunky. But then the action shifts to Sai Pan and he really steps up and delivers some of the best battle scenes ever filmed. But then there's the script. I'm guessing Woo, not having a good enough ear for the English language, didn't know when the script contained some really clunky, cliche ridden dialogue and situations. Between the battle scenes there are attempts to flesh out the story and characters that have been done way too times. Also, given the set-up, the viewer knows there are only a couple of ways this can end. It's merely a matter of which way the writers want the coin to fall. The acting is decent enough. Nick Cage is about as good as you're going to see him.The rest of the roles are played decent enough, but no one looks as though they're fishing for an academy award.<br /><br />This is an interesting chapter in history. They just needed a better script and some more even handed directing to bring it to life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy playing the game.  I try to play it every day and love the many challenges of the candy levels.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I found myself yelling at the TV. Season 3 is full of twists and turns. I highly recommend. Cannot believe it took me son long to watch the Abbey! Ready for Season 4.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|There are a lot of historical facts about the air war that I found very interesting.  I had not understood the relationship between the German Airmen and the Party in power during the war.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Now I am hooked. Why did I wait so long. Thank for allowing me to catch up. Loved Season 2!!!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I thought it was a 5 star product until the 3rd week of October it just stopped being able to be charged by any Micro-USB port.  It no longer will see any Micro-USB plugged into it and therefore will not charge.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting and easily read.  Would have preferred lengthier discussions of brain functions.<br />Comments from other neurosurgeons would have been nice.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Okay seriously? Why on earth why would you make tris die? This book is retarded and I hate it so freaking much
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love the mystery and how it makes you think and use your mind not all games do that so it just makes this game a lot of fun
B002M5E2DW|5.0|&#34;The Secret&#34; is a great book if you need inspiration in just life itself. If you read It with an open mind it could easily change your life for the better. Extremely positive.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An easy read, alot of useful insights and advice. A very different view on relationships. Not what i expected but pleasantly so
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Absolutely enchanting! I will always treasure these stories of loving God's creatures. :) thank you for the privilege of experiencing a world of goodness, commitment, & integrity.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This book keeps you guessing from start to finish. I would recommend just about anyone to read it especially if you like mysteries.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I dont know what the last reviewer is talking about, I dont have a problem making as many recordings as I want and saving them without having to wait. Maybe he doesnt know how to use it. I love the simple interface, it looks like an actual tape recorder. Very nicely done.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had no idea this book was written in 1985, that's the year I was born! However, reading it now in 2013, it stills feels new and exciting, like it was just written. This book is extremely addicting, to the point that I haven't slept in two days just to read it. It may be about children fighting wars, but it has something for readers of all ages. I highly doubt that any movie will ever be able to weave such a wonderful tale and I highly recommend this book for the sheer weight it places on you as you read, the need to read a little more before turning out your lamp is a rare find in books these days.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I purchased this game when it first came out and was really enjoying it until I downloaded the update and my Trustgo Antivirus popped up a warning telling me that the game contained spyware which can access your device ID, contacts, emails, etc. I had to delete it. Its a shame, I was enjoying the  game. Unfortunately we are living in a society in which too many greedy and less than honest individuals want your personal information and use it for profit. This includes game makers. I advice everyone to download any of the free antivirus apps available on Amazon. I personally use Trustgo. Its one of the best.
B008JFUNNM|4.0|Captain phillips delivered on all expectations front.Tom hanks was as usual good.However one scene where he stood out and hit the ball out of the park was when he convinced terrorist leader muse to agree to negotiations especially the last scene where u can only hear tom hanks voice.Muse (first-time actor Barkhad Abdi) terrorist leader almost stole the show from tom hanks,which speaks of his natural ability to act.If he can deliver acting in different roles ,he could be next superstar.I wont give it 5 star as i think they did little over dramatization in last 30 minutes..not sure if that component was really true or fiction.
B000MGATTE|5.0|Of the twenty or so Stephen King books I've read in the past couple of years, I think this one my stay with me the longest. It has the requisite creepy, supernatural elements (it is Stephen King after all), but to me it is a haunting love story told in memories and flash backs. I had to re-read at times to make sure I had the timeline right, but in the end it was &#34;just hang on and let the story take you&#34;. Great character development made it easy to feel for Scott and Lisey. Thanks SK!
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Very nice game. The graphics is good and the gameplay very entertaining. No bugs that I have experienced so far.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice and easy to use - I like simple and easy with no aggravation other devices are costly and often complex
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|I read this book for a college course. Frey writes with no grammar or composition rules. He is also very lyrical in his writings. While a lot of controversy surrounds this book,Google it to learn more, I feel the level of self resurgence of an addict going through recovery is more than you will get from any self help book. The intimate level James let readers get to know him on.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these things, but what is with the price?  $49 !!  I think i paid $20 each for these a couple years back on Amazon.<br /><br />Large headphones hurt my ears after a while.  Ear buds hurt my ears almost immediately.<br />These are incredibly light weight, put all the forces on the top of my head, and barely rest inside my ears.<br /><br />Why don't more manufacturers sell headphones like these?  I can wear these for hours at a time unlike any other headphones.<br /><br />The only negative is that the cord is fairly short.  it is long enough to reach down to put your phone in your pants pocket, but when I try to plug them into my desktop computer, i have to lean over to keep from ripping them off my head.<br /><br />I would love to find something like this with bluetooth support..
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Lot of teachings about everything. Mainly business but also family relationships. A great book that is highly recommendable. Must read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Boring. Redundant. It didn't make sense. Poorly written.  It did not engage me at all this time around which is a shame since I was fully invested in the characters.  What a complete let down. I am sooo disappointed and sad it ended this way.
B001EC3JME|4.0|is of very good quality, if you use the clip will never fall to your belt, but it is difficult to remove once you put it. perfect fit for a maglite XL50, protects very well and mobile clip to adjust the direction of the light and use your two hands as you go in the dark.
B000V658EQ|1.0|Many of the tracks cut off before the song fades out.  Very frustrating.  Contacting Amazon as soon as I can find an appropriate link.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like G5 games but, may I ask a question. Why are all the main characters<br />female? If it is because they are milder games, remember not males love the bloodier games.
B003VANOFY|5.0|for a gaming headset this aint bad totally worth the money. one thing to keep in mind is to seperate anything wireless between this headset it will totally mess with it
014312336X|5.0|Fascinating read enveloped in such a richly textured historical setting with equally colorful characters.  Couldn't put it down.  Definite cinematic material!
B00555X8OA|5.0|Outstanding research and communication of results. Purely scientific with no political or obvious preconceived ideas. Excellent read that maintains interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Love this game. Love this game it is fun for all. The whole family plays this game
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant has received countless negative reviews and I can think of one chapter that may have caused them, but say what you want about Roth's decisions, this book ended the trilogy in a away I never (and I mean never) saw coming. Allegiant had it all: romance, humor, and of course, action, or revolutions, I suppose would be more appropriate. It did get a bit slow at times, but I believe those times were needed in order to soak everything that is revealed in, and a lot is revealed. I almost found myself just as overwhelmed as our main characters.<br /><br />Roth does a great job of crafting a conclusion that answers all our questions and providing closure for the things left unresolved in the other books. I see that many people are unsatisfied with the way things turned out, but honestly don't see why everyone is so bent out of shape. Allegiant has twists and turns no one will see coming, and I definitely enjoyed the ride. I will miss all of these characters though...
0345803507|5.0|I bought it for my sister she wanted it as birthday present. She loved the present. Was really happy with it
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of reading this and didn't want it to end!  The depth of involvement with the characters is remarkable.
0345803493|5.0|I bought this book for my sister as birthday present. She was really happy that she received this book. She enjoys reading them.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I enjoyed the book so gave it the highest rating!  It is very different from Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love, but, to me,  a very interesting story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun but the only thing is that when I upgraded it I was not able to get back on so I had to start over but that  only happen to my kindle but not to my friends but get the game it is a some
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This novel had a compelling twist that kept the pages turning. I enjoyed the suspense and excitement that has left me eager to read the following novel.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first two books had a rhythm and communicated a great story that I thought would continue in this book thus completing the bigger picture - but the story did not flow well and the message seemed to get lost and the story seemed to lose purpose
B000GOWNPU|5.0|A little dark, a tragic tale, but it's an intricate and dramatic legal mystery with a satisfying end. Bacon, DiNiro and Dustin Hoffman were never better. That's all I have to say about that.
B000H5U832|2.0|Quality was sold as good and I believe that should mean that the DVD should not skip; stop etc....not worried about the condition of the case etc....but the DVD should have been in better condition
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addicting. can be frustrating but in a good way! great game i love it!! glad it is finialy on the kindle
0143124544|5.0|Wonderful book  could not put down. Did not think of it as love story. More of a human  interest story
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I used to have a taped from broadcast VHS of this performance and always wanted it to be released on DVD. The performance is excellent and makes me miss Nirvana. The only thing that's missing is Anthony and Flea in drag introducing the songs.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Not my usual reading choice but very enjoyable.  I would recommend it if you like this sort of book.  Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love and hate this app at different times, that's what makes it sooooooooooo good. Drives me mad but so addictive.
B005WMQFOQ|4.0|I'm giving this as a gift and I was a bit disappointed that the box had been opened and taped shut and the condition of the plastic was rather scratched. The doll however is very nice!
B009R54MGW|5.0|I've read the authors other books of the period and enjoyed all of them as I have this one l could not put it down
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I loved book 1 of this series (name of the wind). This book, however, was a bit tedious at times. Still good and worth the read, though
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game. Great for passing time when waiting on Appointments or nothing else to do during the day or night
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun, addictive, great way to kill time. Absolutely fun to share with friends. Would recommend to game playing friends. Hope you try and enjoy it as much as I do.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I felt I had to read &#34;Allegiant&#34; to find out what would happen to Tris and Tobias. I was hooked after &#34;Divergent.&#34; However, I balked at the early bad ratings the book received. To my surprise I enjoyed this installment tremendously. Tobias and Tris are more mature in this story and I like the things they learn about relationships with each other. Additionally, it was not all about battles all the time: the plot has a purpose in revealing what the city was all about and moving toward a purpose and resolution for all of the conflict. There were parallels to discrimination issues in present-day society. The prose was not great literature, no, but that is not why I was reading it. Tobias and Tris are compelling, flawed, brave young people with a great capacity for love. This story arouses great emotion, which is part of the reason I liked it, and the ending is more hopeful than I was lead to believe. So Be Brave and read on. Good job, Ms. Roth! Thanks for a great ride.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have read a lot of books in different genres through Amazon and this is the first time writing a review. I admit I have read quite a bit of these YA books and have enjoyed most of them including Divergent and Insurgent. In fact, I read both of those books in one day. And then comes Allegiant. Oh my. I am struggling with this one. While nice to have Four's perspective, he sounds too much like Tris and I am having a hard time differentiating between the two. Not only that, but so far, I could not care less about any of these characters and whether or not they find out what is going on beyond their city.  I can't believe the same person wrote this book. It seems like no time was spent on it and Veronica Roth just wanted to get something out as soon as she could. Granted, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular as far as the writing but at least something that would hold my interest. I was excited for this book to be released but I am so disappointed. I haven't even finished it (and I'm not sure I will given all the other reviews and the poor ratings based on the ending).
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|My first review of a product this is by far one of the best apps to be able too connect to my PC from any where has been great and if you have Netflix it's even better.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|A good game with lots of different challenges. But after level 35 you either have to wait as long as 24 hours to continue without paying or pay. I make it a habit to never pay. But I've never had to wait so long.
B006J420UE|5.0|I bought this in 9/13 but did my first POST yesterday (10/23/13). CPU temperature was getting high (160 deg F and rising) after POST so I replaced the original 'Sticky Surface' on the heat sink with Thermal Jelly (Arctic Silver).  I used paper towels to wipe the APU surface and the heat sink surface clean (Do Not use abrasives like steel wool).

B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is amazing. Great look and feel. Good story. This is horror. Jessica Lang is awesome in this. Great cast all around
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Sprinkle from developer Mediocre AB immediately asserted itself as one of the most impressive games out there for the Kindle Fire, and Sprinkle Islands is a must if you enjoyed or were even just tempted by the first one. The game features controls that amount to swiping and button pushing as you control your hose and spray water to put out spreading fires. The visuals are crisp and impressive. The app is free of any advertisements, invasive permissions, or material you wouldn't want to expose kids to.<br /><br />The real question anyone would ask when approaching this game is if it's just more of the same from the first one. Although the levels are largely setup the same, and the music can get a little old, I think the difference is that there's a lot more movement on the screen, the puzzles get to be somewhat trickier, and the various giant creatures add to the fun.<br /><br />Overall, the game is perfect for kids and great fun for adults looking for a casual gaming experiencing. The only reason I can think of not to get it was if you played the first one and didn't like it. The value here is more than the asking price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, but beware, it is very addictive.  I had it on my phone, and now I have it on my kindle.
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|Really not bad...not bad at all! My wife is &#34;graphic illiterate&#34;. I talked her into the download and I found it fairly easy to teach her how to edit some of her photos.<br />Basically, I like the options and ease of the program operation.
1401937519|5.0|Incredible story.  Over the years, this same message has come through so many times.  Guess I've got a hard head.  Her message in this book is clear:  you must love yourself unconditionally.  Most people do not know how to do that - and narcissism is most definitely NOT love, by the way.  Terrific book!!!  And it came pretty quickly, too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|fun game! great rooms and regular updates. drama in the chat room can be very entertaining as well. I have been playing for several months now and aren't bored!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm from this era, witnessed the riots and served my country in the USMC. This story hit home in many ways - 6th generation Californian, familiar with every aspect of this well written novel. Couldn't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played many, many match 3 games and there's a lot of really good ones out there. I wasn't going to bother trying this one, but a friend is addicted to it. So, I gave it a try and found it is really addicting. There's enough variety to keep me playing and the graphics are nice.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for kids and adults. My kids and I compete, play together and by ourselves and have lots of fun.
B007EC27QM|4.0|It seems to work well. I saw other reviews that it didn't follow order of operations properly, but I haven't tried any calculations that would require that. It's good for simple calculations. I wish there was an option to make it much smaller and to use it concurrently with other apps.
034580404X|5.0|I am very picky when it comes to books. i have to really like it in order to continue reading it and these books just left me speechless
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i freekin love this book soo much and i am so glad that i bought it! it was sad in in some parts but you learn to get over it. this is my number one recomendation!!
B001NOD0Q8|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. I had a slightly difficult time believing that the characters were so young, but it certainly wasn't a deal-breaker for me. I'm excited that there's a movie version coming out shortly, although I was somewhat chagrined to discover that the author is slightly nutty. (For details on why the author is nutty, check out this: [...] )
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Loved the packaging, the cover, the transparent one and the embossed wall-stoned one, proud to have it among my DVD collection.<br />My only regret is it isn't available in Blu-Ray.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game!! I,m so glad it finally came to kindle. My only complaint is that  while I can get the message s friends send me when I try to send friends lives it says I,m not connected to FB when I am!!!! I have to go to my cell phone to send friends lives. But it is very addicting!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. So addictive I can't put it done. It is also good entertainment when you need a break from work.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is challenging. It is frustrating when you don't earn enough diamonds but that is what makes it a challenge.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is a total mind trip.  I couldn't put it down from the word go.  What a storyteller...love SK!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I have been waiting the longest .And this game can be addictive but it can be fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's not expensive. It totally does it's job what it promises. It even exceeded my expectations. It's been 2 months, no problems.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Craig is the best Bond since Connery, and production quality in the Bond franchise has never been better. The quality extends to the Blu-ray disc. I haven't explored the extras yet, but the film itself looks and sounds great on my 32&#34; Samsung HDTV and Onkyo home theatre receiver. Good detail in dark scenes, good use of the surround stage. If you enjoyed the film in the cinema, you'll like the Blu-ray disc.
0316286869|3.0|As a makeup artist ,The make up tips were helpful and insightful.  However the actual storyline was rather dry and boring.
B000007ODY|4.0|Like many, I'm always interested in obtaining the best possible mastering of any recording I buy. To that end, I conducted a null test comparing the Brahms Symphonies on this release directly with their counterparts on the later \\"Karajan Symphony Edition\\" release [[ASIN:B001DCQI8C Brahms: The Symphonies]]. The result? They are bit-perfect copies of one another. So make your choice based on the couplings or on price.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not as good as the others but still engaging...would be nice if it wasn't quite so formulaic...seems like so many of these books are &#34;me too&#34; characters and stories...
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|I am a fan of the older movies.  I love the actors in the movie.  I love how the movie was made and I like the story line.  Great movie.  I always love a good scary story.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Very good graphics and water simulation, easy and relaxing gameplay. Interesting mix of 3d graphics in a 2d side scroller game.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I literally just want to fill out the word requirement with a million heart emojis. An adult fairy tale that you will not be able to get enough of. This is the story I have been looking for all of my life. Wonderful in every sense of the word. Just perfect.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I actually checked this book out from my library in CD form and listened to it on a long business trip. It kept my attention and kept me awake on the long drive. I enjoyed the characters and found the story believable. I will definitely pick some more DeMille books for trips.  [[ASIN:B00DHPLD06 Protect Your Nuts]]
B00FXEL00W|4.0|I think it was awesome. I couldn't put the book down. It's funny yet heartfelt. Has a lot of emotion and really puts things in perspective. The book goes between Payton and Kendall's point of view.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is violent for ages -4.  But very fun very growing tomboy s.  (Which are girls) and also very fun for cool and growing boys.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It served its purpose wonderfully.  I had to shut it down though, other than that it kept me logged on all the time and the grands thought it was a game.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Certainly gives one pause to learn how little the general public knows about something as potentially catastrophic as nuclear &#34;accidents&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finnaly the real candy crush i have been waiting for like ever its so fun but if you play way to much it gets boring but over all its awsome and free so dont worry just get the game its soooooooooooo fun
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting. Enjoyed it from first  page to the last page. Introduced me to a part of American history I knew nothing about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i bought the real thing because i didnt feel comfortable using the 4shared thing plus thats illegal so in stead iof using the 4shared thing i bought the real thing......the thing i like about it is that you can build anything the mansion of your dreams you can even build castle giant statue's there is lava buckets water buckets cake nether reactor and you can play it where ever you go but the thing i dont like is that sometimes there just alot of thing to build but you just dont know what to build...but in my opinion its totally worth seven bucks....ps dont pay attention to the past reviews those are the old dates of minecraft this is a new one from 10/24/2013 and the date of the version im reviewing is 7.6 .....ps there are updates come...theres people working on minecraft updates
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Not bad, not my favorite, but inventive and imaginative. A film waiting to happen.  I prefer literature with deeper allegory or metaphors that are more deeply navigated.  The beginnings are here and I was disappointed the author didn't take it further.  The contemporary owners destiny felt anticlimactic
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This card game provides a simple system, a campaign with a coherent storyline, creates a desire to return, entertainment for hours on end without arbitrary daily time limits, all for the low, low price of free.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book is a cannot-put-it-down kind of book.  The characters are strong, meaning either good, smart, and caring, or mean, deceitful, and non-caring.  When I learned the setting was an underground silo, I thought &#34;What can the author possibly say about living in a silo?&#34;  Well, as I discovered, plenty.  I've started the next book in the trilogy, and reviewers have cautioned that it's not as thrilling, but I have to read it to get to the third book, which reviewers say it's even better than &#34;Wool.&#34;  This I have to see.
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|Installed, but didn't get to try. Verizon built in security identifies this as Artimis spyware. Not sure how to get that changed.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It did exactly what it said it would do.  Using this tool helped me find better connections for my network.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some of my friends at college told me to check out this book. I'll tell u, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in three days. I love this book. I brought out every emotion in me. I highly recommend this fantastic read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read Ling for years & this is one of his better stories. Grabbed you from the first paragraph.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Gave it a day to process and think over. Still processing  overall a great book and a bittersweet fitting to the end.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|I've only been able to play this game once till an update was available. I've been locked out of the app for 48 hours. If Goodgame wants to make the app better, that's great! But please make the update available in the app store. Ridiculous.....
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|should give more lives but it is addictive and fun. if more lives were available without purchasing it would be a five star.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. If you get it you will be constantly playing it. It has some bad qualities but if you get it you won't regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you Amazon. I love candy crush. Very excited to have it on my kindle fire now. I have it through google on my phone for months now. watch out folks its very addictive. and the levels are different and sometimes trying. Thanks again amazon.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I thought that Emma Watson's acting was good, but the core motivations of the teenagers were not developed enough. The ethical issues and drives were not developed enough. It could have been a really meaningful movie.<br />Considering its potential given the theme and Watson's talent, I think it was a failure.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Kids have a way if rising to exceed our greatest expectations and when you think you might have figured them out, they will truly surprise and delight you !!!<br /><br />Wonder is an story of courage and kindness.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun, addicting, but there are some things I don't like about the game. The time it takes to get more lives is a bit ridiculous.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I enjoyed this reading this book but found myself skipping over paragraphs to get to the point. I don't like books where the author writes long and multiple paragraphs just to make a single point. I call these books wordy and I skip through to get back to the action. The story is captivating and I would recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This was a very good app. You can look up any youtube video including PEWDIEPIE I love pewdiepie and my sister and brother love this to. I would definitely give this a chance......... :) :) :)
B000P407K4|5.0|Best movie ever?  If you said &#34;no,&#34; go suck an egg.<br /><br />Are you sucking an egg?  Good. I'm glad we agree.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun but addictive!  Thought I would try this and I play it for a hour and half until I ran out of lives or something.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very great to play when you are bored or you just wanna slice somethin'. I would def recomend it.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Events happening the world today The few warrior's intelligence, with coordinating allies track an illusive territory  The Preacher.<br />You won't pit it down
B00DJZR4A2|4.0|Based on the music, I would have given this five stars, but I docked it a star due to the poster. The photo on the poster is not from the Troubadour, but later in Elton's career, roughly 1973 or 1974. The poster is fine, but if you are looking for something from the historic Troubadour appearance, you will be disappointed.
B0031SCV46|5.0|I love my keyboard. And because im a producer (IG: @3asyfinance Tweet: @FinanceDaRula) and digital musician. I consider it perfect. Not only does it go hand and hand with fl studio, its comfortable and petty simple to manipulate. Its a little more than what i expected in features. So many that i havn't quite accessed them all. Since i prefer to play most instruments in keyboard form. I just can find anything that would better besides even more keys. I definately  dont need them though. And the price. Immaculate.
B00174TKGI|5.0|I love the movie! It is a must see. Anything with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe is always awesome.<br />I might just buy it.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|I have Kindle Fire with plenty of space for apps, but it will not install. I have a very disappointed grandson.
0446530573|4.0|A cool cookbook that has some VERY nice recipies!<br /><br />For a start, try the Ziti al Forno on page 66. Then try the Ah Beetz' pizza on page 101!<br /><br />On a different slant, try the Nova in Purgatorio for breakfast, on page 141!<br /><br />Getting away from the cheese and tomato, go to the Cannoli on page 185!
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This is a well-written and engaging novel that moves along to what appears as an increasingly inevitable conclusion.  The basic theme is that information and surveillance technology will soon be all-encompassing and, if we allow it, there will be no such thing as privacy.  Much of the book consists of the gullible protagonist accepting specious arguments for complete transparency.  The idea is that if there is right to provide a public record of, for example, sex offenders, why not drunken drivers, why not people with parking tickets? Crucially, the bad guys sell all this as a set of \\"rights\\".  If you have the flu, don't your neighbors have a right to know? Although written as satire too much of what the author satirizes is too close to the truth.  Pervasive surveillance is becoming a reality not only for drone strikes in Pakistan but for many public spaces in Europe and the US (almost all in London).  If you still think Eggers is fear-mongering take a look at AutoTrack (the personal database, not the vehicle tracking version).  If you can, get a look at law-enforcement version.  If that doesn't scare you its hard to imagine what would.
B005LAII4E|3.0|Lots of shooting, and killing people as always, but the script was just a let down for me.  I would watch it on TV but not worth the entry price to pay for this at this time.  If you are a die hard blowing up/shooter movie fanatic, than go for it.  If you have half a brain, don't waste the money.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I followed the NYTimes’ reveiwer’s recommendation to not short change oneself and start at the beginning with Oryx and Crake and After the Flood, and then onto MaddAddam. I read all 3 in 2 weeks--consumed by the fractured world and compelling characters that Atwood has brought us. A chillingly close and thought provoking extrapolation from our present realities.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Why can't these re-makes be a lot better, with better material, and writing ?  I knew right off this would be a let down, but I wanted some entertainment for my late hour, and this was what I picked ?  It has lots of shooting, blowing up things, but that and even the comedy part of it was a just lousy.  Oh well !  Hope at least they don't do another.  Its not worth the money but if it does come on TV and have nothing to do, watch it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This series is very entertaining. Keeps you interested. I can't wait for the next season to begin! I love Amazon Prime!
B005QYKE2Y|2.0|I love to pick things apart so here goes.  You really don't need a gigantic piece of metal to fight another gigantic monster.  You just need a bunch of rockets and fighter jets and go for it.  The story line is bad, the sob crybaby of a brother that chucks up his job because he loses his brother is just dumb, than as always he is convinced to re-enter the fight is laughable.  Not worth the money even if they reduce the price.  Watch it on TV with friends to have a good laugh.  Whom ever gives this 3 or more stars don't have half a brain are just die hard stupid movie watchers.
0385351399|4.0|I'm up to book 2 and found that Eggers paints a picture of a dystopian future that seems all too realistic. I rarely read something as soon as it comes out and I felt it was worth my time to read this one immediately.<br /><br />With so many of us feeling the lines between personal and professional life are dropping, 100 years from now it could easily be as Mae and Francis have it - every clumsy physical encounter is taped, sent to the cloud, to reside there in case someone wishes to view it later, with no hope of deleting the data or being able to curate your online image.<br /><br />Frightening, exhilarating, and a great example of how &#34;big brother&#34; can change people's ways of acting and thinking.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Was kind of hesitant to buy this movie since it was likely more for the younger, but was pleasantly surprised that if was a fairly entertaining, and a good ending.  Would watch it again later as well.  Gave it 4 stars, but wish it had a 3 1/2 star option I could have selected.  Above OK but only slightly.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|it is a very good game. many levels so if you can still be playing for a while to come unlike most games that aren't fun after the first week
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put this book down, finished it in three sittings.  Mr. King is so great at presenting &#34;monsters&#34; who really are representative of the real life dangerous monsters that drawn to our children's shine and hell bent on evil.  The character development is as great as always so it will be a challenge to find the right actors for the movie.  Thank you Mr. King for another great, great read!
B004SBULWE|4.0|Works pretty good, kills the apps but then they pop back up when I check again a few minutes later. Would be better if it kept them killed for awhile.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|After Pacific Rim, my 2nd favorite movie of the year. RDJ as Tony Stark makes every fan of IronMan stand up and say, &#34;Yes, that's how you make a superhero movie.&#34;
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham scores again! A gripping ending wraps up the tale beautifully! Can't wait for this thriller to come to the big screen!
0785153942|5.0|Terrific graphic novel. Should there be a sequel to Pacific Rim, I would hope that additional graphic novels would be produced.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I loved this so much it replaced MS-Office 2010 on my PC's as well and I can sync my files between devices to edit them anywhere which is nice for my on-the-go lifestyle. One gripe though: bullets are turned into 1s if you copy/paste text to Gmail.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I understand the frustration of those who were hoping for a different ending for the trilogy.  In my opinion, though, this was still a love story.  While perhaps not the romantic ending that everyone was hoping for, in sacrificing herself, Tris displayed an understanding love that is beyond the comprehension of many.  I don't think, having throughout the series gotten to know that character of Tris, that the ending could have been any different.  Admittedly, part of me (the teenage girl that lives inside my mid-30's body) was hoping for the happily ever after ending that everyone else was; however, I was not disappointed with the way Mrs. Roth chose for the Divergent trilogy.  I am looking forward to reading more of her work.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Absolutely delightful.  Funny, clever, light and loony.  And straightforward so you don't need a book club to parse it.  What could be better?
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Already on Season 4 and soon to Season 5!  Can't stop watching it!  Beware, you'll get hooked on this series!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is the third book in the Divergent series, and is an easy read with excitement throughout. This book went a different way then I was expecting, which made it better to read. I genuinely didn't know what was about to happen until I read it. I would (and do quite often) recommend this book series to readers of all ages.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It's a cute game that my kids love. My youngest giggles at it all the time and it quickly became a favorite for her.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Any fan of operas and love stories will love this updated version of The Phantom of the Opera. The picture and sound are excellent, the story line is heart-warming, and the price is very reasonable. Plus, since this is an older movie, you can't find it at very many places.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book made me ashamed that I had recommended this series to so many people and my book club. The shocking ending for shock values sake cheapened the entire series in one page. I've reread both Divergent and Insurgent multiple times, as well as other series that I have truly loved. This one is going on the shelf and I highly doubt I will venture to dystopian Chicago again.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|All I can say is WOW! This is a heart-wrenching and heart-pounding story/musical that will leave you depressed and satisfied at the same time. It is a very heavy and dark subject matter, and I could easily relate to certain characters. There are several different stories going on in this musical. It has war, prostitution, a criminal that you can completely feel for, love, death, and a touch of humor. This musical has everything! Plus, I now look at Hugh Jackman in an entirely new light!
B003CHGV74|2.0|Had to have Amazon tech support manually put this in my library( at 9pm on a Fri) The Amazon tech support team is great.  Maybe Obama should hire them to roll out the ACA!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have read the first 2 books by Gillian Flynn . . &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;  and  &#34;Dark Places&#34; and found them to be captivating for fast reads but some what predictable.  As for &#34;Gone Girl&#34; the tension of the read was not quiet as strong, but there was no predictability for this novel!<br />Third time's the charm.  I'll be looking forward to Flynn's next .
B003IDMUT0|5.0|Another great story from a master story teller. Where he gets his inspiration I'll never know, but his characters come to life and you want their story to never end. I'll be back when publishes next.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|love it I think everyone should play this game even if you don't think you should. it is so awsome!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So addicting! Can't get enough. Sad that you have to wait sooo long when it times out! Less timeouts would be nice.
B00BSD90DQ|2.0|Warning, this review is more about Amazon's video service than the TV series. First, I've only watched 3 episodes but find the series entertaining.  My beef with Amazon is 1) Problems with streaming quality and 2) lack of closed captioning (CC) when viewing files that were downloaded.  Streaming (in HD) was ok but had just enough issues (seemed like a frame got dropped every 45 seconds or so) to make me think downloading would be better.  Also, when streaming, CC was available.  I downloaded the next episode, which solved my streaming issues, but highlighted a new issue in that Amazon does not support CC in the downloaded versions.  I found the series on itunes and downloaded an episode which played with CC support.  So, Amazon does not support CC but Apple does.  I'm not a fan of Apple/Itunes but they will get my business until Amazon resolves this issue.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'd been looking forward to this book for months and started reading it as soon as it showed up on my kindle. I started getting worried as I saw reviews coming on, but I didn't read them because I didn't want to have the ending spoiled accidentally. No, the book doesn't end with all smiles, but Roth left me happy regardless. She made my emotions go all over the board from scared, anxious, happy, sad, etc. But the epilogue left me feeling happy, even though someone I was emotionally attached to didn't make it to the last page. There is a lot more dialogue than the other books, but I think it's important for Tris and Tobias to explain their thoughts more thoroughly, especially with the ending. If you're looking for a happily ever after, read a fairytale.
