B007VTVGAQ|5.0|This lady is a truly unique and gifted artist as is evidenced by this album. I've never been a big fan of hers until I heard this album and was just floored by it. It's definitey a favorite of mine and ranks up there with the best singer songrwriters like Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cat Stevens, etc. I love this album.
0784011680|5.0|Love this movie. Love Charlie Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. does such a great chop at recreating Charlie Chaplin. Plays him perfectly.

B009NUPMH4|5.0|Just Love her Music, you have to listen to appreciate it. I recommend it if you a fan of Laura Pausini.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game and wish there were more levels.  Some were easy....others I did a goggle search.  But good way to pass time.
B00DB624GS|5.0|The studio album recorded by my favorite incarnation of Fleetwood Mac is still stunning almost 45 years after it was first released - maybe more so. The Chicago blues of the earlier albums shifts into a more mystic place. \\"Oh Well\\" is fairly well known, but almost every other performance is just as good in its own way. Maybe this release will help this classic album to get better known. I know that I'm going to do my art in spreading the word.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge of trying to clear the board of all the matches, sort of like the game Consentration that I use to play as a child only with tiles.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|DOWNTOWN ABBEY SEASON 1 to 3<br />Downtown Abbey can't stop watching - until the season end. Great story, tradition and really visually stunning!<br />What a season finale tragedy! Can't wait for the 4th season.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you like the comic movies you will like this one.  it is what you would expect for a comic movie. Who doesn't like seeing Thor...
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I like the game, they did well with it, but that you only get a certain amount of games to play before you need to scratch for more token packs or whatever the hell they are to be able to play more is quite simply pretty awful. I get it, they want to make you buy more packs so they can get money, but it's also the reason games get poorer reviews.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an easy to use calculator. Can't be beat for the price. It has good functions and is easy to read.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I think the game is a fine one, and quite enjoyable--despite making the user wait an ungodly amount of time--unless they pay for the money backs on Amazon--for some of the dinosaur exhibits and other buildings and decorations to complete building.<br /><br />But I've just past level 8, and so far being on level 7 and 8 I've noticed the game to start lagging a lot. It's not my Internet or the device I'm using, I don't really know what it is. I have to tap on the exhibits and other buildings several times before I can collect the income. Like, sometimes four or five times. If it's just me, then I'll accept that.<br /><br />But hopefully it's not just me and the developers can fix it, because other than that it's quite a fun game. Well done.<br /><br />EDIT: Raised to a four because the lag has seemed to have to gone away once I reached level 9. It hasn't bothered me since so maybe it's just the middle levels between 1 and 10 that are bad, or it was just a random issue.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I LOVE this show!  It is the only network show I watch.  Great acting, #1, great story lines (sometimes a little &#34;too much&#34;, but what the heck!), the relationship between Sherlock and Watson is so intriguing and keeps you coming back for more!  Character development is at just the right pace.......can't wait for season 2!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good way to stay in touch.  I like the privacy Setup. Friends.Family Games and chat.  Who could ask for more.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love almost all Sherlock Holmes movies since Basil Rathbone. I think this series is right up there with more humor. These two characters can say paragraphs in a single look. Great chemistry and fast paced. The land lady is a darling injection.
006197806X|5.0|In Lauren Oliver's dystopian series written for young adults, a post-civil-war America considers \\"love\\" the root of all strong and harmful emotions and has it outlawed through the implementation of a mandatory medical procedure. The Delirium trilogy takes place forty years after all citizens -- by the age of eighteen -- must have the mostly risk-free \\"cure\\" surgery for amor deliria nervosa.<br /><br />Now eighteen, uncured, and on the run, Lena alternates the narrative in a \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" sequence. The \\"then\\" timeline picks up from where \\"Delirium\\" left the reader, and follows Lena as she adjusts to life in the \\"Wilds\\" after Alex's tragedy at the boundary fence of Portland, Maine. She must toughen her mind and body, if she is to survive in this new world.<br /><br />The \\"now\\" jumps ahead to Lena as an accepted member of the Resistance with an undercover assignment in New York City. She is capable of making instant difficult decisions and no longer trusts as a matter of course. However, fate will lead another chance for happiness into Lena's sphere again, if she can bend and not break; if she can put the past behind her; if she has no idea what the future holds.<br /><br />Once again, Lauren Oliver's style of wording in the present tense immediately captures her audience's attention. This time, the reader is treated to a view of the society from inside the Resistance - from those who grew-up in the Wilds, from those who ran away from the towns to purposefully join the rebellion, and from those who are learning what it means to love. Oliver exceeds expectations with her new cast of characters by including various gestures and an accent/tone-of-voice that is unique to each one. The descriptions of the Wilds was heartbreaking.<br /><br />Wow! And I didn't see that ending coming!<br /><br />As much as I enjoy vampire and shifter fiction, I am captivated by this story of humanity's struggle to suppress the darker side of human nature - even if that means removing love from the vernacular. Oliver expressed every person's inner turmoil of good vs. evil that many authors feel can only adequately be addressed in the paranormal genre. Therefore, I can reasonably assure you that this series will also interest an adult audience, because the world in which Oliver set her series is populated by serious and thought-provoking themes with that spice of the \\"what if\\" termed \\"dystopian fiction.\\"<br /><br />The first book in this series was...<br />[[ASIN:0061726834 Delirium]]<br /><br />The third book will be...<br />[[ASIN:0062014536 Requiem (Delirium)]]rom the vernacular.

As their eighteenth birthdays draw near, the girls make last-minute rebellions against the establishment. But in their adolescent fun, they discover that they never knew the full truth behind the so-called \\"delirium\\" disease or much of their town's inner workings. They certainly never knew anything about boys, love, guns, or the Resistance.<br /><br />Oliver quickly snagged my attention with her present-tense approach to this coming-of-age tale. She eloquently argues both sides of the love-as-disease debate through the voices of her characters (young and old) and their education/religious philosophies. Reading of the pendulum swings of Lena's perceptions struck me as authentic character development, backed as these were with full descriptive mental anxt. The walled and fenced environs of Portland, Maine, were a masterful creation, from medical labs to rundown neighborhoods, from societal rules to cultural prejudices.<br /><br />The explosive ending leads me to suspect a completely different tact will be used on the second of the trilogy.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy vampire and shifter fiction, I am captivated by this story of humanity's struggle to suppress the darker side of human nature - even if that means removing love from the vernacular.

The Delirium trilogy takes place forty years after all citizens -- by the age of eighteen -- must have the mostly risk-free \\"cure\\" surgery for amor deliria nervosa.<br /><br />While their destinies draw them back together, Lena and Hannah exchange position as the narrator in this last of the Delirium trilogy. Lena is juggling the ups and downs of love for two boys and the Resistance's plans. As a \\"cured,\\" Hannah is awaiting her marriage to the new mayor of Portland, Maine, but she is still struggling with ghosts from her past (and now, her fianc&eacute;e's). The two best friends - \\"invalid\\" and \\"cured\\" -- will face off after one year apart, and choices will be made that will save lives... and that will end lives.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's present-tense verb use flatters the interweaving storylines. As the tempo increases, so does the emotional density of the shorter chapters.<br /><br />Like life, novels don't wrap up the lives of each character to perfection. This dystopian social experiment gave us traitors, friends, and fond memories, but it didn't give us a conclusive ending for both male love interests. In fact, the best we are given for the entire culture is to hope that they'll remake it into something better, but the Resistance only freed one town (that we know of). Oliver's series has been an excellent (and philosophical) example of non-vampire young adult literature, but it didn't break the pattern of \\"the curse of the dangling ending.\\"<br /><br />Tacked on to the end of \\"Requiem\\" is a short story from Alex's POV incompassing some of his past, his time as a prisoner, and his search for Lena after escaping from the crypts.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Lauren Oliver's dystopian Delirium trilogy, you might also like...<br /><br />[[ASIN:1423146190 After: Nineteen Stories of Apocalypse and Dystopia]]<br />By Ellen Datlow<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062024035 Divergent]]<br />By Veronica Roth<br /><br />[[ASIN:006207105X Partials]]<br />By Dan Wells46190 After: Nineteen Stories of Apocalypse and Dystopia]]<br />By Ellen Datlow<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062024035 Divergent]]<br />By Veronica Roth<br /><br />[[ASIN:006207105X Partials]]<br />By Dan Wells

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I did not expect it to be so fun. Wild animals are awesome and good 4 kinds. Very very cool. Impressive very impressive. I love it alot.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|The game is definitely not what I expected and wanted ,it's not bad they just made it seem a million times better than it actually is , I wouldn't recommend it ,SAVE YOU $$$ . Wish a refund was possible now I  stuck with this shit :'(
0061205699|5.0|Aside from the novel being one of the best ones ever written, the book itself is as classic as the story.  I like it a lot!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The app was really fun. I enjoyed it. Some things were hard to get but it was worth it. I would recommend it to others.
0312427999|5.0|I have given this book the full 5 star rating for a whole raft of good reasons. The book is about what has to be the most important issue of our era - namely, Disaster Capitalism\\" an essentially utterly greed ridden, totally corrupt, economic creed sold with messianic purpose by a major US School of Economics (Chicago) driven by the ideas architect, no less a person than the infamous Milton Friedman and his couterie of apostles. These people supported by successive US administrations and the sinister CIA succeeded in creating the \\"shock doctrine\\" based on an unholy alliance and combination of psychologically based torture based on a dreadful armory of high voltage electroshocks, a cocktail of mind altering drugs, sensory deprivation that would make the Geheim Stats Polizie (GESTAPO) of World War II look like a medieval organization run by amateurs. This is the modern CIA.<br /><br />As Klein so superbly describes, in chronological order, and moreover systematically referenced, the modern day US has morphed, since WW2, into the most frightening and dangerous country on the entire planet, and is responsible for economic ruin of countries, mass poverty, murder (often on a grand scale), genocide, the mass transfer of wealth from the poor (i.e., the general public through the systematic sale of State owned and run enterprises especially vital utilities for pennies on the dollar) to the wealthy elite.<br /><br />So, in summary, the whole thrust of the book is that an essentially utterly bankrupt idea, borne in Chicago by Milton Freidman, has become just one arm of a multi-pronged US International Strategic and Economic Policy and a vital instrument through which they can now control the social and economic development of the entire planet solely for their own benefit and, of course, that if their real lords and masters, the faceless plutocratic elite who operate skillfully behind the scenes. This book is arguably the most important modern work of non fiction written in the last 50 years and is therefore a must read for all human beings who wish to understand the modern world and where we are all headed! It's an extremely scary book and potentially the dynamite needed to destroy the evil system that is enveloping us day by day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm addicted lol I get so excited when I collect new item and especially completing collections, especially playing with new \\"friends\\"! New rooms all the time too.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is really fun for girls who like to do make up. I think they are all fun. try them some time. they are a lot of fun!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I just installed my Chromecast<br /><br />It doesn't work with my I-Pad 2, and don't get me wrong I'm not a Apple fan at all.<br /><br />I do have Logitech Revue-Google TV , and the Google TV kills the Chromecast and it well worth the extra dollars .<br /><br />Chromecast just lacks features, and with the GTV I have a nice keyboard to use too .<br /><br />Google should go ahead and just invest the time and effort into GTV.<br /><br />The Chromecast stick is pretty weak, and there are USB Android drives you can get that have more features.<br /><br />Also just use your laptop you have now and a wireless keyboard and you can save $ 35 bucks.<br /><br />The media has hyped this one up. It's not that good, maybe a year from now, but as we all know Google is the ADHD kids in the tech world and I doubt we will see any major updates.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very colorful and the titles are beautifully styled.  Good game if you just want to relax and take a little mental vaca from the world.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|It was a very fictional, magical and fanciful story. It took a little while for me to get into it but after about 1/4 the way through I was quite hooked on the storyline and was looking forward to see how it played out.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|For the first couple of times it worked amazingly but after a while when I would click on a video it kept saying loading and it would sometimes turn my screen black I think think this app could use a little bit of work that's why I'm giving it 2 stars.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I liked the movie and it was fun to watch.  I would recommend it.  Great twist on an old story.
B00969PR18|3.0|This map takes a lot of time to learn, not sure I figured it out yet.  I think it will be good once I fully understand it all.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you like Science Fiction then you like Star Trek.  The original series is where it all started. It is funny, quirky and sometimes thought provoking.  Only Science Fiction can address those issues that everyone is afraid to talk about.  Packaging was good and the Blue Ray makes everything look clearer.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I purchased uno with friends and found out you have to pay to play. Then I found this app it lets you play online with others for free! It's great and you can also play alone or with others while offline. This is a great app
034580709X|4.0|This is another good book from Jo Nesbo. Like his other Harry Hole books, the pacing is taut, the characters memorable and believable and the descriptions are right on target. Although this was an early book - and just re-released - it is a good one that shows Nesbo at some of his best. Highly recommened.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is fun and gets more challenging the further you advance. So far I really like it. I tried it on my phone first before I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire HD.. Works GREAT on my Kindle and phone!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Never used to like bingo but I absolutely love this awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!! I literally don't ever miss even one day of playing. As I said this game it the bestttt gameeeeee everrrr!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was definitely memorable.  All our favorite characters make appearances but a few will leave us during this Season too.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The author has an incredible story to tell, and one that I think is important for people to hear. I was somewhat disappointed however with the lack of focus of the struggle that was her life. I understand that the cats were important to her and her survival but the details would have been better saved for other things. As a reader I grew bored half way though out the book and then had to feel guilty about it. I just wish there was more for me to learn from her captivity, other than the temperment of her cats.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|Okay, I know some may feel a little  funny about calling on your angels, I know I did. BUT!! I played the game just to see what would happen. My Angels showed up and gave me a tuning. I am now ON LINE to them. They provide me insight and send me the message that is appropriate for me in &#34;real&#34; time. I am Smiling!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The relationships in this book are just not realistic enough. The odds that a mature woman would run off with a half sister she does not like and be pressured into doing drugs is insane. That's just one of the things I had a major issue with. I realize this is a novel but it would be great if while reading I was able to at least pretend this was loosely based on something...no such luck.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|In one word:  Amazing!  JJ does it again - Star Trek Into Darkness is is nothing short of epic.  A fantastic adventure that will appeal (on so many levels) to hard-core fans and newbies alike. I highly recommend this movie!!
B00AG51V8E|3.0|I was really pleased with transaction. The order came quickly, and was in very good condition.<br />The movie it's self was a disappointment to me. When I saw the stars that were in it, I thought it would be MONSTER ACTION FLICK!<br />Not the case at all. It was OKAY, but if I had viewed it in the theaters, I would not have bought it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm not really into games and I find that I don't have the time to play them. I've hardly played this one so I'm not say either it's good or bad
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie surprised me; it's quite good. It's well-paced, gets you thinking, parallels the modern fad of &#34;Law and Order&#34; and &#34;CSI&#34; type style, and it has some phenomenal acting. I didn't see every little twist, so that kept things fresh and entertaining. Definitely recommend!
1451695195|4.0|This is the first time I have read any book like this with such an analytical slant to the data.  Was like listening to a scientist analyze data to prove its worth.  Good book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a very mysterious game, sound track could using changing. It was fun after I got the hang of it, changeling.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|&#34;Upside Down&#34; is enjoyable light entertainment.  After hearing the concept of the movie, I was expecting something with a little more substance, but I still found it fun to watch.  It's more of a seriocomic fantasy than science fiction.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is my favorite app, next to Facebook. It allows me to access my candy crush and bingo blitz materials before they become avail on Amazon.I LOVE IT!
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|This is a movie with a fascinating premise which is, for the most part, well-realized.  It's heavy on the action and violence, but never to the point of detracting from the absorbing storyline.  Taye Diggs was unconvincing; he showed lots of emotion for someone who wasn't supposed to have any.  And how did Angus MacFadyen's character get so power-hungry?  Could it be he was neglecting to take his &#34;interval&#34;?  (The previous sentence will make sense once you see the movie.)  Despite the flaws, I found Equilibrium enjoyable and thought-provoking.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Great show with amazing writing.  once should start at the begining of the series and work through to completely understand
B005LAIH9A|5.0|This was a real awesome movie, Stifler's character is what made the movie, nice to see Oz's character back in the mix!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Well, as accurate as any weather report can be!  Sometimes you can look out the window and tell more about it.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|What a splendid idea; giving us the back story for the wonderful Wizard of Oz.  And what a sad and unfortunate mess was delivered upon that idea.  The characters were thinly drawn and the story careened about in an almost unintelligible manner.<br /><br />James Franco in the role of Oz simply does not carry the vaudevillian weight that Frank Morgan brought to the role in the 1939 original.  And it's hard to imagine Franco growing up to be Morgan.  Further, the writers let Franco down by not giving him much to work with to develop his character.  Franco isn't even on screen for a good part of the 3rd act and is painfully absent for a crucial climax near the end of the film.<br /><br />This film is filled with promise that goes unfulfilled.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game but the is one thing bugging me. When you level up you should get two crystals.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|The product, Amazon's VOD player, played very well. Clear, with no hiccups.<br />The movie itself....Some have said that this was a 'Coming of age' kind of storyline, that it was more about the boy and his difficult life, than the man named Mud. Yes, the film did focus on the boy more, but it equally focused on Mud and his hard life. The acting was superb. The cinematography was at times beautiful, as well as dark and gritty. The soundtrack was very, very subtle, allowing the viewer to hear the surroundings, making it even more realistic. For parents and those concerned about the rating: There are no nude scenes. No sex scenes. Yet there is a boat-load of foul language. No 'F' bomb that I heard, yet within the first 10 minutes of the film I counted 9 'S' words alone; after counting to 15 I stopped keeping track, and a slew of other foul words just kept on from there. It was just too much foul language, and really not needed. Also quite a bit of gun violence, with people being shot at close range. Boys fighting each other, a grown man punching a boy in the face. Sex references, including porn magazines, and references to girls breasts.<br />Spoiler Alert....For me this movie can be summed up in one word, tragic. No happy endings here. Ellis the boy ends up with the life he didn't want. His father ends up with the life he didn't want. When you start to care about Mud, you then learn that his trials were all for nothing and in the end he doesn't learn a thing. You are lead to care about Mud's girlfriend Juniper, only to dislike her later. The characters seem to be thrown together at which point they all experience tragedies and hard times, then they all sort of go their own way, and life goes on with no one really happy (or caring) about anything. Two hours of unhappiness, dirt, violence, and foul language.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|I don't normally touch fantasy books, but this series just begged to be read. And I'm glad I did. It is epic in in its scope and its storytelling. Located in the fictional realm of Westeros, it follows the trials and tribulations of the major houses of the seven kingdoms. As well action takes place on the other major continent, home to the free cities and the dothraki. The prose I found had started to become a little slow and ponderous in the 4th and 5th books, like the author couldn't quite figure out how to get where he wants to go. By the end of the 5th book I was throwing my hands up in the air thinking, WHY?!! WHY couldn't you have cut out 80% of the last 2 books & just had these last few chapters.. AND WHY isn'y Daenaerys in Westeros yet????(Sorry that was a minor spoiler!)<br /><br />If you like fantasy and you love stories that have real depth as well as action and adventure, this is the series for you. A warning though, if you get attached to characters, this is NOT the series for you. Mr Martin loves to kill characters off and he does it with ruthless abandon. And if you are someone who can't wait to find out how it all ends (like me) wait until the last 2 books come out. The wait is already driving me crazy!  Finally, if he kills off Daenaerys I will be upset (didn't you hear the uproar from the Red Wedding episode of the TV series?!! Although that didn't come from me.. that came from the millions of viewers who had never read the books!)!
0060557818|4.0|This is my first Neil Gaiman book, but likely not my last.  Highly original writer, yet extremely approachable.  A fun read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|More twists, turns and surprises than can be predicted.  The plot just keeps getting thicker.  Complex characters just keep evolving and changing.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The book gives interesting insights into the life of Tesla. In addition the author provides the reader with his own more general comments and views of life. For people who who are only interested in Tesla these comments may not work so well. All in all I find this book to be a good read.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I can not wait to read the remainder of the series!!! My husband is a truck driver and uses audio books while he drives. I have to keep him quiet so he doesn't ruin the story lines for me. I am downloading the next book immediately.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|If you start watching with this show, you will become addicted.  AMAZING!  Love the characters, twists and turns.  Highly recommend
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Wow!  Real science fiction for a change.  If you love real science fiction, give this one a watch.  Once the twist happens you're hooked.  I'd say more but don't want to spoil it.
B000J025AE|4.0|Well, there goes any plans I had for a cruise in my lifetime. And after current events in real life, I've pretty much decided to stay a land lubber until I die. But, it is a decent movie, if you're ok with lots of people dying and being scarred for life. Don't watch if you're planning a cruise. Or on one.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Easy watching relaxing old TV is so much better than any put out now or even in the last ten years
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game. Its so addicting.  Mobility ware did a great job with this free app. You can change number of suits, choose to have either a random deal or winning deal. Personally I love knowing its at least possible to win. If I'm going to waste my precious time playing a pointless game i'd rather have at least a shot of winning.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've already read the first 4 and find book 5 to be one of the best.  This series is so popular, not sure if really needs reviewing!
0425263916|4.0|Was pretty good, just purchased the last book in the series from Sylvia Day. Have passed on books to a friend to also read.
146920231X|3.0|The author speaks at a very high level. The books serves to get you motivated onto making money, but does not delve into too much details on how to do it. The few how-to's are very common sensical. Overall the book is a good first step towards your long stair of financial success.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Cool movie from the start to finish, Love all the action and wild plot. Never read the comic but like the movie.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Very good intense series. Big fan of all the Hannibal movies and this series brings a great psychological thriller to the table.
B002LESNES|5.0|Always been one of my favorites with John Wayne and Maureen O. These two are great together and this movie is full of fun and laughs.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Sometimes frustrating, but fun. Takes me time to figure out where everything is, which is a good thing. Challenging, frustrating, fun
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Full of fun and action. Be ready for a wild ride from start to finish. Not quite as good as the first.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works well for accessing your desktop pc (and its additional processing power) using a tablet or kindleHD asound the house. It streams the audio and video from your computer and sends your touch inputs back to your pc.<br /><br />Even though my kindle has native apps for things like Netflix. I actually sometimes prefer to run them remotely through this. That way I can surf the web or do other multitasking type things while watching or listening. Not to mention it allows you to view sites that require flash like twitch.tv with no native support on kindle. It makes my $150 kindle HD feel like a very powerful computer ( provided I'm at home on my WiFi network)<br /><br />if you have a wireless pc gmaepad you can play games like Skyrim on your tablet/kindlehd. Works really well.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Of all the Mahjong games I've downloaded, this is the one I go back to and play the most. Definitely a favorite.

B008C1O8CA|5.0|Came in perfect quality, works great, etc. . Good album, not the best, but not bad. Would recommend to friends.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun fun fun just needs more levels. Kids love it and I (adult) also. It's a bit frustrating that u have to either work so hard to earn coins or u have to buy them  Otherwise it's a great game.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Restore your faith in people and love  of family saw the movie the book was way better you feel more connected.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Almost all ages can play, and every game has its own kick. I would most certainly suggest this game to friends and family. Another thing I like is its just not the same thing over and over, to top it off it kind of reminds me of old games from the 80's and 90's.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I have not read the Harry Potter Books, though my grandchildren love them. Decided to read this mystery of hers. It is an interesting book and a good mystery. I did have a little problem with the British words and accents, but I did enjoy it for the most part. Adult readers of The Harry Potter Books would surely enjoy it. Definitly not for young people.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Excellent product would recommend this item.  I use to listen to CD's.  Fit over the ears well without pain to the side of your head.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Not big on fiction, but because there was a lot of factual details intertwined, it allowed the what if factor to go in and out of play here and held my interest and intrigue right to the end.
0345803485|2.0|Cheesy sums it up. It doesn't thrill me when I read it, no surprises, more like eye rolling situations, I think this is a good fantasy book for people who are vanilla.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I know they are novels but if PG was writing back when I was attending school, I probably would have enjoyed History Better.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I really love Lady Gaga and have wanted to buy this DVD for a long time. I bought it at a GREAT price and shipping was fast! Very satisfied! :)
B00DDRKDUO|5.0|Watain have made a lifetime out of Black Metal, and strangely now on their least Black Metal album of all, has the band really hit the utmost essence of their own sound. Lawless Darkness was a fantastic re-imagining of Dissection, but this album feels authentically original. The slower passages and more subdued moments augment Watain's usual rip roaring blackened thrill ride, and there are sung vocals which against my better judgement, I'm forced to praise for their authenticity and judicious placement. The actual Black Metal elements the band employs are much more frenetic and oddly timed than previous albums, adding to the band's own sense of self and individuality. This new found confidence provides the actual musical merit the band needed to secure the reigns of actual most dangerous band on the planet! This is a musical compliment to their blood soaked live show, and a call to all to worship at the altar of Watain. I'll be glad to be facialized by gallons of bovine blood from these forward thinking Swedish radicals. European Blackness is on these guys' collectively stinky shoulders, and it couldn't be on more secure ground. Even with a ballad on the album...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked the book<br />It was very interesting as I was sad and scared at the same time I loved it
B000JMLKCG|5.0|Hardy creates a main character who is motivated by pride and jealousy to do despicable deeds but still never loses the sympathy of the reader, maybe because the reader recognizes these traits in him/herself.

B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter loves this game!! Very interactive and fun! Only wish there was more to do in the free edition.
0446579939|5.0|It was shipped faster than I had expected, and I was able to track it easily. I am very satisfied there are only two marks on the inside cover but the pages are in perfect condition. It came exactly as described. I think I will continue to buy my books from this company. I am very satisfied.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park is a edgier story about being 16 and hopelessly in love. I myself am 16 and enjoyed this book not only because it was relatable but because it was very different than other romance novels. At times I was really frustrated while reading but I don't want to say too much and ruin it.<br />Two words: buy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire app is the best. I tried several before downloading this one to my smart phone. You have the choice to either play a random or winning hand or best one to play with someone via internet.  Card movement is smooth and cards and background are changeable. When I received my kindle fire HD,  this was the first app I looked for and downloaded.. great app mobility ware.

B00COGY2P2|3.0|Mr. Cruise was greatly tempered in this action film perhaps due to too much screen<br />play editing from a much better book? I would watch a sequel if there was a change<br />of a better screen play or extended movie.
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|I am a big Bruce Campbell fan, so I was excited for this movie to come out. It wasn't as good as I'd hoped. But for people who haven't seen the original and don't have means for comparison, you'll definitely be enetertained.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Very fun game, but I have already gone through all the puzzles. Why did you stop at 4 levels, red, green, white, black?
B001C1066E|3.0|The item arrived and everything was okay, until I opened the pouch. There frog is overstuffed and there is no room for much storage in coins. I love the Anime show and i wanted the same pouch that Naruto carried around during his travels. The pouch looks a lot like the anime which is why it gets a 3 and not a 1 star. I would suggest buying this if its going to be used as a toy, or for cosplay. DO NOT BUY if you are planning to use it as a pouch to carry around some extra coins.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very, very skilfully plotted! I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, so I won't say more than that the author is extremely clever at misleading the reader. However, I am not entirely sure that the ending is quite convincing.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Great movie!  I would definitely reccomend this...gives you a different view on the world of sushi...def one i never thought of before.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. Good plot, good characters, the gradual revelation of past secrets made for suspense, I wanted to know how things would turn out.
B008458O3S|4.0|it is a challenging game i enjoy having to work at finding  the solution and as it gets more difficult i like it more
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thought this was a great, well-written book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a historical fiction.

B00594XOZU|3.0|I love the app but wish it was like the cell phone version I hope kik keeps making additions to the app and it will be preferable
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I like that the author emphasizes the fact that his scientific knowledge and background made him seriously questioned what had happened to him. I also liked that despite the overpowering scientific approach he always had, he cannot not believe what he experienced. He is convinced that life after life does exist. Because of my own experiences, I have been looking for proof of heaven all my life and he is the first one to convey to me that we are spiritual being having a human experience.<br />The reason I give this book only 3 stars is because I would have liked to see more content about what happened in the afterlife. The author writes mainly about his own life, what physically happened to him and how his family coped when he was in a coma. He described the medical aspect in detail while I was longing to hear more about the experience itself.<br />That said, it did give me answers that I had been seeking for so many years and for that alone I like the book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I've been looking at this one for a while. My main concern was that it was a pandemic rip off and that I can play pandemic online free. When I got my 500 coins free, I decided to try it.<br /><br />One thing I really like about this game is how in depth it is. It has a lot more countries than pandemic, for one. Another great thing is the logic in this game. If people are just sneezing and coughing, no one is gonna close their borders. Also you can make it harder for them to make a cure by suddenly developing a new strain. Also you get to pick where you start. I always choose Madagascar, since it is hard to infect. Countries have different traits. You need to have drug resistance if you want to infect a rich country, and airborne diseases do best in hot, dry countries.<br /><br />Over all, great game. totally worth the buck, and air better than pandemic.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|We are not movie watchers, but this one caught my attention, my husband really liked this movie, the first plus was it was not 2 and half hours long, 98 min. was good.  Actors were good and the movie plot was different. It kept our attention for the entire movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I saw some reviews from others, saying that Facebook only uploads about 10 statuses. Well, I have a Kindle Fire HD and Facebook works perfectly fine. I have no problems with it, other than one thing. When I'm messaging more than one person, I'll get done typing a message, then go to the other friend that I'm messaging. So, when I do that, it will get slow and most of the time stops and a little thing will come up saying &quot;Facebook is not responding.&quot;, and it will have two choices; 'Wait', or 'Close'. It gets on my nerves, but this app is good besides the problem I'm experiencing.

B00B2QA646|4.0|First, I have to say that even before watching this film, all of our expectations are super heightened.  This is one of the most beloved love stories of all time, so I can see off the get-go why some people were disappointed.  The vehicle goes in a different direction, but you get to where you are going.  The story has not changed, the spine of the story is there.  Please keep in mind that this is a British film, the Brits don't explain each little nuance, you have to use a process of deduction.  Don't want to go through all the trouble?  This isn't the film for you, but it is beautifully presented.<br />I watched this movie almost all in fast forward late one night.  I didn't think it was great, and I thought the concept was strange, with the theater stage and all.  Then, a few days later I decided to watch it again. The second time I really enjoyed it, I love this story, who doesn't?? Humans are flawed. agree or disagree with Anna, you will go back and forth.  This was a creative take, but it is worth watching for the acting, costumes, scenery and unique view of the novel.  I think Kiera Knightly was a little young to play Anna, but she is an excellent actress, with a great emotional range, and I am not sure who else could have pulled it off, not many other young actresses are of her caliber, able to play such diverse roles.  Jude Law was FLAWLESS as a stern Karenin, you will actually feel sorry for him, and Aaron Johnson had a good slant on Vronsky, pompous at first, but then bemused with Anna, and how his whole look changed from the beginning to the end, from drop dead gorgeous and confident, to worried and tense at the end, and you saw how the affair aged him prematurely.  The other stories tied in nicely, with some good actors that you haven't seen everywhere (thankfully), and the dancing scenes were beautifully choreographed, with the flavor of the Russian ballet woven in.  Yes, the story is imaginative, you will see, but that is what gives you the hook, you are never sure what is coming.  You need to use your brain with this movie, that is what I liked.  It is not always spelled out for you.<br />I felt for these actors after I watched it, as it had to be a challenging movie to make and live up to, realizing that everyone was going to tear it apart, I would imagine expectations were so high, NOTHING would ever be good enough for critics and die hard fans of the story, but kudos to them for re-making this movie AGAIN!  As a historical fan, I appreciate a movie like this, it wasn't 100% accurate, but they put a lot of effort into this movie.  I only give it 4 stars because I wanted to see more Russian elements woven in, including the dress of the period.  Still, it is worth watching, but you may need to watch it twice.are never sure what is coming.  You need to use your brain with this movie, that is what I liked.

B00DB624GS|5.0|It's taken 44 years for this original 1969 UK LP version of \\"Then Play On\\" to finally appear on CD!  This was the swan song album of the original Fleetwood Mac founded by Peter Green in 1967.  This final incarnation of this group included Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer & Danny Kirwan (guitar & vocals), John McVie (bass) and Mick Fleetwood (drums).<br />Since the earlier days of CD we have had to be content with the inferior American version of this album.  This new remaster of \\"Then Play On\\" reflects the multitrack technology of the time.  It was not a very dynamic sounding recording in the first place, however this new digital transfer gives us what's on the master tapes with more punch.  At last we have the original 54 minute edit of the UK LP running order along with bonus tracks of the last two 45 singles from this group, \\"Oh Well\\" (Parts 1 & 2), \\"The Green Manalishi (with the Two Prong Crown)\\" and \\"World in Harmony\\".  The total playing time for this new CD reissue with it's original feel and segues is a generous 69:53.  All tracks are Stereo except for \\"Oh Well\\" (in it's original mono mix).  Also included in the booklet are 8 pages of fascinating new liner notes and graphics.<br />\\"Then Play On\\", one of the masterpiece British albums of the late 60's, alongside John Mayall's \\"Bare Wires\\", demonstrated how the British blues movement had evolved into a polished art form all of it's own.  The darkness of \\"Then Play On\\" anticipates the murkiness of \\"Exile on Main St.\\" by the Rolling Stones 3 years hence.  We will never know where this Fleetwood Mac might have gone next...<br />This is a desert island disc.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|And this movie has lived up to expectations. It's a little bit of a mind-f*ck, but an entertaining movie and when I received it, the case and disc were pristine.
1608871827|5.0|I can't put this book down. Visually stunning and the detail that went into creating this work is amazing. From concept art, behind the scenes photos and detailed anecdotes, this book is a 'Pacific Rim' dream companion. I only wish it were twice as big because I didn't want this book to end!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love all four Alien movies and I was looking for something that had all of them and this was more than I expected. Having both versions of all the movies, plus extras is fantastic.<br />The case is beautiful and was in prime condition, and it doesn't even bother me that when fully open, it has to be at least five feet long. All the discs were scratch free and in place, something that's rare with big collections as a disc or two tends to fall out of it's spot during travel.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|This player has a great interface and a superb equalizer. It gives you a choice between high and low quality equalizers, and also adds control of your pre-amp. It makes it easy to find your music in a large collection. Altogether, highly recommended.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|For someone who likes explosions like I do, I found this movie to be fascinatingly intense and the plot well developed. It wasn't really a &#34;save the world, cure everyone&#34; movie, which was great in terms of real consequences to a &#34;contagion&#34; and I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />The case and disc were brand new as described by Amazon.
B0054TKB8I|3.0|I know one of the cast members of Teen Wolf and decided, out of loyalty to him, that I would give the series a viewing. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't inspired either. It is for kids, of course, and I can't speak to how kids will view it. But, as a film professional, I felt that certain features of the series were questionable.<br /><br />First, the series is rather simplistic: boy gets bitten, boy gains super powers but is hunted, boy and his hunter fall in love. Oh, my! What a quandary.<br /><br />Second, most of the student cast is too old. The girl who plays the love interest is so obviously in her mid to late twenties that her love scenes with the (very good) Tyler Posey (the lead) seem just a touch creepy to me. But, that's just one person's opinion, of course.<br /><br />Third, the lead actor's antagonist is also a little old for high school. But, worse, he WANTS to become a werewolf (to gain super powers). The other aspects of the werewolf's life ( murdering animals and people, inability to control yourself, being hunted by monster killers) don't seem to bother him. I found this difficult to believe.<br /><br />So, not a great show, but not the worst I've seen. Good luck to the actor I know.

B00821OW8K|5.0|This is a really great series with an engaging story and good character development. This is definitely a character-driven show. One of the things I really like about this series is that there isn't a lot of unnecessary \\"filler\\" action just to create tension or to make up for a lack of narrative. This is not to say that there is no action, indeed there is, but the action functions as part of the narrative instead of the other way around.
B00D6MJOAQ|2.0|It's been a long long wait for this one, and I have to say, after hearing it and listening quite a few times, I'm sorry I believed the hype. Truth be told, this album makes Headphase sound amazing, which isn't saying much. I hate dissing these guys, being a longtime fan from the days before they were even signed to Warp, but it's all mediocre at best. Something is definitely missing, and I don't get the feeling I have when listening to timeless albums and eps such as Music Has the Right, Hi Scores, and In a Beautiful Place. I don't get those chills listening to this album. In fact, it's pretty depressing and unremarkable, uninspired even. There's too much good music in a similar vein as the latest BOC that's actually a lot better. I highly recommend listening to superb but highly underrated artists such as Milieu/Brian Grainger,<br />Locust/Mark Van Hoen, Signaldrift, and Discoverer for starters.

140006922X|5.0|I have to admit that I was drawn to Zealot by watching Green's interview of the author on Fox.  I am interested in all manner of history, including history of religions, but I am not a scholar.  I do enjoy well-written prose and, based solely on the quality of the writing and the new information - for me - about Jesus and early Christians, I heartily urge everyone to read this book.  It can easily be read in a weekend.<br /><br />Putting Jesus into context was illuminating for me.  I understand the place of crucifiction in Roman governance; I learned of the schools of James and of Paul; and I can see why Christianity, as formed by Paul's efforts, became acceptable to the Roman Empire.  Learning of Paul's place in the development of Christianity added color to my experience of visiting Ephesus in Turkey (Ionia) and seeing the amphitheater in which Paul spoke to the Ephesians.<br /><br />There are more elegant reviews, here, and I would urge you to read them.  Don't stop there, however.  Read Zealot.

Through the process of learning to cook, the reader learns how to learn all over again, the right way. It's made me more goal-conscious, more capable in picking up skills, and also an enthusiastic culinary student. Can't recommend enough and love Ferriss's vision!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Straits' eponymous first album was recorded at Basing Street studios in West London in February 1978, for a reported £12,500. Though now recognised as a strong contender for the best debut album ever from any rock/blues band, the dominance of the popular music scene at the time by the nihilistic and ultimately disposable `New Wave' meant that this recording was initially drowned out by the surrounding noise, so its  reputation grew only slowly.<br /><br />The original band was a classic R&B quartet: band leader-singer-songwriter-guitarist Mark Knopfler, his brother David on rhythm guitar, Mark's flatmate John Ilsley on bass and drummer Pick Withers.<br /><br />The music is tight with a sound stripped down and clean; the songs distinctive and in style redolent at times of JJ Cale, the arrangements straightforward and unpretentious. Mark's Fender Strat and growling (somewhat Dylanesque) vocal dominate the action, over a capable rhythm section with a deep love of their rock/blues roots. They sound like a good pub-band on a Saturday night, with the mojo in overdrive. The whole album is a joy from beginning to end.<br /><br />Lyrically the songs are a cut above your average R&B fare, with Mark's Tyneside roots evident in the themes and a laconic humour spicing the slice-of-life stories told from the perspective of an observer, very much in the style of Bob Dylan. `Sultans of Swing' later became the album's mega-hit and perennial DS stage-favourite, but originally was just one track among the rest with no plans to release as a single for radio-play.<br /><br />DS went on to international success in the 1980s with five follow-up albums and a few personnel changes, the arrangements becoming more lengthy and inventive whilst remaining true to their original sound. But even their mega-selling 1985 album `Brothers in Arms' never really topped this, the sensational 1978 debut; it has an honesty and simplicity close to perfection.

B0046B3QTG|5.0|good price for a good movie that we had to have for our collection. I'm going to keep writing because amazon thinks I should write more even though I have nothing more to say.
B0030BYWKU|5.0|I like Jason Derulo's music and think he is cool.  Every song in this collection is very enjoyable.  I definitely enjoyed this collection of his music.
B00867GJYK|5.0|We have always loved this movie. Great for parents and kids! This price is crazy awesome to, no reason not to take a deal like that!
B0052YAKS6|5.0|It's true his music is explicit but it is cool and exciting.  His music is great for dancing at home and clubbing.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|this an oldie and a goodie! and for the price, I couldn't refuse! That's the end of my review but I am supposed to keep typing for some reason.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|As Bruno Mars is very talented, I enjoy his music immensely.  This CD is one of his best as far as I am concerned.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Enjoyed this movie and I usually do not like Tom Cruise but this is a enjoyable movie to watch.  You will like it...
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I wish I had known that the quality of the film would be diminished by not buying it in HD.  There was no chance to change that choice, once I made the decision to go with the other version, which in the end looked like it was pirated from asia.  This is a sad thing to watch when the quality sucks.  Next time I will want to see two choices to view in the trailer format to see which one looks and sounds better.  Sometimes in the past even with HD the quality of a video does not meet the standard that one would expect when viewing a film.  All this aside as an avid Trekkie I would highly recommend the film as it is very well made and the acting is superb.
B008Y5UADK|4.0|I received some good information. I don't have any complaint. However, I forgot the main theme. Well I may watch it again
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very engaging read. Learned so much about Tesla, sadly little known in our celebrity obsessed culture. Tips on using imagination may be very helpful.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I'm in a sales environment and this definitely gives you ways to challenge yourself.  It gives you ideas to move your customer, your coworkers, and you.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|I bought the CD for a couple of specific songs, hoping the rest of the CD would enchant me as much as these two songs did.  I was a little disappointed.  But the prompt delivery from the seller was nice.

B002RI9M2U|4.0|Overall I found this book to be compelling reading; almost voyeuristic as you journey with Hannah and Clay as they relive the last 2 years of Hannah’s life and the events that led to her ultimate suicide.<br /><br />I loved this book because it highlighted how our actions can have such huge, unintended, reverberating consequences. Thoughtless words can haunt a person. But at the same time a kind word or compassionate act can be that little thing that just keeps a person going, that turns a life around. We just never know.<br /><br />I also loved that the book explored suicide. Some reviewers have questioned Hannah’s reasons, indicating they were not “strong enough” to justify suicide. But rumination of “little things” can and does snowball. And the snowball can literally roll out of control as it does here.<br /><br />At first Hannah “dabbles” with her thoughts, not even daring to utter the suicide word. But as events spiral and she loses control, the emptiness and disconnection grows. The thought of dying gradually takes more shape until she sees it as the only option.<br /><br />Hannah reaches out. She wants someone to help her find a reason for living. But it is at this point that the book really jars. Mr Porter is Hannah’s guidance counsellor and she turns to him for help. Their conversation, word for word, is replayed. And we find a counsellor who is defensive. A counsellor who says “don’t tell me you don’t have friends Hannah”.  Basically a counsellor who does not want to listen, understand, empathise or really get involved. As with every profession, there are varying degrees of practitioners. But Mr Porter’s handling of Hannah’s plea is so inept, clumsy and unprofessional that it just seems too improbable to be possible. It proves to be a real discord to the rest of the book.<br /><br />Hannah’s actions also seem contrary and may annoy some readers. She clearly gives Mr Porter the biggest test of all, but offers him vague answers and little to work with. True he is inept, but she almost snatches this up and encourages it. Hannah wants us to believe that she is a person who has truly shut down, who has disconnected, and has nothing left to offer. If this is true then the whole premise that Hannah could put such an elaborate plan in place with the tapes whilst so empty does not ring true.<br /><br />Instead we see a person who is vengeful, unforgiving and blaming. Hannah preaches about how inconsequential acts can have meaning and matter. Yet the tapes are the ultimate weapon that will haunt the listeners for the rest of their lives. Clearly she wants revenge and the reverberation from her single, malicious act will be bigger than any of the 13 unintended reasons.<br /><br />Despite this Thirteen Reasons is very engaging – it would be of real benefit if added to a high school reading list and the opportunity was given for active classroom discussion.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I just purchased a Nikon D-7000 but found that my sb-600 flash was too large and bulky and that I rarely used it.  The SB-400 is a perfect match for my new camera and I use it quite often and am very pleased with the results.  I  am a casual photographer and this camera and my new flash meet my needs.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've seen other people comment on how this book truthfully shows the lives of those with cancer and how they deal with it, but this is not a cancer book. This book is a wonderfully written tale of two people who find love in a most impossibly possible situation. It is a story filled with tears, and lots of laughter, and sadness, and truth, and it is beautiful.<br /><br />-a fellow nerdfighter.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I read this book because everybody was talking about theTV series! I had first watched the first episode of season 1 and decided it was too brutal for me but I was willing to read the book so that it might change my opinion about it. I really wanted to know why the series is so well received and is even awarded prizes!!<br />And, reading the book was actually quite interesting although it tookme a while to get into the storyline and the politics!<br />Now I have started reading part two and will soon give the tv series another chance hoping it won't scare me somuch anymor since I am well prepared now ;)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing, I laughed, I cried, this is probably the best book you could ever read. Very heartwarming, and has some good advice that we could all use.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I love the story and how it helps shed light on a subject that people don't necessarily want to know about or have talked about.

B007AL48UK|5.0|the VERY best mahjong ever. I love playing this game. Very easy to play and attention consuming. I recommend to all Mahjong players.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|In a nutshell, this book is thought-provoking. It wasn't a perfect read. Some of the chapters could have been fleshed out more, but I can see how most of this stuff would be difficult to recall. The fact that the author was able to recall as much as he did is impressive. But without a doubt this book influences how I think about life and death. Is this the definitive statement on near-death experiences? No, and one would be naive to take it all at face-value. But his experiences are worth taking into consideration and incorporating into our own belief systems about what the bigger picture of life may be.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Highly addictive game, I am not usually in to games like this but I absolutely love it I haven't put it down. I would recommend it
B0099114WO|1.0|This is a film to avoid. While the acting is first class, the script is miserable. It is based on the non-existent sex life of a long-married couple and their disgusting therapist.  Wanna know about the great oral sex the couple is missing?  And then there's the sound track: It is surely the worst in any movie with distinguished actors.  And where was the much touted comedy? I saw not a trace of it.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I enjoyed the trial version a lot,so I decided to pay for the full version.  I really liked the puzzles and the story line.  I felt that five dollars was a bit much for what I consider a short game,but it was well made.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Not a waste of money at all.
0812982622|4.0|What an intriguing book! I love it! Well-written and with an amazing plot. However, one aspect of it disturbs me and the editor is to be blamed, not Mr. Johnson. That is proper fact checking. I know Texas well. The geographic references are completely off base. The Korean plane flies into Abilene, which is in the Panhandle of Texas. Next we are told that they are in Odessa In Central Texas. Odessa is in West Texas and shares an airport with Midland. Odessa is 170 miles from Abilene, a 2 1/2 hour drive.<br /><br />There is also an amazing similarity between the activities that were forced upon the visiting Koreans and a description I read last week of the German president's visit to the LBJ ranch in December of 1963. The barbeque dinner menu is not really authentic. I am not accusing Johnson of plagiarism by any means. The Korean stamp he places on the ranch visit is fantastic, the tables defaced with initials, for example. The description of culture shock and the failure to understand each other's culture is superb.<br /><br />I love all of this, but to someone who is familiar with the area, it is jarring, and makes me wonder how many other errors there are about subjects I don't know. I am forcing myself to practice willing suspension of disbelief because I love this book. Editing in general has become increasingly sloppy. Authors like this don't deserve sloppy editors.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|that was the best book i have ever read in my life!!!!!!!!!! i would read this all my life if i had too
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie good special effec!! all the stars really shined in this awesome movie I would highly recommend watching it
144235948X|5.0|I was on the lookout for a good book and decided to get this one after reading reviews.  I really liked it.. took me only a couple of days in between work and regular house duties to get through it.  I just kept wanting to continue on with the book once it was done.
1401941893|1.0|way to short. Mirada has good ideas but they are short, she writs a paragraph per idea, i wish she could show examples
B006ZS4SHC|4.0|The helicopter is great and my son loves it and he is still raving about the helicopter he has built using the pieces. Why I give 4 stars is ......when the package arrived the box was damaged and some pieces were missing...probably lost in transit.

0762451319|5.0|I ordered this to compliment my City of Bones merch and my Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices books. Everything is bundled into a neat tiny box. I especially love the necklace. I am a little lady, so it was just long enough that the rune hung between my collar bones. As others have said, the necklace is worth the entire set on its own.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked this book very much, because of it's unusual story. Not that some random kid is going to save the human kind, but the way he does. That he doesn't know what's he doing until the very end. I liked the ending too, a little mystery :) It's not ordinary sci-fi cliche, and I would recommend it to every sci-fi lover ;)
B004DH8IK0|5.0|I heard Salt In The Wounds on a popular internet radio website and instantly fell in love with Pendulum's sound. I listened to every bit of the album and honestly it's the only CD I keep in my car. It'll definitely get you moving and feeling like you're on top of the world. I really don't know what else to say other than just try to listen to all the samples and see for yourself how quality this music is.
B0053B347M|4.0|Powered through a usb port, except depending on how far your monitor is away from the usb port you might find it difficult to get this thing to the back of your monitor.<br /><br />Also, you might find some difficulty having it stick to the back of your monitor. I clean the back of my monitor with a microfiber cloth before putting it on. This was when I had my desktop right next to my monitor, there was slack so the thing couldn't have came off because the line was too tight.<br /><br />I'm going to order another one and try my luck, hopefully it would stay on, because i really like this product. The leds are bright, not sure how well bias lighting works on my eyes, but I set my computer to run power to my usb even when its off. At night these work great as a guide light. They're soft enough that I can sleep with them on (that might just be me), but whenever i need to get up in the middle of the night to empty myself. The lighting from these guys really help me get around.<br /><br />Do they work when looking at the screen in the dark, my girlfriend says they do. She says her eyes do not feel as tired. Her eyes however are worst than mines, so if she says they help her I'm glad i made this investment.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I really liked this app. It is sometimes challenging but fun. My mother even played this game and she doesn't play a lot of games.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I used this product to scan about 1100 black and white negatives.  It got the job done, but the resulting files seem slightly out of focus, and have less detail than scans I made from prints made from the same negatives.  I was vaguely disappointed with the quality I was getting while I was doing the scans, but the device made scanning a relatively painless process, so I kept going.  Only later did I find some matching scans of paper prints and really see the loss of quality I was getting from the negative scans.  I'm keeping the scans and the device since the results are almost adequate, but if I were to do it all again I'd probably buy a better unit or have them professionally scanned.<br /><br />Also, I agree with other reviewers that the negative carriers get scratched much too quickly.  Thankfully you can order replacements. I went through 9 of them.<br /><br />A comparison of a photo print I scanned and a scan of the scan negative using this product is linked below.<br /><br />[...]

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is just the right size and I am able to sharpen just about all of my knives. They all work well with this little guy and it really is worth looking into if you want an inexpensive knife sharpener.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond fan since Dr No. At the first viewing of this at the megaplex I was let down. Wasn't the usual bigger than life thing. Was more subdued. Bond's, and M's personal journey's an important part of the story, a dip into the cold blunt realities of life. Not exactly the regular spy fantasy romp. The second viewing, in my home, made it personal for me. Maybe a feeling difficult to get in a crowded theatre, hungry for action, not reflection. At my age and position in life, I could relate to M and Bond. There is enough of the Bond thing to satisfy, but there is also a need to swim in deeper waters. Look forward to where they go next.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Game is more than worth the download. Very similar to online poker! Great graphics. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I do not like the way the game points are distributed. As with many new games that connect with Facebook, this game wants to you make in app purchases. Otherwise, this game is easy to use and fun to play. With optional help prompts and short wait time, this game is great for all levels of UNO players!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|It was a compelling read, both scary and insightful at the same time.  The final meeting between the mother and son blew me away.  What transired in that conversation was shocking, but it was a fitting end for the story.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I thought it was informative and well written.  Kind of fills in the blanks from the other books. I look forward to the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|5  stars would give more if possible. Maggie Smith is awesome.  She makes it come alive.  I hope she never dies in the story.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Though I find it disturbing and especially the ending.  You are just never sure whether he is guilty or not.  I can however, relate to the undying love and devotion of his father.  That was the best part about the book.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The characters are quirky and cool, but believable. I look forward to more books from this author. I highly recommend it.

0448444216|5.0|I bought this book for my classroom and the children enjoy it very much!  I have several children who tell me this book is their favorite. I bought this used so there was a little more wear than I would like on the outside covers but in perfect condition on the inside.
1454901276|3.0|The best part of this book is the Outer Hebridean setting, on the Isle of Lewis (off the west coast of Scotland). I've been there, but found the place so profoundly depressing I left after one day - it's bleak, and even when you walked into a pub, the unhappiness in the air made you want to immediately leave.<br /><br />The author does a good job of describing the Isle of Lewis, but his history in television is reflected in this book, which was rejected by many publishers before finally being accepted. And no wonder. There's really not much attention paid to the murder mystery -- instead, it's one of those coming of age stories that men may like more than women (the message seems to be that you need to do something dangerous and bloody to be a man, and then there's all this father-son stuff). The center of the story is a male rite of passage on Lewis: the annual harvesting of 2000 fledgling sea birds -- in two weeks -- which serves as a coming of age rite for the protagonist of this story, I ended up skimming most of that - not interest in hearing the details, which distressed me and were irrelevant to the story anyway.<br /><br />The protagonist detective is Fin MacLoud, who grew up Gaelic-speaking on this island, is now an Edinburgh police detective, and returns to Lewis to investigate a murder that resembles one he investigated in Edinburgh. In the tradition of Scottish mysteries, the detective's superiors don't like him, and he's a maverick (a la Rebus). Fin's young son has very recently died, and returning to the place of his youth triggers a lot of memories of his youth. The present day chapters are interspersed with chapters recounting Fin's past (beginning with his first day at school as a child). Needless to say, the past and present all tie together and his memories help him solve the murder.<br /><br />But it's incredible - in the worst way and very contrived. In the great tradition of novels, Fin is pretty much an orphan with little family. Fin, an onlychild, is orphaned at age 8 (nobody in this book dies of old age) -- and his aunt who raises him doesn't love him and provides a cold home. She dies while he's still young, leaving him alone. Fin is not the only child: they seem to abound in a book full of odd families and unlikable people. Four characters fall from great heights, either to their death or severe injury. Descriptions of the weather (almost always foul) abound - Gothic weather. Everyone drinks too much and too often (that's probably realistic), or they smoke marijuana. The women are two dimensional,and serve mainly as props or for men to compete over.  I found a troubling attitude toward them by the men -- one woman screaming rape is described as engaging in \\"wishful thinking.\\" Another woman who says she has been raped must be lying. There's lots of fighting, between men of the same age, and father-son relationships are at best absent.<br /><br />By halfway through the book, I felt like I was watching a Gaelic soap opera. Maybe this is really a men's book - or someone who doesn't like a well-plotted mystery, but prefers a focus on conflict between characters in a novel. If you're interested in the Hebrides, it's definitely worth a read. And it did make me want to go back and give the place another chance.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|It is a good and captivating book. Some parts are beautifully written but these are not constant. The different cararcters and situations seem not always to belong to the same book. Not enough coherence..<br />I can still advise it as a holiday book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My stepdaughter brought a copy up for us to watch one weekend, and I thought it was really outstanding in staging and performance.  Have been to a stage performance (in Chicago) and have seen versions of 25th anniversary on TV.  The staging - because it really is handled as a movie - is much more in depth, and also explains the back-stories better.  Performances were stunning.  I read criticism of Russell Crowe but felt his performance (a really uptight, rigid personality) was appropriate.  If you'regoing to get a copy of Le Mis, get this one.

0062014536|4.0|Requiem was a final bit to the Delirium series and while I thought I was interested in, and rightfully I was. The book flopped between Lena and Hana, and it was refreshing seeing the other side of the wall and the perspective of a future wife of a Leader. I first thought of the two as something extraordinary and I yearned to see more of Hana page after page of Lena. The two were great, and their growth matured as the story unfolded, but there were times and many times that I found that Lena fell from what I thought and what I envisioned her to be.<br /><br />  First lets start where the book started Alex and Lena, but I want to deal with Lena first. Lena is dealt with Alex returning in the beginning, and while she's with Julian the vision of who she wants to be with blurs. Look at Lena in the end of Delirium and than at the middle of Requiem, and that's a whole other issue. She grows delirious and is unsure of who she wants to be with. Time and time again she's told that Alex doesn't want her, when it's really her who isn't sure of what she wants. The love triangle in this book is oddly demoralizing, and degrades the strong character Lena personified.<br /><br />  Alex was great, his pain and his turmoil is all there on the surface. Put yourself in his shoes; he's been beaten and bruised til he's seen the life end in his own eyes, and when he's come back he finds the love of his life with someone else. He's devastated and ultimately heartbroken and truly beyond any and all repair. Time and time again he pushes away from Lena, and continuously speaks with Coral a new Wilds group member. I don't see that Alex and Coral have a relationship starting beyond a simple easy friendship. I loved that about Alex, he was always faithful to Lena, even if it hurt him and the love seemed to be the darker parts of his life.<br /><br />  Than there was the other side of the wall, Hana. Hana was the carefree eccentric one that brought life and freedom to Lena in Delirium. However, when we see Hana in this book its completely different. She's had her procedure and believes fully that love is a disease. The world has changed all around Hana, and she's just getting the first doses of what is coming. The wilds are getting into her city, and growing in numbers. Furthermore, Hana just isn't sure whose side she's on anymore.<br /><br />  The plot and the scenery grows, the Wilds and the camps grow in numbers. The first large camp of wilds appears about midway through this book, and it made my jaw drop. The imagery and surrealism was perfect and great. How it captured what a group of homeless people would be like amassed in the thousands. The stench, the putrid and horror that would go through all those people. Than the city drowns them out, or attempts to in an effort to stop and deal with the Wilds.<br /><br />  The city was, and the DFA seem to be nothing more than a bunch of cowards who hide behind the walls. The quote at the end of this book took my breathe away, I love the idea and the message about taking down the walls, and pushing through our differences. That's what we all do right? Take away our differences, what are we? I look at this book and the series and I love how Lena grew, even if she ended up at the end being a coward. Hiding in the middle of a love triangle that she can't decide on who to be with, until the very end. I was disappointed in this Lena, Requiem's personification of her broke my heart.en we see Hana in this book its completely different.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I usually do not read best sellers, but the unexpected surge of 50 shades and the long time it has been on the lists awaked my curiosity. The novel presents female sexual submission as an almost successful attitude. This bold idea allows the author to explain easily and in a natural way subjects that normally remain in the intimacy or in the imagination or, maybe in a certain specialized literature.  The book is freshly and clearly written and the sexual activities are described with taste, style and vividly. There are also excellent dialogues. The problems arise from the clichés and stereotypes, which are incredible. Particularly, the male hero or antihero cannot be real: an extremely rich and young entrepreneur, very handsome, elegant, strong, athletic, sensible, gourmet, and also a qualified musician, art connoisseur, educated person and from a good family but experienced and self-made man; imaginative and open minded but controller, and with male ruddiness but sweet and kind. Of course he has the best clothes, houses, buildings, cars, airplanes, boats, helicopters, collections books, pictures, etc.  and has plenty of time to play, love, travel, listen and play music, dance, support social activities, anything, and, the most important of all his virtues, he is a great lover, with incredible performances. Regardless of being capable of managing with energy and knowledge his huge firms, he is ridiculously meticulous for planning his love dates and sexual activities. And he is an excellent son and sees frequently his parents and siblings. Another point that bothers me is a moral one: showing some exotic and almost aberrant sexual acts as normal and controllable activities, apparently conveying to incredible ecstasy without any harmful consequence, could lead some readers to take dangerous partners as reliable persons. The unhappy end tends to soften both critic remarks that I´ve made. So, if anybody has not read it yet I recommend him or her doing it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just got this (surprisingly, because it was out of stock) and I love it!  It was easy to set up.  We tested taking control of the system with several phones and computers.  Netflix worked great.  Finally we can show each other youtube videos without hovering around someone's phone.  The only thing that was a bit glitching was casting a website and watching a video on it through Google Chrome.  But otherwise, youtube looked great and netflix looked great.  I cannot wait for them to add Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Oh and no more remotes that can die or get lost either.<br /><br />I'm more than happy with it!  By the way, I also own two roku devices and would say that this device while lacking in channels has the potential to make the rokus unnecessary.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|What a gift!  Thank you, Sir Paul.  Post WWII songs<br />sung with finesse and accompanied by the best<br />orchestras... The liner notes add details about the<br />sessions with Paul.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Just pure greatness in the story and the enlightening it. The math,psychology, and history made this one of the best books ever.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A little basic but just enough &#34;mmph&#34; to make it challenging.  Usually the first two grids in a level are a bit challenging, but they provide the formula for the rest of the grids.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|This little gadget is good for just carrying around your tablet and protecting it until you need something to prop up your device. I have this and another nifty case that props my tablet up and protects it so I just switch between the two  depending on where I'm going and what I'm doing.
0060245867|5.0|For years I've been searching for an age appropriate way to introduce my preschoolers with Ayn Rand. In If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, Laura Muneroff tells a tale that highlights the importance of objectivism in a way young children will understand. The Character of the mouse represents Big Government's view of the poor, meek, tiny, helpless creatures unable to survive without assistance. The Story is told in the 2nd person, the author obviously did this to drive home the point that the collective you, or we the taxpayer have the power to affect the outcome.<br /><br /> The story opens with a mouse simply asking for a cookie, a seemingly reasonable request considering we the tax payer (the main character) are enjoying a plate full of delicious cookies (the fruits of our hard labor) and this poor hungry mouse doesn't have any. When we give the mouse a cookie, it triggers a chain of events that leads us down a dark path as we struggle to accommodate the mouse's seemingly endless list of demands.  *SPOILERS* After an exhausting day of catering to the mouse's every whim, his final request is another cookie, thus starting the cycle all over again.<br /><br />The lesson that children get from this book is that welfare leads to a never ending cycle of dependence. The author's choice to not mention the motivations, aspirations of the main character highlights the apathy that Big Government has towards the tax payer because in the eyes of the government it doesn't matter what the individual wants.  The mouse starts off poor and hungry then spends the day being pampered, but in the end, he is just as empty as when he started. Unfulfilled he does not value what he has received because he didn't work for it. What we are left with is a tired and apathetic working class and an empty and dependent welfare class who lack the motivation to better their situation, who will continuously vote in the system that keeps them poor.<br /><br />I recommend this book for every preschooler andparent alike.
0061259470|2.0|This book arrived on time; however, most of the pages are falling out of it making it a rather irritating read despite the fact that the story is awesome.
B0057J72OG|2.0|Really disappointed with this album. Like some other reviewers on here I ended up skipping most of the tracks as they are all commercial pop tunes. Was hoping for some tracks I didn't recognise but seems he has released them all! Won't be heading to a David Guetta gig ever probably - too commercial for me, sorry!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Not as challenging as some but still fun and enjoyable!  Would like to see more games though that would allow you to earn coins within the game so you don't need money to advance.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|for some reason, the bluetooth speakerphone is never as good as the bluetooth headset. The voice on the other end is always in and out. It's just the matter of how much.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Very slow moving, not historically accurate in every sense. Upset some historians I believe. If you are looking for a cure for Insomnia then this should work just fine.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book my 12 year old daughter loved it good book for preteens with action and adventure
B00A285OOW|3.0|This story has a definite depressing effect. I loved the other books in this series and was looking forward to this one. I was disappointed in The White Princess. But maybe her life was like that, however it ended too soon. Wish it had told more about her later life.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I am so glad I read the reviews and got this little caddy.  It is compact and holds everything I need.  It can hold a variety of bottle sizes.  I take my baby on a walk everyday in our Britax stroller and this complements it beautifully.  I am so glad I saved myself $20 and went with this one!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I read this after my daughter had read it for school and told me about it. Normally she never recalls the details of the books she reads when she is recounting the plot to me, but this kept her attention and made an impression. Now that I've finished it, I want to discuss it with her and she what she thinks of the themes in the book. She is 11 going on 35 so I already know that she wasn't disturbed by the content, because she already showed exuberance for the story, but she is at a very advanced reading level for her age and her maturity helped her handle the situations that may be alarming for some kids. Personally, I think that this book gives us as parents a chance to discuss more complex topics with our kids to gauge their overall sense of the world, right and wrong and morality without having to bore them with our &#34;parent-like&#34; stories. I think parents should read it first if given the opportunity, to see if their own child could handle it.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer has matured as a person and an artist over the past few years and this new album is just a continuation of his journey.  I saw him in concert this week on his Born and Raised Tour and he puts on an incredible show.  He looked so HAPPY to be on stage and to me, this is more important than anything when I go to a show.  I don't want to feel like the artist is just playing another cookie-cutter, routine gig - I want to connect to his emotion and the lyrics of the songs - and JM didn't disappoint!  I am really enjoying Paradise Valley and listening to the songs over and over, discovering new layers of meaning and depth.  I'm really proud to be a John Mayer fan.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book series is so great! Once you start reading these you will not be able to put them down. It is fantasy but feels like it could have actually happened. Not cheesy at all the way that some fantasies are.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is my absolute favorite book. Love all Dean Koontz books, especially his earlier works, and this one most of all. I love the interaction with animals, which adds some softer moments. This was the first of this author's books that I read, years ago, and I was hooked from then on.

B00533D3CQ|5.0|Awesome album!  Incredible works!  His best yet!<br /><br />This album is full of tone and full of attitude and emotion.  Not what you would expect from Peter Murphy, at all.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book. I knew it when i first picked up the book. The mythology fits right into the storyline.  If you like fiction, action, and love to read this is the book for you!
B001AQR3E4|4.0|You could not have imagined how Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt could ever act I'm this kind of movie but they are terrific and they draw you into the story and you ate on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Story line is very intriguing  and before you realize it you are on a journey filled with scarey happenings, surprises and things that will keep you up at night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's was a powerful book that is a learn on life,love and heart and I just loved it :) ps. It made me cry a little ;D
B000F9RB8K|4.0|This is the story of one family's history in the wilderness of Montana. It takes you thru their life's , successes and heartaches . A romance, a war, the jealousies and how each of the 3 sons fulfill their destinies. You feel as if you are a part of their family and you feel emotionally invested in all that happens to them.

B00AZMFO6I|1.0|I received this and then left for California so I discarded the cover, but when I went to view it is damaged and cannot be viewed.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I thought this series is pretty good for TV. Of course the alien invasion theme has been done uncountable times before. But this series works well.<br /><br />I'm not going to dig into the details of the story line since that has been very well hashed over already. But I'll make some points I thought interesting:<br /><br />1) Unlike the vast majority of material today this series treats religion with respect. One of the characters is a very religious Catholic. And actually pulls other major characters in her direction by her example.<br /><br />2) They really should hire a military consultant to work with them. The story revolves around military small unit tactics. One of the main characters is supposed to be a long service infantry veteran (Dan). The main character is supposed to be a student of military history. But all the actions are disorganized meeting actions. No attempt is made to turn their armed rabble into a military unit, no training ever takes place. They never organize ambushes for example. they appear never to have heard of sand bags, instead they pile up tires as a barricade. A pile of tires wouldn't even slow down a bullet.<br /><br />Every action with the aliens occurs with everyone involved blasting away on full auto. They would need railroad cars full of ammo to provide all the ammo that they burn thru.<br />In the final episode they have developed special ammo which will penetrate some of the aliens armor (mechs). The leader warns everyone to conserve ammo since they only have 30 rounds per shooter. When one mech shows up, all 15 or so of the humans blast away on full auto at a distance of 15 feet at the mech. Which is the size of a small car. Out of 300-400 rounds fired they manage to hit it maybe 10 times and expend 90% of their ammo. Any army sergeant would have gone berserk witnessing such behavior.<br /><br />3) Another minor quibble. This special ammo they develop is supposed to be like depleted uranium ammo or maybe tungsten penetrator ammo. Tunsten and Uranium are very hard material, hard materials -always have a very high melting point. 2000 deg F for Uranium and 6000 deg for tungsten. But they melt this special mech metal like it's lead. Lead is soft you may have noticed. I can forgive people for not knowing enough physics to understand this tho.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Really a great movie.  So nice to see aging SAG members putting their talent to good use.  Loved every minute of it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This guide gives you everything you need to know to format your book for Kindle.  The only reason I've given it four stars is because you can get the same information on the Amazon website, and I found it easier to refer to it on the website while formatting, rather than trying to juggle my Kindle and my computer.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The first season dvd of Homeland is one of the very best new tv series to come along in the last few years.
B005SCSL56|4.0|I found this book enjoyable, though some of the situations that were set in the &#34;real&#34; world were rather unbelievable (e.g., some things that the teacher does would never happen in real life).  I doubt kids would be as picky about such things as I am, so I'm sure they'd love this book.  Very quick, easy read.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I would recommend this wonderful piece of music history to anyone.  It's been praised in its 25 year anniversary as one of the greatest concerts ever given -- he is a true master of his craft, at his very best.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A fast read, and great story about who ultimately has control over time and who decides when your life begins and ends.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I need to watch season 1 now! Lol. We watched 2 & 3 in a matter of days....this is probably my favorite English period series.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I'm neither a historian, nor a religious zealot; just a guy trying to make sense of the world.  I've always been attracted to the Christ as portrayed in the Bible.  The concept of grace, his admonition to turn the other cheek and the overall positive view of mankind are attractive to me.  But, as I read the Bible, I am aware of inconsistencies in the message, particularly between the Old and New Testaments; but also within the New Testament itself.  This book, which I consider a \\"Time Magazine-type\\" of overview has helped me understand better where some of my confusion comes from, and for that I am grateful.  This is certainly not a book that will further the faith of Believers, but neither is it one that is dangerous to our faith.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Kids love it. It is a free app and it gives the kids good hand and eye coordination. Very easy to download.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|An honest acccount of a person's life and achievements. Although the book describes Steve's  brilliance and excellent vision (the positive side of him), his most often dreadful bahavior (the negative side of him) as well as his persona as a whole are equally well portrayed in the book.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Game was easy to download. The kids love playing it. It is a silly game but gives the kids eye and hand coordination. Also, the app is free. Always a great thing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|so wonderful and well -designed I honestly cant believe it's free! I like the waterfall and river ones enc sometime I combine one of those with frogs. my current favorite is &quot;cold rattle&quot;.

B004IYISSK|4.0|The book told the tales of people who were interlocked by the joy luck club.  The novel focuses on rich Chinese heritage and uses a lot of symbolism.  I enjoyed it, my only complaint would be the skipping around, telling the stories of different people, making it hard to find the link between all f the characters. Otherwise it was great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game I lost my kindle and bought a new one just because how awesome this game was, but I lost everything :( best game ever!!!!!!

B008ALA6DW|4.0|I paid $2,700 for the lastest mackbook pro and found out it had no ethernet port. So now one of my two lightening plugs is being always use by it. It would be no problem if we had wifi where Im at in Afghanistan but we don't. So I gave it 4 stars because it works great. Didnt give it 5 because we have to buy something so necessary on a laptop!

B009LXEBD4|5.0|From the first time she opened her mouth on American Idol I have loved this girls voice! Every song on here is a song that I love by her.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first chapter. The lead character, Amanda, witnesses the death of her twin sister and then carries a guilt inside her that plagues her life. We follow her story as she grows up from a little girl into a young woman, to see her family struggle to find their happiness after the death of Samantha. There are moments of happiness and hope for the reader to hold onto, a message that although the world can be hard, but with perseverance some of us can make it to better times. Finding Her Feet is a modern day tragedy.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|A fantastic family movie with something for everyone! The story is a new spin on the romantic comedy theme boy meets monster girl complete with a disapproving parent and supportive relatives. If you're looking for good clean fun, look no further.<br />My kids and I quote this movie now: &#34;What? My hand's in a tan shoe?&#34;
B0086700CM|4.0|I have this game app on my iPhone.  Although this is mom's Kindle, I downloaded Temple Run so that my niece could play the game on a bigger screen.  She enjoyed it a lot better.  I think a Kindle gift for my niece is on the Christmas list. :)

B00B7Y0206|4.0|My mom just bought a Kindle, I am helped her set it up as well helped her navigate it.  I downloaded YouTube so that she can pull up any helpful info videos, or if to listen and watch her favorite musician.  So far, seems pretty good.  :)
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Like other reviewers said...simple interface and decent graphics. Went through 50 matches in one day but game keeps going past 50.  Few matches past 50 and difficulty seems the same.  What I like is you can play friends that have apple products though all the matches end in a decision cause its hard to knock someone out. Power punches at end of round dont seem to do much.  Good entertainment for kids.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|So much more than the sex.  A really engrossing read.  I am captivated by the two main characters and their journey.
0231161166|5.0|I obtained this book via interlibrary loan.  After reading and a couple days reflection, I ordered the book from Amazon.  Oscar Wilde once said that a book not worth reading twice is probably not worth reading once.  I strongly feel this book passes the OW test with flying colors.<br /><br />I did not understand everything I read but, so what?  I understood the general idea and since I have followed the so-called Human Genome revolution, it has certainly modified and vastly improved my understanding of life, all life.  It should also be remembered that science is moving very fast in recent decades and, there will, no doubt, be better and more more knowledge via the bio revolution in the years to come.  Do not depend on the media and TV to keep you abreast of these developments.  TV hype and limited time cannot even scratch the surface if you want even a basic understanding of this and other, complex subjects.<br /><br />Francis Crick boasted of having discovered the \\"Secret of Life\\" when he, a physicist, discovered the shape of the DNA molecule.  It was a great discovery, but thinking that it, and it alone was the Secret of Life is an exaggeration. Followed, of course by similar claims when the human genome was fully mapped.  A note of caution based on such claims might be that, we should not, think, that epigenetics is the final answer to our struggle to understand LIFE, per se, in its totality.  We may never get to that point but efforts should never cease and we are lucky indeed to have such writers as Nessa Carey to give us a ring side seat into watching these developments unfold.  Thank you Nessa.

B008220C38|5.0|Recently I downloaded all 8 volumes of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina to my phone, and while I did my routine exercise walking, I listened to it.  It was a wonderful story, rich, full of complex characters, lots of beautiful setting and scenery descriptions, and gripping conflicts that kept me truly interested.  So when I saw that Anna Karenina was being reproduced for the screen, I couldn't imagine how 8 volumes could be covered in one movie.  Nevertheless, I purchased the CD through Amazon, and I was delighted in watching the movie how filled with the key elements of the story it had.  There were a few short scenes and minor characters not in the movie, but overall the movie was a rich and wonderful story of the Russian aristocracy in the 1900s.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history, other cultures, romance stories, or just a well-told tale.  I am a devotee of the Russian writers, but listening to and watching Anna Karenina has made me rank Tolstoy at the top of my list.  This movie is a real expression of Tolstoy's brilliance and rich creativity..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so much. The ending left me speechless. Truly a wonderful story of the power of love.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is the best record to be put out this year. Hands down the best Qotsa album, because it was released on Matador records they had all the creative freedom and say on what to do for the record.

I cannot wait to read the sequels.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.
0439023491|4.0|As all the books in the series which I have all, interesting concept but with glimpses into a future that doesn't seem so far away.  A must read from the first book continuation.

1620404869|2.0|I expected more. After I heard the novel was sold as a screenplay, I expected a plot.<br /><br />This is no different, actually much less fleshed out, than the few Harlequin Romances I read when I was 12.<br /><br />This very quick read is empty, a tad dull, and I fear, meant to be sold as a screenplay.<br /><br />It took little over an hour to read. The characters were one dimensional, banal dialogue, again, no plot at all.<br /><br />NYC girl goes to Austen Disney Land. Falls for fake Mr. Darcy after a few meetings.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The Ninth Doctor was brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Eccleston. Billie Piper in the role of Rose, the Doctor's companion, is a bit of genius casting. The pair had amazing chemistry on-screen and were fun to watch. It was easy to get carried along as The Doctor and Rose fell headlong into one spot of trouble after another. Admittedly, the make-up, effects, and bad guys are cheesy/kitschy. But that is a large part of the charm. It's new, but well known at the same time. I love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so great if only my kindle didn't go dead<br />I love to play it on rainy days when I can't ride my friends horse
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played in my life I think it is fun getting new armor and upgrading it
B00DP3IESY|5.0|finally something a little different, loved it. I'm really not a review type, but I felt that this movie deserved some recognition.
B000P0J024|3.0|I wanted a live concert DVD not a studio version! Plus I have to click play for every song to start. Are there any live concert DVD's out there available?
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Grandson [8] loved this watch, especially the figure.  Needed a little help to put it together the first time, but plans to change the design soon.  Happy to have such a neat watch to start school with.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got it as the faotd i had no problem saving things and i have the kindle fire hd. Not sure if every complaint was from a cell but i love the app. Easy to use and easy to share.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Neil Young and Crazy Horse<br />Live at the Fillmore East 1970 (CD)<br /><br />Neil did half this show solo and then Crazy Horse joined him for the second half.  This CD gives us the second half of the show only.<br /><br />What is special about this CD is it gives us Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten, who would die of an overdose a couple of years after this.<br /><br />This is a very solid 6-song performance but it is not an essential recording.  There are better versions of most of these songs.<br /><br />This CD does contain the song \\"Wonderin'\\", which Neil had performed at Woodstock '69, but that version has never been released.  This Fillmore version, being recorded just a few months after Woodstock, it probably much closer to his Woodstock performance than the decades later recording of the song.<br /><br />This is a Four Star CD
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The whole family is enjoying this game. It was my first downloaded game. I love my new kindle. Thank you.
B0000076MI|4.0|Ten Years After<br />Recorded Live (1973) remastered<br /><br />There is not a lot of difference between this CD and their \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" album from three years earlier (except in that Fillmore East is a better performance).  This album was released in response to all the bootlegs that were circulating at the time.  This release is certainly better than the bootlegs but it probably would not have been released at all without the pressure of lost income from those boots.<br /><br />This is an entertaining CD.  This reissues re-introduction of \\"The Hobbit\\" (which had been left out of earlier versions) is certainly welcome.<br /><br />This is a solid Four Star CD
1781162646|4.0|I have always loved Stephen King, from the moment I picked up \\"Carrie\\" as a teenager, I was hooked on his stories. There have been a few duds, but for the most part his stories keep me enthralled, and usually quite scared.<br /><br />The books I haven't read were the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, and perhaps I should give those a chance. One novel I loved was \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\", which falls into the YA category, but is a wonderful story if you haven't read it.<br /><br />I just finished \\"Joyland\\", and I have to say it was a true joy to read. I loved the characters; the protagonist, Jonesy, is a great lead, utterly believable, and his narration leads the story at the perfect pace. Bits of foreshadowing, expertly done, mark it as a novel by King.<br /><br />It didn't scare me, nor is it meant to. It is a coming of age story...of a 21 year old, a love story, a ghost story, a human story. There are life lessons here, and some wonderful quotes about life as well.<br /><br />They sell fun at \\"Joyland\\", and sometimes fun is what is needed, particularly if you spend too much time immersed in the news, politics, tragedies, you need a bit of fun. Read \\"Joyland\\", enjoy it, take a breath and revel in what many would say is a simple story, but it is one that leaves me feeling hopeful, and there are too many times when that concept is hard to hold on to.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for. The apps on my phone all had pictures on them. This is just lick the little post it notes that I'm used to using.
B00110K62U|4.0|Unlike some other reviewers, I will not comment on the sound or video quality of this set. I am writing as someone who didn't \\"get\\" Les Miz until I saw this show on TV, and I immediately fell in love with it and bought the video tape. Since then, I've seen Colm Wilkinson perform it twice, and was mesmerized. The cast in this show is truly stellar. My main complaint with the DVD is that the reception of and speeches by Cameron MacKintosh at the end, and those of the writers of Les Miz, are not included before the performance of the \\"17 Jean Valjeans.\\" This was a HUGE disappointment, as it captured the spirit of the performance and the interaction among those involved. If you didn't see that, you didn't really see the whole Royal Albert Hall show. The DVD is fine, but the second disc honestly isn't worth the extra money. Transfer your VHS tape to DVD instead.
B0035JGYZS|3.0|Least favorite NextGen movie. Although as I was watching I realized the hotty hot hottie Tom Hardy is in the flick. Unfortunately he's a skinny punk, not very Bane like. So. Anyway....meh.
B005CX53RU|4.0|Does the job. Easy to replace. Unfortunately the left phone stopped working about a week later! Seems to me a common problem with the 400 series.
B0067RQYNW|2.0|This is hard to use on my Kindle Fire, and does not seem to save or email documents properly. Disappointing.
B002U3CCF6|2.0|There is something about the whole style here that I find hard to digest. It lacks subtlety and nuance. I don't expect Shakespeare, but a little depth might be nice. Perhaps a wider vocabulary, even a few more metaphors...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Turkey a good read. I believe Robert Jordan would have approved. Brandon Sanderson completed the story with his own style showing but not completely overshadowing what I think Robert Jordan wanted to present.
B000002KDS|5.0|Perfect, still with the wrapping on it. No scratches, not banged around or anything.<br /><br />The album itself is superb. Very entertaining.<br />I love Alice Cooper, his work is amazing.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Love the series and love this disc. The price was unbeatable as well. I don't buy too many TV shows on disc but this one is an exception
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I never watch this kind of movie and have only seen bits of the other four movies but I enjoyed this a lot when stuck at home recently. very satisfying on many levels: like the plot like the romance, like the main actors, locations all good.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|It is okay and I would probably buy it again!  I love the ease the Kindle operates, wonderful item LIKE!!!!!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|If you've watched other Marvel movies you know what you are in for, this film is meant to be exciting, silly, suspenseful, and dynamic. I love the mix of technology with simplistic scenes.<br /><br />Easy move to watch, immerses you, takes you away from whatever else you're focusing on.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|moves a bit too slow for my liking but if you like uno go for it- well worth the price
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I liked it because it was  period movie of time before the Great Depression.  The United States had affluient familes that lived in simular households.  Didn't dislike anything in ith movie.  I would recommend it to history oriented people only; most everyone in the United States do not have the intellegence.
B00AEFYQE2|4.0|great movie with an interesting twist within it- fun loving and enjoyable movie. we watch it over and over again
B002ZG98J6|5.0|It was definitely better than the Hunger Games! I like the Hunger Games, but PJ1 takes the cake. Thank you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game with cute dragons to raise, trade and play with. great graphics- no time limits for the first few times then you can only play so long each time
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This is so misleading as others have stated.  I would like to know how to delete it from my Kindle.The description stated that you can watch live tv and browse channels streamed from internet. You can browse as shown, however,  you cannot see the available channels until you purchase it.  It is ok if you only like religious and foreign programs, otherwise it is a waste of space.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|i thought this was a much more difficult game to follow and to play then Dragon Story- but good graphics-
B00A285OOW|3.0|After reading the preceding books in the series of the Cousins' War, I had hoped that I would find this book as gripping and enjoyable as the previous books. Especially since this book picks up where almost all of the previous books had ended. All of the other books had chronicled the lives of the female power players and how they overcame the limitations placed on women of the era to influence the progression of events in this epic war. So I find it disappointing that Princess Elizabeth doesn't follow this trajectory.  I did find it to be an interesting read chronicling how she walked the fine line associated with being a York princess in a Tudor court. However, I felt that the book focused more heavily on the constant emotional assault heaped upon by her Tudor husband  and Mother in law and showed none of the aspects for which she was beloved.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a challenging and fun game if you like hide and seek puzzle games. I would recommend this game to anyone.
0061122416|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Paulo Coelho is a genius! He delivered a story so meaningful and necessary that everyone that comes within contact with this book will receive enlightenment. It's a powerful story about a boy that followed his dreams inspite of how vast his dream appeared. His courage is a demonstrative example of the ability to BELIEVE and have FAITH. Thank you for delivering this unbelieveable tale of sacrifice, dreaming and becoming the dream. Both thumbs up to you!!
0061450162|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed this collection of short stories. I have found myself losing track of time repeatedly. Great book!
B008DYZKQE|5.0|We love this book!  It's awesome and I would recommend it for all little girls!! Robert Munsch is one of our favorite authors!  Good message!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Being it was free it was a fun challenge.<br />Not too hard that you get fed up, only draw back was finding certain items they were too small, needs better lighting and my Kindle is set for brightest lighting
0399255370|5.0|I bought this for my grandnephew's 5th birthday. His mom reports that he and his 2 brothers like the silly story very much. They read it a lot.<br />I'm an education consultant and teacher coach. I can recommend using the book as an introduction to personification and perhaps point of view as well. Love this author!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season as the other two just grab you and won't let go. The story lines are great, the costumes are wonderful and the actors are the best. Can't wait to see what the next season has in store.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|An excellent game, I play daily, it's almost an addiction! The few issues I have are the new cost of land, and the Amazon Game Circle notifications.<br /><br />  Before the last update the cost of an acre of land had only gotten to as high as $56,000 for me, but after the update it increased instantly to a ridiculous $440,000 per acre! This change has almost completely put my game progression on hold, at this new cost it will take me weeks to buy an acre, and I just don't understand any reason for such a drastic increase! I don't bother playing nearly as much now as I did before.....<br /><br />And then there's the Amazon Game Circle notifications. Every time my experience goes up it puts out a notification on my kindle fire hd. This makes no sense to me, obviously I'm 'playing' the game, I know my experience increased!!! Is there any way to shut this off? I've looked and looked at everything I can find on my device, but can not find a setting for this. It's really Really annoying to get pulled out of the game because I t o cubed the screen too close to this notification, Especially when it's a pointless notification in the first place!<br /><br />Any help or input on these two little issues I have would be greatly appreciated, other than that, it's a really fun game and I would love to play more often, I'm just a bit annoyed.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|Pretty much what I expected.  Entertaining watching robots brawl.<br /><br />The plot was uplifting, but it did feel as if they had wanted to develop the lead up to the big fight a little more but decided not to for the sake of time.  I liked the ambiguity of whether Atom had a human level to him.  Even the name goes along with it (Adam/Atom).<br /><br />A pet peeve of mine is product placement, and they laid it on heavy this movie.  I don't know what companies pay for those spots (HP, Dr. Pepper, Budweiser, Bing, and ESPN to name a few), but it got overwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, good movie.  You get what you came for.
0385349947|3.0|&#34;Lean In&#34; offers few useful suggestions. Main premise is that women are not ambitious enough, which I disagree with. Harvard Business Review article of this month is better and more useful, as is Anne Marie Slaughter's Atlantic article from last year.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it<br />Best idea for children and teaching them get up on their own and for multiple times for different schedules Thank you!
B004WPYNY8|4.0|I'm one of those guys where if you blow me away with a few good albums, I'll probably buy everything you put out. SymphonyX nailed me with The Odyssey and since then, I've been hording everything they've done and by extension as many projects that Russell Allen has been involved in.<br />So this one was no different, except that I usually just settle for the cheapy download version from Amazon or iTunes because it's just going to end up on my iPhone anyway. This one however, I wanted the special edition CD digipak because of the 'concept art' that came with it. I'm into artwork and had worked in the graphic design business before, so the print version really interested me. I was not disappointed.<br />The actual music was not like I was expecting from them. It's very guitar-driven which is good, but the riffs are starting to sound the same as the last album. I prefer their older, more neo-classical metal action. The newer stuff is almost to down and dirty. Down and dirty is fine, if you drew your fans in with the down and dirty sound. But I was drawn in by \\"Divine wings\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" which were more symphonic, they should consider a name change to \\"MetallicaX-with Keyboards.\\" The transformation into what they are now started somewhere around \\"Paradise Lost,\\" but, hey, with me, you are free to evolve and try new things and try to get more out of your career that just a bunch of musician geeks wearing your t-shirts.<br />Russell doesn't even sing softly and soulfully anymore to add dynamics to the songs. He just does his cool scream thing which gets old because he does it everywhere, and it's become what people want from him now when the ask him to sing on their album.<br />I will say that this is good stuff though from the newly evolved SX! It's good gym music and the songs are long. If you paid the 11-15 bucks for it, it's 2 discs worth of material and I think the value alone makes it worth it. So bang your head or bust out a couple extra squats ... there's definitely plenty of adrenaline and testosterone splashing around in this album.
140006922X|5.0|The book is what I thought it would be--the life of Jesus outside of church affiliation.  I am Catholic and my church has always  been Catholic.  But I am also not afraid to look at an outsider's account of Jesus.  Aslan is first and foremost an academic with a good reputation.  Actually I haven't quite finished the book--it's &#34;heavy&#34; reading.  But I can recommend it without reservations.  It is highly researched and well written..and I should add,. since Aslan is Muslim, written without bias.
B008Y768XO|1.0|I felt like I was being punked. Did Richard Gere really star in a movie this bad? Don't waste your time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book.  Have recommended it to friends.  Can't wait to start the next one.  So easy to get on the Kindle.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is fun. Sometimes it freezes up while playing and you lose the cards you were playing. I was awesome before the came was recently updated. It use to give you more winnings. To someone newly downloading this game, it should be very enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a great game challenging and fun.I enjoy it. My daughter also enjoys it. I would recommend it to anyone. I could play it all day

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I bought this item at a Barnes and Noble and it's one of the most coolest concerts I've ever seen!!  Very well done, very creative and I loved every minute of it.  Michael Jackson was a music legend and his concerts show no less.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|Heard one track on the radio, and knew I had to get the CD- Chris Potter is one of those artists where you know without even hearing it, that the CD is going to be good. This is exquisite, happening, contemporary jazz, some of the best of what's going on now.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|I have been a deep purple fan since 1972. Own every one of their albums released in the States.I really like this album, there's a few songs that have a different flavor to them  not your typical deep purple songs.I would definitely recommend it to any hardcore purple fan.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|City of Ashes was a very entertaining read.  A bit frustrating in places but over all a good book.  Am anxious to see the movie!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I am a David Tennant fan. Seriously. I have seen him in various roles, including my favorite, Dr Who. Until now. WOW!!! Not only is this series riveting from the very first scene the actors/actress they chose for these roles could not have been any better. You will, if you watch British TV/Movies, see very familiar faces. The characters in their roles are believable and that's half the battle. They ALL carry it well. It will also keep you guessing. Twists and Turns are common. Not a series to be missed. Really. Don't miss this one!!!!!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Clearly the good guys and the bad guys stand out. Is this really how it  is for actors on the way up?
B000065KH2|5.0|This is a wonderful story and movie. the music throughout is a perfect mix for this period movie.<br />Wonderful visuals too
B008YKGQR4|4.0|For the most part, I really like this app and use it from my Kindle Fire HD at night when I'm all cozy in my recliner.  The only problem I have is that occassionally when I click on a link, then I have trouble getting back to where I originally started.
0307266303|5.0|I'm not even a distance runner and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Definitely one of the 2-3 best books I have read in the last year or two.<br /><br />The book is definitely pro-running.  While, I don't think running is the \\"be all end all\\" exercise the author makes it out to be.  I do believe that exercise of all types is the \\"be all and end all\\" for us.  But, for me, this was a secondary message in the book.<br /><br />The real message was more inspirational.  The author really inspires you to set goals and be true to yourself, without ever preaching it or lecturing.  I'm not even sure this was a conscious goal on his part.  Though, if I were to guess, it seems like inspiration was part of his intention.  You feel invincible after the reading this book and that's impressive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  It's sized to fit the page so it's easily read.  I highly recommend Calculator Plus Free.
B002M9WW30|2.0|What they did was, put this on Blu Ray without any restoration or cleaning, so pretty much what you have is the same as DVD as in quality concerns, actually I compared the DVD with the Blu Ray and the DVD look even better.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Adichie is an excellent writer, very descriptive and insightful.  It's refreshing to see America from a newcomer's eyes.  She also gives you an equally good view of Nigeria and other Africans from the continent.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|If you want a movie about things getting blown up, and not much dialogue, this is it.  We weren't expecting much more than that, so it fit our mood that evening.

B003Z2LAAO|2.0|I bought this for the 3D site seeing aspect of the Grand Canyon.<br />It was not a thrill ride.  The 3D effects were moderate since the film concentrated on a ride through the Colorado river.  I was hoping for considerably more grand scenes of the Grand Canyon.<br />As soon as I learned that Robert Redford narrated this, and it included a Kennedy, I new I was listening to a warning lecture of our endangered earth.  Sure enough, the film was a lecture of sorts, not a magnificent 3D adventure through the Canyon.<br />If you like Greenpeace, Redford and the Kennedy's politics this film is definitely for you.<br />If you want a great 3D adventure of the Grand Canyon without the downer message, you might want to skip this.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Small and tidy but just the right size for a larger-than-average, point-and-shoot camera along with its strap, extra battery, a/c adapter, and various sundries.  Nicely padded but very light.  Has three zippered exterior compartments in addition to the main compartment whose interior divider can be neatly positioned as needed.
0399162097|5.0|OMG! All I can say is this book should win every award out there. It is so beautifully written, and the subject matter behind the story is so important, I am incredibly jealous and wish I had written this novel. Fowler makes us love this family, which includes Fern, a chimpanzee. Best of all, the author doesn't romanticize the fact that Fern, in all her wonderfulness, is not human. She is an animal, best left free in her natural habitat. The blend of fiction with facts about animal and human behavior makes for an outstanding piece of literature.<br /><br />Some years I can hardly find a book worth reading. Recently, the most amazing books have found their way into my hands and I am grateful.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love having more background behinds the HBO SERIES.  Well written, fluid and great story lines.  The character development is rich!
B001QERPDO|3.0|this is kind of a depressing cd. liked some of the songs but not all. eventually sold it to someone else.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Uncomfortable, but I expected that based on the design and noise cancelling feature.  What I didn't expect is that it would lose its' signal constantly.  Audio cuts in and then cuts out.  I have went back to my cheaper wireless headset, as this one is not worth the problems.
B00BWGISB4|4.0|I liked this album. I only didn't love it because many of the songs sound the same to me, but who cares! I love NKOTB!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I can't figure out how to get it to use my location when I'm using Google Maps.  I'd like to be able to click on maps and see the neighborhood I'm in. Maybe this doesn't work with wi-fi. Not sure. Google Maps on iPhone is much better.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|a fun little chajje<br />a fun little challenge dame. very relaxing type of fun.give it a try. fun graphics too.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|&#34;The Call of the Wild&#34; illustrates the theory of natural selection better than any textbook.  In the Wild, the strong survive, and the weak are eaten alive.  That this message is filtered through the mind of a sympathetic character who happens to be a dog makes it a bit more palatable, but Jack London's vision of a savage and merciless world still has the impact of a club to the side of the head.  If you read this book as youth, read it again through the spectacles of maturity.  If you are reading it in high school, resolve to read it again in 45 years or so.  But be warned:  There's a raging river beneath the thin ice of civilization.  If you don't believe me, ask Hal, Charles and Mercedes.  Better yet, ask Buck.  He's the survivor.
1452000255|5.0|It was my honor to be given the opportunity to read Peter: A Darkened Fairytale by William O'Brien.  This story was an intriguing blend of Alice in Wonderland meets The Never Ending Story with a little The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe thrown in.  O'Brien certainly gets 6 stars for creativity.  His cast of characters is varied, fascinating and unique.  The story begins in a sleepy village and although I have never been to England I could almost smell the countryside.  Soon young Peter discovers that the world is a little more magical than he believed.  I would only give the story 4 stars for the style of the writing.  I would have loved it if O'Brien had expanded the storyline because at times I found it to be somewhat jumpy and abrupt.  In addition, Peter was almost overly trusting in the beginning and I kept waiting for him to get into trouble and sure enough, trouble soon found him.  Overall, I'd give it 5 stars because this is certainly a book I would recommend to both students and teacher friends who are looking for a new kind of fairytale complete with swords and dragons!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Ive just discovered this well done series. Highly recommend it.  It has a story line that never gets stale. I can't wait for Season 4.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Perfect in the Shire. Its comes in handy on the way to Mordor, when I need to text Gandalf where I am.
0307476073|1.0|Relentlessly self-absorbed, completely narcissistic, and wildly implausible. If this were a novel written in the third-person it might be mildly entertaining and somewhat evocative general fiction or \\"chick-lit.\\" As a first-person \\"autobiography\\" it is insufferable. Read about half of it on a recent camp trip and couldn't take it anymore. Watching wood burn was preferable. Did not like the author, couldn't care less what happened to her, and didn't believe a word she said. A sad statement on our times that one of the richest women in the world, herself a paragon of self-absorption and narcissism, could make a gold mine out of this drivel.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan is an awesome author. The Mark of Athena is even better then the previos. His books are the best. If anyon e os looking for good books - It's Rick Riordan. About the book - it's awesome. I couldn't<br /> wiit for it.
B007QJBHRS|4.0|I have been watching Cary Grant and Doris Day for over 30 years.  Of all the bedroom farce ever made this is one of my favorites.  Grant is a suave as ever and Doris is her perky sell.  They were good together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best ending for an adventurous book series. If you start, always finish! :) A must read book recommended for 11 and 12 year olds.
B00028HBKC|5.0|My wife and I saw this when it first came out. the day we went and saw it was ash Wednesday. The Theater was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop. And the tears rolled free. We love our Lord.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I uninstalled the new Weather Channel app on my Kindle Fire because it wouldn't refresh and it never had the correct temperature. I wish they would bring the old app back. I really did like it.
B0001CNRSE|3.0|It just wasn't what I thought it would be but we did enjoy the effort that was shown by the young actors
1416594795|5.0|Just kidding!  Unlike Tricky Nicky I think it would be dumb to write a review for a book I haven't read and have no intention of reading. Ever.  I think Dawkins is a putz, regardless if he is right or wrong.<br />Just saying.  Since Tricky Nicky does this all the time I figured why shouldn't I?<br />Amazon doesn't stop him.<br /><br />I give it five stars because I know Mr. Dawkins ego is very very fragile.
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|Meryl Streep at her best, and a host of wonderful characters, an interesting look into the fashion business as well
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I'm no stranger to using thought forms to manifest in reality. I've read The Power of Positive Thinking, Wishcraft, The Secret. However, Pam's experiments were interesting and I tried them all. In addition, her writing is such fun to read. I have another book by her...Jumpstart Your Metabolism....filled with the same wit and wisdom.
B00770KR7W|4.0|This is a great toy for a young child and the quality of this product was above my expectations. I recommend this item.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A little dark...but not enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to those that enjoyed the first book.  Pretty much more of the same.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So handy to help with your bible study or quick reference to versus while in church.  Now it's easier than ever to have Gods word with you everywhere you go.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Once again Dan Brown weaves a great story around actual events and locations.  This time in the Washington DC.  I look forward to going back to have a look around this time with Dan as my guide!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It's good to see good family entertainment on Amazon. I am new to Amazon entertainment, I was looking for good wholesome entertainment for which the whole family can enjoy. The Candlefotd series is a winner. I am enjoying the good moral country living the Candleford Series offers. Thank you Amazon.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I enjoy Baldacci's writing style! This book was action packed from beginning to end!  The development of the characters and their relationships was relevant. I love being able to see them in my mind!  Multiple story lines came together in a very believable conclusion!  You should read this book along with Baldacci's others! You will enjoy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sweet and sad...the Downton Abbey will have you chuckling, laughing and crying. I can't wait for season 4 this January.
B009ZQI41C|5.0|I joined Amazon Prime JUST to watch season Three of DA, found out it was on Amazon about 1:00 AM and watched four episodes.  SO very addictive.  I laughed, I cried, and was deeply moved thru this season.  What do you mean I have to wait til 2014 to see another season???<br />[[ASIN:B00AXVHHTI Episode 1 (Original UK Version) [HD]]]
B00867GHS8|5.0|Excellent film, with great clarity on this Blu-ray.  It's awesome to have these titles give you a digital copy.  My kids love to watch these movies on their ipads.  No more scratched discs from the kids loading and unloading the dvd players.
B0050VA428|5.0|This is a must for any and all Sherlock Holmes fans.<br />Doyle lets his readers escape into the realm of<br />who-done-it and see if they can figure it out before Holmes does.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the digital copies this comes with.  I can take them anywhere on my ipad.  This season will leave you wanting more.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Good movie! Got it for someone has a gift that had never seen it. We all enjoyed watching it again!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This show will keep you wanting more.  Be warned it is graphic!  The survival of humanity after an unknown biological outbreak is riveting.
1844137872|5.0|Title says it all. Banksy is ne of the best, I am an amatuer canvas graff artist so its always been an art tradition to study the works of the masters.
B00BNUBK46|4.0|I am a runner and I bought this light for trail running at night.  My previous light had a rather strong spot beam and I wish I could see more of the trail around me.  When I saw this, I thought it would be perfect.  A combination of flood and spot.  It works as designed but for my needs the flood light is too wide and the spot is too narrow.  I wish the flood light was a bit restricted and brighter and the spot size a bit wider.  Other than that, this headlight is well designed and balances well on my head.  I will update my review later when I have a chance to actually try it in trails and compare it with other lights.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Free download fast fun to play when I have time to play games nice to get good quality and free apps
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun game. Can't stop playing it. Great for players of any age.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to best your score everyone you start a new game.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is the best book in the whimpy kid series by far. It has tons of jokes. You should definitely buy this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun game and I think I have whiplash! You will flip your lid, I mean Jeep.<br /><br />JoeMotocross says get this game
B003L77G10|5.0|The good wife is my boyfriend and mine's favorite show!!! Second season is amazing!!! Would recommend for anyone!! DVDs were shipped fast and in great condition!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome read i cant wait till the movie comes out next year, only flaw is that its a lil similar to twilight, but like an adult version of it
B007HO392S|5.0|Love her voice. Bought this album because of her song about losing a loved one. She could sing the phone book and it would be beautiful. She is just so talented. Had the opportunity to see her in concert and she was just so awesome. I highly recommend this album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! Seems simple at first but will drive you batty at the higher levels.  Fun all the way though! You can kill an hour with no problem, but it's an excellent 5 minute getaway too.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Metropolis is unlike any movie you will ever see. It is eerily much like our society today. Amazing quality on this restored edtition with the original music score makes it a special event.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The only thing that would make this pinterest app more awesome would be a companion extension that allows you to pin any item on any page in kindle's browser.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I am still embarrassed to explain to people what kind of game this is, because the concept is a little creepy.  But it is so addicting, I have played it for hours.  Aside from the entertainment, it has made me realize how just how scary H1N1 or West Nile can be.  Could we be one tiny mutation away from the end of civilization?  It's possible.
B004NSULHM|3.0|As a Radiohead for twelve years and a non-musician this is a difficult review to write. Radiohead continue to evolve and Thom Yorke pushes the band to their limits. However I do not find the jazz-influenced music with fast-paced percussion to fit the melancholic Radiohead musical themes I grew up on. The first two tracks, \\"Morning Mr. Magpie\\" and \\"Bloom\\" are the weakest on the album. \\"Bloom\\" sounds similar to a b-side from the Amnesiac and Kid A recording session with a faster drum line. These two songs are never able to reach any climax and that further highlights the weak lyrics. The songs get much better as they slow down towards the end of the album. The highlight of the album is Codex, which shows that they have actually improved and matured even from the heights of songs like \\"Pyramid Song\\" off Amnesiac. I suspect Radiohead will continue with the jazz-electronica-pop music...hopefully they'll improve on this with their next release.
B0042GNDT8|4.0|REINER, FRITZ The Complete Chicago Symphony Recordings on RCA<br />63 CD box, original jackets,  will be released this autumn (September 2nd) and it will include most of this material in the latest remasterings (i.e. Living Stereo not the earlier and inferior CD generation RCA \\"60+\\" incarnations). This Strauss set does include some of the non-CSO mono Strauss, however.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|This movie was a dud, not a great movie at all and I found it boring and did not finish watching it.  I really have  nothing good to say about this movie.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle and Beckett have a wonderful chemistry together. The show is awesome. Havy and Ryan are a great pair and they blend in well with Castle and Beckett.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I highly recommend this album as I believe it is one of there best pieces of work asside the Boxer album!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Now if I could just stick to it.  Ready availability of processed foods makes this a difficult thing to do.  Hope springs eternal.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Christine , has a problem when she goes to sleep, she loses all her memories. When she wakes she has no idea were she is or even who she is.The man who says he is her husband and the one person she should trust. Maybe only telling her half the story. Welcome to Christines life. She keeps a journal and has to read it everyday. The man she thinks is her husband might not be.The characters are beautifully written and the story is easy to follow.I look forward to reading more books by S.J Watson
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Really feel like you are out on the sea in a warship from the great age of sail!  If only there were sequals!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such a beautiful story! It makes you look at the issue from a different point of you. I cried so much in the end...
B001L5YW9I|4.0|Thought Daniel Day-Lewis did an exceptional job, but the movie seemed too rushed for my tastes. Action scenes move too quickly, the drama is rushed, especially the romance between Cora and Hawkeye, it seemed unrealistic. I thought they should have lengthened the runtime of the film for at least another hour, like Dances with Wolves. I liked the battle scenes though, especially the British retreat from Fort William Henry, when they are ambushed by countless Huron. Very realistic!  Although in reality, the British did not have ammunition, like they do in the film, yet during those times ammunition was not a good deterrent against surprise assault from organized guerrillas, mainly because of the antiquity of rifle defense tactics during those times. Can you imagine the extreme helplessness of those unarmed soldiers back in 1757 facing agile Huron with rifles! This film gets close to the reality. Very good film.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|So enjoyed watching this.  I love watching at home with my prime membership.  The quality of the picture and sound were excellent
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is my number one favorite show on television right now.  It takes the traditional (Disney) fairytales and gives them a nasty twist.  Good wins, but good actions and not necessarily good people.  Plus you have a few kick-butt female heroes!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|put octopuses in and and a picter of one please for me its my faveret sea creter<br />there awesome deadly they can choke you put theme in
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I don't understand why this show only got one season, so to you, network, I say &#34;Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!&#34;.  This is my third favorite sic-fi, after Star Trek and Star Wars.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|you now I'm tring to see the mermaids bobes but its just skin coler and pocadots and also I'm triying to<br />have sex with mermaids and get marred to one put that stuff in it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I simply love this show- what a great Rom Com. Great view of two different society. I can not wait for the next season
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This drama is very well done. The characters, the writing, the filming. I feel like I am there and that is good TV. Thanks for offering it otherwise I would never have had the pleasure of viewing this fine work.
1781162646|3.0|Not a bad story, but definitely not one of his better works. If only he would have kept his gratuitous, and distasteful political comments to himself while writing an otherwise quality novel. The story is going along great, all is good, when all of a sudden WHAM!!! We get hit with the senseless, and heartless comments having nothing to do with the story. Not one bit cool in my opinion. For me it completely  wrecked the mood, and should have been saved for the dinner table at the King residence. Other than that it was a pretty good book that takes a 2-star demerit for poor judgment. I love Stephen King the author, not Stephen King the political commentator.
B000002WYT|5.0|This album is an absolute landmark in my music tastes.I remember being introduced to it back in the 90's and thinking that it would be bad because everybody on the planet liked DMB. I was entirely wrong - everybody else was entirely right.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|You really have to stay with this movie because you can really get confused. The whole gravity thing is so cool. I would reall recommend this movie for science geeks. The two worlds are amazing.
B000056K04|4.0|There are a few staple songs on this album but for the most part it just sounds like a band trying to sound like DMB.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I haven't really used this as an alarm but I do like that I can see it from across my bedroom.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I can picture that I am watching the movie while listening to this in my car. Thanks for the CD.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Found the series to be provocative and controversial in subject matter and approach. Thoroughly enjoyed watching the ongoing shenanigans of bad cop Vic.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Bruno Mars doesn't have a bad song on the CD. Thanks a lot for the prompt delivery and great traveling music.
1451648537|5.0|Who doesn't admire Jobs these days. I read the book at day one with Kindle ebook but I bought actual book for me and my kids.<br />I like the small anecdotes such as Jobs started crying when his neighborhood kids once asked about their actual parent.<br />I could feel that he was just another man in some regard.
044654759X|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks books. They just suck you in and are so detailed. He is a talented author.
0446563048|5.0|I read this book with Kindle but I bought actual book again for my children.<br />This is really inspiring and actually very fun to read. I highly recommend and I want my kids to read when there are old enough.<br />(They are 4 and 2 now. :))
0446572985|5.0|Been eager to read the next one of his I can find in our senior library.because I am hooked.  They all keep you wanting to read the next page.
0307895475|3.0|Even after revision this edition still contains some errors. Honestly, why do I, or anyone else for that matter, bother to buy strategy guides when websites such as IGN offer guides along with wiki pages and mobile applications?
B00AC8ZIXO|1.0|I am not going to give this \\"movie\\" a full review, since it's not a full movie. I thought it was going to be pretty good, but about half way through I realized it was just a long lead in for getting you to get excited about the game. Sure enough, the movie definitely didn't have any kind of ending. It would be fine if I was planning on playing the game, but I'm not.<br />Warning: Do not watch this if you're expecting a full movie. It feels like it cuts off about half way through. I didn't know.
B001G8XON0|5.0|If you like musicals, romance, and tragedy then this is the bluray for you. The plot, soundtrack, and casting is impeccable.
0425263924|5.0|Everything about this book was great and the fact that it seems like a fourth will be coming out is also great.
1451695195|5.0|This was actually the third copy of this book that I bought. I read it and then loaned it to a friend to read and she lent it to someone. And then I bought one and sent it to my daughter in law back east, and then a friend actually went to see the author but  had not read the book and since I lost track of my original copy, I just bought her one. Incredible journey. And whether you believe in Heaven or you do not it is still a great journey.
0394800184|4.0|The images seem aged and muted but this is such a great original book with a sweet message.  My kids love it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The beginning was slow and did not keep me coming back anticipating reading more. It got better, but then it was too long with the same &#34;stuff&#34;. After finishing reading the first book of the series, it did not catch my attention enough to care to see &#34;what happens&#34; in the trilogy. I never connected with the characters to care enough.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this is my favorite game i play it all the time is so addictive and fun.why do you have to write so many words that is why sometimes i do not write reviews .one word should express your views.
0345803507|4.0|I'm in the middle of the book and the book is very good so far. The beginning is kind of slow until about the 3rd chapter. I ordered all 3 so I'm excited to see how it ends...go Christian Grey!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|i love having the convenience of being able to check the dictionary on the go instead of searching for a hard copy.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I probably can't add much to what has already been said. The portrayal of Lincoln as a conflicted man who was very capable on the one hand, and a story teller who could be a bit of a space cadet on the other, was entertaining. And Daniel Day-Lewis is simply one of the greatest actors of his generation -- probably one of the best ever, so this is well worthwhile. Sally Field was surprisingly good as Mary Todd Lincoln and the whole cast is excellent.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is constantly freezing up or just goes back to your home page. Very aggravating. You lose credits, points and power ups. They darn sure wont refund or replace them unless you have paid for them. I know I'm not the only one having problems. My grandkids and kids were playing too but most have quit because of this. They like to play better on Gamesville.  On my free daily tournament today in the second round I had 3 bingos with over 80 bingos to go and it froze. Of course I lost some good points there.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|It says here this did not deserve the Academy Award for best picture, but it was very good. Ben Affleck does a fine job, the support cast is very effective ensemble work, but why do I get a feeling that Hollywood was congratulating itself for their contribution to solving a major international crisis? Kinda like what happened when they gave the Oscar to Crash a few years back. All that said it is definitely worth buying this.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Have enjoyed the whole series so far..... Keeps you on the edge.... Can't wait for the next book to come out...
B000KKPN5C|4.0|The flash is very easy to use. It's compact and light weight which I like. It's not the most amazing flash in the world obiously, but it's good for the low price and simplicity! I like the angles you can set the flash to.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|It was difficult at first for me to get over the male perspective in this book, especially the way that Drew talks to the reader. He definitely was portrayed initially as pig-headed with a one-track mind, but it was great to see the character development and evolution over time. This is a fun beach read that allows you to sit back and enjoy the ride. If you can get over the ego of the main character, you will enjoy!
B009X01FJS|5.0|I got a REALLY great price on this product. I've been searching for a Kindle cover for a while and finally got one with a special offer/voucher deal.  It's simple, but has every feature you actually need to use it.  Would definitely recommend!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this games ot is so fun to play and I am 12 years old I Gus love this game the little critters are so cute!!!!'&rsquo;&iexcl;&iexcl;!&iexcl;&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!:):):):):):)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very fun and doesn't get old too fast like so many strategy games tend to. Can't go wrong with free games in any case
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Every time I try to play the game it says I don't own the game and I don't know what that means it won't let me play the game.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I felt that it was written well that it could easily be followed by the movie &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;
B006LXQID8|5.0|It's interesting, funny and charming. It brings you a new perspective in life while enjoying some unforgetable characters in various amusing situations and stories. The weird and the unexpected bring out the best of you with Amelie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|love Lee Child's, Jack Reacher, I have yet to be disappointed in any of his books. This was another great read.
B0086700CM|1.0|Do not get, it is just repetitive and has too few power ups, not good at all, don't download if you want to have fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, Love, Love. Although I have heard that the graphic novel is much better... This is much cheaper... So I prefer watching it!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's fantastic and totally worth getting. It's fun to play and I enjoy it and<br /> If u don't like it you're A CHUMP
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Although I have to skip through the beginning credits I absolutely love this season!  I watched season one on a whim, and didn't realize that season two was something completely different! I had so many unanswered questions from the first season... and now I have so many unanswered questions about the second season.... And I like it..
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My girlfriend and I played this game on a long ride to the beach. My only complaint is that it only lasted the 2 hours to get there and not on the way back. We had so much fun while it lasted and hope the person who developed this comes out with more content.
0316743003|5.0|This is a great book that mixes 20th century military and technology history, management, and even personal anecdotes.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the Mythical Man Month, you will also enjoy this one. If you have not read that one, just read it along with the Skunk Works.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show is amazing and I would totally recommend it! Jensen and Jared are awesome and they have great chemistry which makes the show so much more fun to watch! Will always be one of my all time favorite shows!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a great read. Couldn't but it down. It tells you just what a person see's as they fight for what they want to protect. God speed to you chris!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is fun entertaining and it keeps you busy for tons of hours ps. You might stay up all night playing it
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|I ordered this DVD and it has no problems and is brand new!!!!!!!! Suppose to be used but does not look it or act it in any way, the shipping blew my mind when it was hear 3 days after I ordered it. I will order from them a lot more often.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This author has quite a few popular books out, ie. The Kite Runner, and it is a pleasure to continue reading in the same vein.  The story weaves back and forth and ties his characters together through their mutual history and then their lives spead out and encompass very ordinary relationships that are always right on the mark!  The author's ability to write more than superficial action mysteries in this day and age or fast-action, fast-paced fiction is pure pleasure.  He takes his time to develop characters and their very real emotions and relationships and he does not endorse the typical &#34;Hollywood&#34; endings.  This is a great book, an adverture and page turner because these characters are very real to us and the plot is more about telling a story than solving a crime.  Would recommend it highly!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|One of the BEST photography products I've purchased in my career. My cameras are my baby's and this backpack snuggles them tightly!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Each one is a mini movie. Acting is fabulous. Stories are intriguing and a nice modernization of the classic tale.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|The first thing that I would like to point out is that I couldn't believe that this novel was written by a guy. the main character is Tally. I thought that it was interesting coming from a guys perspective. it felt like a little bit like the Hunger Games at first. I say this because its like teams with Tallys &#34;boyfriends&#34; Its either Peris or David. I ship David and Tally all the way!! At first it wasn't that interesting hes just introducing you to Tallys everday life. Then more in the middle it becomes a cliff hanger. You just cant stop reading. I did this school book for a report so I thought this book would be really boring. Man I was wrong. I cant wait to read the next book after my next summer reading book.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This one takes me back to their earlier work. Still got that sweet groove, but much heavier than more recent work. I can see this becoming one of my favorites from my favorite band.
0760336954|5.0|This book truly shows you how to design a car. It takes you through a history of designing, interviews with top car designers today, and also has some nice concept art for illustration value.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was very awesome I really liked it. If you like some challenge then you I would love this app.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I am an indie author in training. This book has proven invaluable. So many concepts explained, packed with savvy advice, so generously offered. What a good guy, what a good book.
B007REW8DO|5.0|It is a great cd. We really enjoy listening to it. She has a beautiful voice. Thank you!! Have a good day!!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This book contained everything  including the element of surprise<br /><br />I love the story and it made  me emotional about a relationship between 2  guys
B00BTHV05M|5.0|OneRepublic did well with this album! The music is great! And I could not beat the $5.00 value price of this MP3 download!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing triology with great storyline keeping you entwined the entire time. Eva and Christian are perfect characters just. This novel.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This is a classic 80s flick! Love seeing Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and Duckie (can't believe he is now Alan on 2 1/2 Men!) again! I enjoyed watching the movie on my iPad through Amazon's free Instant video app, too. Worked great!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I ate this movie up!  Unfortuneately is contains sex, violence and adult content.  I also read the book.  The movie has taken many creative liberties with it's plot.  The book is completely different--boring!  If you watch the movie first, don't bother with the book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great for people looking to build and run their very own city the way that they want.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I called Amazon customer service regarding issues with my Kindle Fire. It keeps showing the batter with a &#34;?&#34; mark in it and will not charge. The customer service person said she would ship me this new updated charger and that it would solve the charging issue. I received the charger in a timely manner but it did not solve the issue at all. My kindle fire will still not charge and I feel that I have wasted my hard earned money on a tablet that does not hold up. When I called Amazon back to advise the charger did not work and if they could possibly repair they told me they do not do that. They offered me another kindle fire at a discount. If I am going to have to spend money on another tablet it would not be for another kindle of any kind. The least Amazon could have done was offer to replace it. I had only had it about 18 months when the failure happened.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the most awesome game I ever played! The graphics are fantastic I love it! I can't wait til temple run 3 yay!!!!
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Hated it! There were good special effects but the plot was so obvious. Please do not waste your money on this loser!
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|I didn't know what to expected from this movie and it surprised me. Very good. I would recommend this movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My hubby and I loved this movie.  Clean, fun, entertaining, and heart-warming.  Great message and delivery!  We loved every part of it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a very cool game with lots of interesting levels of exploration.  Also, it's a great way to stretch your mind.
B004I8WD7S|3.0|The screen protector is almost useless. I tried putting it on multiple times and I couldn't get it to go on without forming thousands of bubbles underneath it. As soon as I peeled the protective layer from the screen protector itself, it attracted dust from across all corners of the galaxy and made it impossible to put on.<br /><br />The case however is very nice. It's a slightly rubbery/ hard shell case and seems to do the job well. Fits snug, and has a ridge that goes past the screen to protect it from falls.<br /><br />So overall, it's okay. It also comes with a microfiber screen cloth, and since Apple doesn't include those with iDevices anymore, it's a pretty nice bonus.
B004289ZW0|2.0|I bought mine for use with SkyDemon for safer aviating.<br />The on off problems have been experienced but not a constant problem. The main problem, which other people have noted, is the poor/unreliable blue tooth connection.<br />This has actually let us down in flight, and on reflection only worked as it should do for a couple of months.<br />It is still within the warranty period, but getting help from the manufacturers is very difficult.<br />Mainly relying on on-line forums for advice, but there seem to be no fixes so suspect that our unit is u/s.<br />For aviation use you need a reliable unit.<br />THIS IS NOT IT!<br />Also, the resetting technique that you can find on YouTube, done with a paper clip doesn't work for our device either.<br />My feeling - DON'T use this for aviating!
B000002J6F|4.0|Four and 1/2 stars<br /><br />I hadn't listened to \\"Manassas\\" in a long time but I recently saw it in the bargain bin at Barnes & Noble for $7.99 and couldn't resist. After the phenomenal success of their self-titled debut album (1969) and Deju Vu (1970), CS&N (and sometimes Y) were hailed as the \\"American Beatles.\\" Atlantic Records mogul, Ahmet Ertegun, rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipation, but as we all know, the egos were far too large and CS&N wouldn't release another studio album until 1977.<br /><br />Stephen Stills was widely considered to be the most talented member of the CS&N trio and he certainly agreed with that assessment, once stating in an interview that Crosby and Nash were strictly his backup singers. Following CS&N's implosion after the recording of Deja Vu, Stills released solo albums, Stephen Stills (1970) and Stephen Stills 2 (1971). Both albums sold well but did not meet artistic expectations, especially the latter. In 1971, Stills crossed paths with ex-Byrd Chris Hillman, whose band, the Flying Burritos Brothers, was struggling to remain aloft and proposed they join forces. Al Perkins (steel guitar) from the Burritos and Paul Harris (keyboards), Dallas Taylor (drums), Joe Lala (percussion), and Calvin Samuels (bass) from Stills' touring band joined up and Manassas was born.<br /><br />Manassas (1972) is a very enjoyable double-album from a great band; probably one of the most over-looked albums of the 70s. Stills, Hillman, and crew play everything from rock, blues, and country to salsa and bluegrass and they play it all with confident aplomb and without the horns and overproduction rampant in the Stills solo discs. Stills' blistering guitar always took a back seat to the vocal harmonies on the CS&N albums but he lets loose here. Hillman, a talented songwriter and musician but second fiddle with the Byrds and Burritos, is the perfect complement to Stills. There's not one AM radio hit single in the entire album but, taken as a whole, it's a majestic ride. The band's next album, Down the Road (1973), was a disaster as Stills was steering toward the 1974 CSN&Y concert tour reunion.<br /><br />Much was expected of Stills but he would never again reach the level of accomplishment of Manassas. Much later Hillman went on to be the frontman for the Desert Rose Band and he often gave credit to his stint in Manassas. He praised Stills as a bandleader, musician, and songwriter but also added he was his own worst enemy. I remember watching Manassas on television in an installment of ABC's \\"In Concert\\" and Stills was absolutely drunk out of his mind.majestic ride.

B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was amazing! I just had to read all of the books after seeing this! Great adventure for anyone young and old!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I've played cut the rope and time travel but never this but by far its great and is a wonderful way to be entertained in a long car ride and to be doing after school. And always watch the cartoons, they are so cute!!<br />I hope they come up with another cut the rope game!!
B00008G9JN|4.0|Ian Anderson always had a minstrel's soul, yet in all of Jethro Tull's discography, it wasn't laid bare until \\"Songs From The Wood.\\" Martin Barre's electric guitar is turned off or down with the exception of one song, while Anderson conducts the ceremonies with his ever present lilting flute and eclectic lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Let me bring you songs from the wood,<br />to make you feel much better than you could know.\\"<br /><br />Calling listeners into a quite countryside with this a Capella couplet, and then sing wistfully about getting back to the countryside. Come with them and visit such characters as \\"Jack In The Green,\\" they cheerfully beckon. Follow \\"The Whistler,\\" who might was well be Anderson himself, as he plays his fife while strolling through the fields. Join in the sense of medieval England, with songs that are as far away from the proggy world of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or the rocking semi-autobiographical \\"Too Old To Rock And Roll, Too Young To Die!\\" as possible. The band sounds looser and less yoked in than they have since the earlier albums sported their side-long spunky epics.<br /><br />The one time that the electric guitar rings out is on \\"Pibroch (Cap In Hand),\\" which begins and ends with Barre's echo-laden guitars before Anderson assumes control with his flute. It's also \\"Songs From the Wood's\\" longest song and most reminiscent of past work, slipping in and out of folk, jazzy passages and the rock of Barre and Anderson's dueling solos. It's a little out of place, but hardly a misstep. That honor goes to \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells,\\" which stumbles over its lightweight lyrics. Oddly enough, this song became an unlikely hit in the UK.<br /><br />Those songs not withstanding, \\"Songs From The Wood\\" is a delightful mix of fields and forest, and one of Tull's most enjoyable albums. They must have thought so as well, as the follow-up \\"Heavy Horses\\" and much of \\"Storm Watch\\" would stay on the same pathway.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Amazing book to read.  I have read this book as a teenager and feel it is not only a thriller and romance novel, but gives the reader a story of many characters involved in the novel.  Such a great novel, I will likely read it several more times.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was so easy to set up and use, I can't compare it to anything else!  This is a fantastic toy, and a great tool for people doing webinars or business presentations - just plug in, configure network (pretty automatic) and go.<br /><br />For $35, you gotta play with this thing.  You'll love it!
1476715904|4.0|4.5/5<br /> This is a new adult novel that really spoke to me. I read this during the time I was taking care of my grandma. She was home with hospice and she has passed, but this book really helped me cope with knowing any moment could be my last with her, and then also after the fact.<br /><br />It is a story of loss, of impending loss, and moving forward afterwards.  Our character s struggle with it and learn their own ways of coping.<br /><br />Layken is our MC. She has just lost her father with the start of the book. She's figuring out how to keep going and suddenly she has another great obstacle that she is facing.<br /><br />Then we have Will. He lost both his parents tragically, and he had to learn to go on, and deal with what he's been handed. Will teaches Layken  ways to cope and express her feelings with death and loss. (The poetry in this is AMAZING!)<br /><br />We have such amazing characters beside that of Will and Layken. They each touch your heart, and their stories will break it at times. I loved how much not only our main character grow, but how our sub characters do also.<br /><br />This is a great book. It really spoke to me and I think it would to anyone feeling with grief. This is only book one in the series, but doubt if I will ever read the next books. This felt like complete story, and felt like with the ending, that's all you really need.  This is definitely a novel I would recommend to others!

B00CL68NOG|3.0|I love Barbra Streisand.  The relationship between mother and son is well played and I found it easy to watch Barbra.  Not a great movie, but a good one to rent on a rainy day.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|It kept me turning pages as fast as I good.  It was well paced and had Interesting characters. Good descriptions.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Needed a bigger than night light, smaller that room light, motion activated and battery powered helper light for  my laundry room. Needless to say, you usually have you hands full walking in or out of a laundry room - add to that the fact that my light switch is not the most accessible this guy made the difference in convenience for us. - it might be a little pricey if you cared to pick arround dollar stores and such but this will do the job.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game.  its a lot of fun but I thought I would be able to play with my facebook friends and I can't.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I love g5 an this game shows why. Great mystery and adventure all in one game. Couldn't stop playing it!!!!
B008LV8TSU|3.0|it was an okay story.  really interesting and imaginative.  I thought it was a little complicated and hard to follow at times and I really didn't get the connection between the two main characters.
0345803493|1.0|All this author E L James does is copy 9 and a half weeks and make it a g-rated long version and into 3 sequels!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive and makes you think. No stupid guessing like 100 floored. I can play it until my battery dies. Best app I've downloaded in a long time. If you like brain puzzles get this app.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I learned a lot about myself, an introvert, by reading this.  I would recommend that extroverts read it too so that they can learn how to approach us without making us uncomfortable.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I got it for my grandchild, who really knows how to use his kindle. Keeps him busy and happy most of the day.
B005LJITS0|3.0|movie is cool and all and at some points funny but the story line basically just sucked, i wasnt really thrilled with the final fight at the end and the ending was very predictable and not as much action as i hope there would be.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The location is beautiful, the plot intriguing, the characters sympathetic, the writing clever and engaging.  I will watch the show again<br />Patrtick P.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great visual effects and story line! this movie should only be seen by watching the first star trek made in 2009 and to help with the idea of the story in this film is to watch the original star trek movies, but overall i give this movie five stars!!!!
B00874T02K|5.0|Great app simple to use and vary easy to navigate! I'm a returning body builder and to have something I can use at anytime at work or at the gym is just perfect!
B005TBN3EU|5.0|this movie once again could not make me laugh for more than one minuet, the story is once again unpredictable which make the entire movie more hilarious!
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones were actually pretty good, and I used them a lot. Unfortunately, after a few months, they suddenly gave up. The audio would only come through one side. I tried to mess with the wires, but then I figured you get what you paid for
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|very cool action moves throughout the whole movie and alot of comedy relief, overall i think it was a decent sequel.
0316212377|1.0|Perhaps if I reread it ,it will be clearer to me..The premise appears to be is there an afterlife or not,and of course we will never know for sure.But logically it's not happening.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|this movie didnt feel like any of the die hards before, the action was cool and the comedy parts were okay but it just didnt feel right.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This app is so awesome and cut! I can't put it down! This is a must have game! Definitely worth the measly one dollar
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series, hard to stop watching.  Can't wait for the next season to start. I have watched season 3 also, shocking ending!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Just started playing this late last night. I think I am going to like it a lot. I especially like how it &#34;speaks&#34; and simultaneously shows pictures of the number being called. The only complaint I have is that it is too easy to accidentally hit the &#34;bingo button&#34; when &#34;daubing&#34; any number in the bottom row. Doing so results in that card being instantly barred from &#34;the game.&#34;
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's wonderful, wonderful. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a series this much.  It quickly became the highlight of my evening TV watching.
0345529057|4.0|Am about half-way through the first book, and I find myself quite caught up in the story. There is a lot of detail-provided, so much so that at times it is hard for me to keep up with. However, that is probably the fault of this reader rather than the author.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I generally use very cheap head phones and this is my first little high end head phone and what a sound quality.<br />Best quality for the price I guess.
0140067477|5.0|I am enjoying this book; it is helping me understand &#34;Tao&#34; better than my college world religions class did so many years ago.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Tons of hater comments for this movie, but I definitely back the majority. This movie's pretty good. I watched SD version and enjoyed it so the HD one should blow you away. Didn't much like the ending though. I guess it was what had to be done :/
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|This is fun, but for some reason it doesn't appeal to me. Once I make myself start playing it, it isn't so bad, but it just doesn't have that &#34;come play with me&#34; appeal that other games have for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addictive, a nice w a y to blow off steam after work.<br />Be careful it's hard to stop!
B008EKON56|3.0|I listen to my iPod on a home stereo with large klipsch floor speakers with an adequate amplifier.  I can tell no difference in sound quality between the headphone jack on the iPod and the LOD connector.  Maybe I am not using the LOD for the right application, but I was expecting to hear at least a minor difference in sound quality.
B000P407K4|4.0|Certainly an interesting movie.  Had never seen it, but so many people I knew had.  It is worth watching at least once.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Can not get laptop and smart phone to link up. Program does not recognize whether it is running or not. Trouble shooting guide does nothing to fix problem.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Haven't seen any of these since I was a kid.  Brings back a lot of memories.  The series is great.  And the supposedly never-before shown pilot narrated by rodenberry was pretty cool.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a great book that tells a wonderful and inspiring story about live, loss, friendship, and family. Highly recommended!
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|WARNING:POSSIBLE SPOILERS(SUBJECTIVE PLOT/STORY FOCUS REVIEW)****-Just got done watching it, I liked it, story is okay being linked to the bosnian war. The basic plot intrigued me and I'm personally a sucker for hunting & hitman films, especially when its simply two opposing characters squaring off one on one, witch is exactly what this film is. Of course John Trovolta's fake serbian accent is bothersome and even annoying at times, but hey whatever, I like his past work so I was able to let it slide. Robert Deniro is just awesome in this one, he really made the viewing worth it for me personally. I also like it when a film or story has the protagonist carrying a handicap and disadvantage against the antagonist, it adds a more exciting dynamic and has makes me wonder how the hero will defeat/overcome the villain,  if he even defeats him at all. The ending was awesome and personally the best ending I would want for the film. There is alot of action, Deniro is fantastic in my opinion even for his age, he did great in the action scenes. OK NOW, chemistry between the two(& keep in mind it's really just these 2 actors for most of the film) was very interesting to see in my opinion.I myself am the kind of viewer who really honestly does not care or pay to much attention to chemistry between actors/characters in film. I of course find interaction between actors/characters in films fun and important sometimes, but overall Im passive about it. The interaction between Benjamin Ford(Robert DeNiro) & Emil Kovac(John Travolta) is again interesting enough to have kept my attention, It didn't bore me at all and the resolution between the two satisfied me personally. I recommend to those who like a hunter VS hunter, soldier VS soldier type of deal, kind of like the film Enemy At The Gates for example with Jude Law & ED Harris facing off ass 2 WW2 elite snipers. So finally I give it a 3.8 out of 5 stars.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Good &#34;Movie NIght&#34; Selection! The cast was awesome and Lady J rocks! Good Ninja scenes on rocks! Sequesl should be awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Please read this comment the whole thing  Fun and addictive I just love the graphics they did a wonderful job on this game if there were a ten star button I would click it I am so loving this game and ten million stars and yay and finally ten billion hundred thousand :D and : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) :) :) :) :) :):D:D : D get this game  now now now or else.........
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks does an amazing job of chronicling the Zombie Wars, it such a new and interesting way to tell the story it moves quickly and I was sad about how quickly the book was over, but I was also marathon reading practically from chapter 1. It is a great story creatively told, one modern fiction book that can't be passed up movie or not (btw the movie is only about 10% from the book so it doesn't ruin it at all).
1594487154|4.0|Purchased this for someone who is in the selling profession.  The advice here is useful to everyone.  The author has written several other books, but this is the only one I have read.  Deciding which title to choose could be difficult if one gets caught up in<br />trying to be thrifty.  I was thinking about purchasing the shorter version of this title, but am happy with the full length version.
0547848412|3.0|The film is almost word for word the book, which made it a bit tiring to read but it is still a good story and I would definitely recommend reading before you watch the movie so you can appreciate the book for creative story
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|It was a weak movie at best.  Story was poor and if your not a Joe fan a little hard to follow.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Light weight and easy to use. Compact for carrying in my to go bag. Would recommend this product to anyone.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|My book club decided on this, so I went about it somewhat unwillingly. What a great book!! I wouldn't recommend it for assigned reading for a class of freshmen, but educated adults will have no trouble with the language.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really do like this app a lot! It's accurate, and has a lot of features. I loved that it was free bc I'm a sucker for free.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was one of the most enjoyable reads ever. I picked up the ghost brigades as soon as I finished!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Could not put this book down :). Just was disappointed when it was over...... hope his other  books are as good because I'm hooked!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love it very much. Can be challenging at times but it keeps me thinking a lot. I would highly recommend this app
B00884GR0W|5.0|I like it that it has an unlimited world and the hell sky and water world. It is also cool how you can get pets and craft spawners. It can be a little creepy in some ways.. There are so many blocks and technical stuff that it can be confusing at times.It is better than minecraft pe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love how u can put the chest together but can u please add enderman or enderdragon mabey even cats or dogs. Can we also have spawners to zombies, creepers, and skelletons. But love the update.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Impressed with the game in general minus the social media and cost of purchasing things.  Most games nickel and dime you but this is closer to quarters and dollars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because I love despicable the movie was th best ever I can't for part two to come out.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was a new experience for me having never played this type of game before and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I will definitely look for more like this.  Very intriguing to have nothing but puzzles and no hidden objects to find; I really enjoyed that and will definitely seek more of these games out in the future!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|i love this game yes i would recommend to my family and friends.This game is great for keeping the mind fresh
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is something special.  It leaves you thinking about life and death.<br />Thanks for a great read.  Sydney from: palm springs ca.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan by any measure, and prob the biggest reason I rented this movie other than because I like sci-fi movies is the fact that Morgan Freeman was in it. I really enjoyed this movie, Tom Cruise was great, and the movie was pretty solid... I only wish there was a bit more history behind the tek....
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This movie is a must for art and history lovers.  It is well done, and the colors and scenery are quite beautiful.  I have visited the actual Home of Frida K., and  the reproduction of the home in the movie is remarkably similar.  The story is beautifully told even though it does have some very sad parts in it.  Thus, it is true to life.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|One of the best games I've played ever!!!! Loved writing this review<br />And I really enjoyed playing this game and will continue playing it
B00015YVD6|5.0|This is one of those what if movies...What if mermaids did exist.  Would you give up your life on earth to be with your true love?
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Honestly, the main draw to want to see this was David Tennant, the much-beloved and much-missed tenth doctor in Doctor Who. But that is not why I rated this five stars. Compelling story (and heartbreaking), interesting characters, beautiful photography -- all of these elements combined to produce my rating.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone for whom the death of child is too intense or emotional. (I knew what it was about and cried at the point of discovery and informing the family.)
B003439LIC|5.0|This movie conveys a sad and obvious truth. Worth a watch..even if you are not a Michael Moore fan. Despite his notoriety I like that Moore allows many ignored people to voice their stories. The discussion on the \\"dead peasant\\" practices that companies like Walmart use were a real eye opener and something that needs to be stopped.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used evernote for several years, across platforms, and rely heavy on it. I love the versatility and flexibility. I've recommended it to many - one of my top apps
B00AK77WPE|5.0|I will recomended to all merengue and bachata fans..<br />I was waiting for a concert video like this to share with friends
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|These are a favorite of our young ones, and each Monster High doll seems to be more clever than the last.  A fun and durable toy.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|I love Derek and Susan.  I love their idea of creating real MUSIC and avoiding the spaz of what our modern so called artists are doing.  Her vocals are grand but not exactly unique.  Yes, she sounds like Bonnie but does that mean she shouldn`t sing???  Of course not.  She has soul and soul is a lost attribute in modern music.  Today it`s all about bells and whistles and videos.  That being said, I would like to see them add some special effects to their overall sound.  I mean, if you`re gonna play more or less hippy style music at least throw some flange or delay in the mix.  As for Derek, he is one of my favorite guitarists out there.  A rare breed so to speak but again, why so bland with the guitar??  Why not add an effect or two and spice it up??  I understand them wanting to be pure.  That is a wonderful thing and brave but a little spice isn`t going to take anything away from that aspect.  This band has the potential to be legendary if they would just step off of the high horse for a moment and somewhat get with the times.  One more thing,....they need to hire a studio producer for their recordings.  The mix is flat, of that there is no doubt.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best game...I feel like its hard to complete levels...still fun wish it were easier to get friends too still enjoy playing almost every day
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|Superb music.  But the tunes can be monotonous. As stated, the music is great but I wonder why in the world would they not have any belting blues tunes for Susan to sing.  That is her cup of tea so to speak.  I hope they don`t allow self importance to negate the talent.  Nothing wrong with purity, also nothing wrong with doing what ya do best. Just an opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is was what I have been looking for. I can now use Netflix on any TV in my house and control it with an android device. Works great sending anything from your chrome browser to your TV.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Like most, you can choose your level of difficulty.  If has some features that I like as a casual player.  One is that when you touch any number already solved it will highlight all the rest that have been filled in. Also, you can't fill in a wrong number.  It will assess a time penalty if you place a number wrong but the number is removed from the block.  All in all a good basic game for the casual player.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|love this series, very nicely done and played. I would recommend it to anyone as a must have in your DVD collection.
0345803485|2.0|Love how the female character says \\"argh\\" during sex! The storyline is really getting repetitive and I'm not even at chapter 6 yet! Glad I just borrowed the book, Argh !(haha)<br /><br />Update 8-23-2013<br />I finished this book today and even though jeez, argh, biting lip etc was mentioned WAY WAY too much I am reading the whole sequel.  By the end I didn't totally dislike this book
B0090SI4LU|4.0|If you are going to watch THE HOST before reading the book, you will not notice what's missing and what had been changed from the original story.  Considering the length of the book, it had to be condensed in order to keep the audience's attention.  I liked the movie, but since I had read the book when it first came out, I immediately noticed what was changed and what had been cut.  Even so, it's a good movie, I was entertained, I cried at certain parts and felt that the producers had done a good job with it.  My suggestion is watch the movie first and then read the book.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|Came one day late and my grandson was unable to see it.  I had ordered it for him so I was real disappointed.  And I paid for guaranteed two day delivery!!!!

1250029465|5.0|A wonderful story of never giving up and that help comes in many forms.  I loved this book.  I read it three times and have lent it to friends as well.  Bob is undoubtably a really wonderful cat but James was also his savior.  Reads like a &#34;feel good &#34; movie and all the more wonderful due to the truth of the story.<br /><br />Don't miss this one !!!!!!!!!!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I did like this hidden object game, but felt it was a little corny at times.  I guess I did not like the story line as well.  There were interesting puzzles and mini games.

I tried returning to the horse puzzle numerous times and every time it had reset and needed to be worked again.  Still no results.  I'm very glad that I didn't pay for this game!!

B00DB624GS|3.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2013 CD REMASTER ***<br /><br />OK - here goes.<br /><br />THE LP: When \\"Then Play On\\" was first released on vinyl in the UK and USA in September 1969 - fans found that the album differed on both sides of the pond. The British LP had 14 tracks while the USA issue had only 12 - and a slightly different track running order. To add further confusion to the album's history - the split 7\\" single \\"Oh Well\\" became a sizeable chart hit in the UK in September and radio presence in the USA in November 1969 - so Reprise USA decided to relaunch the US album that November with 11-tracks - this time incorporated the hugely popular \\"When I Talk To God...\\" song. But instead of including \\"Oh Well\\" split into Part 1 and Part 2 (like the UK single) they edited it together as one long song with a tiny amount of repetition added on in error (the American album version runs to just over 9 minutes). The two Danny Kirwan tracks \\"Without You\\" and \\"One Sunny Day\\" that appeared on the original UK LP were dropped from the US variant because they'd already appeared on the band's 2nd US album \\"English Rose\\" in February of that year. There are also giggles and huffs and puffs at the end and beginning of certain tracks that got messed around with too. What this all means is that 1969 effectively saw the release of three \\"Then Play On\\" LPs.<br /><br />THE CD: The dull-as-dishwater basic CD on Reprise that we've had to live with all these decades (released in November 1988) is an un-remastered mishmash of all those line-ups (13 tracks, 54:14 minutes). So for the sake of clarity I'm going to show how this 19 August 2013 Extended CD on Warner Brothers/Rhino 8122796443 (18 tracks at 69:53 minutes) will finally allow fans to sequence all three variants of \\"Then Play On\\" LP - and the singles that surrounded it (just about). The track number is after each song title...<br /><br />ALBUMS:<br />September 1969 UK LP on Reprise RSLP 9000 with 14 Tracks:<br />Side 1:<br />1. Coming Your Way [1]<br />2.

They certainly show that both the album and the band at that time wasn't all Peter Green. The bluesy \\"Show-Biz Blues\\" and \\"Under Way\\" are other highlights and I love the quiet majesty of \\"Although The Sun Is Shining\\".

I wish I could say it was a bit of a find but it isn't - it's starts out nicely but descends into a rather dull and meandering Danny Kirwan instrumental. You can't say the same for the blistering A-side which astonishes to this day - \\"The Green Manalishi (With The Two Prong Crown)\\". WOW! Musically - lyrically - what a blast. It would have been nice to have the rare UK Picture Sleeve (I proudly own one) pictured in the booklet (along with other European variants) - but alas.<br /><br />To sum up - there's good liner notes for sure, but the sound is iffy at best and bound to divide and disappoint fans who've waited decades for this reissue.

0517548232|5.0|Henry Hazlitt's \\"Economics in One Lesson,\\" is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the Austrian school of economics and how it forms the basis for contemporary libertarian economics. Of all the great economists who were part of that school, Hazlitt has done the best job of explaining economics in a way that anyone can understand. Clearly written and without any technical jargon, it states the lesson in Chapter One and from there shows how this lesson is applied to such diverse issues as taxation, tariffs, price-fixing, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, inflation, and more. The lesson, by the way, is this: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"<br /><br />\\"Economics in One Lesson\\" will certainly strike a responsive chord among readers already convinced of the libertarian economic position. But even for those who are not libertarians, this is still a book that must be read, since it presents that position as clearly as any book has ever done.
1401308201|5.0|LOVED THE BOOK!  This was an incredible book to read before we went to the Broadway show.  My wife had to fight our teenage daughters to read the book.  Everyone loved reading the script and learning about the stage costume and the history of Wicked.  If is possible the background information made the show come alive for my girls.  This book even made it to the show and some of the cast signed it fir them.  This is a must have for any Wicked fan.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I am such a fan-girl of Robert Downey jr 's Sherlock Holmes films. I love them. I love how he and Jude Law play well off of each other and make me crack up often. Sherlock is such a little bratty brain child. I just love him.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|Firstly, I am a fan of Star Trek, a huge fan. I purchased this film on an 80inch LCD 3D Amazon-enabled television. The streaming was seamless, true HD, and the purchase on the television was simple.<br /><br />I rate the film 3 stars because it was mostly a fleeting and filler written film, in my opinion. The previous (reboot-franchised) film had the character development, INTO DARKNESS had more character development without the elongated, integrated plots. The main plots are lackluster. The acting is excellent, so believable that in moments, I felt as though I was in the film, in space, however, the writing and direction is too surface. The previous film is one that is a must-see. INTO DARKNESS begins with the crew running, the film \\"hits the ground running\\" and that is a great idea for a a film with 1 premise, however, this film has so many side-plots being played out, none of the plots are given proper time to play out.<br /><br />Star Trek INTO DARKNESS could have been epic, I had great expectations with no spoilers when I watched this film. I wasn't the only person whom thought the film was lackluster & fleeting, the family watched all at once and agreed after that this film is too flawed in production. With actors at pinnacles of their craft, the writing, direction and even the graphic effects were less than stellar.<br /><br />That being said, I recommend watching the first film. If you have yet to watch this film, I recommend waiting until after September 10th (2013) to stream through Amazon Prime Instant, M-Go or Netflix.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|when Timothy olyphant's character wants \\"Nick Cage\\" to play him in Steve Zahn's  characters next screen play.<br />This movie had everything in it you could want in a movie, story, action, suspense, scenery, comedy, and most importantly two hot chicks, especially Kiele Sanchez, this is the first time I've ever even seen her, and Milla Jovovich is the former super model?<br />Kiele's like 10 times better looking and she puts on this super hot southern accent.<br />Anyway I've read other reviews about this movie and people said it was very predictable, well I'm glad I'm just not as smart as these geniuses are because the movie had some \\"red snappers\\" in it that threw me off a bit.<br />All these actors were great in their roles especially Olyphant who had me laughing through the entire movie and I've never seen Steve Zahn play a role as good as the one he was given in this film.<br />I like the Resident Evil movies but I think Milla's overated in her acting and how good looking she is, she's built like a clothes hanger.<br />I watched the unrated director's cut but it also has the theatrical version in it to, so if you intend to buy it you'll get both.<br />The stories suspenseful and fun to watch, check it out if you want, it's worth the money.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!

B000SEFNMS|4.0|This is a book where the authors ability to write, explain and describe make up for the rather weak story.  I have read it twice and the author creates a strong mysterious attachment to the main character.  A good read.

B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is great. Everyone giving  a view saying its not that good lack the capacity to play against an ai. I have to admit though it is very difficult to win. Bur however I play this game daily and I win at least half of the games that i play. The game is great in many ways. It provides a very difficult opponent and you must learn how to evenly distribute your forces. Like I said in the beginning the people who made reviews saying the game is bad don't have the capacity and my proof behind it is me and the number of games that I win and loose regularly l.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|Its Pride and Prejudice warmed over, several times.  Its stale and lackluster, doesn't come near to evoking any of Jane Austen's characters.  Elizabeth is a twit, Darcy is hardly arrogant enough.

159463176X|4.0|This book begins with an Afghan brother and sister who love each other very much.  The sister is sold to a childless couple for adoption, and the pair is separated for life.  Khaled Hosseini then tells the story of their lives by means of telling of the lives of everyone around them.  In the end of the book the brother and sister are reunited late in life, but time has taken its toll, and their relationship will never again be the same as it was when they were children.  I found the beginning of this book to be wrenching and the ending to be heartbreaking, and the pages in between are full of interesting character studies of people whose lives intersect with modern Afghanistan and the brother and sister.<br /><br />Most compelling is the story of an Afghan-American doctor who goes to Afghanistan to see to a house he's inherited, and gets involved with a little girl who was nearly murdered by a relative.  He intends to bring her to America for a much-needed operation, but lethargy gets in the way, and he doesn't help her at all.  It's his ethically challenged cousin who helps out the little girl and gets her the medical attention she needs.  There was something unusually sickening about this tale of a doctor who has everything being unwilling to help out even one unfortunate person, and this is the tale that has stuck with me after I finished the book.  Once the brother and sister were reunited (sort of), the tension drains out of the book, and it wraps up pretty quickly.<br /><br />I have read \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" both, and I thought this third book, while a good read, to be inferior to both these works.  The final meeting between brother and sister is so sad that it distorted the entire experience of reading the book, for me, and the many ancillary stories, while interesting, seem to peter off and fade away even as you're reading them.  I'll remember the ineffective doctor, and the tale of the chauffeur because he's about the only character in the book who gets a full, pain-free life span.  Virtually everyone else is afflicted with various hideous conditions that either kill them off or make their lives a misery.  After a while the book becomes a freakshow of medical maladies, enough to detract from the enjoyment of reading the stories.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this is a good book and well worth reading but not as good as Hosseini's other two books.  It's an ambitious book because it tells both a central story and many side stories, but all the while you're reading you're waiting for the brother and sister to be reunited, and when it finally happens there's a terrible pall of sorrow over the whole thing that pretty much ruins it.  Hosseini likes downer endings, look at how \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" ended, but after you've invested 400 pages in a story you want something with a little hope to it, and in this book that investment is defeated.  I'll remember this book for a long time, and I'll recommend it to others, but with reservations that weren't there for the first two books.  I hope Mr. Hosseini tries something more traditional for his next book and leaves off the multiple points of view and the soul-crushing endings.  Something a little more upbeat, maybe, just for something different?ter in the book who gets a full, pain-free life span.

B0015DROBO|2.0|Good beginning but becomes too involved in several stories slightly related and questionably solved.  Some are not believable even in a mistery novel.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|This book was even better then the first one in the series. A massive cliff hanger at the end though
B0085157B8|3.0|There should have been more close-up special effects. The movie was OK but I was a bit disappointed. I am having a difficult time finding good 3D movies.
B006O6F932|5.0|This looks like a cute product, we have not opened it yet though, it was bought as a holiday item.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|As a fan of magic, I was delighted at the ability of being able to play magic wherever, whenever. The game is Great, though it has some minor flaws. What makes this review a 4 star review rather than a 5 star review is that the game is 1.2 GB. While I understand that the game has to function the same as the game for the PC, at 1.2 GB this game takes up one-fifth the memory of my Kindle.
1603427244|5.0|The book was excellent.  Really enjoyed using it and learning from it. Easy to understand. Excellent graphics. Great book. Must read.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Just purchased app.  Think this could be my next addictive app.  This is slot of fun.  Will.look for other apps from these people.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Usually movies about gay topics are so poorly acted it's like watching a play in high school.  This one is professionally made, very well filmed, and well-acted.  I wish more movies with gay themes were this good.<br /><br />The story of the younger guy falling for the older guy and realizing his sexuality is very well done, and without full sex scenes (which may have been good to add a few :-) ) -- his anguish of living his life, taking on more responsibility than is normal for his age bracket, and accepting his potential future as a gay man is heart breaking to watch, but excellent.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie for all audiences.  I liked it so much I had to buy it.  The soundtrack is also excellent!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am on a fixed income, it is very hard to make monthly ends meet on the tight budget that I have.  That is why I usually check Amazon  Books and Music for any entertainment needs before going to  a retail store.  I love my cd 21 by Adele, I purchased it just after she won  the grammy for it and I love it! It was new, but I purchased it as used. Dora Stokes
159668139X|4.0|I bought this book a while ago when I was interested in learning to weave.  I had bought a rigid heddle loom and had never woven anything before.  The book was not very helpful for me on that loom, but I found a lot of the information in it to be very helpful.  I had to read it over a few times, and some of the concepts did not click until I had actually gone to take lessons in weaving on a multi-shaft loom, but overall I think this book is a good basic book for those who have interest in weaving and want to learn some basics without a class.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Easy to lose track of time playing. I just wish you could earn tokens easier. Would be a lot more fun if contests have away tokens instead of bananas.
B005HGKWLO|3.0|This is a cute movie, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's not excellent, so I can say &#34;it's ok&#34; here.  The acting is fine, the story is kind of trite and simple, and the &#34;hot guy&#34; character is not that strong.<br /><br />The idea of being in love but not feeling like the other person would think you're worth their &#34;level&#34; is common, so I think most people would enjoy this movie for the most part.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|This app is so cool. You can create so many new sayings by using this app. You can also use generic pictures, flags and even memes to create your poster. I like how you can even use old flags, like Soviet Russia's to make your poster. Get this app because it is totally worth it.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I enjoyed this film a lot - given the unique concept of 2 worlds nearly touching with gravity affecting the inhabitants differently.  Don't watch this movie if you are expecting adherence to physics, or if you're one of those who pick on Prometheus for having &#34;holes&#34; in the story.<br /><br />It's a cute love story basically between two people in different worlds, where their cultures are trying to keep them apart.  The people in the &#34;down&#34; world are the workerbees and the people in the &#34;up&#34; world are the rich, in charge people - who also are using up all the resources of the &#34;down&#34; world to keep themselves wealthy.  There's a lot to go 'huh?' about if you really thought about it, but just suspend your disbelief and enjoy!
B001DF68MA|4.0|I ride a women's 700cc hybrid bike. I bought this seat so I could ride with my son, who weighs 30 pounds and is 32 inches tall.<br /><br />Getting this seat installed and adjusted so that my son could ride safely and I could still comfortably sit was bit of a pain. The instructions picture a men's mountain bike, and after taking one look at the fact that a man's bike has a vertical bar for the seat to rest on and women's bikes have diagonal bars, my husband said &#34;Sorry, this won't work on your bike&#34; and went back to playing video games =( Left to my own designs, I was able to get the bar and seat installed. This really will work on most bikes because every part of the bar and seat are adjustable. Figuring out what will work best for your bike may require rebuilding the bar system a few times (it comes full assembled but needs to be disassembled in order to be installed), and in my case it took a couple hours of trial and error in order to get it just right.<br /><br />Once the seat was on, it was great! Since my son is taller, it only supports his lower back, which is fine. I had to adjust the way I ride a bit and the seat digs into my thighs a little, but I'm a bit chubby. If I were thinner, the thighs wouldn't be a problem. Overall, once I learned to balance with the extra weight (30 pounds of baby is a lot to lug around!), my ride wasn't effected very much by the seat.<br /><br />The best thing about it is how easily the seat comes on and off once the bar is installed. In seconds, I can unscrew the seat and ride the bike as if I never had it on there to begin with. And when I want to ride with my son again, I screw the seat back on just as easily, no adjustments needed.
1416955070|4.0|I really was surprised that I enjoyed this book enough to order the sequel.  I had seen it in the store for a while in the \\"teen paranormal\\" section, and was afraid to read it as I thought it'd be like Twilight (which was painful to try and read).  When I got through the first chapter, finally, I discovered I actually was liking the book.<br /><br />Honestly, since the movie is coming out, I figured I'd read it and see if it was worth going to see the movie, or if the book was really focused on the hot shirtless guy on the cover -- I liked the characters, the story was unique, and I liked the premise of a \\"class\\" of people who can see and interact with the supernatural, and who fight evil under cover of illusion.<br /><br />I half didn't like the main character at first, as she's pretty angsty, but that's par for the course with \\"teen paranormal romance\\".  When I got past the feeling of the main Twilight character and saw her as her own person, I started to like her more.  I love the complexity of the team she meets in the Institute, and the mundane friend who has a crush on her that gets sucked into the paranormal world he cannot even see.<br /><br />There were a few scenes that we goryish, but not horrific to read.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to people who like quick reads, fantasy, and romance.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Admittedly, I began this read several times, only to get lost in the first chapters between characters and a complex storyline. After watching the movie (which I felt was well done) I decided to try again. Having a clearer understanding, I was able to glean so much more detail from the book as is generally the case when contrasting to the movie counterpart. I found it difficult to put down, and am beginning the second book right away. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and give it a strong recommendation.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie enough to watch twice - it's a cute story and well done.  I love how the &#34;guardians&#34; are all different than what you'd expect.  Santa is semi-Russian, the Easter Bunny is Australian, and the Sandman is mute and speaks in symbols.  The story is about Jack Frost and his life after the Man in the Moon selected him for his role in the world.  He is happy go lucky, fun, and loves life and making kids happy - he embodies the &#34;fun&#34; that kids see in wintertime.  He isn't thrilled to be selected as a Guardian, and kinds of balks, but once he realizes his power and that he wants to help keep the world safe from the Boogeyman, he embraces it.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes very much,  the story line and all of the characters.  I've been in some places just like the Whistle Stop Cafe and it brought pleasant memories.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|This movie is about a submarine that goes rogue during the Cold War. It is loosely based on true events. The movie stars Ed Harris, David Duchovny, and William Fichtner. The solid acting really help keep this movie afloat. Although, it is also directed well, with a good story, that never gets too complicated. The movie always does a good job at explaining what's going on, and it's interesting because the Captain has visions of his past. David Duchovny really shines in this film. His acting is some of the best I've seen him do in this movie. Will Fichtner is great also, and so is Ed Harris, who is in most of the film. I always love watching Ed act, and he is great in this movie too. This is a very serious movie, but very enjoyable to watch. Do yourself a favor, and rent or buy this film if you like good suspense films. You will enjoy it all the way through.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Good acting and good mystery plot.  I want to see next episode.  The characters are drawn well and I care about them.
B007N579X6|5.0|Despicable Me is easily one of my wife and I's favorite movies and the 3D Blu-ray does not disappoint! Hilarious, from start to finish...enough said!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It twists and turns and always has a surprise but you won't really understand the characters unless you start with season 1
B00471JSR4|3.0|It will never win any awards, but two hours of Channing Tatum is OK by me. Money well spent. Yes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am so involved with the story lines and watch the seasons over and over again ...waiting for season 4 and the return of this masterpiece classic
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I thought this book was about romance?? I am so disappointed , I can even write how I feel at the end he dies and left her some money . He was selfish , he made his choice , good for him.... I don't recommend the book it doesn't end well. I think life is too harsh a least in books you can have a happy ending..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|User friendly and fun! Sid game is great but I need more acorns ! Lol it's fun for myself and my family as well! I will play this game for a long time to come!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Got it for my preemie grandson. Monkey lays on his chest and helps to keep the pacifier in his mouth.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|A simple, easy to use checkers app for Android. Eight difficulty levels, three different styles of boards and checkers. It can be played with one or two players. It even lets you undo your last move (just in case the CPU gets the best of you). ;)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Written by those who know (Amazon) this is a MUST for any author considering turning out a Kindle book. Discusses everything you need to know to avoid layout issues and glitches. Take the time to download and read it, apply it - and save yourself headaches and wasted time later.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so interesting you just keep wanting to know more.<br />I just can't wait to read the book I hope it is as interesting as this book.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|The selection is okay, but not as great as I would have hoped for. But then, what do you expect when searching for free books? I had hoped that it would list Kindle books that are within their free sales days - but alas, no luck.  Still found some interesting reads though. It's worth a try.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|No reason to watch this.  Just no plot, no characters (other than from prior movies they have been in) and no good dialogue.  The best character in this was Dolph - really.  Dolph.  Decent fight scene from Statham.  Other characters were wasted, or got in the way.  I would suggest watching these actors' old movies and skipping this.
0345803485|4.0|this book is a wonderful read and I would recommend to a person who likes sex, and adventure and you will love it/
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All in all, a great game. Perfect for any time of day and a great time killer great for all.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Fell in love with this novel.  Never read anything about the women surrounding King Arthur before. Read Mary Stewart's \\"The Crystal Cave\\" series prior to this.  That series is written from Merlin's point of view. It's excellent as well.
B0060AY85C|5.0|I found parts of this book painful to read.  The struggles of ordinary people were brought to life.  Thank you Ms. Morrison.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A very fun game, but needs more levels. Was disappointed there are only 10. Maybe because it's the free version.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It started off a bit slow like the first, but was still a good read. Enough to pull you into the next book.
B005IY3DP2|5.0|If you're a new comer to KASABIAN than you should definitely acquire their three older albums before listening to this; Getting into this as your first KASABIAN experience is essentially like falling into a trip that 'you don't know how you got there'.<br /><br />Their older albums solidify the foundation for experimental albums like this that allow more creativity from the artists themselves, which is one of the points of music!<br /><br />After a few listens I've chosen a couple as my favorites, while liking the overall album, I prefer: Velociraptor! (Of course, quirky fun song), Acid Turkish Bath, Re-Wired, I Hear Voices, Let's Roll Just Like We Used to, Days are Forgotten and other such songs; they all are great songs in their own respective musical mannerisms and the entire album desires to be added to any KASABIAN fan's collection.<br /><br />I'd have to say the self-titled track, Velociraptor! with its quirky fun attitude about dinosaurs hunting and eating people, would have to be my Favorite song overall.<br /><br />This purchase was a worthy purchase that I had delayed for far too long.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I wish that the makers of these games would add more back story!  If there were more character development I would be much more involved in the game. It's not a bad game, but it could be made so much more than what it is.  It is j u st a hidden object game with a less than minimal storyline.
B009NX409M|4.0|It was good to see two great actors, Meryl Streep and Robert DiNero together.<br />They were much younger then.<br />The movie was a romantic fantasy about two people who meet on a train.<br />I just kept thinking in practical terms. My husband fell asleep before the movie was over.<br />That the entire story was just based on physical attraction and a certain amount of boredom in the player's lives wasn't quite enough for me.. It seems that as we get older we find it harder and harder to &#34;buy&#34; a story like that. But it was entertaining.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed how the plot unfolded.  I won't spoil it for you, but it's worth taking a look.  Matthew was great in this one.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my grandsons. I really loved how the characters danced and interacted. My grandsons wanted me to watch this movie. I'm glad I did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So hard to put things down and get down. I loved it an  can't wait  to read the 3rd one.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I bought soley for the Pink Floyd set! Everthing else was a bonus! A great dvd set, packed with headlining stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby season 3 is fab!  I try to watch every chance I get!<br />It is just like a good book!
B00E1LAS42|2.0|Cloaked in the genre of the novel this is a empty lifeless view of another era lost in the glist and gloss of today. Stylishly boring
B000002TYX|5.0|\\"Free as a Bird\\" is a pleasant reunion between John and the 3 surviving Beatles (I agree with one of the reviewers below who said we're lucky to have that). The song was allegedly written about the freedom Lennon felt after his deportation threats and \\"Lost Weekend\\".<br /><br />On with the rest of the album. It features interviews with John, Paul, and Brian Epstein. We have possibly the 1st Quarreymen recording: a 1958 scratchy recording of \\"That'll Be The Day\\" and an original \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\". There are more demos of this sort- Ray Charles' \\"Hallelujah I Love Her So,\\" \\"You'll Be Mine\\" and the instrumental \\"Cayenne\\". We have Tony Sheridan's fair sounding vocals on \\"My Bonnie\\" before the Beatles take over (with Pete Best, the original drummer) on \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and \\"Cry for a Shadow\\". George sings lead on \\"3 Cool Cats\\" and Paul sings lead on \\"Besame Mucho\\". Also included is Pete Best drumming on \\"Love Me Do\\" before Ringo replaces Best on \\"How Do You Do It\\" (I prefer theirs better than Gerry and the Pacemakers'). An early (and superior) version of \\"One After 909\\" finds its way here. There's a more raucous demo of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and the Beatles experimenting with harmonies on \\"8 Days A Week\\", with an electric 12-string on \\"And I Love Her\\", and with tempo changes on \\"I'll Be Back\\" (which was originally going to be a waltz). Great songs you never heard from the Beatles (until now) include \\"You Know What to Do\\" (George's 2nd song) and \\"Leave My Kitten Alone.\\" And the Beatles really did sound well live, as witnessed by the 1963 recordings (most humorous is \\"Moonlight Bay\\" with Morecambre and Wise!)<br /><br />Also recommended is the CD single which includes demos of \\"This Boy\\", \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and the 1967 \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\\".
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|mocking jay is freaking amazing! i cant stop reading it! the second best book out of all 3 of them! honestly i thought catching fire was better cuz it was mysterious, thrilling, exciting, insane, jaw dropping, and amazing!!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Plenty of action. This movie was not only action but also had good acting to provide a realistic approach for a fun pack entertainment.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I probably shouldn't review books that I don't finish but I was all primed for a winner and after plodding through a couple of hundred pages I put it down.  Very possibly it comes to life in the middle so know that I didn't finish this book.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The movie was alright... and the buzz highlights did not measure up to the hype and needed more action to measure a better score.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|This movie is a must see and will blow you away.  I had to order this for a friend of mine and she could not get enough of it.  If anyone decides to purchase this movie, I would highly recommend that there be no disruptions, otherwise, you will not perceive any of it.<br /><br />You may have to see it twice for the comprehension.  Lastly, pay attention to all of the characters, detail and the overall movie.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using it for a few years now and highly recommend it. Works well and predictive is great. Hope they keep improving on it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|From behind the scenes to interviews, this collection lets you submerge into the Matrix universe and have a complete vision of the story the Wachowski brothers tell.
1419705644|5.0|This book is Algebraic! Totally math! A tiny bit of backstory-- but without giving away too much-- and a little bit of what I can only assume is foreshadowing as well... which I was hoping for. Lots of different sections, and the same type of weird and wonderful humor you can expect from the creators of AT. I highly suggest this to any AT fan.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I especially loved the epilogue to this book. I have to say that it has been a while since I've read a book that I couldn't put down. Thank you for writing it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Unlike other free games, everything can be unlocked by playing. No cash needed. Graphics are also great, my child loves playing with her horse.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Still going good for the third season, this season has some sad times in it though and we are kinda left hanging wondering what is next.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It Rock's<br />Lots of features easy to set alarm, time and temperature function is a breeze. I find very handy for traveling
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a great movie, has  lots of cute sea creatures.<br />My grandson loved it.<br />Recommend it for your collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I luv this game.I think it's good to have it b free and hope u guys tht are planning to get it,to.Do get it. I recomend it for people tht wanna own horses or go horse back riding. I hope u love this game as much as I do and rate it 5 stars do it now!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wow!  An awesome book that touched me so many ways.  I couldn't put it down.  It's amazing how the story spanned multiple generations and several continents.
B000001FN3|5.0|And since we're talking Edgar Allen Poe, that really IS the past!<br />The work Alan Parsons put into this accomplishment is astounding to say the least. It is no mystery how Parsons overtook the sound industries at a time when grunge and screaming at the top of their lungs music was trying to gain an edge, and I doubt the creative sense of the man will diminish any before another similar musical piece is upon us.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|This movie seemed a little slow in the beginning and spoiled kids are not my favorite. The acting was believable and touching. Overall I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it as a touching story and well done from an acting point of view.
B0090CVJZ4|3.0|My first foray into banana plugs....worked well enough.  Solid construction.  The black/red rings are nice, but with smaller wiring, may need to remove the rings to screw together far enough get a good connection.  I managed to make it work, and am now happily enjoying my speakers with convenient plugs. So, not the best design, but for the price works pretty well.
B0087EVHTE|4.0|Definitely gave me the bang for my buck, benchmarks well and keeps at a decent temperature even with the stock fan.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|Gotta love Walter! I appreciate this series for the close attention to character development and the simple fact it does not take itself too seriously where the SF aspects are concerned. The characters are all flawed, interesting, and struggling to grow as human beings.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Be careful it's addictive. Not your grandmother's bingo. Fun free and can earn more credits don't have to wait until you receive daily credits. Slots give another chance to level up and collect coins.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN - TOTALLY ABSORBING.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE NEXT OF HER BOOKS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better than the first.  The graphics are wonderful.  The game is challenging but not so hard as to be unbeatable.  Good for hours of entertainment.
B002OHDRF2|3.0|This is a replacement in the video collection and at an affordable price.  This collection will be donated to a welcoming library and one that we're proud of.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When you play this it instantly gets addictive soo I know I did play this app and you will love it as promised! c;
0425252868|5.0|I began this book because it looked intriguing. As I read it, I began to see that it was more than just history. By the end of the book I felt that I knew these people, and felt as if I had lost a friend when I finished it and put it down.It is a well told story, with interesting history and new information for a history buff, but the personal tales and back stories made it come alive, and more human. I would recommend this to anyone who cares about history, and cares about people. The flying sequences were thrilling, but the stories of the people reinforces the notion that war is an ugly business in which people -- good, bad, innocent or not die or get maimed. Itis more than worth the time spent reading it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it is a great app. You connect to your facebook and you can use it efficiently. It worked great for months, but now I find the app going slow. If I click to veiw my notifications, it takes a while to view them and takes a while to load comments, view a specific status, ect. It is an overall good app, but it has become a bit slow and at certain times makes me impatient.
B000002B30|1.0|This is NOT what I ordered. The packaging was Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits. The sticker on the disc showed Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits. But when I played the disc, it was some crappy pop music. THIS IS A SCAM!
B005723JSQ|1.0|Same old storyline of Sophie Kinsella.  This is becoming boring now. Took me awhile to finish as story was slow.
B005I4JG80|5.0|This book is definitely not a &#34;how to&#34; guide. But it clearly highlights cultural differences that account for different behaviors among French and American children. I grew up in Brazil and the comparisons still stand. There are good many concepts to learn from French families.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a nice, fun game. Especially if you are missing your real horse. It is easy to understand and fun!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I loved your book!!!!!!!! It was do awesome and inspiring than in you for making it . Your awesome Jeff
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is awesome. I think everyone would like this game. I give this game 5 stars. possession posts known for its part was great I need a mad men who
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I got hooked on the free version and couldn't  get enough so purchased full game. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD 8-9,  So far never a glitch whatsoever, very pleased with it.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|As others have said, this is a really excellent history--written by a person who really knows and understands modern European history.  Long, but compulsively readable.  Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|the reset button trips immediately when inserted into the port.. I have to remove it to re-set.Tried 2 different, empty ports on new a Hitachi tv.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|My new favorite band. Progressive music is not dead and these guys could help restart the genre. Yay. Yay. Yay!
B0089XH38M|5.0|I love this app.  Very full featured and one of the smallest apps out there.  It also works on most of my devices, pc,  phone, kindle, etc.  A few years ago I had act running on 1 device  ant 2 other anti-virus on other items,  this one identified and blocked a virus @ 5hours after it hit the net, the others let it thru for about 6 more hours.  That response time to new threats is fantastic.  Just wish it could be moved to SD card on my phone.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I opted to read the book rather than see the movie. I loved the oral history style of writing. Recommend.
B0095D4JUA|5.0|This movie is a classic. I have watched it many times and never get sick of it. I am so happy to have it on my Kindle so I can watch it anytime I want.
0671578855|5.0|For anyone caught up on the brilliant series, this may be one of the most entertaining books ever written.  While there are not a lot of spaceships being blown up (uh. none come tho think of it), it has some of the funniest and best written scenes in the English language.
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|I thought this was going to be sooooo funny! I bought this late at night and would like my money back please!!!!!
B008133MDK|5.0|Contemporary Sherlock is a treat!  More flawed than the others on cinema, and more twisted plots than the others, too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses I just love this app<br />This for all ages but probably be like more by older kids<br />&amp; for horses lovers
B00B7ERH04|4.0|Ok it was good at first then it wouldn't let me record and said that I have to get this for it to work
0064471837|5.0|This is one of those books I try to wait as long as I possibly can before reading again. Why? I love it so much that I want to forget the details between readings so I can be charmed and enchanted all over again. Nix uses elegantly simple language to describe lush things. It's not overly flowery, nor sparse, but that rare combination of the right word at the right moment, every single time.<br /><br />The story is simple and compelling - Sabriel's father has gone missing and she sets out to find him and rescue him - set in a world that is familiar and foreign all at once. She crosses the Wall back to the Old Kingdom and encounters adventures and her own family history on her quest to save her father.<br /><br />The great thing is... she doesn't save him. I know, that may be spoilery, but it really isn't. She saves him, but not in the way everyone was hoping for, and she then takes up the mantle of his responsibilities, namely of making things that were dead STAY dead. And it's great that she DOESN'T save her father, because it's not the easy way. It's the hard way, and many young adult books would shy away from such an answer. Nix doesn't, and does it was with grace and compassion.<br /><br />A marvelous world. A marvelous read. One of my favorite books of all time.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I absolutely LOVE Pinterest, but this app plain sucks. None of my boards show up when I go to pin something. It's also constantly crashing. I have to delete the app from my device, redownload it, and log in again. It will work for a few pins and then crash again! This is ridiculous! They need to get the bugs OUT of this app!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|In the words of James Lee Burke, author of the novel and two other's made into films &#34; they made three movies of my books and they all suck...&#34; Read the books, so much richer an experience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great App. Just solitaire, nothing more or less. Good game to bring with when waiting in line or in the car.
B00992CF6W|3.0|So when I got this app I had already played minecraft before. It USED to work fine... now all of my buttons are gone. Like, my arrow keys, and menu, and pause button disappeared&hellip; I don't know if it's is just me, but it's really annoying.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics. Just challenging enough. As stated in the title. Where's the next one? Would be interested in more like this from fireproof games.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm definitely a Joss Whedon geek, and this is my favorite of his--even more so than Buffy! The dialogue is hilarious and the film was shot with lots of small, hidden details added in for greater depth and entertainment if you pay attention. I love the music also and the fact that they used the actors' actual voices. Neil Patrick Harris was perfect for this role, and the web blogs are my favorite part. They shows Dr. Horrible's vulnerability and bring a realness to the film. Bravo
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This App was pretty good, level ten was a bit of a challenge, but I eventually got it. Try it out for yourself
B005GSY23M|4.0|I loved this movie and the music was mesmerizing and really brought me into the movie. How can you watch this movie without immediately buying the soundtrack after? The first three songs have great vocals and addictive melodies. I especially love Nightcall with the contrast between the woman's voice and the creep, deep male voice. Tick of the Clock is probably the best song (that doesn't have vocals) on the album. The other songs kind of run into each other with none particularly standing out, so it does get a bit boring after a while. I would suggest only buying the first three songs and Tick of the Clock.
0307950689|5.0|I have absolutely nothing bad to say about The Lost Symbol. My husband and I LOVED IT! Just my personal opinion, but Brown is one of the greatest writers of our time. I've been hooked on his work from the very beginning. Maybe it's because I don't care about whether or not his information seems legit, but Brown's imagination, the landmarks he associates with that imagination, and the time he takes to put a little history into each and everyone of his works is very much intriguing to me. I simply love a good book, and do not concern myself with the scholarly aspect of the material. Dan Brown (and Langdon) have yet to fail me. Read the book; you won't be disappointed!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I am still having trouble sleeping after finishing this show a week ago. So scary and twisted. But it's also smart and the acting is superb. The storyline is just keeps you hooked and wanting more. It's worth the sleepless nights.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and I watched it completely.  It's no Lord of the Rings but is consistently entertaining.  The key figure in the movie is Thor (or course) who is marked to be the next king of his nation but his warrior mentality leads him to almost start a war with another nation which his father has worked hard to avoid.  Banished from his kingdom, he grows and learns from his mistakes and eventually regains his father's confidence while exposing his brother duplicity.  This is a good movie for a sequel.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is fun to play with friends or alone.There are so many things to do like slots, free games and different countries to visit a long the way.Bingo Blitz is all the entertainment you need. I play almost everyday.
B006S01GH2|3.0|This is a movie that has its interesting parts but it's not a grabber by any means.  It's certainly not a Hollywood movie and I think its appeal is oriented towards a French audience.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|you can use tip 1 for thin drawings, tip 2 for standard browsing and tip 3 for deleting lines in a drawing
B0095P31L6|3.0|Good graphics and an fairly interesting story. Not a grabber but OK overall.  I would have to think twice before buying.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|The movie was what I had expected and the streaming was good.  I long for the day where all movies are streamed in HD as I miss that when watching a BluRay.  But all things considered it was enjoyable... The streaming... The Movie was Bruce Willis, need I say more.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Some puzzles were truly difficult. Others somewhat easy. You need strong observation skills. My kids and I (10 and 15) enjoyed it. The little ones were especially impressed by the cool graphics.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun game. Can play it for hours on breaks at work but not at home. The wife gets pissed off.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|It is definatley fun to watch new Star Trek episodes.  I wish they would have kept the story line more original like the 1st one.  It had to many similarities with the original Wrath of Khan especially the trapped in the radioactive area.  Though if you like star trek you should still see it.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I have to admit that I approached this album with some trepidation, after all, we are talking Creedence Classics, and any re-working of those great songs are sure to ruffle some feathers. As it turns out, there was no need for concern, for it has been managed very, very well. Mind you, it's not without its faults, but these are minimal & seem more related to who performs with Fogerty, rather than the production of the numbers, which on a scale of 1-10, I would rate a 9.5. The variety of supporting performers is interesting to say the least, & sadly, there are some who seem totally out of place here, with the result that some of the numbers do disappoint. 'Fortunate Son' is one of the great Creedence songs, but the presence of the Foo Fighters fails to render it the awesome rock re-make that perhaps Steven Tyler & Aerosmith could have. Similarly, Kid Rock fails to lift 'Born On The Bayou\\" above the level of average, while the inclusion of Dawes in 'Someday never Comes', results in the album's greatest disappointment. The album would have been better served if Fogerty had gone this one alone. On the plus side, the rest of the album is excellent, with each of the supporting artists combining with Fogerty to show that there are times when you can improve on greatness. The album's 'new' Fogerty songs, 'Mystic Highway' & 'Train of Fools', show that he has lost none of his songwriting talent & is still a force to be reckoned with in the world of rock'n'roll. As for the other tracks, Miranda Lambert proves her worth yet again on the title track, Brad Paisley adds his superb guitar playing skills to Hot Rod Heart (to great effect), Alan Jackson is as accomplished as ever on 'Have You Ever Seen The Rain', the Zac Brown Band are an outstanding addition to 'Bad Moon Rising', and finally, Jennifer Hudson proves once again that she has one of the best voices on the planet on the album's stand-out track (in my humble opinion), 'Proud Mary'. Her soaring voice, along with accompaniment from Fogerty, Allen Toussaint, & the Rebirth Brass band, and an outstanding re-arrangement of this classic number, provide a superb finale to an album, that while not perfect, is still very, very, very good. Despite its flaws (and what album doesn't have flaws), it deserves the five stars given to it. And judging by the comments already lodged, I'm certainly not in the minority for saying so.
B0041D843M|1.0|Please do not change your diet, and especially your children's diet, just after reading this book. Do your research on this book. You will be surprised to find that this theory is not based on any reliable scientific data.<br />Many readers left reviews before me, so I will keep mine short. In my own research I find that there was not one society in the history of the world (except temporarily, some small religious groups) that could sustain themselves on plant diet only. There are many nutrients that we can only obtain from animal sources and cannot get these from plants and even supplements. Take for example preformed vitamin A and real vitamin D, B12, choline, certain fats, and enzymes, etc.<br />To link isolated casein as a cause for cancer is wrong - casein does not appear in isolated form in nature. Casein, along with its co-factors, is found in mothers milk. Our ancestors consumed a lot of foods containing animal protein without ever getting cancer. As a matter of fact, vegans and vegetarians are more prone to different diseases, including cancer, due to weakened immune system, deficiencies, and inadequate nutrition.<br />It is wrong to mislead readers and it is dangerous, especially for children, to eat vegan diet deprived of nutrients they need to grow and develop properly. They need real foods, from healthy grass-fed or pastured animals - not GMO soy or oxalates/pesticides laden spinach salad..
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game a very relaxing game. I enjoy playing it and so do my children. It is something all of us can play.
071815780X|5.0|Love the book.  Have already purchased the spices needed for a few recipes.  Have never been disappointed in any of his books.  I probably have purchased most of them.
B00CXG5E6E|5.0|Not a huge Benson fan, but he does justice to the King with this album. I recommend it for pure listening pleasure. Now if I can just find it on vinyl.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|UPDATE: The Facebook app finally updated on my Kindle recently, and so far so good. (Will update this accordingly if that changes.) Now the news feed is automatically set to \\"top stories,\\" where I view it as \\"recent stories.\\" But if that is the only complaint I have about the update, I'd call that pretty good. At least the gear to change \\"top stories\\" to \\"recent stories\\" was briefly easier to select; it wasn't beforehand. It updated again and now it's a little harder to select the gear. So which way will the gear go, easier or harder? We will see.<br /><br />For the most part, this app works fine, and it refreshes my news feed without a problem. My only complaint, which is why I deducted two stars in the original review, is that it CONSTANTLY crashed when looking through a person's photo albums, including my own. This was very frustrating when I try to look at a friend's photos, say from a vacation, honeymoon, or really anything to do with a person's photos. Thankfully I haven't had this major headache on pages yet, but it is really unfortunate. If I didn't have the constant crashing, I'd have definitely given this app 5 stars. (I don't know if it still kicks me off for viewing photos.)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The best quality video for my Samsung tv, and the movie was awesome!! Never got to finish it in the theater was much better at home anyway
B003UYUR10|5.0|Prince of Persia has all the elements that make a great movie. Style, wonderful cinematography, terrific story, and perfect casting. The movie moves you along seamlessly from scene to scene capturing your attention every step of the way. It's combination of action, comedy, and intrigue leave you wanting more. The character of Dastan is energetic and fun to watch. While Princess Tamina's beauty is beyond compare. The actors playing these characters have terrific chemistry that clearly shows in the film. Prince of Persia is a film you'll want to see over and over again.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I love the remastered version of the series.  They have enhanced the graphics, put in new shots of the original Enterprise while keeping the original dialog.  I love Star Trek and this remastered version is pretty amazing.  Amazon ran a good deal too so I'm having a good time going back and watching the original series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I find myself thinking about these characters and the time era of this shows setting...... Then I look forward to seeing how they all evlove in the next episode.  DELIGHTFUL!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game in the whole world. If you love..... I mean love, love, love running and Despicable Me, you will love this game.
B0031R5K68|2.0|I've read both the previous Robert Langdon books and enjoyed them immensely. Interesting scenarios and an intoxicating mix of truth and fiction. The bad guys were nasty but your imagination could stretch to believing in them. Here though Brown has lost it. His bad guy in The Lost Symbol was a twist and turn too far. Not only was his ultimate revealing unbelievable, there was virtually no backstory that put him where we found him to begin with. Well written and readable but like a hamburger from a fast-food chain - looked better in the picture than it did in the consuming!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I absolutely love the TV series Castle. It is by far one my favorite TV show. All the characters on this show blend so well together you can almost believe it's real. This show is not only an intriguing drama, but is also Awesomely funny. Another amazing show is Bones. Again because of the wonderful cast of characters, mixed with the right amount of drama and comedy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The graphics are amazing and the minions make me laugh. I also like the fact that it's challenging and keeps my attention. All-in-all: GREAT GAME! :)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is a good time and I will figure on playing it to a a while.  I love the battles with others.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this one down. I started and just had to keep reading til the end. Augustus, what a sweet heart! The book is highly emotional and plays on all feelings. You feel happy, sad, grief, laughter, everything. Great Job John Green!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. Words can't describe what I felt when I read this book. My outlook on the world has truly changed. Wonderful book.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I have enjoyed this series so very much and look forward to the companionship of the Crawley's in my livingroom once again.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I love this movie, it funny.. Fast shipping, no scratches and its good to put it on the holidays for a family get together.
B00CKYB3R8|5.0|Loved this movie.  It was funny, serious, and most of all a SURPRISE.<br /><br />Ed Murphy was not his usual self, and vulgar as usual.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|One could tell immediately without being told this was a BBC production.  It bears all the hallmarks which are equated with BBC.  The settings are dressed according to the period, the costumes fit not only the period but are quite suitable for character wearing them.  All in all, I was drawn into the story from the first few moments and have felt compelled to watch subsequent episodes of this series.  I am now into Season 3 and still lookig forward to epidoseds  from Seasons Four.<br /><br />This is a wonderful way to whie away the hours with some great entertainment.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great to figure your greatest number of moves per deal.  You feel as if you have a greater leavel of skill mixed with the luck of the deal.
B005EVV5GI|4.0|... because unlike this edition, that newer release (following this one by only a year or two) has completely re-mastered everything except the lieder following Sym. #4. That newer box is the same price as this one and makes this edition obsolete, good as this one is.<br />None of the other recent Klemperer EMI boxes were re-mastered - just the Mahler box.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|After scoring success with her debut it would be easy to assume that Florence Welch and her band would slip under the pressure of having to follow it up. That critical second album often (but not always) tells you a lot about an artist and in this case we surmise that this group knows exactly what they're doing. There's no denying that Lungs was a creative, big, and surprising debut but Ceremonials bests it in every way imaginable.<br /><br />Let's state the obvious: Florence has a powerful voice and she knows how to use it. She's the steering wheel of this band and she carries every song with a strong sense of passion and determination while her band provides the big rhythms and sonic muscle to propel her along. They work well together and help to create a massive wall of sound that blows you away but never feels intrusive or self-indulgent. The tone is a bit darker and more cinematic this time around but it also makes the album more cohesive and epic as a result. It's not quite as playful as Lungs but musically and lyrically it's every bit as strong and to my ears better. The opening four tracks (\\"Only If for a Night\\", \\"Shake It Out\\", \\"What the Water Gave Me\\", and \\"Never Let Me Go\\") make up one of the best openers to any album I've ever heard. They are stunningly good and serve to let the listener know they're in for a darker, more intense journey. The rest of the LP doesn't disappoint either, from the haunting \\"Seven Devils\\" to the 80's-inspired \\"Breaking Down\\" to the powerhouse of \\"Spectrum\\", I can honestly say that every track feels like it belongs and the running order is carefully sequenced to provide an engaging and emotional journey. Some tracks are a bit better than others but I'd be hard-pressed to cut any of these songs from the album. Each one creates it's own gothic world of towering cathedrals, gospel choirs, and booming instrumentals. It flows together so well and it's skillfully crafted for maximum impact.<br /><br />The album's only weak point comes in the form of the mastering, which sounds a bit too loud and at times detracts from the rich textures that Welch and producer Paul Epworth so delicately create. It's not enough to harm the record in any significant way but it's disappointing that sublime albums like this can be slightly tarnished by the industry's continued use of over-compression. That being said, this is a magnificent recording and one that nearly two years later still leaves me stunned. I had the pleasure of seeing her open for U2 in Nashville a couple summers ago and she's every bit as incredible live, so don't pass up an opportunity to see her in concert. She and her band are destined for great things.s in the form of the mastering, which sounds a bit too loud and at times detracts from the rich textures that Welch and producer Paul Epworth so delicately create.

B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a very simple application to use, though I'm sure the math behind the interface is interesting. It's fun to use, since it takes no brainpower to use. The kids love it. I love it too. I draw random patterns when I'm working on a problem and get stuck. While I'm busy drawing out patterns, the fuzz clears out of my brain and lets me concentrate again.<br /><br />The images are fantastic on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; and really show off the high resolution.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game but it's my fourth time to start over each time I've gotten to a level over fifty five it has crashed and very disappointing to have to uninstall and start over even more so if you have spent real money.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I started playing a few months ago and my 4 year old son quickly learned to play. He then talked his father into downloading and starting his own game!  We have spent no money on in-app content, although you can.  I like that there is no penalty for not &quot;checking in&quot; on your park, but I still log in twice a day to collect our coins.  Fun app with lasting play value!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|While it is by no means going to win any prestigious awards, this film is perfect for anyone looking for a good time. Fun, gore, gadgets, and great one-liners: everything you could ask for, right? And hey, it's Jeremy Renner, right? You just can't go wrong.<br /><br />Don't go into this hoping for a life-changing film. It's a quick, exhilarating ride that's guaranteed to make your day a little happier.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This game is fun visually and provides a challenge for kids and adults alike. I can highly recommend this app for those looking for something that makes you use your brain cells without causing too much frustration .It's perfect for relaxing on the beach.try it on your lunch hour too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more levels, that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.<br />Really fun and makes you think.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun little addictive game to play. Super bonus that it is free and you don't need to buy anything to play the game.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|On easy. it is exactly. that but it is additive. and time killer. it loaded. great and easy and the. graphics are gd
B00B7Y0206|4.0|The YouTube on my kindle stopped working so I got this app and I loved it till I got on it me and my friend were going to watch a video and it said v tube has stopped working and I turned of my kindle and turned it back on and It still doesn't work but I work at the beginning when I got it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Can be extremely addictive but the daily credits are low and it feels like you have to buy credits in order to play. You can only get 10 credits per day from your friends which really sucks, especially if you have been sent twenty or more daily.
B000FC130E|5.0|Few books create such a thoroughly wonderful, funny, terrifying world, that you return to yours with such reluctance. Bravo Richard, walk through that brick wall...door.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I wanted to love this book and I enjoyed it quite a lot. But I can't get passed some of the plot points. I wanted Rachel to pick up the phone when she found out the truth. She was ready to kill the person she suspected, but willing to let the true killer go on with his life? Why? Because he's suffered a different loss. No way. No mother would let that slide, not in a million years. She's going to resign her job so she doesn't have to see him carry on with his life but she won't pick up the phone to tell the police? Never. Oh and his wife is going to stick it out as well. No, not at all plausible. It made me hate characters I was enjoying throughout the book.<br /><br />Still, a great read and I will definitely read more by Ms. Moriarty. I just really hope in her other books the bad guy gets what's coming to him.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I recently started reading the Jack Reacher series and simply love them.  Lee Child's stories demonstrate a stellar imagination. I have seen an improvement with each book that is written.  I am currently reading #3 of the series and can't wait to read the next one.<br /><br />I am an avid reader and I don't know how I missed these books!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really fun and has a lot of action! So much to do and think.  You have to think fast before you character falls or misses.
B000003N7F|2.0|A very weak transfer.  Best to keep looking out for the original orange and black Impulse lp, or, if you can afford it/find it, the 45 rpm reissue I believe was AS-77.  This was thoroughly disappointing, Jones, Tyner and Garrison are reduced to sounding like a polite backing band on this transfer some unknown reason.  This is one recording where the cd is still superior to the commonly available vinyl.  Hopefully someone will get this right AND make it easily available to the public.  Someday.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.......did I say Awesome!!!!!!!  Ok so I will never look at a circus the same again. This book displayed magic and illusions in a way I had never read before. The first couple of chapters it took me a while to read (I personally just couldn't connect, but as I kept reading things got much better).<br /><br />Two characters bound to a challenge at a very young age, neither knowing the exact rules of which to play by but brought up with very different instructors and philosophies. One taught through books, the other through experience; each not knowing who the other is or when and where the challenge begins. As the story progresses this elaborate circus is constructed and thus the game begins. With an entire circus as the venue for the challenge both Celia and Marco displays there talents to the best of their ability not knowing that the risk to them both is greater than the reward.<br /><br />A very beautifully constructed story full of illusions, unexpected events and forbidden romance, this is definitely a novel I would read again and also recommend. Author Erin Morgenstern created a story told from various characters point of view :-) and it's what made the story so much more interesting as you took the journey with the characters as each story entwined to complete a spectacular novel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun so far.  Don't know how many levels they give for this free version, but it's fun.  Doesn't take long to do each level.
0545586178|5.0|It kept my attention from beginning to end.  I've already got the third book.  I look forward to starting it soon.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I returned two of these units already because of the poor battery compartment design. The third one that I just recently purchased had the same exact flaw. It seems you have to wiggle the battery back and forth because the contacts in the battery compartment don't connect very well with the battery contacts. I managed to fix this by using a dremel tool and cut away the small plastic surrounding the holes on the battery, now it works like a charm.<br /><br />I rate the functionality of how it cleans much higher (4 stars) than my one star posted here but given the fact that I had to return two of them already and this one having the same issue just really ticked me off. The technical support team was of no help either.<br /><br />If you purchase this item I also recommend you purchase a dremel tool, you're going to need one.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was nice to read but I will not recomend it to my friends . It was not that special , just ok .
B000001FKY|5.0|Following up a great album is always a difficult task, even for legendary bands like Def Leppard. And this is an especially challenging chore when considering that the band's last album, 1983's \\"Pyromania,\\" was their watershed release. But nonetheless, Def Leppard put forward a valiant attempt with `87's \\"Hysteria.\\" And even though the band probably did not make a strong enough case to usurp that aforementioned 1983 release in terms of greatness, they did produce yet another stellar hard rock/traditional heavy metal album, and one that needs to be hounded down by all fans of either genre.<br /><br />The album begins with a glam metal throwback song in the form of \\"Women,\\" which backs big, bobbing, staccato, synth-aided guitar riffs with wailing solos and vocals. The next handful of tracks after that are all arena-ready tunes, but only the first of them is at all heavy. It, \\"Rocket,\\" is an insanely catchy and infectious hard rock anthem with hooky staccato beats and guitar licks. The next two songs, then, are both anthemic, as well, but are both power ballads, with \\"Animal\\" and the soaring \\"Love Bites\\" (which is laced with memorable lyrics) tastefully weaving in some delicious melodic guitar leads into its mix of huge, meaty hooks. Another one of the album's best moments is \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me,\\" a track that, despite boasting a distinctly AC-DC-esque song title, actually has more in common with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. It does, after all, boast some mammoth, brutally heavy, and all around excellent, Zeppelin-styled riffage. And when some Rush-like swing and instantly memorable and catchy hooks (including epically epic choruses) are added to the mix, the end result is \\"Hysteria\\"'s most well-known hit single -- and rightfully so, too!<br /><br />And the next series of songs continue in this heavier-than-usual fashion, doling out \\"Armageddon II,\\" \\"Gods Of War,\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun,\\" three big riff-rockers filled with hefty, chugging guitar licks, and anchored by solid, grumbling bass bottoms, and iced with contagious, sing-songy vocals. (The latter two inclusions in this bunch are particularly bass-heavy, as they boast propulsive bass fills, and, in the case of \\"Gods Of War,\\" a noteworthy bass intro, too.) The last two songs that I will mention are \\"Run Riot\\" and the title cut, with the former being like the album's opener (the above-described \\"Women\\") in that it is a glam-esque metal song that evokes Kiss and Scorpions (thus, it is needless to say that it is a VERY catchy tune), and the other being a piece of bloated modern rock power balladry with atmospheric acoustic strumming, sweet lyrics, and heartfelt vocals.<br /><br />So, to reiterate the main point, here, \\"Hysteria\\" is a very enjoyable, memorable, and all-around excellent hard rock/heavy metal record. And that is just when taken on its own terms, without accessing how influential and important the release was (it paved the way for trillions of pop-metal and hair metal outfits).

140006922X|3.0|I was initially attracted to this book, as I am sure most of our parishioners are, by the reaction to the author's interview with the correspondent of Fox News.  No doubt Sunday School Classes and small groups are talking about it, if not selecting it for study.<br /><br />I find his account an interesting review of previous scholarly analysis by others that he analyzes and presents in his own conclusions:<br /><br />THE HISTORICAL JESUS AND THE CHRIST OF FAITH:  Jesus of Nazareth was an illiterate revolutionary peasant who led a movement against the priestly aristocracy and Roman occupation resulting in his execution as an insurrectionist.  At two particular points in history when \\"zeal\\" for the Jewish homeland brought reprisal from Rome Jesus' original message was radically changed.  The capital punishment imposed by Rome in Jesus' crucifixion and the wrath of the Jewish leaders led the Jersualem community to reinterpret Jesus' teaching as a spiritual life requiring adherence to the rites and regulations of Judaism.  The destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE resulting from the political overthrow of Roman rule by the Zealot Party (among others) led the early Gospel writers to further spiritualize the message to insulate the community from the charge of insurrection.  The historical Jesus bears little resemblance to the Christ of the faith of the church.<br /><br />JESUS AND JOHN THE BAPTIST:  Jesus was mentored by John the Baptist in the wilderness, eventually discerning his own revolutionary understanding on the theological base John first learned in the Essene community at Qumran (site of the Dead Sea Scrolls).<br /><br />JAMES AND PAUL:  James, the brother of Jesus, and head of the Christian community that continued to adhere to Jewish rites and rituals in their following of Jesus, soundly condemned Paul's Hellenistic reinterpretation of the teaching of Jesus.  Most, if not all, of the letters of Paul are written to counter the arguments of emissaries that James sent to the Pauline communities in order to reprimand and correct them.  The Letter of James, with its emphasis on works, is a clear defense of necessity of Jewish practices as the legitimate expression of the faith.<br /><br />He only makes brief mention, and summarily dismisses, the extensive scholarly work on Jesus' teaching on nonviolence.  He also concludes that references to the divinity of the Son of God are inventions of the Gospel writers to serve the church's understanding of the nature of Jesus<br /><br />What I found most helpful is his convincing argument on the centrality of Jesus' concern for the poor and the corporate nature of the Kingdom of God as the overturning of the corrupt culture of power and greed, an understanding often disregarded in our own day in favor of a more individual, spiritual salvation.<br /><br />Frankly, this book by a scholar of religion and the Bible who is also a Muslim, is provocative but presents no novel conclusions beyond those of the scholars upon whom his argument depends, whatever their own faith happens to be.<br /><br />Rev. William G. Davidson<br />United Methodist Minister, retired<br />North Myrtle Beach, SC
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hated to see it end.  I had heard so much about the show but had never viewed it as I do not watch television.  it was wonderful. Watched all three seasons free with my prime subscription.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Of the Iron Man the trilogy, the first film is still the best one.  It has a great balance of story, characterization, and action.  However, even in saying that, there is still only one film that, in my opinion, has given us the best and most complete version of Iron Man, and that was \\"The Avengers,\\" which is still my favorite film with Iron Man (who has always been my favorite superhero).<br /><br />Any time that you sacrifice story for special effects or human connection for spectacle, you end up with a very flat story and film.  George Lucas once stated shortly after the first Star Wars film in 1977 that \\"special effects without a good story is a pretty boring thing.\\"  There is a lot of irony in that statement since he largely broke his own \\"rule\\" with his latest trilogy, which is also why the newer trilogy is largely considered to be quite inferior to the previous one.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 delves deeply into the mind and psyche of Tony Stark.  We already know that he is a man of great wealth and intellect, who often prefers a drink in his hand or a one-night stand at his side, than to have to deal with any real human connection.  This is an aspect of the character that is largely taken from the comic book storyline of Tony Stark.  In a very real sense, it can be distilled down to \\"the man vs. the machine,\\" which ironically, is a theme that has been addressed in many science fiction and fantasy storylines.<br /><br />The principal villain of this film is a terrorist known as The Mandarin who is assisted by and orchestrated by AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics), founded by Aldrich Killian (wonderfully portrayed by Guy Pearce) who wishes to demonstrate an unnatural union between scientific advancement and human biology.<br /><br />Tony Stark's world is turned upside down by the Mandarin who instigates an attack upon Tony at his Malibu beach home.  The attack is well orchestrated as we see Tony struggle to save himself, but also the one person in his life that he realizes that he loves even more than himself: Pepper Potts.<br /><br />With many of his suits of armor destroyed, and stuck with his most advanced, yet non-working, M-42 suit of armor, Tony must figure out a way to, not only find out who has masterminded the attacks, but how to stop them and get his life back...largely without the use of the armor that he has become so largely dependent on.<br /><br />Tony Stark realizes how fragile his life is, and how dependent he has become upon his armor.  Perhaps so much so, that he has forgotten the human aspects of himself.  He has done a tremendous amount of good in the world, since the invention of his armor and the alteration of his company's ideals and mission.  However, Tony is also forced to come to terms with his own mortality, which is largely exacerbated by the trauma of nearly being killed in New York while fighting to save the Earth alongside his fellow Avengers.<br /><br />There isn't a whole lot of Iron Man in this film, and those who were really looking forward to seeing a lot of Iron Man may find this film to be largely disappointing.  Iron Man 3 could easily be titled \\"Tony Stark,\\" because the film's story is about him, not Iron Man.  Robert Downy Jr., who has already immortalized himself as Tony Stark/Iron Man gives us a greater depth of that character than has ever been done before.  And, of course, his performance is as magnificent as it ever has been.<br /><br />The film does have a number of moments that you may find yourself \\"raising your eyebrows\\" at; situations that just don't seem to fit or situations that might detract from the story.  These elements prevent, in my opinion, this film from becoming even better than it is.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 works because it focuses on the human elements; the connection that the viewer feels with and for Tony Stark; his constant inner battle with who he is and what is really important in his life.  Perhaps he even succeeds in realizing that Iron Man may very well be a part of him, but Iron Man is not all that he is.  And Pepper greatly serves Tony by, perhaps, being the only person to realize this and accept both Tony and Iron Man for who they are.<br /><br />Joss  Whedon gave us an exciting Iron Man as well as a fallible and all-too-human Iron Man/Tony Stark in \\"The Avengers\\".  We have already seen Tony at his most charming, most selfish, most defensive, most exciting, and most self-sacrificing self.  Iron Man 3 gives us Tony at his most vulnerable state.  And perhaps that is why we can relate to him so well, because facing and dealing with our own vulnerable states is most often that one thing which we most fear to do.rt of him, but Iron Man is not all that he is.

B005HEPOKU|5.0|this is probably the most accessible star trek version for those who do not initially think that they are into science fiction. Season two starts getting into the stories behind the characters and although there are great space elements to many of the plot lines, its really more about the interpersonal relationships of the crew. However I would recommend you avoid the ones that take place mainly on the holo-deck like the sherlock holmes episodes.
0525478817|5.0|Okay, guys, I've been holding out on you. I finished this amazing book that most of you have probably already read (and if you haven't, you need to), but I just couldn't bring myself to review it. The Fault in Our Stars, wow, well I knew it dealt with cancer and people said it sounded like a Lurlene McDaniel book...so it's been on my to-read list forever. I finally bought the ebook version when it went on sale for 3.99 on Amazon. I had so many other things to do and read before I started that book, so I just opened one page just to see what it was like, and I was instantly sucked in to the story. First, although I love Lurlene, the writing style is way different. It paints what I believe to be the cold hard truth of cancer --- you're scared, not brave. You have no choice but to put on that brave face for others, but internally it's frightening. So many stories (not always Lurlene's, but others) dealing with cancer kind of glorify the `victim', like they're so wonderful and perfect and strong...when really, they're human like the rest of us, and John Green captures that perfectly.<br /> Hazel Grace is a cancer `survivor', though the cancer is still there, dwelling in her lungs. She walks around with an oxygen tank, as reclusive as her mother will allow, and is forced to attend a cancer support group. It is there that she meets Augustus Waters, another cancer survivor who had the unfortunate experience of losing a limb. The two hit it off, and soon enough they're talking about a favorite book of Hazel's --- analyzing it and discussing the `ending'. Their friendship/relationship deepens, but as Hazel gets sicker and sicker, Augustus gives Hazel what he hopes to be a wonderful gift...but sadly, the world is not a wish granting factory.<br /> The writing style is so raw and real. I cannot wait to read John Green's other books. Five stars, for sure!

B007AL48UK|5.0|First, I encountered no bugs in this game (Kindle HD 8.9). That is always important to get out of the way. :-)<br /><br />The game plays smoothly, and has nice graphics. Tiles are easy to differentiate. You have the option to play from many tile set-ups, including the traditional basic configuration every Mahjong player knows. The summertime theme includes clouds depicting various kinds of weather, and beach images such as sand buckets and sea shells. However, the tile icons aren't really that important. The fact that this is a solid Mahjong game which you can grab as the free app of the day is what's important. :-)<br /><br />The game keeps track of time on each tile configuration, so you can try to beat the clock and establish your fastest time.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants a Mahjong app on their phone or tablet.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|If you are a true Sabbath fan, this is for you. This album will make you forget there is a gap between Never Say Die and 13. The non Ozzy years are great but they were not the original Sab four. We, as fans will spend our hard earned money and buy everything available from the artists. Think of it as baseball fans. Boston RedSox fans will still cheer on the team wether they win or lose. This recording may not have met some peoples expectations of hearing another album like Paranoid or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and shame on anyone who thinks that way. Those recordings of the past were made great because they are what the band felt at the time. Is anyone out there the same as they were 35-40 years ago? This album is a must own to anyone who calls themselves a fan. It is the recording of the century. I spent a year and a half saying \\"Black Sabbath will never pull off a great album\\". Wow....was I wrong. The more you listen, the better it gets. I only wish my stereo had an 11 on the volume control. I hope if they film the tour, they film the whole concert and put any interviews and comentaries on  separate tracks. The Reunion tour back in 2000 was a disapointment for that very reason.

The CGI environments are interesting but sometimes it appears that all they overwhelm the story and stiff acting by Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Overall, the concept and the visuals are enough to recommend this.

B005LAIIQC|1.0|Here's a summary of the movie: talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, shoot-out in a house, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, more talk and then a chase through Manila slums.  The end.  About one hour into the movie, it gets interesting for about 7 minutes, then there's a who lot more talk.  No wonder Matt Damon turned it down.  Screenplay is inept and direction is mediocre.  I'm still not sure what this was about or what was at stake -- if anything.  The dialogue is a laughable attempt to use tech and military jargon.  The take-away is: Be sure and take your \\"chems\\" when off the grid.  And watch out for drones especially if you don't know how to trap a wolf and feed him the tracking device embedded in your belly that you just cut out.  And I loved the first BOURNE movie.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is the classic game I used to play with my friends. It's very fun; I could play for hours except that I need to wait for the almost hourly scratch cards to get the gold tokens.

1781162646|5.0|King has returned to the style of writing I enjoyed with his earlier works of CARRIE, FIRESTARTER, etc. I fell into this while reading, and literally went through it in one sitting. I had just finished CARNIEPUNK, an anthology of carnival stories, and King's usage of carny language, and life, just jumped out to grab me. I felt drawn in to Jones (main character) as he dealt with life in general, and for the first time in a long time, I actually got a bit teary-eyed at the ending. Definitely a thriller, and a hard case crime read, that includes King's bit of twist! If you enjoyed THE COLORADO KID, you'll love this one, too!

B00ARA4SLU|3.0|This is the 2-disc release of Hitchcock (2012). It looks at the relationship between Hitchcock and his wife Alma when Psycho was filmed. The picture and audio quality are excellent. There is also a book attached to this film written by Stephen Rebello. Both the film and book suffer from the same problem in that most of the content is public knowledge now. They are both interesting but not particularly groundbreaking anymore since the book was first published in 1990 and other sources cover the events in more detail. Hitchcock is iconic but much more info about him has since come to light. The film tends to show Hitchcock bumbling around while Alma was the real genius. Alma was influential but Hitchcock was in a class of his own. Key players like Bernard Herrmann, Hilton Green, Rita Riggs, John Gavin, Universal, Revue Studios, and even the Bates Motel seem like background figures in this 2012 biographical drama. The film grossed $6 million US domestically.

B00CBT04LI|3.0|This Blu-Ray is the prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing that was released in 2011. The storyline of the prequel is very similar to John Carpenter's version. A team of isolated workers in Antarctica encounter an alien among them. Ultimately it can't quite compare to the classic JC version. It ended up bombing at the box office.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />- Deleted/Extended Scenes (HD, 9 min.) - Various scenes that were filmed but not used.<br />- 'The Thing' Evolves (HD, 14 min.) - Writing The Thing.<br />- Fire and Ice (HD, 4 min.) - Special Effects in The Thing.<br />- Feature Commentary with Director Matthijs Neijnngen and Producer Eric Newman<br />- U-Control, My Scenes, D-BOX Motion Code, BD-Live, Pocket Blu App<br /><br />This release is somewhat light on the bonus content (27 minutes long plus the director's commentary). A 2-hour documentary (even half of one) would be a treat for fans.

There is nothing new in this 30th Anniversary Box Set and not all of the extras from the Halloween DVD or BD are available here. Forget about the new content from the Halloween BD (all-new audio commentary with writer/director John Carpenter and star Jamie Lee Curtis, all-new featurette entitled \\"The Night She Came Home\\" - a documentary-style piece showing Jamie Lee Curtis attending a fan convention). Even Disc 2 of 25 Years of Terror (2006) is not included (just the documentary). Halloween 5 does not have the new audio commentary released on BD either. Perhaps it is unfair to compare the set to Blu-ray but the prices have come down so much for the films you may be better off buying the stand-alone versions separately. Ultimately you have to compare how much you are getting from this aged box set. $46 is on the high side. There are 3 copies of Halloween alone (Restored, Extended and Blu-ray) and not enough of the sequels in this 6-disc box set.<br /><br />Titles Included: 1) Halloween Restored original 1978 film 2) Halloween Extended Edition 3) Halloween 4 The Return Of Michael Myers 4) Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers 5) Halloween 25 Years Of Terror (2006) - 83 Minutes 6) BONUS DISC Halloween BR release. This set is OK but much of the Halloween canon is missing. The obvious question is why pick Halloween I, IV and V for a 30th Anniversary collection. I wouldn't say that is the best trilogy in the series. Freddy got 7 films on 5 BDs. Jason got 12 films on 10 BDs. Mike Myers surely deserves deluxe treatment. Also check out Halloween II and III which got great BD releases full of extras (the rest are average). It doesn't look like a deluxe Halloween collection is coming to DVD or Blu-ray. Perhaps one day Americans will get a release of Halloween Complete Collection Set 1 - 8. Also Includes \\"25 Years\\". 10 Discs Total. Imports, Region 1 (Us & Canada). that was released in Europe in 2004. The 30th Anniversary Box Set has managed to hold its value well.are average).

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Psycho is about a mother and son team of motel owners who keep a dark secret from their guests. Norman Bates is the son who lovingly cares for the Bates Motel, his guests and of course his mother. This 2010 Blu-ray of Psycho has been remastered so it looks and sounds excellent. The bonus features are superb and we get a new Psycho Sound featurette. There is over 3 hours of supplements. I don't hand out 5 stars everyday but I must admit this release does not falter on anything. The transfer, picture, audio, original film, and overall release is great.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />NEW Psycho Sound<br />The Making of Psycho (1997) - 94 Minutes<br />In The Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy (2008) - 26 Minutes<br />Hitchcock / Truffaut Interview Excerpts<br />Newsreel Footage: The Release of Psycho<br />The Shower Scene: With and Without Music<br />The Shower Scene: Storyboards by Saul Bass<br />The Psycho Archives<br />Feature Commentary with Stephen Rebello (author of \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho\\")<br />Lobby Cards, Behind-the-Scenes Photographs, Production Photographs, Theatrical Trailer, Re-release Trailers<br /><br />What else do Psycho film franchise fans need?<br />- Psycho II, III, IV also star Anthony Perkins. Psycho II is considered one of the greatest sequels of all-time in the horror genre. It is quite the gem with more great performances, more disappearances and a good mystery. There is a triple feature with the sequels on a single DVD disc. I, II and III now have deluxe stand-alone BDs. Skip the offshoot TV movie (abominable production values) and Psycho remake (comedy bomb).<br />- The Psycho Legacy (2010) - A rather average documentary that adds bonus content to Psycho II, III and IV.<br />- Hitchcock & The Making of Psycho (2012) - It is a dramatic portrayal of the real life events described in the book of the same name.<br />- [Books] Robert Bloch's original Psycho novel, Psycho II and Psycho House (somewhat unrelated to the films). Psycho II focuses on Lila Crane and Sam Loomis and it doesn't quite work without Norman Bates taking a starring role. In Psycho House the Bates Motel has been converted into a tourist attraction where Norman and Mother have been turned into robots! Hitchcock & The Making of Psycho by Stephen Rebello is about the making of Psycho. It is well-known to fans but there are tidbits sure to raise eyebrows. [[ASIN:0671604295 Hitchcock (Revised Edition)]] is a classic interview by Truffaut in its original length (excerpts are provided on the BD).<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. My only complaint is that Psycho never got 2-discs in a DVD or BD release (it manages to squeeze an amazing amount of extras on this disc). There is no director's commentary or deleted scenes. I'm still waiting on the four-disc Psycho 1-4 (2011 DVD Box Set) released in Region 2. If you like Hitchcock then check out his deluxe US Blu-ray collection (which also includes Psycho and all of the bonus features). Universal put love in this Blu-ray and it shows.

B0000560XY|4.0|This is a 2-disc special edition of a great movie. I cannot believe it has not been released on BR. We do get a director's cut with a whopping 24 minutes of additional footage. However, a director's commentary and more featurettes would be terrific. The documentary is quite interesting but could be extended now. This was one of the first films to get a two-tape VHS release. In May of 1993, the first THX-certified LaserDisc title of the Special Edition Box Set was released and was a best seller for the year. Both the theatrical and SE editions are available on DVD only in non-anamorphic versions.<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Original Theatrical Version<br />Special Edition Version, 24 mins of additional footage<br />Text Commentary option for both versions<br />Collector's Edition 12 page booklet<br /><br />Disc 2<br />Trailers, Behind-the-scenes footage<br />Documentary \\"Under Pressure: Making The Abyss\\"<br />James Cameron's Original Screenplay<br />Featurette, Visual Effects Reel, Photo Gallery<br />Cast Biographies, Multi Angles of Pseudopod Sequence<br /><br />Buy this film on DVD until we get a Blu-Ray release. The extras were very good in the 2-disc DVD release but 2-3 hours of fresh content is needed to up the content for today's standards. A new documentary and commentaries with the cast and crew would be great in a Blu-Ray release.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis to free Dune from the emperor's rule. The 2006 DVD Extended Edition of Dune contains more bonus content than the BD release. The real problem is that David Lynch isn't interested in doing a director's cut (nor has he ever endorsed the television or extended cut of the film) so a definitive version of the film may never be released. I rate the film 4 stars but this release only 3 stars.<br /><br />Special Features on DVD:<br />Feature 1: Original Theatrical Version - 2 Hours 17 Minutes<br />Feature 2: Extended Version Version -  2 Hours 57 Minutes<br />Deleted Scenes with Introduction by Raffaella De Laurentiis<br />Designing Dune, Special Effects, Models & Miniatures, Wardrobe Design, Photograph Gallery, Production Notes

And the star, Tatiana Maslany, who I'm sure few people in the US have heard of, gives BY FAR the best performance by any actor this past season. Unfortunately, this show is on the BBC.  But, by this time next year word of mouth will make the show a hit and Tatiana a star.  (PS You can get this show on BBC if you have Comcast. Turn to TV shows by network, go to BBC, and scroll down to Orphan Black,there you will be able to get all 10 episodes of the first season. I do not know if other cable services carry the BBC. You will be hooked after one episode.)

B00E9PXI3S|5.0|This isn't a straightforward erotic thriller with a lesbian twist--viewers expecting that are bound to be disappointed. It's certainly erotic, and the lesbian twists are in there, but this is a super-slinky, ultra-elegant, ironic, and perverse art object of a movie. A key suspense sequence occurs in split screen with a Debussy ballet. Dream sequences abound. The cinematography is spectacularly lush and crystal clear, the actresses are gorgeous, and they appear to be having great fun being bad. The director, Brian de Palma, has no particular interest in routine believability or the mechanics of the police investigation. He's more interested in faking us out with wild changes in perspective and tone, and making everything supercharged and sexy. I loved it, but it's probably a minority taste. Hitchcock's later, dizzy/dreamy thrillers like \\"Vertigo\\" weren't huge hits either.

1575666286|4.0|I find the concpet of nutrition as the basis of health quite logical. It's like the performance you get out of a muscle car with 103 octane unleaded fuel instead of 81 octane leaded fuel, ha ha ha!  I've always tried my best to eat right and exercise but in today's modern lifestyle it's not that easy.<br /><br />I started researching about alternative methods to fight disease, particularly cancer after someone close to me died after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I stumbled onto this book about how nutrition is the basis for the body's natural healing process. My wife and I then decided to experiment on ourselves and did a 10 day fruit and vegetable juice only fast. We felt lighter, clear headed, more energetic and my wife's constant fatigue went away.  I continue to read the book as the whole method is quite comprihensive and for a terminally or seriously illed person who's liver and kidneys need to be restored back to health before full healing can begin. This involves additional nutritional supplements and cleansing methods I haven't had the need or chance to try yet.<br /><br />On the minus side I find that sometimes the author is trying a little hard to reaffirm the Gerson Method as valid and, although I have seen mild yet positive results, that should be up to the reader to decide.

B00A285OOW|3.0|I'm a huge fan, both of Philippa Gregory in general and of the Cousins' War series. But this one was a tough read. The story was interesting, and it's fascinating to read it from the perspective of the different players, as always in her novels. But I felt as though Gregory were running out of steam. Every character seems to be a master of redundancy; everyone mimics everything everyone else says. Dialogue is reduced to monologue with an echo. It was hard to tell whether none of them was very bright, or Gregory had simply become bored with her subject matter, but I really had to slog through this one. Very disappointing.

1781162646|5.0|I think I've found my new favorite Stephen King novel.<br /><br />When I picked up Joyland, I was hoping to use it for inspiration for a personal project. I thought it would be a killer clown story. Instead, what I got was one of the greatest coming-of-age stories that I have read in a long time. And, honestly? That was something I needed but didn't realize.<br /><br />For a quick summary, Devon Jones travels to a small North Carolina amusement park, Joyland, for a summer job. While there for the interview, he hears stories of a grisly murder that occurred in the house of horrors ride. The victim's ghost purportedly haunts the ride, and summer help is prone to see her. As the summer winds down, Devon decides to stay at the park to work through the grief of his recently-ended college romance. He also wants to discover more about the murder. During this time, he befriends a young boy, Mike, who suffers from muscular dystrophy. Mike's mother, Annie, is very reluctant to take Mike to Joyland, but Devon and Mike convince her that it will be all right.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the story was the description of Devon's work \\"wearing the fur.\\" In other words, dressing up in a dog suit to entertain the park's visitors. I loved this because it rang of authenticity. I don't know if Mr. King did this, or talked extensively with someone who did, but it is the real deal. The way he describes the feeling of being a mascot, the joy on children's faces when you dance, the heat headaches... it's all true. I write from personal experience. I know it's an odd thing to bond with a character over, but as soon as Devon put on the Howie costume, I was one with him and wanted him to succeed at everything.<br /><br />A year from now, what I'll probably remember best about this story is the amusement park and carnival environment of the book. The patter of the barkers, the description of their worldview, the in-crowd lingo took a story that could have been very drab and deadpan and really gave it life. It made me want to run away and join a carnival so I could experience it myself.<br /><br />I'd recommend Joyland to pretty much anyone, but particularly to those who have always turned up their noses at \\"that Horror writer, Stephen King.\\" This is a fetching little story that's great for a rainy day. If you're looking to buy fun, look no further.

B00BURWSG6|5.0|Unlike many Stratovarius fans, I'm an American, 52 years old, and consider myself a connoisseur of finely crafted heavy metal,<br />and I own a very large collection of music to compare against.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Stratovarius for many years, so I was sad when I read that Timo Tolkki had left the band a few years ago.<br />Nonetheless, I faithfully bought the latest couple Stratovarius CDs in the hopes that they could carry on. One of the reasons<br />is because I'm a big fan of virtuoso Jens Johansson, arguably one of the best keyboard players on the planet. Unfortunately, those<br />CDs were a huge disappointment and I never listen to them. It reaffirmed in my mind that Timo Tolkki was the creative force behind<br />the band, and without him, it is a shadow of its former self.<br /><br />Recently, I discovered Tolkki had done this album, The Land of New Hope, and I was extremely skeptical. Usually these things are crap.<br />Cases in point: I didn't like Kotipelto's solo albums, I didn't like Geoff Tate's Queensryche, and I don't like ANY of the stuff<br />done by any of the former members of Guns 'N' Roses. Still, on rare occasions, someone can break off from a band and achieve new heights.<br />Case in point: I really love the CDs Tarja did after she left Nightwish.<br /><br />So I took a closer look at The Land of New Hope. First I learned that metal legend Rob Rock does a bunch of the singing, and that's<br />a pretty good set of credentials. Then I learned that Sharon Den Adel of Within Temptation made a guest appearance, and for that<br />reason, I found it impossible to resist buying (I love Sharon and WT). Then I found out Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica did some singing on it,<br />and that impressed me as well (another band I like). Then I found out that Elize Ryd of Amaranthe was a major singer on the CD.<br />I own some Amaranthe, but they seem to lack creativity, even though she's got a beautiful voice. Another notable guest appearance is<br />Derek Sherinian of Dream Theater (another band I like).<br /><br />So I had to order the CD. The first time I listened to it, I was absolutely blown away. I love love LOVE it.<br /><br />I fully expect \\"guest musicians\\"--especially singers--to not achieve their highest standard, so I fully expected half-hearted<br />singing on this disc. Especially since it's a \\"metal opera\\" (I loved the first Avantasia CD, but subsequent discs have been disappointing).<br />But wow: these guys give it their all. Rob Rock sings his heart out. I was very impressed. The delivery and execution of Elize Ryd blew my mind; it<br />was way better than the stuff she did with Amaranthe. She--unbelievably--surpassed Sharon Den Adel with incredible singing; no small feat.<br /><br />When I got to the last song, the title track, I was shocked to find out it was sung by none other than Michael Kiske,<br />the \\"good\\" singer from Helloween. I couldn't stand the new singer after Kiske had left the band. (I remember how shocked I was to learn<br />that Kiske had left the metal scene altogether to do his own thing; some blues crap or other. It was another sad day in metal history.)<br />Kiske doesn't hold back on this song; he blows you out of the water with soaring highs. I began to have visions of Tolkki standing over these guys<br />in the recording studio with a big club, saying, \\"Guys, it's still not good enough. Sing it like you mean it! Take five hundred seventeen!\\"<br /><br />As for the music:<br />Tolkki was the main song writer for Stratovarius, and this CD is an exemplary work. What makes great music is not the band, but the song writing,<br />the soul of the music. Even the finest virtuoso is boring if the music isn't good (case in point: Joe Satriani, imho) but Tolkki does not disappoint.<br />The songs are all good; no clunkers in there.<br /><br />As for the execution:<br />Tolkki is a top-notch guitarist, and his playing is flawless. That would be enough, but there's another specialguest:<br />Jens Johansson of Stratovarius plays some keyboards, absolutely setting the keyboard on fire in the song \\"To the Edge of the Earth\\",<br />which sounds more like the old Stratovarius than any of the recent music done by that band.<br /><br />IMHO, this is a must-own CD, especially for fans of Stratovarius, Rob Rock or Avantasia. I want more!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I can't say that I liked this film, but I am glad that I watched it.  I won't ever sit through it again, but I definitely appreciated the creativity and artistry that went into it.  The acting was top notch, the make up tremendous, and it clearly had one heck of a director.  But as a whole work, it's not something I can rave about.  I appreciated it, which makes liking it sort of not the point.

B000FIMHJ4|5.0|I have to admit, I haven't heard this album in many years until now.  I pickled this up today and after hearing all of these songs again, I'm pleasantly surprised. In the remastering, and the quality of the songs. I miss when you could just pick up an album and listen to it from start to finish. This is definitely one of those albums. I like every song on this one.  Noone is talking about the songs in their reviews. All the songs are good here, not just \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" and \\"Nothing But A Good Time\\".  Songs like \\"Good Love\\", \\"Bad To Be Good\\", \\"Back To The Rocking Horse\\",  and \\"Love On The Rocks\\", are  great rock songs. That's what I was so surprised about. If Poison made another album like this, maybe  they would have been more successful.  This is a late 80's Rock N' Roll masterpiece.

B003UESJIS|5.0|ANOTHER YEAR is about how you choose to live your life. Mike Leigh takes a year and shows us 2 different kinds of people; the happy couple and son who nurture their lives.

While the character \\"Mary\\" who admits letting her garden die is a mess; she cannot make her life flourish.<br /><br /> There is so much going on in each scene and each moment of this film. I've seen it 4 times already and everytime I watch it I catch something new and revealing. One of the best films of the past decade without a doubt.

193700788X|4.0|This book is good but not great. some of the other stories I liked better. I wanted it to be more epic but it was a pleasant way to wrap things up...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I personally loved the book and the movie, they followed similar plots but I liked how the book was its own entity in a way. If your looking for a movie thats not romantic, cute or a bit predictable then this movie isn't for you.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Oh my good. This is how legendary Thin Lizzy sounds in 2013, just like turning the clock back to the eighties.. Very good song, mixed with viping guitars, solid rythms.. All Things that make a joyfull listening if you are a Rock&#34;N&#34;Roll fan.. WARNING!: You might get beer thirsty listning to this record!! ;-)
B000M341QE|5.0|1 plot check, arguably scorceses best<br />2 cast check, marky mark steals the show already stolen by jack<br />3 action check<br />4 paranoia check<br />5 mob stuff check<br /><br />only the shrink girl coulda bene replaced by someone good looking not so older n ugly
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A wonderful historical piece with great characters and story line. Beautifully acted and beautifully done. Can be viewed by the entire family.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just love this game!!! It's addictive! When I learned that I could play it on my Kindle, I downloaded it immediately! I think I'll spend lots of time playing it!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|hate the upgrade!! If I could give a zero rating I would. Will be uninstalling this app! DUMB move Weather Channel! Wise up and go back to previous version. It was 5 stars all the way!!!!!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like the way they give the words pronunciation \\"Clear and Crisp\\".Easy to read and easy to say.<br />It's an up to date Dictionary.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!  Free daily tournament and daily credits make it the best. Lots of variety in games to play.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|Got this one for a change of pace from my other stuff. I am a fan of the slower games and enjoyed this one. Still going to the various levels and trying hard. The only complaint is that I have to take my Kindle out of the case to have better control.  I wish that the zoom feature was a little better to get a complete overview of the entire maze.
0399103422|5.0|I bought it as a gift for someone who really loves the movie. As expected, it reveals many more useful and interesting details than the movie.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love to read John Grisham's books; they're fast paced and easy reads.  But his endings are invariably unsatisfying and never seem to really wrap up the stories.  Without giving away a spoiler for the ending of this book, I can say that finally in &#34;The Litigators&#34; we see an ending that ties up all the loose ends of the story.  Kudos to Grisham for this, and it makes me look forward even more to reading his next book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down ... One of the few books I have read that I hate to have finished.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Another excellent CD by TTB!  Susan and Derek plus the whole band know how to write, sing, play and deliver the best of the blues/soul music of any group today.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Product works and looks as described. Easy to plug in and use. Charges my iPhone with no problems. So far no problems
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is amazing! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to prove to yourself that energy is out there for the taking. The 9 simple experiments are fun and so easy I've done them with my 10 year old. Once you start you'll be so excited you'll want to share this book with everyone!
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love almost every song on this album.  In fact, after i got this CD, i bought her last CD.  Great artist.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|It took about a week to download and my Internet is normal. I couldn't download other apps till it was finished. Game was cool though. Then I realised just today that it was still downloading wth
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This charger worked great for a couple of months and as soon as the return policy went out of date it stopped working. I do not suggest buying this charger.
B00AFEQA5K|4.0|Matthew McConaughey is showing everyone he's not riding off his good looks and his great body.  I think he's always been a good actor, but he's becoming a great actor in my opinion.  He was wonderful in Mud.  He just oozes coolness!  LOL.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This app is fantastic. I play it all the time. The characters a hilarious! You can change the hospital bed. I love giving them a shot in the butt the best. :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Don't start this game at 10 o'clock at night or you may not get any sleep!  I've never played any of the Mist games on pc that others have likened this too, but after 1 day of this game I'm hooked.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loving the game , but I'm stuck on 10. I can't get a hint so I don't know what to do. The numbers to be put in under the table ... I'm lost as to where I find them.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|This movie would have been fine except for the fact that Ryan Gosling looked too skinny and young to be playing the part of a successful lawyer. He looked like a schoolboy in his uniform rather than a grown man wearing a suit. It distracted me from the story every time he was on screen and I really like the guy so it was really annoying as I bought the movie because he was in it !!! Rosamund Pike was good in her role but she looked like his big sister and not his boss. I didn't see why she would be attracted to him even if he was gifted, unless he was a child prodigy and there was no evidence of that. If he had worn glasses or something it would have suited him more. It would have been that geeky look or something but he needed to \\"fill out\\" / bulk up in order to look like a grown man. The love scene looked really bad as they were not \\"moving together\\" shall we say and it looked like bad choreography. Actually he looked confused as to what the hell she was doing. Anthony Hopkins was really good but a lot of his scenes were with Ryan Gosling who didn't seem like he could hold his on against Anthony Hopkins so it looked like Anthony Hopkins was overacting which was a shame because he wasn't. Acting with others is like a game of tennis, it works best with two evenly match players or one that is at least challenging the other but Ryan Gosling looked like he hadn't an idea how to swing let alone hit the ball back towards Hopkins.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Bought one for a new granddaughter.  She loves it and it stimulates her to respond.  Just bought another for the upcoming Great Granddaughter.  Still in box and will be given at shower.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|This was a perfect addition to the other items we have bought for our son. Whether he is happy or sad when he gets put into this he instantly becomes excited and dances to the music. Definitely worth the investment.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game. Enjoy the dinosaurs. Extra parks a plus. I especially enjoy the aquatic dinosaur park with the excursions, there is always a element of surprise when they return.
B005HSL626|5.0|Would recommend this game. Keep you entertain and could play with the kids and enjoy the game.  Must get it
