B00CW665VI|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  I laughed out loud so many times, it was almost embarrassing.  Not only is this book funny, but it is ,sweet and sassy, and sexy as can be.  Loved that this was a man's point of view, too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend and have to many. Great story line even with the sexual content. Would love to see book written from Christians side

B00001U0DP|5.0|It is amazing how this guy could turn everything into an fun journey in life.  Even when he is walking into his death, he tries to make it fun for the son.  I am very impressed.

B002OR0RP0|3.0|Fun, entertaining kids movie.  The only reason it didnt get four stars was because I thought it was irresponsible writing to have a pregnant female deliberatley put herself into a potentially dangerous situation, especially that close to delivery.  The dinosuar had better parenting skills than the mammal in this case. So parents, be prepared to explain to your kids why her decision was a really, really, stupid one.  Other than that, it was an overall good movie.
B006RBZV82|4.0|Very good film, beautiful photography. I also enjoyed the narration and music. And it does not have a lot of sea creatures eating each other which I liked.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Having seen the TV programme, the whole idea made sense to me and having tried the 'diet' I find I feel healthier, blood sugars great and even lost some weight! Thanks!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  It was funny and sexy as hell.  It was awesome reading it from his point of view, especially in the first chapter.  Emma Chase please write more!!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I loved Drew and Kate's story. I loved this story for so many reasons, it's was funny, romantic at times and it was told from Drew's POV and I really liked that. I haven't read a story that was so witty and told so well from the males perspective. What he did to win Kate back wad so Dreamy and any woman would be lucky to have a man like Drew.<br />I highly recommend this book. You won't be let down!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is really a challenge.  I love to play it.  If you like to figure things out and like racing against a clock you will love this game and the graphics.
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is the entry point for adventure reading for youngsters destined to be readers. Long John still has a leg to stand on! Yarrh!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This is so bad. The app can't even recognize what activation code they sent you. This deserves a 0 stars. The app can't even recognize your printer even if it's an hp.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|My kids enjoy creating their own melodies and finding what they think is relaxing to them. Very user friendly. I recommend it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a really fun game. Love the graphics and time just seems to fly by while I'm playing. I really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy and making your own kingdom.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awsome and you get all new people that you could play with new people the special kind agree a little to high priced so hers a tip don't buy any other people say  th coins you have
B009NY43NY|5.0|I must say I don't understand what all these bad reviews are about, but every person is different. Just like sookie, she never wanted to be anything but as close to a normal human as possible. she wanted to grow old, tend to her garden, work at Merlots, have friends, and babies. That never changed so bill n Eric were never meant to be forever. Sam was always the obvious choice from the first book. Never have I loved an ending so much. Thank you.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great book. I've already suggested it to my middle school students. Wonderful lesson about acceptance without judgement. Highly recommend it!
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|A worthy effort, but 'Up in the Air' will be the only commercial success for this album (not that that is a bad thing) with poor placement, I'm forecasting, during the NBA Finals.<br /><br />Some songs like 'Conquistador', 'The Race', and 'Bright Lights' are the highlights and those are just alright. 'Bright Lights' could have been , and may have been (I don't have the sleeve notes), a U2 b-side written track/ or a Steve Lillywhite personal favorite song.<br /><br />And to the folks that do the music file data; thanks for listing this as 'Thirty Seconds to Mars' while my entire library says '30 Seconds to Mars'. Yes I can change it, but will most likely result in this album not being in my listening lists.
B001HN694K|5.0|It's a really great movie.  I especially love the visuals, my favorite character is the hair.  I bought this for the wife, and of course she loves it as well.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Absolutely love the books however, this was my least favorite. It sort of took a left turn somewhere and was a difficult read.  Somehow it did have the rhythmic flow of the first 3 books which I found very disappointing.  I do hope that one day he finishes the series this was my first fantasy book series read and it has been an amazing ride.  A Feast For Crows did not live up to the first 3 books.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is an awesome movie with a wonderful plot! Not your typical chick flick so the men will enjoy it too. Just watch out for the language and a little subject matter with kids. :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the reviews and finding out that Ms Day is extending this to a 5 series have decided not to buy. I am tired of the damn series, please make them stop. what ever happened to ending a book? I'm done!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I built my own football stadium I built a hockey rink I built a basketball court and meny others on my world
B00CP2Z5TC|1.0|Gutless soulless simple pop garbage. A complete a total waste of my money. The only reason I bought this, we were taking a friend to Red Rocks for her first concert there and she picked the show. So I thought I would pick up something by Vampire Weekend. Wow, what a terrible band, unless you are a 12 year old. Talk about a boring band live as well!?!? People were pouring out of Red Rocks less than half way through there yawn fest of a show. They must have been playing to a lot of empty seats by the end of their show. Don't waste your money on this forgettable pop crap.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found Wool by looking for books bought by customers who bought Ender's Game (which is one of my favorite books, and I had been craving something similar).  All of the 5 star reviews compelled me to buy Wool without knowing anything about it.  I am SO glad that I did.... This book grabbed me from the first few pages, which really says something as I normally feel like I have to push through the first few chapters of any book.<br /><br />The first part was so amazing, and I couldn't sleep that night thinking about what had happened.  The next 4 parts of the book were no different.  Now that I am finished with Wool, I am going to go buy a kindle so that I can read Shift faster than ordering the paperback.  It really is THAT good. I can't wait to read everything else that Hugh Howey has written.
B00280LYIM|4.0|It was great. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is because at the end of the story, . I wanted to read more. Riordan stops his stories a little too soon.
B00B2166BS|4.0|This is a mandatory accessory for Nexus 10. However, I give it a 4 star instead of 5 because the price is very expensive for just a cable.<br /><br />I think it should be included in the N10 box rather than being sold by a third party.
B00C9U9YOW|3.0|First off, I'm not rating the music a 2/5, I have to take off a star for the mastering on the album. It has a dynamic range of 6, which is about standard for albums these days, sadly. At least it's not as bad as the mastering on Songs for the Deaf (or Songs That Will Make You Deaf) which has a dynamic range of 4. SFTD is a pretty fatiguing listen, but the music on SFTD is out of this world good. So as long as bands keep making music with poor dynamic range I will continue to adjust the review accordingly. Now, onto the review.<br /><br />This is the first new album QOTSA has released since I started listening to them, so it's a new experience for me. It's always different to listen to a new album from a band you've heard everything from rather than finding a new band and listening to all their previously released albums. Your expectations are much higher when you've already heard all of QOTSA's previously released (incredible) albums.<br /><br />There's not a single QOTSA album I don't enjoy. That includes this one. The songs all sound like QOTSA, but they do go places they haven't before. I also feel like their influences come through more on this album than any other (particularly the Bowie influence on \\"If I Had A Tail\\"). This bothers me slightly (mainly because I feel like QOTSA's other albums don't remind me of anyone else, and it's rare that I can listen to a band and have that feeling), but it only comes through on certain songs (and the music is still good regardless). Anyway, there's really no throwaway tracks on here, and most are really quite enjoyable. I really enjoy \\"I Sat By the Ocean.\\" It's just a feel good song. It sort of feels like it could be on Era Vulgaris. How would I rate this album among their other albums? Hard to say right now. Not their best, but still really quite good.<br /><br />Of note, I was a bit disappointed by the drumming. Knowing that it was Dave Grohl on drums again certainly only made my expectations even higher. The drumming on SFTD is just amazing to me, and it never really stands out much on this album. Not to say the drums are bad, but I certainly expected more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of any of QOTSA's previous albums I do think you will enjoy this album. I'm sure there will be some that won't be in love with it, but I definitely think it's worth a listen and it should get better with more listens. I'm pretty sure I will grow even fonder of it with more listens.<br /><br />Edit: The more I think about this album and listen to previous albums, the more it depresses me. The usual Qotsa energy just isn't present on this album. It's still a good album, but I enjoy all their other albums more. There are just elements missing from this album that were on all of the previous albums. The guitar isn't nearly as frenetic on this album, and the drums are lacking. I feel like Qotsa is getting too clean, too mature, if you will. Oh, well, I look forward to the next album; hopefully this time it won't take 6 years.<br /><br />Music: 3.5/5 Mastering: 1/5<br /><br />If my review was helpful (or not), let me know why. Thanks for reading.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Not only does this game have great graphics and smooth game play, but there is a challenge aspect to it. A must have for any gamer!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Don't throw your money away on this film. I generally will suffer through the entire movie once I paid the price, but I could only take about 15 minutes of this before I turned it off. It was a disconnected, low sound quality, trashy language and nudity for sales sake only. Come on - I only need the F-word a couple of times to get the idea.<br />Considering the actors involved, I was very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game it is perfect if you want to wast time or just have like five minutes to spare and need to be entertained
0316224588|4.0|It is hard to tell who has missed John Rebus more - his loyal fans or his creator, Ian Rankin.  The depth of expression and the quality of writing especially in the early chapters is evidence enough of how delighted Rankin is to be back with the man who must almost be a second self for him.  As for Rebus, he is as irascible as ever.  The man really is impossible - rude, secretive, insubordinate and defiant of all rules and protocols.  His redeeming feature is his deep instinct that drives him, time and again, to make the breakthrough that other cops have missed and to take insane risks to prove his point.  In the hands of anyone other than Rankin, we would have given up on Rebus a long time ago, but the curmudgeonly old codger survives to fight another day, whisky and cigarettes to hand.  Yes, it is possible to poke holes in the story, but in the end it is Rebus we come back for, together with those memorable characters, the loyal Siobhan and the conniving Cafferty, the bleak Scottish settings and the wondrous way Rankin weaves them altogether.  Another round or two, please!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic.its almost like you actually have a horse.it has activities that you can do that are related to real life chores of owning an actual horse.this is a very entertaining game.
B004NELBPC|2.0|The Huffington Post content can't be beat! However,if your eyes are older than 25, you would not be able to arrive at that conclusion based on this app. The font size is absurdly small, even for the young. However, the layout and general design is better and quicker than the web site. With a fix for the font problem this would easily get 5 stars. As is 2 stars, but only because I want to encourage them to fix it. Really only deserves 1.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I guess the extensive graphic sex fulfilled the author's need to explain the type of person Grey is, but it got to be too much at times.  When you take that away there's not much content.  However, the Grey character development is so compelling that you feel you must know why he is the way he is.  I kept wondering why the intelligent Ana stayed with him!  So I find I did not so much enjoy the book as I want answers.<br /><br />After my review posted, I read numerous other reviewer comments.  I must agree that I cannot figure out how anyone gave 5 stars to this book, as commentators said, it is not that well written and is excessively redundant and childish in its approach to women/women's orgasms.  However, do note that it created a floodgate of commentary about the Grey character and abuse.  Doesn't it make you wonder then, what the author was thinking?  I'd say she's a smart cookie.  As I said previously I agree with the negative reviews yet I just gotta find out what happens to this character.  So while somewhat embarrassed to admit it, I will read the next two books, even if I end up thinking the same way as I do now.  And what that spells for the author is success - and proves the masses will excuse poor literature for just about anything.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|This is a nice way to end a series and yet leave enough for the imagination to where the story could continue.

B00BEXB18M|3.0|I'm writing this review as full Megadeth fan.  I have every album, including box sets, greatest hits etc.  This is the first time I have ever truly been this disappointed in one of Dave Mustaine's works.<br /><br />Being a Megadeth fan is like being a fan of any band that have a long history and catalog of albums.  There is going to ups and there is going to be downs. But us a true fans we hang in there take the good with the bad in the long creative journey with band.<br /><br />This album was a crushing disappointment to me when it came out but now I see I was missing something. I must apologize for my first review I was way too harsh. There is Megadeth to be found here. It still is near the bottom of my Megadeth ranking but it's still has some of that Mustaine sting to it. The guitar parts are very good. There are actually some good catchy hooks.<br /><br />Super collider is a very middle of the road album. It's on par with Cryptic Writings but a little less memorable.<br /><br />I was so hard on this record at first because I thought Endgame and 13 were such strong albums and this one fell short of those. But it's still Megadeth and as a huge fan I should have given more of a shot before reviewing.<br /><br />Megadeth have been through so many line up changes and Dave has soldiered on better than any of the other big 4. He has an amazing work ethic and has produced an overall better catalogue than the other three. Only really one not so good album and us fans know which one that is, and there were many reasons for that.<br /><br />Super Collider has its place in the world of the Megadeth empire and Their follow up record is phenomenal.. This record is so \\"just there\\" it isn't funny.  I urge all old Megadeth fans that still really like their music durning the modern age to really look back and ask yourself a question. What was the reason you got into Megadeth in the first place? What has kept you on the journey with Mustaine? For me at least the answer does not exist in Super Collider, and it grieves me to say it.<br /><br />So I must say good bye a 1000 times!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've been waiting for this book forever and was going to order it but before I did I wanted to read the reviews to see what people thought so far.  I'm happy I did very disappointed this is not the end will not be buying the book...<br />This should of been done....
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Not sur ewhat to say, in line with the other Mission Impossible movies.  Lots of action, great locations, Great camera work, in some cases I think the film makers are pushing the CG effect too much as they become obvious.  Though we understand it was done with a computer, we still want to believe in the magic.
B00AEFXOKO|5.0|Even though a lot of people feel the movie is kind of preachy, it is still a good, yet inspirational film that I can watch again and again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Well done Sylvia! What an awesome continuation of Gideon and Eva. I think i may have read it too damn fast..ugh! You've taken me on another roller coaster ride and I can't wait to see where it stops. Hot, hot, hot! Is all I can say for now. Looking forward to books 4&5<br />Thank you for sharing Gideon and Eva's world with us. It's a world one will never forget &lt;3
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I can't figure out why so many metal and Megadeth fans have disliked so much of what Megadeth has been putting out. They seem to just want repeats of RIP and Peace Sells. The System Has Failed, United Abominations, Endgame, all amazing albums and completely stand with Megadeth's older albums. 13 was also good and has some great songs. Super Collider is very 90's Megadeth. The riffs and feel of it is very countdown to extinction, youthanasia, and a little bit of cryptic writings, NOT Risk at all. Songs like Burn, Kingmaker, Built for War and Don't Turn your Back are great songs with awesome riffs, shredding solos and good lyrics. Lyrically this album is less political and seems to be way more personal from Dave. I dig it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I find it more interesting than some of the other games like it. I like the hidden object part of the game.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|When I first listened to this I only liked Get Lucky.  Now that I've listened through it about 4 or 5 times it has grown on me, especially the first half of the songs.  Very mellow and very groovy.  Almost a complete 180 from Alive.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Very up-lifting. Brings a smile to my face! I love the old songs and have enjoyed the new songs too!
1439102732|4.0|I do not read a lot of fiction, but this is one that I have recommended to friends.  Picoult probably overloaded it with significant social issues, but she held it together well.  It made a good basis for discussion in my book club.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Let me say that I've loved the first 2 books, and I've waited not so patiently for this one.  It stinks to have to say how disappointed I am!  I won't spoil it, other than to say it's more and more angst and no closure.  I'll probably read the next one, but I'm not going to go crazy waiting for it like I did for this one.  I'm so very bummed!!
0811879542|5.0|I don't want to give anything away so I'll have to be a bit vague.  What a really cool idea for a book!  Love how it gets the kids to interact with the story.  I really want to get some of his other books.  It works for both the 4 yr old and the 2 yr old.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|the game when u get missions is awesome! u can buy a large variety of cars and when u buy them u can use them unlimitedly (tip: buy the soleill idk if I spellt that right... it is 64k but its worth it. : ) ) BUT... after u complete the story and all the jobs... I have most of the best weapons in the game except the heavy machine gun and I still cant complete the missions with the arrows making a circle. I HAVE AN AMAZINGLY HIGH RESPECT LEVEL AND MY STATS R MAXED OUT!!!
0679809015|4.0|I was really surprised at the size of this book, it is seriously tiny!  Not a problem just surprised.  Anyway cute book, good illustrations, and fun for the little one to open all the flaps.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|While rewatching my Evangelion Platinum series , I happened to be looking up any new info on the story line and came across the new movies. &#34;What did you say?!?&#34; Had no idea this had been out since 2007! I ordered it and 2.22 only to find out that the english subtitled version is still M.I.A. I had always hoped that they would release the series in HD, but this was an even better surprise. The HD with CGI looks great and the sound is outstanding on my 7.1 theatre.
0743487486|3.0|Really loved the theory behind this book and agreed with almost everything the author said but found it very difficult to implement.  Whereas some parenting books are very detailed with suggestions on how to use them, this book was extremely vague.  Many chapters ended with something similar to &#34;it depends on the child and the parent as to how to handle the situation&#34;.  I'm not looking for a step by step guide but some ideas would be helpful and useful for me to understand how this theory works.  On another note, I love that he backs up his theory with actual facts and study results.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I had been away from anime for a while because I don't' like the newer &#34;Americanized&#34; shows (I've been heavy into anime starting as a kid in the late 80's). I didn't even know that Hideaki Anno had remade the story until recently. Seeing any production the way the creator truly envisions it is always a plus, and 1.11 and 2.22 do not disappoint. 2.22 Picks up fast where 1.11 left off and I like the new character (Mari) and can't wait to see where the story goes in 3.33. Just wish we didn't have to wait for the next two...I still love the original series and End of Evangelion, but I am enjoying the new and different twists just as much. HD and CGI graphics don't hurt either!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great time killer, not much to it really but not horrible.  Would definitely recommend to people who want it solely for that, finding active people seems hard
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Morrie was such a beautiful man!  This is such a touching story and a very important read for anyone breathing.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This was truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen!  I thought it might be kind of a fun movie to watch....Matthew looks great...Adam Rodriguez...oh my!  However, the language is wretched, the acting sucks...the movie plot is even worse.<br /><br />Save your money....it's not worth a dime!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Here is a quick summery of the plot of The Phantom Menace:<br /><br />****PLOT SPOILERS:****<br /><br />Episode I has one of the best plots of any of the Star Wars saga. There are two Jedi, a much younger Obi-wan and his master Qui-Gon, who are sent out to settle what they think is only a trade dispute with the Trade Federation (who are being controlled by a Sith Lord Darth Sidious) who set up a trade blockade and an invasion of the planet Naboo. The Jedi make their way to Naboo to help the planet's Queen escape and head to Coruscant which is the planet which the Senate occupies so she can get the Senate to help her with the trade blockade. On the way to get the Queen the Jedi meat a Gungan called Jar Jar Binks who is an outcast of his society, but helps them reach the city of Theed where the Queen is. When they reach the Queen they all try to escape her planet of Naboo but her space ship gets damaged and they have to stop on the planet of Tatooine to repair the ship. Qui-Gon makes a bet on a podrace with a local junk dealer to get him the parts he needs to repair the ship. The bet is placed on a slave boy who they recently met on Tatooine (a young Anakin Skywalker a.k.a. Darth Vader to all the Star Wars fans) who races pods and is strong with the force. The boy wins the race and is also granted his freedom as a stipulation as part of the bet. The ship is repaired but before they can leave Qui-Gon is attacked by a Sith Lord Darth Maul who was sent by his Sith Master Darth Sidious to capture the Queen. Qui-Gon narrowly escapes the battle and reunites with everyone on the Queen's ship as they head to Coruscant. Once they get to Coruscant the Queen tries to get the Supreme Chancellor to resolve her problem with the Trade Federation on Naboo right now. The Chancellor only offers to send a crew to investigate what is happening on Naboo. Since the Queen needs the problem solved now she moves for a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor and the Senate begins to elect a new Chancellor and one of the nominees is the Senator of Naboo Senator Palpatine, who is also the Sith Lord who setup the blockade in the first place. While this is happening the Jedi return to the Jedi council which is also on the planet Coruscant and Qui-Gon tries to get Yoda, Mace Windu and the rest of the Jedi Council to let young Anakin be trained as a Jedi. Mace Windu tells Qui-Gon that he will not be trained as he is too old and Yoda senses there is much fear in Anakin. The Queen and the Jedi then return to planet Naboo and form a plan to capture the Trade Federation Viceroy who is in charge of the Trade Federation. The Jedi and the Queen plan to storm the Palace of Theed through a secret passage while getting Jar Jar Binks to create a diversion with the help of his fellow Gungans who have banished him. The Gungans agree to help out to take the planet back from the Trade Federation and create a very large battle away from the city of Theed against the Trade Federation's battle droids. The Queen and Jedi storm the Palace and free some of the Queen's captured pilots and guards who set out on starfighters to take out the Trade Federations blockade ship that is blocking the planet. Anakin Skywalker is still with them but goes to hide in one of the starfighter's cockpits. While Anakin is hiding the group is ambushed by the Sith Lord Darth Maul who the Jedi then engage in one of the best lightsaber duels in all of the Star Wars films. The Queen in the meantime is attacked by some battle droids and Anakin who is sitting in the cockpit fires and takes out the battle droids but his ship begins to take off by itself because its on automatic pilot and it heads out to join the rest of the starfighters who are in a battle against the Trade Federation's ship. The Queen and her guards continue fighting more battle droids until they are able to reach the thrown room and capture the Viceroy. While this is happening Anakin is able to destroy the Trade Federation's ship by attacking it from the inside, once the ship has been destroyed all of the battle droids become deactivated. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan continue to fight Darth Maul but Darth Maul is able to deliver a fatal blow to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is albe to kill Darth Maul. Obi-wan rushes to his dyeing master's side and promises his dyeing master that he will train young Anakin to be a Jedi Knight.<br /><br />****END OF PLOT SPOILERS.****<br /><br />The main purpose of my review though is to defend Episode I which is one of my favorite Star Wars movies. Episode I has been bashed by more fanboys than any other movie on the planet and it really isn't fair because the Phantom Menace really is a great movie. The main problem I think people have is that they are TOO CLOSE to the original trilogy. They had their minds set before even seeing The Phantom Menace that it couldn't be as great as the original trilogy, and they cannot find a way to step back and truly see the many similarities between characters of Episode I and the original trilogy.<br /><br />The number one complaint seems to be of Jar Jar Binks. Many fans think he is too silly and annoying. He was created as a comic-relief character who is supposed to be a silly character. He was also created with kids in mind. A lot of people who saw the Original Trilogy for the first time were kids when they saw it and have forgotten how amazing this movie is for kids because they have been watching it for 30 years and have gotten way too close to Star Wars to step back and look at it from another perspective. There are plenty of characters from the original trilogy who are just as silly as Jar Jar:<br />- C-3PO and R2-D2 are just as silly, if not even more silly because they are droids who argue and one of them can't even speak, he argues with beeping.<br />- You have the one of the main supporting cast Chewbacca (one of my all-time favorite characters) who looks like bigfoot who howls and roars every time he speaks, clearly thats pretty silly.<br/>- The first time Yoda is introduced in the Empire Strikes back he is very silly as he hits R2 with his cane and yells Mine! Mine! Mine! as R2 tries to take back the lamp Yoda took from Luke.<br />- The entire group of Ewoks are silly for crying out loud.<br />The point I'm making is that there are plenty of characters from the original trilogy just like Jar Jar and people really just need to get over themselves and let themselves have some fun. Geez.<br /><br />Another problem people seem to have is the plot. I have no idea how they really could. Yes, there is an awful lot going on in this movie but George does an excellent job at conveying what is going on always. I really think people are just trying to nitpick because they are looking for a problem because this isn't the same Star Wars movie they have grown up with.<br /><br />I will say this about the rest of the prequels though; they rely too much on CGI. Episode I to me really feels like the Original Trilogy especially in a visual sense. I think if Eps II and III would have used more set pieces like Episode I did, those movies would have had much more of a Star Wars look and feel to them.<br /><br />The only negative that I have about Episode I is I wish it would have had more Darth Maul. This seems to be a common complaint that I actually agree with. He is by far one of the coolest characters, and he is right up there as my favorite Star Wars character Darth Vader. Sometimes I think Darth Maul might actually be my favorite.<br /><br />The bottom line is, if you don't watch Episode I uptightly you will have a great time with this movie. The Pod Race scene is so much fun and so is the final lightsaber duel. Also the movie has the iconic John Willaims score with it and that in itself is enough of a reason to enjoy this movie.

B000FA675C|5.0|The Robert Langdon series is my favorite of Dan Brown's books, but I also enjoyed deception point, and digital fortress as well. His novels always keep me guessing.<br /><br />Randy

B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game it's a good time killer.....but I wish their was an easier way to get invest points...other than that I like the game...
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I love the conceit of this film -- setting a classic 1940s noir film in the world of 1990s high school students. It works so very well. The cast is great, and the plot is complicated enough to do honor to its elders, while remaining coherent and compelling. The humor works. I wish there were a bit less violence, but it's rated R so the viewer is warned.<br /><br />Buyers should avoid the Bluray version. There's nothing gained in the higher resolution video. The audio, especially at the beginning, is so muffled that listening to it uncompressed is nothing more than ironic. And the extras are worthless. The only subtitles, for example, are in French.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|THIS MOVIE RULES IM GLAD I BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK IT IS BEYOND AWESOME!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE
B008I43DYU|1.0|It does NOT work on Galaxy S4 ... the display is too big. I can only see the top row of keys.
B000002JSP|5.0|This album was one that I hadn't heard until I was given a recommendation by a friend who I knew to have similar musical taste to mine. I listened to it once through and was hooked. There is a lot of sound on this album that seemed entirely new to me upon first listen.<br /><br />A little less rocky, somewhat emotional and overall a great record.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|After the disappointment that was \\"Th1rt3en\\", did I want another \\"Endgame\\"? Yes.<br />Was I expecting it? No.<br />Did I get it? Anything but.<br />It's not \\"Risk Pt. 2\\" like some have said. It's not a harkening back to the '90's era Megadeth like others have said. And anyone giving this record a 5-star review needs to stop frontin' like they know the first thing about metal or Megadeth, stop calling actual fans \\"haters\\", and stop lying to their sister about stealing her Nickelback albums. This one continues along the path Dave began to pave with \\"Th1rt3en\\", but thankfully it's a slightly uphill path.<br /><br />When the title track was released, I thought it was a good rock song, a good summer song, and not to be indicative of the album as a whole. When \\"Kingmaker\\" was released, I was definitely more pleased, but not really excited. Now, after buying my copy this morning and running it through twice, I find that every other song on the album falls somewhere between those first two tracks. And if you've heard \\"Kingmaker\\", then yes, it's the high point of the album. THE FIRST TRACK. Kinda gives the phrase, \\"It's all downhill from here\\" new meaning. The songs in and of themselves range from good to very good, but nothing I'd call great (well, ONE thing, but I'll save that for the end). Every one of them a very clear mix of hard rock and heavy metal, the distinctive mix being heard most clearly on the track \\"Burn\\", which is has metal verses then switches to a heavy classic rock sounding chorus. Not really a BAD thing, just more of Dave experimenting/growing as a musician/getting older. \\"Built For War\\" and others show part of the aforementioned growth process as the \\"Decidedly Less Mighty\\" Mustaine tries different rhythms vocally, and it might take a time or two to get it, but it works in every case. The lyrics are great. Well written and styled, they convey the mind/heart of each song almost perfectly. Some very positive lyrics here as well, which may not necessarily be considered \\"metal\\", but is by no means a strike against the album. And nothing is even remotely preachy, as one reviewer inferred.<br /><br />\\"Off The Edge\\" and \\"Don't Turn Your Back...\\" are both strong points, with \\"Dance In The Rain\\" being 50/50 for me. It's saving grace is the second half of the song, which essentially mimics \\"Truth Be Told\\" off of \\"The System Has Failed\\" in how it changes and maintains until the end. The low point here is \\"Forget To Remember\\", which, as of this writing, I see as uninspired pop-rock trash. And It's hard for me to admit that I feel that way, having loved Megadeth SO MUCH over the years, but the truth DOES hurt. I blame Johnny K., personally. Why Dave would have him produce a second album is beyond me. Which brings us to the mixing of the record. The music is heavy, but the separation of the instruments leaves something to be desired. Which is a shame, because as near as I can tell, everyone brought their \\"A-Game\\" this time (musicianship, not song quality). The worst part is that some songs have lines that are layered under the music (not likes whispers or echoes, but like a voice in your head... people that are actually familiar with Megadeth's catalog know what I mean) which is nothing new, but often barely distinguishable, if not virtually inaudible thanks to Johnny K.'s stellar talent.<br /><br />But I've been saving the best (or more accurately, WORST) for last.<br /><br />The solos.<br /><br />One thing people have come to expect from this band is the amazing guitar work. And with good reason. But unfortunately, that seems to have been an afterthought on this album. There are solos. Good ones. But at least half the so-called \\"solos\\" on here are so short they are better classified as \\"fills\\". It's nothing short of shameful and the lowest point for me overall on \\"Super Collider\\".<br /><br />Now, I know I've spent a lot of time focusing on the bad, but it's not ALL bad (I mean, 3 stars is better than 1, right?). The Thin Lizzycover of \\"Cold Sweat\\" is great. I honestly haven't heard Megadeth do a cover yet that wasn't as good or better than the original. A nice surprise I found on my first time through is...<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />...the hidden tracks, taking the song count up to 14 instead of the advertised 11. One cover, one original, and one live track (I wonder if the next album will have 15 tracks...). I won't tell you what they are (if this review has turned you off then these songs won't make a difference, and if you're going to get the record anyway then you'll find out soon enough), but they're all welcome additions.<br /><br />In closing, despite it's many, MANY, shortcomings, this is still a good record. I can see how some people like it, but I don't see much to love here. I can see how some people hate it... and I'll leave it at that. Like I told my friend who wanted me to tell him what I thought before he dropped the money on it himself...<br /><br />\\"It's better than 'Th1rt3en'\\".
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Blues Funeral is another glimpse into the musical mind that is Mark Lanegan. Listening to this album is less melancholy than listening to Bubblegum, but still feels pretty dark.<br /><br />I really do love this album though, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lanegans.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Dr who is one of my favorite shows of all time.  Cant wait to watch Season 6 . Love BBC.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is one that will never leave my collection. My favorite record by the Strokes because of the sound and all the memories I have with this album playing in the background.<br /><br />If you like the Strokes and haven't listened to this, you're missing out.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great quick read.  I suggest reading Kill Shot first because once you start this series, you should read it in order, or at least closer to in order.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Come on...what did you expect.....Bruce Willis is no Artist he has ALWAYS been after the money and if you think I'm wrong (and your not my wife) just watch one of his old films called Hudson Hawk.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is great. Not only is it easy for my younger children to understand, adults find it simple and easy to use. You never ave to worry when your gonna run out of charge this app tells you. Also tells you how long til fully charged. Brilliant!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|After suffering from a prolonged drought of good music, this album is as thirst quenching as the coldest drink of ice water to a parched mouth.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I plead ignorance to the period 1937-1942 so the battle between the interventionists and the isolationists described by Ms. Olson was a revelation.  She does a workmanlike job of describing the many characters on both sides and the ruthlessness of their methods.  Her scholarship appears outstanding, although I would have liked more footnotes citing specific sources.<br /><br />The few notes that do appear are at the end of chapters, making quick reference difficult.  This may be a product of the Kindle process.<br /><br />If you have an interest in WWII and the run-up to it, I recommend this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|In my opinion, this book was badly written.. i.e. very repetitive and no plot.  The reviews for four and five stars are most likely from people who do not read much and were pulled into the 50 shades phenomena that I still don't understand.  There are many well written contemporary books that should get the hype that this book has gotten.  For example, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and The Other Typist by Suzanne Rindell-both books I highly recommend.  The love story between Christian and Ana was so boring and one dimensional I felt that an 8th grader was writing this..In a nutshell-- Beautiful, young, naive (dumb) girl falls for drop dead gorgeous tortured (DOM) billionaire and tries to save him.. There was sex and her climaxing and then more sex and her climaxing over and over again.. It was not very erotic sex, it was just repeated over and over again. I am afraid for the younger generation if this is what good literature looks like in the future:( This was just a retell of Twilight with sex for the bored housewife set.. big thumbs DOWN
B00C2VIA52|4.0|great game I cant stop playing it..I love the fact that its simple there are not many tcg out there but this is a winner
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I wanted a game to play on my new Kindle and found this. The game has exceeded my expectations and provided me and my family with hours of enjoyment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first thought this game would be boring but then I actually played it and I love it.. I first had Tokyo but then I got upgraded to Miami! Best Game Ever!!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game. It is a great matching game, with an Asian theme. Also, it is not too hard to complete either. If you're looking for a good game to buy and download, I would recommend this one.
B00BESM14U|2.0|The movie is good but content is very heavy. Be prepared for the issues addressed. If you are looking for a light, fun , coming of age story, this is not it.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Quick assessment: I had a hard time getting started in the first book, especially with the unfamiliarity of the Swedish pronunciations of names and all the location descriptions. Not to mention the vague and slow start in general.<br /><br />Once I drug myself through to chapter 4 (only due to multiple friend's strong encouragement)I was then hooked and couldn't get enough.  Flew through the rest of the book. The second book starts off running and was a page turner. I struggled a little with all the lengthy introductions of new characters in the third book, my head spun with who's who and what importance do they have. But, I just absorbed what I could and read on, and really didn't find myself confused.<br /><br />All in all, really good series. Glad I read them!  Some great plot surprises I did not see coming.<br /><br />Side note: this was clearly written by a man with a desire to create female characters with sex drives any man would dream of!<br /><br />...and I craved coffee like no ones business while reading!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoy this type of game . The story is amusing and the puzzles and mini games are fun. Lots of twists and turns to think about.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|So many twists and turns, every time I thought I knew where the author was headed, the direction changed.  I highly recommend this read
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was good but confusing it's technology didn't we make these things to make it easier and more understanding. But good and...
B009MO5G90|3.0|If you're a RE fan you are probably disappointed in this release. They basically wrote themselves into a hole at the end of the last movie, taking our hero and making her a normal human and then placing her into an impossible to survive situation for their &#34;cliffhanger&#34; ending. We all must suspend reality when watching Sci-fi or horror movies I understand that. But we all 'accept' the created reality to enjoy the movie. Retribution wants us to suspend their created reality to accept this movie and that didn't work. I'm glad Milla's character gets he powers back and there is going to be more movies... I hope they learned from this one what us fans don't want.<br />And while you're at it folks. Lose the all leather outfit. Milla looks best in skin. In RE Ret. she looks like supporting cast for Aeon Flux.
B004J09ONG|5.0|This is a very old movie. One of my favorites. Great for kids yet as an adult everytime I watch it I cry. Dont miss this one it will capture your heart.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a fun funny movie. Enough going on that its not just for kids I almost defy an adult not to find some fun here. I've heard there was a lot of actors ad-lib that the creators found funny enough that they added scenes to the finished release. I believe it. The characters come across with a simple reality thats hard to find in a totally scripted release.<br />I must admit I hope they want to take more of my money and give us another Gru/minions movie. Not only another chapter with the whole cast but maybe a 'shorts' type special on &#34;The Making of the Minions&#34; maybe? Where did they come from?<br />I've very happy with the blu-ray version. I'll be watching it again.
1567184855|5.0|This book was comforting to me after losing a very dear friend. I suppose we don't find out for certain exactly what happens when we finish here in the physical realm until we actually cross over. That said, soul development makes sense to me and reading this and 'Destiny of Souls' made me think more about choices I make and keeping to my meditation schedule. I am also more aware of the effect of my interactions with others and the responsibility of being a developing soul.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Don't know why I like caustic little things like this book. Maybe because I like to play and be played with.<br />Anyway, the question that I still have is: why did I enjoy reading it? I have this idea that I learned nothing from it, didn't seem to get any better from reading it. Maybe I'm already that person that looks at the odd and different stuff with curiosity and whatever it is that keeps me through it... I really don't know. Ah, humanity is a disconcerting thing. Maybe I was converted to Bokononism...
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|My daughter loves Sofia the First, so I preordered this set of the royal family. She has the PVC figurines already but I was excited to have the parents included in the set.<br /><br />It arrived today and Princess Amber's head fell off while I was taking her out of the box! I popped it back on but it keeps falling off. After a few minutes of play, while trying to get Sofia into a sitting position, HER head came off. The king and queen dolls do not sit.<br /><br />My daughter is having a fine time playing with them, but 2 out of 5 heads are already falling off. I've never been so disappointed in a toy!
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Another excellent album from Megadeth. Since 2009's Endgame, Dave Mustaine and his band have been producing one perfectly crafted slice of heavy metal after another.<br /><br />This album has a slightly more \\"rock n'roll' sound (think Motorhead) rather than the usual complex riffs we've got used to on records like Endgame and Rust in Peace (1990). There is also more experimentation with rhythms and style than usual, which only serves to make the record a little fresher than 2011's Thirteen.<br /><br />'Kingmaker' is clearly another Megadeth masterpiece. 'Don't Turn Your Back' is particularly vengeful and musically interesting. Lead single 'Super Collider, on the other hand, is merely OK. (Then again, Megadeth were always bad at choosing singles from their albums. They chose 'Mary Jane' and 'Anarchy in the UK' as the singles from 'So Far, So Good...So What', for goodness' sake!)<br /><br />Lyrically, there is probably more thought and less sheer venom on Super Collider than usual. However, I think that after perfecting modern Thrash in the 21st Century, it is time for Megadeth to try something new. And the music they've made on this album works brilliantly.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app! Love that you can mix up your own sounds to listen to and then set a timer if you want!
0807014273|4.0|This is powerful stuff. Frankl's concentration camp world was about the black bats of human existence --  unimaginable privation, subsistence humanity and no expectation of the next heartbeat. It's the kind of a scene that can only be witnessed with a hand over the eyes and absorbed in glimpses through the cracks between the fingers.<br /><br />Yet Frankl emerges, indeed flourishes (Nietzche: That which does not kill us . . . ), to become M.D, Phd., world-renowned neurologist and psychiatrist, author of thirty books and world-wide speaker with another 29 honorary degrees. What powerful life force could account for such a drive to survive, indeed, thrive? His answer is reflected in the philosophy he founded -- Logotherapy, which includes, among its tenets, the assertion that our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.<br /><br />How could anyone presume to even question the conclusion of one so wise --  a wisdom obtainable only through a depth of world experiences of almost unimaginable proportions? Yet my own I'm-not-worthy intimidation then gave way to honest inquiry.<br /><br />My stab at the subject started with a visit to an old favorite: Joseph Campbell.  We're not all seeking a meaning in life, he maintains, but rather the \\"experience of being alive . . . so that our experiences . . . . .(resonate with) the rapture of being alive\\" (Power of Myth, pp 4-5). Bill Moyers pushes back in the interview asking whether he mean \\"the experience of meaning\\"?  -- thereby drawing the distinction from Campbell that no,\\" not the experience of meaning, but rather the `experience of life.'\\"<br /><br />Sorry for the free-floating introduction but that exchange puts the issue in stark relief. Campbell sums it all up by invoking the Zen rhetorical question, \\"What's the meaning of a flower?\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the search for meaning is nothing more than the search for permanence in drag. Look at me, commands some inner voice, look at me, my progeny, my novel, my wealth, my discovery (see that new planet I found?  -- it even has my name on it!), my donation to PETA, my granite inscription and, most of all, my belief (no, my certainty) in my own personal everlasting cosmic abstraction.<br /><br />The point is not to denigrate the instinct; the point is to see it for what it is. Carol Batrus hit on it in her Africa lunch talk as she wondered aloud about how much done in the name of altruism is really a form of ego-stroking. It's that background whisper, \\"Oh what a good boy am I . . .  that is, indeed, how I want to be remembered.\\"<br /><br />Were the search for meaning to itself pass for the experience of living then (one might argue) life truly is one grand illusion, even a cruel delusion. For we are, in truth, nothing within the context of life's grand contingencies. Sad to think that mister everyman in the geat Roman or Mayan (or any other, for that matter) empire may have confused the two.  Behold the god of provisional outcomes.<br /><br />And then there's the whole question about meaning as an end in itself. In the universe of the absolutes the man probably with the most self-regarded sense of purpose in Frankl's hell was the camp commandant, right down to his polished belt buckle.<br /><br />Perhaps we'll treat ourselves in this last session of 2006 to a private showing of Casablanca -- we've seen it a half-dozen times before; we can recite most of the lines -- and watch it as allegory. It becomes the myth of sacrifice (of meaning). Rick's Cafe' Americain is the world. Rick Blaine and Victor Lazlo are splintered aspects of the same man. Rick meets and beds the widow of Idealism. Rick is selfish desire, \\"the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill 'o beans.\\" Ego arises above selfish despair. Idealism soars and Rick retreats into the fog.<br /><br />Or perhaps we'll just forget the allegory. Forget meaning. We'll just<br />watch the story unfold and splash around in its sentimentality.<br /><br />Likelife.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Book 4 in the series competed with Book 1 for it's absolute genius storyline.  I love this series but Book 4 definitely came back with a force that draws the reader in and makes them continue to turn pages as quickly as possible.  The only time you'll be upset is when you actually finish the book!
0312427573|5.0|You will be absorbed by this novel. You will inhabit the world of 1980s New York City. Actually, multiple worlds, as the city is populated by such starkly differing realities - affluence on a level that would make the Sun King blink; the nothing-left-to-lose hopelessness that gives rise to the dead-eye stare and the Pimp Roll --  that it's hard to believe these different realities could co-exist on the same planet, let alone the same city. But they do. And it's when these parallel universes, against all the rules of nature, happen to intersect that we truly catch a glimpse of the human condition.<br /><br />The magic of Tom Wolfe is in his characters. The words on the page somehow transcend the normal intellectual process and mainline directly into the visceral. The reader absorbs the accents, the affectations, the environment and is pulled into the minds and the central nervous systems of all these supporting actors in the unfolding drama.<br /><br />It is that very slice-of-life precision that distinguishes the realistic novel (The Grapes of Wrath, another example) from the avant-garde, high-brow fiction with strange names like Absurdist novels and Radical Disjunction. Give me something rooted in real life rather than some literary game, words on a page manipulated by an author. Wouldn't you agree that real life itself offers more than enough absurdity?<br /><br />So what does the cast of characters teach us? First the good news is that some of the seething racist energy and the predatory criminal elements characterizing Wolfe's New York City of thirty years ago has been tamed and thus, to some degree, the novel can be seen as a period piece. Yet the `vanity of vanities, all is vanity' that animates virtually every character in the novel is as old as Ecclesiastes and is as fresh as yesterday's news.<br /><br />We may do well to ponder in our own existence the degree to which we are defined, entrapped, entombed(?) by our own narrative - career; possessions; pedigree; wealth; alpha-maleness; beauty; partner - as if we're constructing a monument to ourselves. There is a poignant scene in the novel where Sherman McCoy's monument finally crumbles and one can't help but reflect on Jia's concept of surrender and wonder if the protagonist hasn't finally achieved bliss.<br /><br />Expand the notion of vanity to include its scruffy half-brother, hubris, and we may have the answer to the life cycle that confronts many a company (confuse being lucky with being smart) or empire (imperial over-reach).<br /><br />In any event, enjoy the ride (but, by all means, avoid the movie abomination).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the book before you watch the movie, this is definitely an amazing series.  I loved it so much I made all my friends read the book; needless to say, they loved it as well!
1451626657|5.0|Abandon first the comfort of any logical time sequence. Catch-22 is a celluloid strip twisted in half and doubled back on itself.<br /><br />The subject matter is the WWII Squadron 256 (or, more poetically,<br />that's two to the fighting eighth power), presented not so much as a story but as a kaleidoscope: a disorienting collection of character introductions, sleight-of-hand logic, tricks, and paradoxes all mixed  together and flushed down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />This novel was such an assault thirty years ago on my own painfully linear background -- born and bred linear; at a linear time; in a linear place; with a linear education; and (later) a linear profession  -- that I recall throwing the book across the room: the reflex of a linear soul beholding a mobius world.<br /><br />But somewhere these mythic tricks intersect to reveal a larger truth about the limits of rigid thought. It's as if one so totally enamored with the self-defining internal logic of mathematics is suddenly confronted with contemplating the square root of negative one.<br /><br />Our book group has taken a low-level pass at some of life's paradoxes: e.g. meaning (Camus' paradox of the absurd: we value our lives and existence so greatly, but at the same time we know we will eventually die, and ultimately our endeavors are meaningless); or the search for enlightenment, even love (the harder we try to achieve it, the more difficult it is to attain); and so on.<br /><br />But somehow these matter take on a dream-like quality, a subject best left to those professional contemplators, not to those of us in the  \\"real\\" world. Then circumstances reveal a world to be sometimes (maybe it's all the time, but just seems like sometimes) turned inside out.<br /><br />The novel's setting is war -- in this case, the last \\"good\\" one -- but the subject is really the absurdity that arises from the surrender of the soul, whether it be to a system, a government, an ideology or a religion. One gets all tangledup as rules unchecked take on a life of their own.<br /><br />War (in this case) is stripped of all pretensions to reveal the paradoxical madness of that which animates it. The book revels in the paradoxes, \\"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with\\". Absurdity presented as comedy. It's as if Kafka (take, perhaps, The Trial) were an Abbott and Costello routine (\\"Who's on first? . .  . \\").<br /><br />Nothing here is \\"sacred,\\" whether it be heroism, patriotism, justice, government, bureaucracy, sanity, or even religion, as when the<br />Chaplain questions the reliability of the Bible: \\"So many things were testing his faith. There was the Bible, of course, but the Bible was a book, and so were Bleak House, Treasure Island, Ethan Frome, and Last of the Mohicans. Did it then seem probable, as he had once overheard Dunbar ask, that the answers to riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall\\"?<br /><br />Who/What defines sanity in the context of an order which itself is suspect?<br /><br />Case in point: the hallucination known as Viet Nam. There we have Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense and co-architect of that \\"conflict\\", the consummate linear thinker (at the time admiringly referred to as a computer on legs) and working the crowd with language that resonated with me along with the rest of the other like-minded audience at the time -- falling dominoes; maintaining the equilibrium of the Dingdong by containing the ever-encroaching Doodah -- and then being fast-forwarded three decades later to stand as a broken man confessing (in the preface of his book and as seen in \\"The Fog of War\\"), \\"Mistakes were made, terrible mistakes of judgment.\\"<br /><br />Oh, sorry 'bout that.<br /><br />Then you wake up one morning with the realization that you know nothing. The only thing worse than that is the belief of knowing everything.<br /><br />The satire of Catch-22is the fun-house mirror reflection of the arrogance and distortion that can arise from any locked-in belief system. What starts as farce morphs into a terrible-mistakes-of-judgment hubris, the tragedy which has befallen many an individual, organization, empire or nation.<br /><br />Not many people know this but the White House hosts its own book club. Karl Rove chooses the book, invites the author along with a few neoconservative luminaries, and conducts the discussion. This past<br />February the author was Andrew Roberts, author of \\"The Churchillians.\\"<br />According to a participant, George Bush, in a moment of self-reflection, explained why he believes he enjoys an advantage over Churchill, who was an agnostic. The advantage, he explained, is that he believes in God and, as such, it is easier for him to make decisions and stick by them. He said he thus doesn't worry, or feel alone, if he is unpopular. He has God.<br /><br />Who's on first?
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Easy read and very interesting. Emma Donoghue does a fantastic job of really putting the reader inside the Narrator/Child's head.  I now have a totally new perspective regarding children who are surviving this as well as their mothers who have managed to continue to nurture their children in this type of environment.  It is very apparent that the author did a lot of research into this work.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Really enjoyable, play it all the time... with the lights out... at midnight... with a couple of your lame friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the book before you watch the movie, this is definitely an amazing series.  I loved it so much I made all my friends read the book; needless to say, they loved it as well!
B00555X8OA|3.0|This is certainly worth the time and effort to plow through the different scenarios and examples of how we think - both fast and slow. For those with the intestinal fortitude to make the journey - it will be worth it. The key takeaway for me is that it makes me think differently now - about how I think!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|For anyone who has ever struggled with body image, this book is an amazing story of a woman who not only beat it but came out the other side fighting.  The fact the Portia de Rossi is willing to share her story and let the world see her when she was at her lowest point is such an inspiration.  I really didn't know who she was before this book, now I would be honored to meet her.
B00CKKD78U|5.0|A wonderful portrayal of the American Neocon,<br />and a powerful glimpse of the Empire he stalks.<br />Peace seeking, virtuous folk, would clutch to the<br />robes of Bin Laden to protect them, and restore the balance.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'll definitely be going back to finish this series and explore more work from this author.  Cassandra Clare does an amazing job of keeping you on the edge of your seat.<br />Another thing I absolutely LOVED about this book - the vocabulary is fantastic.  I learned quite a few different words reading this book.  Great work!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it's a really simple concept and interface but at the same time is very addicting.  don't. stop until you have the tank!

0345803485|4.0|I bought this for my mom for a present but she never read it. Not her cup of tea I guess. So I will.
B008LCR9W6|5.0|This is a classic series. I had to own it on DVD and this is a great way to start.<br /><br />Seasons 1 & 2 is a chance to watch all the cast members grow in to their roles and show us truly how talented and funny they are.<br /><br />Between the extras, the (2) versions of the pilot episode and the HD quality of the remaster it makes it a must own by anyone who loves this series and a great way for someone new to the series to get a chance to fall in love with it and it's loveable cast.
B001O1O71C|5.0|When I read several reviews of this book prior to purchasing it i read one that stated he did not understand why it was called a fable. obiously, he did not read the book or he read it strickly at face value.  i like reading a book that gives me an &#34;aha&#34; when i'm finished. The two boys were born on the same day and each had an equal opportunity in life.  then, things changed and their destinies took two very different directions.  The end takes a suprise twist.  This fable could be told from either childs family as a lesson in life, the haves and the have nots. There were a couple of things such as the continued use of out-with and fury that should have stopped in the first chapter. Overall. I enjoyed the book more after I finihed it and the aha of the fable became clear.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addictive game love how the colors move around and u want to get a high score to get more coins and bars.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book had me from the beginning!  It's an emotional, sexy love story.  The connection between these two is amazing! The sad stories of each are similar which gives them quite a connection. Some similarites to Fifty Shades but quite different. Now--- on to the next book :)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Surprise Ending.Descent Read.Some twist and turns to the storyline.Not the type of book I would normally read ,so to give 4 stars day's a lot
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG!!!! In love with Gideon!!  His love and commitment is so touching! Their emotions are real--- I can feel it! So hoping for their happy ever after.  I'm on to Book 3 today. So excited!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel delivers an astonishing performance that hits all the weakness, hopeless and helpless<br />Possibilities of what can become of success and happiness. It's always a good thing to have friends<br />Around when needed. His court scene is compelling it got me to remembering the Denzel Washington<br />Academy preformance of pass years, and all the delightful characters he's developed for our viewing<br />Pleasure.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|I don't know why they make all those stupid and illogical scenes. I've been a fast furious fan since day one but they need to focus more on cars and try to put some effort into the plot, I'd like to think that we fast and furious fans are people who think and going to the movies to see a lot of actions sequences connected is not what we are looking for. granted, we want action but we want a movie with more cars and a good plot involving the love between a guy and his automobile, but please, no more guys jumping 50 meters over bridges or cars jumping one over another like that stupid scene in fast furious 2 (almost forgot the 200kms airport strip. c'mon I think the producers can deliver that and still come out with a very nice looking and action packed film. I remember fast furious one and 3 as good movies about cars and with some plot, not the best but some plot still. also please try to have nice landscapes a la ff2 in the next movie, looking at a bunch of warehouses is not that entertaining.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Totally into this game. Love it. Wish I could earn acorns easier.  Great for kids and adults. This game is addictive.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun but needs to get to were it is not lagging so I would give this game a lower score but it is still fun fix that I will raid your score :)
B004GYY714|5.0|This is one of the most used app's on my Kindle Fire HD Tablet.  If you like listing to radio like I do this app is a must.<br />What really makes it great is that it's Free!!  It even streams your local stations.  Sports, news, NPR and music it's all there. Check it out, you will glad you did. You will find it in the Amazon App store.<br />Fred Neslage
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The idea behind the game is intriguing, and I would be lying if I said I want captured at once. However, just as I was like, hmmm this is getting pretty interesting it told me it was over. All in all, I guess it was a pretty cool for two bucks.
0316134082|5.0|I loved the book ! Better than I thought it would be . It stated very good condition and it was . I wanted the collector's addition and didn't have the money for regular price . So used was the way to go . I would recommend this route for anyone that wanted them for their personal enjoyment . Now I have the collection that I have tagged my favorite quotes and pages . These will go to my display case just to look at . Yes they look that good .
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked that it was written in the guy's POV. It was funny and refreshing and it had some unexpected twists. I recommended it to all of my friends.<br />Thank you and looking forward to book 2!
0062231375|5.0|The inside to cooking and why you don't want to upset the staff.  Great work but not for the squeamish or prudish (those who think swearing will lead to the decline of western civilization should avoid this).  Probably a must read for those considering a career in the culinary arts/sciences.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that I rather enjoyed the book. It reminds me somewhat of the hunger games books which I also read. Here the characters are mostly one-dimensional, but the sci- fi fun keeps you going.  I did find  it difficult to envision the environment of the GAME Room. Perhaps the movie will show me how it could work.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This should be a LESSON to all the writers and publishers out there, greed can be dangerous. Once a great book and highly anticipated love story has been completely destroyed. People have had enough. I will not purchase, much less preorder, anything that has been dragged out for months. When you charge almost ten dollars for a book, keep people waiting for it for months and announce, just a couple of days before publishing supposedly the conclusion to the trilogy, that it actually is going to go on for two more books, this is called greed and dishonesty. Goodbye Gideon and Ms. Silvia Day!
0307346617|1.0|Because of reviews I had passed on this book in the past. Since a movie was coming out based on the book I thought I would give it a try.  It is one of worse zombie books I have ever read.  Max Brooks has a political agenda that speaks about the worse in any type of government and authority. Each short chapter gives a bleack version on how someone failed.  The writter apparently has unlimited funds to travel ALL over the world to get interviews. It made me depressed reading each account, Does  Brooks have anything good to say about anyone?  Skip this book, please!  I am not sure that I will even want to see the movie now?  ONE STAR is a gift.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The beginning of this book is great and immediately hooks readers, then slowly adds the most awkward, boring, stereotypical romance I've read in quite some time. Admittedly I have no problems not finishing a story, yet despite the ugh romance storyline I really wanted to know what happens next! I'm glad I finished the book and then began reading the next in the series (Shadow of Night) because the second book was really enjoyable. Overall I think this book is an easy read and if you have the patience for a cringe worthy romance the rest of the book makes a great summer beach book!
B003U80I5G|5.0|I am collecting all the Jane Eyre movies I can get. Beautiful story, would make a great gift. The acting is great.
B00065VTU4|5.0|I got this Delux edition of 461 Ocean Blvd. and I can say it's worth the price.<br />The remastered sound is great and the bonus CD is excellent live material.<br />The bonus tracks on CD1 are OK, but I found them insterresting on the first listen, but I need to say I skip them ever since. They are more like extended Jam sessions rather then finished songs.<br />But that is fine. The original material on CD1 is worth the purchase alone.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This was a great read.  However, as someone who has a very tender heart toward animals, parts of the story were difficult to read.  The LIFE OF PI is good for anyone wanting an adventure, while learning wisdom along the way.  I would recommend this book.
B000002KDW|5.0|Faces was a great band, and this is maybe their best album.<br />If you are a fan of early Rod Stewart, or appreaciate rock music such as Beatles or Rolling Stones, you'll probably like this one also.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Unbelievable, enjoyable and so very good listening.  The interplay between Chris Botti and his guests was so enjoyable and a pleasure to listen and see.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case is great for carrying my kindle.  It is small and sleek, does not add much bulk and I can fit it in my purse.  It's even helped protect my kindle fire from a few drops, which is what I was worried about when I was looking for a case. It stands up nicely in the landscape view without slipping. A reading handle would be nice to have, but I wanted the smaller, sleeker case.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|So glad we FINALLY had time to watch this movie.  It was on our must see list, but we never seemed to have the time.  We were a captive audience from the theatrical beginning.  Rango's journey to find himself, and water for the town of Dirt, is full of humor, suspense and action.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|They are cute. But right when I opened the package Sophia's head popped off. My girls have been playing with it for 30 min and I've had to put her head back on twice. Its pretty disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|why is this game so awesome. it so cool why don't they make a subway surer 2 if made one I would go to school
B009SQWQ5E|4.0|I've been a fan of Kai Hansen since Helloween first came on the scene. I own all the Gamma Ray album and dvd's, and had big expectations about this being a \\"skeletons\\" tour. First misses are the fact that they decided to do Rebellion in Dreamland (one of my favorite GR songs) and Send Me a Sign acoustically. They just pale in comparison to their original versions and I'm not quite sure why they chose to do them like this. The next miss is the inclusion of the duet w/Kiske of A While In Dreamland (boring!). Video quality was not as high as I would have expected with some pixelation present on the DVD, maybe it's not present on the Bluray.<br /><br />That's not to say it's not worth getting. Notwithstanding my criticisms above, it's an outstanding performance! The sound is great, the performance of the \\"electric\\" songs are great!
B00785P2QC|3.0|,Fun but the point's suck need to be easier to get to expand .make easier to expand expand expand expand expand expand expand and expand
B00C7NKPPS|3.0|From what I'm reading, the remaster is not a big improvement over the previous cd's. I never owned the cd's though, I had the original 3 disc record set, which is kinda hard to take in the car :). I'm really enjoying hearing it without the occasional pops and crackles from the vinyl, but I'm REALLY disappointed in the sub-par packaging! I mean, it really sucks! I didn't really feel like spending over 100 bucks to get the deluxe version, simply not worth it imho.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Ambivalent as I may feel about the author as a person, the writing is terrific and vivid. Too vivid, in fact, for the scene in which she decides to shoot her late mother's 30 (plus) year old mare to put the animal out of its misery. If you care at all about animals, you may want to skip this part, because I will remember the images she described well after I've forgotten most of the details from the rest of the book. Horrific, just horrific.<br /><br />I am an avid hiker and trail runner and was interested in this book mostly for the a story of life on the long trail. While you get some of that, this is mostly a book about Strayed's personal struggles and certainly not a primer for hiking the PCT. I've gone on numerous long backpacking trips or trail runs with just my dogs for company. Somewhat similar to Strayed, I've also relied partly on the kindness of strangers when bumming food or hitching a ride. But I sometimes felt that Strayed relied a bit too much on the kindness of strangers and took a bit too much advantage of her being a young woman alone. It's OK to do this to some extent, but she wanted to be an \\"Amazonian mother....er\\" (her own words) and instead came across many times as a lost little girl in over her head. Which she readily admits, but that bothered me. For my tastes, there was a bit too much use of her \\"feminine wilds\\" (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) and less self reliance and that bogged down the progress of the story. But, hey, we all have our faults.<br /><br />It is difficult to differentiate between how I may feel about the author and her choices vs. the quality of the book itself. In summary, the writing is terrific, the story moves along but gets bogged down at times, and the description of the abuses her feet endured started to make me wince as the story continued. A worthwhile read, but not exactly the story of an Amazonian woman as that of a lost little girl who manages to hike a long way on mangled feet hauling a pack much to heavy to make hiking very enjoyable. If it wasn't for the author's incredible prose, I would not have given this four stars.make hiking very enjoyable. If it wasn't for the author's incredible prose, I would not have given this four stars.

0525952926|5.0|Once again Ken Follett has done what I expected he would do. And that is to write a book so captivating I finished it in just over a week. The downside is that I will now have to wait at least a year (less I hope) for the third book to come out. After I read World Without End and Pillars of the Earth I was hooked on Follett's work.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|First of all, I've always enjoyed Ms. Day's books the only difference has been the degree of my enjoyment. I definitely agree with the majority of the reviews in articulating my disappointment that Entwined with you ends in a cliffhanger. This &#34;trilogy&#34; now extends to 5 books? Really? That's just disheartening, while I'd love to read another book I don't think this story merits 5 books. The ending of this book &#34;whimpers&#34; with the weak confrontation Eva had and doesn't elicit alot of interest in Gideon's mom.<br /><br />Now, we're left wondering what the next release date will be and as much as I dislike bashing this author I agree with others that her stories are following too many other authors with long drawn out story lines (series) that feel like poorly concealed &#34;cash grabs&#34; for readers.<br /><br />After pushing aside my disappointment that Eva and Gideon have not gotten their HEA, I look forward to the continuation of the their story in the next book but I will NOT buy a fifth book.

B0073XV2W2|5.0|Daniel Suarez must to a phenomenal amount of research for his books. Everything is true or totally plausible (the bits you know about which lends credence to the rest of it). And the topic finds it's way into the news. Happened with Daemon and is happening with this one.<br /><br />Every time I read one of this books I end up going back to reread all his others.

030758836X|5.0|This book is brilliant. A page-turning study of a messed-up, co-dependent marriage wrapped in a thriller mystery.<br /><br />Plot summary:<br />After losing their jobs in New York, writers Nick and Amy move to Nick's hometown in Missouri where Nick buys a bar. Amy isn't happy being a housewife in fly-over land. Nick isn't happy with Amy's ennui. On their fifth anniversary Amy goes missing and Nick becomes the prime suspect in her likely murder.<br /><br />My opinion:<br />This was a really well-crafted book. It broke all sorts of writing \\"rules\\" - lots of digressions, some telling instead of showing blah, blah, but it all worked beautifully and had me turning pages until 3 a.m. Flynn painted detailed pictures without taking me out of the story or making me want to scan descriptions. Some of the metaphors and imagery will stick with me like the knotted razor wire that was Amy (p. 49). I loved the use of quizzes throughout; and some of the lines, especially in thoughts, were great, such as the interrogation at the crime scene and the neighbor at the park scene. The characterizations were complete and varied, even of secondary characters like Amy's parents and the cops. This was a really well done book. Some might not like the ending. I admit I turned the page and expected more pages, but after a few hours when the ending settles on you, you think--at least I did--that it's really the way it should be, with everyone sort of getting what they deserved.<br /><br />If you don't like reading about unlikeable characters, don't read this. If you like complex characters and don't have to love your hero, you'll like this book. I've read some reviews complaining about gratuitous sex and language and don't know what they're talking about. Both were minimal. Loved the story, loved the prose, loved the characters, loved the book.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Nice alarm. Good luck sleeping through the rooster tone. Several tones to choose from. Several alarms can be set at the same time. You can set it to ring/Buzz/whatever just one time. Every weekday, every Wednesday(or Friday or whatever you want). Very handy. I admit I use it for the slightest things. Such as a wake-up alarm. Call my grandson when he gets home from school. As a reminder to start the chicken. Whatever. It is the kind of app you take for granted. Always there, reliable and no maintenance. What would I do without it? Oh, sleep till noon, neglect the grandson and serve a lot of cold dinners because I forgot to start the chicken.

B00BUADSMQ|3.0|John McClane is in Russia.  Why, you might be asking?  Because his son has been convicted of murder.  Except, really, McClane Jr. is a secret agent, and he's trying to stop a bunch of political terrorists from gathering a whole lot of--you guessed it!--nuclear weaponry.  And of course, when Daddy finds out, he's gotta show his kid how they do it in Dixie.  Er, New York.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back, of course.  He looks and feels tired, but he's still fun to watch; the guy's still got acting and action chops, even if both are rather lacking here.  Jai Courtney, who gave a great villainous turn in 2012's JACK REACHER, doesn't have much to do here; his character is by-the-numbers, and takes a back seat to daddy.<br /><br />Yet, the surprising thing here is that even Willis seems to be a supporting character in his own film.  The outlandish script and over-the-top (in a bad way) action stunts hog too much of the spotlight.  Even Rasha Buckvic, giving us a love-to-hate villain, finds his character undercut in the inevitable third-act twist (which you can see coming, and is not at all satisfying when it arrives, except for the solid performance of Sebastian Koch).  A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD feels like an ordinary, direct-to-DVD action film that some producer got ahold of and said, \\"Hey, I want to make a DIE HARD sequel, let's squeeze John McClane into this.\\"  If you're a true fan of the series, you probably owe it to yourself to give it a shot,  That being said, I absolutely love the first three films, and can tolerate the second, and the only reason I went to see this is because a friend wanted to, and I was bored.  I can't say as I'll watch it again, unless I catch it on TV.  Maybe the inevitable sixth film will be more enjoyable...but we know the odds of that aren't good.

1781162646|5.0|As a kid looking for something to pique my literary hunger beyond the outgrown Judy Blume and Babysitters Club series, I crept into my parents' library late one night and stumbled on a book about a pyrokinetic young girl on the run with her father. I snuck it back to my room under my shirt and spent the next few nights devouring it under my blankets with a flashlight. I quickly moved on to The Shining, Carrie, Cujo, and It. And so began my literary love affair with Stephen King at 11 years old.<br /><br />Over the years, I've loved some books more than others, but the Dark Tower series were really what convinced me that he could do no wrong. But after his accident had taken its toll and a string of books read somewhat uninspired and formulaic, I figured his best work was behind him. I was a little sad, of course, but grateful for all the entertainment and inspiration I found through his previous books. Besides, everyone has to lose their mojo eventually, right?<br /><br />Oh, so very, very wrong.<br /><br />I knew it three chapters into 11/22/63. And now, the thrill ride that is Joyland proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt: Stephen King's mojo is back, full force. It's like Jerry Garcia in a bag, man. Except in a book.<br /><br />And speaking of BOOKS...<br /><br />I drove to the store late last night and stayed up through the wee hours of the morning reading Joyland under my blankets, this time with a slightly more advanced book light. To those complaining about the fact that King didn't release it on e-book, quit your whining. Reading an actual book (not a screen) is FUN. As an adult now with kids of my own who love to read, ebook are strictly for school or literary emergencies (only real book lovers know what I mean) in our house. Holding a book in your hand, cracking the spine, creasing the corners, getting water wrinkles on the pages from falling asleep with it on your chest while you float around the pool... It's all part of the charm. If you have to have it explained, you wouldn't understand anyway.<br /><br />Joyland is a scary, seductive, and fun thriller; a classic Stephen King read and a perfect addition to your summer reading list. If you want a synopsis, read the book description above. But if you have any doubt in Stephen King's mojo, just trust me and give it a try.  Because, let's be honest, Stephen King at his worst is still infinitely better than that Twilight joke. But this is far from his worst, so even if you liked that sparkly vampire crap, you're still ahead of the game.<br /><br />[Edited To Add]<br />Many people have commented in defense of ebooks, and I have to add that my opinion on ebooks was staged much more harshly than necessary due to feeling the need to pick sides in the book wars (so to speak). As I mention in the comments, after seeing what the Internet and digital files have done to record/music stores and video stores, it breaks my heart to think of a world without bookstores. But that doesn't mean that ebooks don't have their righhtful place; they do. And to those with eyesight issues who have mentioned the ability to read more because of the technology, thank you for offering another perspective I hadn't considered. I do support print, but supporting print doesn't have to mandate condemning technology, either.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy the book. See you all again for Doctor Sleep.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|it was a good fun game then it froze my kindle fire and I had to shutbit down. then afterwards the game would not open back up. uninstalled it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Awesome movie, especially because it is based on a true story.  A must have for any DVD collection.  Easily 5 stars.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Most definitely FF&SS!<br /><br />Remember what I said in the latest Mimi Jean Pamfiloff book about FF&SS? You know, that Fast, Fun & Smart, Sexy are things not a lot of books have and that's why I'm not pushing to have the acronym coined. Well, I'm so glad that there are and this book is one of them.<br /><br />OMG it made me laugh so much, I couldn't put it down and I couldn't stop myself from marking up phrase after phrase or reference.<br /><br />I have rarely read a book that's told in its entirety from a male POV and I have to say this was a real treat. Being in Drew's head was funny and refreshing. His insights in to all things male are diverse, hilarious and honest, they're also swoon worthy.<br /><br />\\"Mackenzie is the perfect weapon. My very own baby borg. Resistance is futile.\\"<br /><br />\\"I am a bad, bad boy. Think Kate will punish me if I tell her how bad I am?\\"<br /><br />\\"I want to talk to you until the sun comes up, and I want to bring you cereal in bed every Sunday...\\"<br /><br />Besides the way the book is written, having Drew also talk directly to us, the readers, was also something I really liked.<br /><br />There are so many different and good things regarding this book about \\"the dashing playboy that meets the take-no-prisoners girl of his dreams, and she snags his heart forever\\" that I would probably end up transcribing it completely.<br /><br />So thank you very much Emma, congratulations and may you gift us with many more.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This movie was very good.  I would have rated it higher but a little something was missing.  Action and effects were superb though.

B00B8PMWJI|1.0|Upon hearing of the premise of \\"The ABCs of Death\\" I was immediately intrigued, although a bit skeptical - could they really work 26 different stories into a single movie effectively? My hopes were high though, expecting something like \\"VHS\\" or one of those `90s anthologies like \\"Tales From the Darkside.\\" The end result unfortunately isn't just disappointing - it may actually be the worst horror film I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Honestly, something like \\"Entrails of a Beautiful Woman\\" is a more coherent and watchable movie than this.<br /><br />Most of the clips are intensely juvenile, and of course there isn't nearly enough time in one to four minutes to offer up any sort of satisfying story. \\"G is for Gravity\\" is utterly pointless and might as well not have even been filmed, and it just gets worse from there. To know whether the flick is worth viewing, all you have to do is consider if you want to see something called \\"F is for Fart.\\" The segment consists of the world dying because God lets off some atomic flatulence, and then a Japanese schoolgirl with a fart fetish spends her last moments sniffing the bright yellow toots from her teacher's behind. If that sort of thing floats your boat, then by all means enjoy, but I think it's clear the rest of the world can safely skip \\"The ABCs of Death.\\"<br /><br />Now to be fair I kept watching after \\"F is Fart,\\" thinking maybe this was some sort of high concept but low-brow execution of social commentary on how women's bodily functions are viewed in Japan. I shouldn't have. Afterwards you get things like \\"K is for Klutz\\" (sigh) in which a woman defecates into a toilet, the feces becomes sentient and refuses to be flushed, and then tries to work its way back into the uh, \\"birthing canal\\" it came from. Does that sound like something you want to watch?<br /><br />The one that will likely be the final straw for many viewers though is \\"L is for Libido,\\" in which men are forced into a masturbation race to the death. The one who loses gets a pointy object shoved into in an unpleasant place. If you've ever wanted to see two guys furiously masturbate while a small boy is raped by an overweight man, well, here you go I guess.<br /><br />So is it all bad and totally without redeeming value? Essentially yes. \\"C is for Cycle\\" is the only clip that's even remotely interesting (with a storyline similar to the flick \\"Triangle\\") but of course at a minute and a half it doesn't have time to go anywhere. A minute and a half of somewhat decent material just simply isn't worth the other hour and a half of non-stop awful.. The one who loses gets a pointy object shoved into in an unpleasant place.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is about subway surfers, an awesome, fun, and creative game.<br />You can earn coins and unlock characters as well as motherboards.<br />The creaters of the game always make up fun theams such as<br />Miami, New York, Christmas, ad Holloween. Right now it is on a<br />world tour so you go to places like Rome, Net York, Miami, and Rio.<br />I think you should bye subway surfers.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|English films are usually a bit uneven in my experience but this is one movie I have practically absorbed - I can pretty much recite the whole movie... and if you check out the commentary which I found fascinating, not only was it genius as far as comedy but they put meaning into just about every scene, giving homage to many other films. A great piece of cinema!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this book down! I experienced so many emotions throughout this story and was sorry to have it end.
030758836X|3.0|not great.  the writing is excellent but the story is weird.  i didn't like any character in this book and that is a first for me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this whole series. They are well written, in depth, full of suspense and just plain epic but at the same time every character I love seems to die. I also don't really enjoy most of the chapters featuring Dany, I feel the author let her storyline get a little sloppy.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I ordered 2 of these and chose the free shipping. They got here in less than 10 days from the other side of America.<br /><br />They sound great and for the price, they beat the Shure SM58!!!<br /><br />Still yet to try it with guitar and drums, but vocals and speech are crystal clear with little or no EQ.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone who is on a budget and cannot afford top-of-the-line equipment.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Over good book series and very very hard to put down. I guarantee you'll fall in love and want to read these books again and again.

B005NS5CX4|5.0|Each one of their songs is great!  Each song actually has meaning to it.  So I believe it to be a 5 Star album!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This replacement cable works great.  I believe that most of the negative comments stating that the cable didn't charge their Kindle was due to a faulty port on the Kindle itself.  My Kindle wouldn't charge after just 5 months of ownership.  Thankfully it was still under warrenty and a new Kndle was sent to me at no charge.  Get the extended warrenty!!!!!  Amazon was easy to work with and very helpful.

B003QS9WIE|5.0|Here Christopher Nolan has created a story that both socks and mystifies the viewer and treats them as intelligent human beings. Every detail is put to good use as Christopher Nolan combines history with fiction. It's worth a million bucks but I only has to pay 1.99
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Main reason I bought this was for the promo item in TF2. Thought about trading it away but once I had it in my inventory I just couldn't part with it.<br /><br />As for the music, it's great. If you're a fan of Portal this is a must own...or you could find the free download, but then you'll be missing the promo item and the fourth disc.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I have always been a fan of Stephen King and this book does not disappoint Stephen King readers. can't wait to read more
B000683VI4|5.0|So let me preface this by telling you that I watched the movie for the first time about 4 years ago; I was 16 at the time. The movie was good, I let a tear leak, but that was it.<br /><br />I just watched it for the second time (I'm 20, now), and I cried my damn face off.<br />Good god this is a great movie.

B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I think that this is a book that every woman should read at least once. It is an entertaining and good  book about love. I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because some parts were a little slow. However, some parts were very cleverly written.

1606863622|4.0|Wanted to read the book after seeing the movie because the book is always more detailed, which this one was.  I enjoyed this book but didn't care for the ending.  Probably should have read the book before seeing the movie.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great job interpreting the book into a visual set; casting of actors, costume, sets, etc is wonderful.  It's especially exciting when  scenes turnout exactly as I pictured it from the description in the books.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like the brain puzzle aspect of this game and the graphics, while juvenile are cute and enjoyable enough.  It is a fun game with interesting sound effects.  I is a challenging game and is appropriate for any age group or person who has a reasonably well developed frustration tolerance.  There are layers of game play and I enjoyed going back through previous game boards to get 0, 1, 2, or 3  stars and earning crowns.  I do wish they would publish some more game boards more quickly, but at the price of free how can I complain too much?
1568363931|5.0|This is a bento lunch book for serious adult Bentos. No cutesy anime-face hot dogs in this book, but just great photos and step by step preparations of what are surely delicious Japanese-and not-so Japanese style bento lunches. My wife has been reading and has yet to prepare anything, but the anticipation is killing me. Boy am I hungry just reading this book. Must have for anyone interested in a new lunch experience and bored of the ham and cheese sandwich.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|This works better than I expected. I'm using 3 of them, one in my car, one in my office and another on my nightstand. I use the one in my car to turn on gps and bluetooth and turn off wifi. I turn off bluetook, gps and turn on wifi in my office and I turn everything off and set phone to vibrate when I go to bed using the one on my nightstand. These actions help save battery on power-hungry phones by quickly allowing you to control battery hugging features. The software also allows you to open applications and control volume settings and a few other features. I like how the Sony software allows you to create start and end action profiles for each tag so can set actions and then remove them later on using the same tag, like turning on Bluetooth when you get in the car and then turning it off before leaving the car using the same tag. Very cool.
B00BMTX2HG|3.0|It wasn't as hard as there previous music, It just wasn't hard enough. Amorphis Forging The Land Of Thousand lakes live double CD 100 times better.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|First album ruled... Second album, well... Rules too! This album has a little more diversity than the first record, and has more of a &#34;Jam&#34; aspect to it as well. More Hendrix / Allman brothers influence than Sabbath this time around. Also has more parts to the songs, less drudging in the same key Doom style. I think it's a great follow up record, and can't wait to see them here in the states!
B00138H876|5.0|I was going through a devastating break up after a long relationship went sour, and I put this record on, and it didn't come off for a few months... That was over a decade ago, and I still get chills listening to certain songs from this album. A definite must have for any Dylan fan.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|How dissapointing!! The book simply repeats very boring and previously written sex scenes.  The plot sruggles to be new and interesting.  Don't waste your money on this one!  It was suppossed to be the conclusion but surprise surprise there is now two more (probably just as boring) books to come.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Amazon instant video is awesome!  I can download to my ipad now and watch it anywhere.  It really helps pass the time in between sporting events and during my lunch hour.  I love Sons of Anarchy!  Such a great show.  It rivals The Wire, The Sopranos or anything I have ever seen.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Every time one of the 90's legends puts out a new album (i.e., Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Metallica, etc.) the old fans get a little hysterical and rush to shouting that the new album's either a soulless, dead-on-arrival money grab or some miraculous resurrection.  When it comes to AIC, the fans have their own take on the band's difficult history and debates about whether Cantrell should've reanimated AIC are for fan forums.  Album reviews should be about the music.  I started listening to Alice at the age of 15 when they released their self-titled album and they've always remained on of my favorites in the interim two decades.  Obviously Layne's voice can never be replaced, but Duvall does a truly outstanding job in his own direction and fits perfectly fine with the brand.  If the band had tried to replace Layne's voice, it would've been a sad gimmick and everyone would've known it.  They haven't.  What they have done is somehow manage to release their best album since Dirt.  To me, Devil has smarter writing and sounds a bit more genuinely inspired than their 1995 self-titled album (recorded when Layne started to dissolve) and it's more self-assured and ambitious than 2009's Black Gives Way to Blue.  As far as I'm concerned, Devil ranks right in the middle of their generally awesome 5-album oeuvre.  The bad reviews for this album are written from an emotional place, not a sober analysis of the music.  Devil will deservedly be recognized as one of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|I started listening to Garbage when they released their first album in 1995 and instantly fell in love with the music.  The band somehow managed to build on that greatness with Version 2.0 in '98.  I don't know what happened to them between then and 2001's Beautiful Garbage, but it wasn't good; I was disappointed and figured I was listening to the obituary of one of my favorite 90's band.  When they came out with Bleed in 2005, I was in my mid-20s, still listening pretty regularly to the first two albums.  Bleed was a 2-star album, mostly because it allowed fans to nostalgically connect with that signature sound first heard in their teens, but there wasn't anything groundbreaking in there.  NYKOP is a very good album; the band was definitely gelling in the studio and having fun being Garbage again.  I don't think there's much room for growth in Garbage's sound.  It's hard for me to imagine them successfully evolving beyond the the sound the first two albums.  They're one of the few bands I used to listen to that I don't need to hear evolve and they haven't been doing a very good job at it, anyway.  But there's enough rawness, creative/solid songwriting, and the usual paramount production magic by Butch Vig in the album to rank it as a highly worthy listen.  Most of the songs do a good job of sounding like Version 3.0, with the exceptions being \\"Blood for Popppies\\" (the chorus of which belongs on the cutting room floor of the Beautiful Garbage sessions, WTF?...otherwise great song), the title song (which totally rips the Beatles off and doesn't amount to much), and \\"Big Bright World\\" (which isn't an awful song, but shouldn't have made the cut).  Bearing in mind that NYKOP's industry context has been Maroon 5, Nickleback, and Justin Bieber, the album is definitely one of my favorite releases in the last decade.  However, I hope they stop messing around and actually release Version 3.0 next time around.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|T<br />I'm still sweating and yea panting over the scenes between Gideon and Eva!! Remember that even though this series was to be a trilogy it was fairly obvious early on that Eva and Gideon had much more to do to make their relationship work, sexually and with all the terrible baggage they both share. Their world is a minefield as everything they do becomes public knowledge because of power and money .<br />Spectacular sex and wildly complex characters make this series fantastic!!<br />For those whinners complaining about how it's not a trilogy anymore GIVE IT A REST!  Please keep their story unfolding it's a great read and not just because of the fantastic sex.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Managed to surprise me, and I found the characters sympathetic.  I was concerned that it would be 'yet another holmes takeoff' but it stood on its own, using the holmes theme as a platform.  I liked the British version a little better, but this was good :)

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I had watched the trailer for Side Effects, and had formed something of an opinion on what the story line would be. I was so wrong. There are twists in this movie that I didn't see coming, and that makes for an interesting film.I thought Jude Law did an excellent job in his role. In fact, there are several very good performances in this movie. If you like a well-plotted movie that moves fast and keeps you guessing, Side Effects is a good choice.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I guess I am a simple person when it comes to movies. Real life (at least mine) is very complicated and can be stressful, so when I sit down to watch a movie, I don't want flashbacks or reminders of what I deal with in life. I am an escape artist!<br /><br />That said, there is a lot to recommend about this movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger for one. I am old enough to remember Arnold when he was a real movie star in the Terminator series, Total Recall, True Lies, The 6th Day, etc. One thing you could always count on when Arnold was at his best, was his sense of humor which was in complete juxtaposition with his appearance. He rarely took himself seriously even if the material he was acting did. That is a gift few actors have. And to see this Arnold up on the screen again was a joy for me to behold!<br /><br />I normally would not give such a fairly innocuous movie 5 stars. But Arnold once again, took the material given and made it his own. Which meant it was a rollicking good time with laughs and excitement and a bit of horror all thrown together. Simple ME! I loved every minute of it and, if you just want a fun, escapist movie to lose yourself in for 90 or so minutes, then this won't disappoint! His age is definitely showing, but instead of feeling melancholy about it, since the movie fit him so well, I was just in the moment with it. Besides, nothing lasts forever. Sometimes, though, we get a moment to relive a wonderful thing, and for me, this movie was that moment!
B004QBWU02|5.0|This was, is and always will be a great movie. The characters, story, and pace make it enjoyable again and again.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|To approach Super Collider from a traditional album review standpoint (as it seems most mainstream journalists are doing) is to miss the entire point of this album. To call this the best or the worst or good or bad has to do with who the audience is. This album is both really confusing and really damn good at the same time...it all depends on what audience you are a part of.<br /><br />Let's look at some circumstantial evidence to try and get a feel for what Megadeth was thinking when making this album. First, Dave Mustaine and David Ellefson are approaching the latter part of their careers. Sure they may have 3, 4, 5 more albums in them, but they have already established their legacy as institutions in heavy metal. So they aren't motivated by that at this point, at least not nearly as much as they were in the past. They've essentially been there, done that.<br /><br />Secondly, they know that their core fans will buy the album no matter what any review says about it, so they have a core fan base that allows them to tour the world whenever they want, and this is really where all the money is these days. The days of a band selling millions of albums are largely over. As Dave said once, \\"An album is just a business card inviting people to the live show.\\" (paraphrase) Since the advent of music downloading, bands rely more on live shows than ever. So if they made another primarily heavy album like the last several, they'd surely get good reviews and street cred etc., but I doubt they'd sell a significant amount of albums to new listeners, and their live shows would still draw about the same number of people. In other words, they wouldn't be exploring anything new.<br /><br />One way to really make a new legacy and a new impact would be if Megadeth became commercially popular again. As metal has swung its popularity pendulum back toward popularity, Megadeth has a chance to again become pioneers in this resurgence. (Odd comparison, but look at how Tony Hawk is viewed today upon the resurgence of skateboard culture).<br /><br />By seeking to re-pioneer the resurgence of metal, this would draw in new (younger) fans who would buy the new album and also see them live, which would be the only way to break any new ground. Most importantly, new fans would \\"discover\\" Megadeth and then buy all their old albums too (which most long term fans don't really do anymore in any large degree). This creates a compounding effect for the band.<br /><br />So in between the last album and this one we see that Megadeth joined Creative Artist's Agency (CAA) as their new management. This is the absolute top tier Beverly Hills management agency in the world. Just look at their website. They manage every A-list person from music to movies etc. Next, likely via CAA, they sign with the largest music company in the world Universal. This goes back to the \\"go big or go home\\" strategy I mentioned earlier. If anyone can boost their popularity with new fans and give them the chance to re-pioneer the resurgence of metal, it's Universal and CAA.<br /><br />So now we get back to Super Collider. Super Collider is designed to ease these new fans into the Megadeth catalogue. They can't just drop another Endgame and put up more web ads and hope for the best. It wouldn't work. They have to create an album which serves the function of a \\"bridge\\" between these new fans and their entire back catalogue. The idea is that once they have these new fans accustomed to their current and back catalogue, they can then synergize their old and new fans into a modern fan base that bridges across two entirely different 'generations' so to speak and at the same time re-pioneers the resurgence of metal.<br /><br />And this is definitely a bridge album. It has so many different elements for so many different listeners. It has heavy ass riffs and killer solos in some parts, and it also has intriguing melodies with subtle bass lines in others. It has almost a KIMB-sounding vocal part, a spooky as hell banjo/violin, spoken word, catchy radio tracks for new listeners, very personal and emotional lyrics about Dave's family, and it even wraps it in a CD package that looks like it jumped off the screen of a 20-something's video game (with an insert card to let new fans who don't come to this website know that CTE live will be out soon).<br /><br />As a bridge album, Super Collider is really, really damn good.<br /><br />As a traditional thrash album for the hardcore fans, it will seem like it's Risk II and coming out of left field. After all, even Risk was called Risk to warn people they were trying something new. But that was a totally different era when metal bands were reacting to a pretty sudden drop in popularity due to grunge and hip hop.<br /><br />From the perspective of a new listener, I give this 4 stars. From the perspective of a thrash fan, I give it two stars out of respect for multiple parts on the album which were well worth the $13 bucks I spent on the Best Buy exclusive.<br /><br />From the perspective of a Megadeth fan, I hope this really, really ballsy move pays off for them and that the fans will see what's really going on with Super Collider.

It was nice to see they used an alternative word (conjurer).  I also appreciate the fact that there was a duality when she had to &#34;choose her side&#34; instead of it being one or the other.
B0036UW09U|5.0|Might be a little dated but kristopherson and Streisand are superb in this wonderful love story.  Just love love love it.  A standard in my collection
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book is a great way to finish an amazing series. Brandon Sanderson really knows how to write an epic ending.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is not a bad book.  I, for one, am THRILLED that this story will continue.  I do not feel cheated nor taken advantage of.  If the author feels there is more of the story to be told than originally planned and the writing is as good as Sylvia Day's, then I will happily give her another $10, 20 or however much.  I have read over 800 novels over the last year and a half and few have been as pleasing as this series.  Its an EPIC love story so it only seems appropriate that it take more time to tell.
0425263924|1.0|We waited so long for the 3rd book and now to find out it is solely disappointing..thank you everyone for the reviews,,I will save my Money !!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We love Downtown Abbey and are now into the 3rd season.  Great actors and while there are certain melodramatic elements to the scripts, I find I can forgive them.  A great series and have recommended to others
B00A83075M|5.0|My grandsons love this movie. It's has something for all. I ended up buying one for all three of my 4/5 year old grandsons because they enjoyed it so much at our house.
B0054SMID0|3.0|I must say I was disappointed in the film version.  There was a wit about the main character in the book that I thought was missing from the film.  Way too much dramatic angst and little sharp, pointed humor.  After reading the book, I immediately went on to the sequel, The Fifth Witness.  After seeing the film, I have little or no desire to see a sequel.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book as the last book in the trilogy but I am very disappointed. I eel like the story just rambles on and on. I am about ready to smack both Gideon and Eva all they do is play games....I do not know why this book could not be the end. I was disappointed
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Everything went great the movie was great very fast service it was here<br />In a flash. I must have looked at it five times. Lot of action like I had said<br />Great story line.
B007EECSFA|4.0|It was an interesting story with twists and turns. Perhaps a little too drawn out. I would recommend the book.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|A must see movie the best if you like a action flick.<br />The story line was great they went into detail with<br />The weapons and ammo and story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game I playy it all the time!Ayee!<br />And I like how they do it in different states
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Waited 6 months to be sorely disappointed! Will not be wasting another dime on this drawn out, thin plotted, waste of my time. All I can say is shame on you...<br /><br />You can return this ebook if you are not satisfied with your purchase within 5 days! Go to manage your kindle, click on the + next to the title and hit return!! Send a message that we ARE NOT happy!!
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I didn't really expect this movie to be this good. I highly recommend. Arnold done a great job. Good come back.
0425263924|2.0|I heard a few weeks ago that the Crossfire series was going to comprise 5 novels, not 3, so I can't claim to be surprised that Entwined With You ends with so many things unresolved. I admit I wasn't thrilled about the idea of the author dragging it out to 5 books but I know that Ms Day is an accomplished writer so I decided to give EWY a go. I am very sorry to say my worst fears have been realized. I bought the book because I wanted to read more about the compelling love between Gideon and Eva, not about Megumi's sad sex life, Mark's wedding plans or Eva's parents having sex in her apartment. Apart from these boring, incidental storylines, the plot is so jam-packed with unresolved twists and turns it has become borderline ridiculous: Cary is still juggling the boyfriend/girlfriend except now the girlfriend is pregnant; Brett the Rock Star is still whispering dirty talk to Eva who STILL seems to be receptive despite her assertions that Gideon is the love of her life AND the fact that Brett has made a music video which deliberately exposes her to salacious gossip; Gideon is being stalked and harassed by not one, not two, but three psycho exes; Corinne has attempted suicide and had a miscarriage; there is a sex tape of Brett and Eva about to be launched into cyberspace and as if all that isn't enough lo and behold here comes the Russian mob to take the wrap for Nathan's murder. Oh please. Doesn't anybody in New York have a normal day? I really don't understand what has happened here. Perhaps Ms Day has lost her mojo, or had to rush to meet a deadline. I got to the end of the book and immediately thought 'Where's the other half?'. Yes, there are still plenty of hot sex scenes and there are some moving moments between Gideon and Eva but on the whole their passionate, intense love story is no longer the focus of this series. It reads more like a treatment for a potential 'Revenge'-like television series, with a cast of thousands, than a true sequel. I feel duped.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I gave this a quick test and it &#34;scanned&#34; a page from a magazine into a PDF file. It was a bit slow, but the results were quite good. It auto-detect page edges and does a good job of aligning the page.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger has music from my time.  Almost every song brings memories, a tapping foot, a sing along abd wanting more!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is the first calculator I have seen that handles fractions without making the whole process difficult. It is very easy to use, and gives you answers in both decimal and fractions. The screen is easy to read as well. It would be nice to have some more functions, perhaps, but I rarely do much besides basic math with fractions. I have other good calculators for doing more sophisticated math functions.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|I have the same on my PC. I just need to get used to controlling it on the HTC One XL.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really loved this book, could not put it down.  It did get a little weird, their relationship.  Once I &#34;got it&#34; I couldn't get it out of my head for days after finishing the book.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This is the body of my review of this album. It is a very good album. It is better experienced with Part One. \\"The Conflagration\\", \\"Gravesend\\", and \\"Red City\\" are the best tracks. I recommend this album.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|Great songs with good beats and strong vocals.  I can't stop listening to this album.<br /><br />Best to buy the whole album because of how many songs are included.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and this is by far my favorite Nicholas Sparks movie.  It stayed pretty true to the book, and the actors worked wonderfully together.  It's nice that it has a bit of excitement and mystery in it, as well!  I definitely recommend this to any fan of romantic movies, you will love it!
B00BEFL5Q8|5.0|I'm not going to prattle on about the hooks, the comeback, the utter brilliance of the lyrics. It's all been said over and over and over and over again. I'm expressing concern over my waking up every morning with a \\"Bloodsports\\" song cycling around in my mind like it was in my dreams. I've not listened to the album in a couple days and AGAIN I wake up with the Brett Anderson shouting in hiccups in my head in a Cockney wail about how no one will love me as much as him, and how it starts and end with me. This is the perfect Suede album.
006114665X|5.0|Anyone interested in the results of research in depth told with a narrative ease will enjoy reading this book to gain new insights into WWI one of the profound events of the 20th century.  Book arrived on schedule in prime condition.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have been using this app for over a year and have had no issues with it. It works everytime and has lots of options.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Movie starts a little slow, but it is worth the buildup.  I hope the second movie comes out very soon.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I like watching this on my kindle fire. I can use the headphones and watch with out disturbing my fiancée.
B0071FBARY|4.0|This is not the their best CD, but the tunes are still good.  If you are just starting to listen to them, try the previous CD first.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Interesting concept, entertaining story. Brandon Sanderson does not disappoint, if you like his other books you will enjoy this one.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I would give this book  -star<br />The book was almost $10! This is really taking advantage of the readers! The story in book 3 was lame and I agree with most of the comments. The one major issue of murder was not even discussed in the book. I think the author will discuss the murder in book 4. The characters were weak and not fully explored. Why did the author and publisher put this book/ kindle edition at $9.99? Many of the well known authors do not charge that much. The most I have paid has been $7.99!<br />Greed.. plain and simple by the author and publisher.. Sorry people we will not be taken advantage of. I will not buy 4 and 5<br />and I will tell everyone how upset I am!!
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|As always, a well researched book with a clear objective and great writing. Even if you disagree with some of the conclusions you will find loads of usefull information.
0385349947|5.0|Despite the harsh criticism, I found this book to be enlightening and inspiring. Many of the ideas are applicable to both the professional world and outside the office setting. Whether you are volunteering or dealing with contractors to fix your house, it always a good idea to Lean In!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love seeing older people take names and dish out punishment.  The things they do in this movie are really amazing.
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|i like seth rogen...and will watch pretty much anything he is ...but this &#34;comedy&#34; was exxtremly stale...had a few parts that made me smile...but never rolling on the floor...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I agree about the delay in this book, it was so aggravating!! But the book itself is so good.  I love, love this series.  I'm glad there will be two more books!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Such a great game for little and big girls!!! The graphics are so clear, colorful, and precise. It is a relaxing and great way to spend time away from other normal duties doing by what you love...Glamour! You can be a beautician or creative designer by using touch and drag functions. When you are done creating your masterpiece you can take a picture and save it to your gallery to show to others later. Great APP. Thank you LiBii and Amazon!!!!!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Piano and cello and orchestra - what could be better? Love piano music? Love cello music? Get them both together with orchestra and it's a winner! Talented performers and musicians and arrangers and producers - five stars!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Popular and Fun App. Pictures clear! Sound quality great. My kids love! Even had bonus cartoon shirt films. Very good for keeping the little and big ones busy in waiting rooms. We love it!
B00710Z87M|5.0|Just finished this book today...have been implementing all of the meditations and practices for manifesting.  This really could be called create anything you want... Truth be told that which I am manifesting practically is coming about but I can't say it's here yet on the physical plane till it is.  In any case, being as positive, fantastical and idealistic as I've always wanted to be is just plain fun!  My favorite part of this book is it gives you full permission to be as dreamy as you want.  Your imagination has no limits and that is so liberating.  I finally gave myself to permission to dream my biggest dreams, ask for things I only could meagerly hope for before.  They say when you shake the universe's apple tree you're likely to get oranges- but those oranges will be sweeter than all the apples you could have hoped for.  Time will tell, but I sure am a happy camper in the meantime!
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Great app for those of you who like the puzzle style games. The instructions start out very simple so you know what to do. Then the game gets harder pretty quick, but not impossible. Graphics, sound and game play are excellent. Knocked off a star due to the fact that the start-up info on the levels sometimes block the tracks and stuff. Hard to plan ahead on what your first move is if you can't see where the track goes until its too late. Otherwise very addicting to say the least.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|He didnt know Sherylyn Kenyon! But he got all the others right, Sideshow Bob, my dog, my husband, I even had him guess himself! Lol lots of fun!
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|Thought this might be a little more fun with the shotting and flying, but the entire game leaves much to be desired. Controls are hard to get manage to even on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; screen. The graphics are very cheap. Trying to aim and fire straight is a whole other skill set in of itself. App deleted.
B003730LRY|5.0|...seriously, I love that thing.  Despite the MC Hammer &#34;Addams Family&#34; song, this movie rules ass.  Yes, that's a term.  I looked up on the google machine using science and hashtags.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I like puzzley games, and i like rpg type character development. And here they are in spades. Good times honestly
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The style of writing was a little different and that was interesting.  Kind of eerie.  Would recommend
1574214276|5.0|I ordered this book right after I first heard of the Zentangle art/meditation process.  I have since taken a class with a CZT and love it.  This book shows many more patterns than learned in the beginner series of classes.  Very easy to follow instructions/diagrams.  If you can get one book on Zentangle, this is the best basic book.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it town. I can't begin to imagine the hell she went through. I admire her for her strength and courage!
B00AAU3JNU|5.0|If you're easily offended, this is probably not your cup of tea...  Frank takes the results of censorship and control to it's ultimate (ridiculous) end, but you get the point.  If you're uptight, if you see a devil behind every questionable lyric you hear, you should give it a serious, objective listen end to end.  I dare you :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Holy carp how can this story keep getting better with every BOOK.  I truly had many emotions the on going struggles of Eva and Dark and Dangerous. I love how she calls him this and even better Ace! THE love they have for each other comes across so well it is hard not to have your heart ache sometimes with all of the carp they deal with. NOW ONCE AGAIN WE WAIT FOR WHAT COMES NEXT. I AM SURE IT WILL BE ONE HECK OF A RIDE......
B00AG297GK|1.0|I've always thought Sacha Baron Coen was a mediocre comic, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  Couldn't get through the whole thing.  It's awful.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|Awesome once you figure out how to make objects (especially confusing on the new Galaxy s4.) Glad I bought it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Saw this at the movies! When I saw they made a \\"Red 2\\", I had to rent this to refresh my memory. I watched it twice. In 48 hrs. Its lol funny!!! Can't wait to see \\"Red 2\\"!<br />The download and streaming was fast and clear. You gotta love technology :)
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Arnold is a interesting and enjoyable actor who keeps the audience entertained and maintaining a like-able character in this movie.  The corvette is also a star in this movie of non-stop action and believable story line.  If you enjoy Arnold, you should enjoy this movie.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I saw a promo on TV for this and it enticed me. When my wife and I watched it together, she immediately said, &#34;We've seen this before, at the cinema.&#34;  &#34;Really?&#34; I answered. It took another ten minutes for me to agree with her. But I liked it again and will bring it to our summer house as a choice for our family and guests.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I actually enjoy playing. As a matter of fact I find myself constantly playing but the only downside is friends' requests. It would be a five star game if u were able to request friends via game circle or gameloft as well as Facebook. I love love love ice age by gameloft. Easy to play, great graphics and most importantly easy to add friends.<br />Update...I've since learned how to send and accept friend requests via GameCircle on my Kindle Fire. My GameCircle ID is not2n1te if anyone needs friends to play.
B004UPAN6W|3.0|Good movie just wish it was part of prime.  Having to rent it sucked since I paid for this membership.
0812993845|5.0|So cute.  Light and funny.  Loved it.  Made me laugh and laugh .  Will read more of her books in the future.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I didn't like the parts when animals killed and ate each other.  It was ssooo far fetched that it was hard to tell what the author was trying to portray.  You couldn't tell if PI was telling the truth or just dreamed all of it.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|If you're a Merlin fan this is a must.  I still cry over the last episode.  I would suggest the non Blu ray version as the Blu ray doesn't necessarily work on all Blu ray enabled machines.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Soderberg has lost it. It appears he started to make a film about psychopharmacology and realized halfway through that nobody was going to care. So, about halfway through, he tried to turn it into a different sort of film, a murder mystery and a revenge fantasy. Our protagonist is Jude Law who, as usual, is very compelling as a cardboard human being, in this case a shrink who likes money and hates to lose it. In the end he uses psychiatry as a weapon against his patient in order to achieve revenge. It's inauthentic and boring. My advice is to not waste your money or your time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much because it has<br />Coin's and it is a great game to play on my kindle
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't wait to read it and when I was I didn't want to stop.  The characters were so real  and touched each other's lives and it wad so touching.  Can't wait for his next book.
B0094K20FK|2.0|Fun to watch in the context of the latest Star Trek movie with the ties to Khan... Always a little tough, though, to swallow the fact that the Prequel has some much more advanced technology.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|While this movie won't win any Oscars overall it still was an enjoyable one to watch which will give viewers a good mix of action/gore/drama/sex/tragedy to keep most entertained throughout the movie. The one thing is that this was a CGI captures motion movie which is one of the few to be released to us here in the states since the sad box office fail of Final Fantasy:the spirits within.  The voice cast did an excellent job in their roles and the video quality and background scenery was excellent as we;; as the soundtrack that went with the movie too.  This is definitely not your Disney's Pixar kind of movie so if younger children show an interest in this I suggest pointing them to the more family G rated movies instead as there is a good deal of gore and blood in the movie.<br /><br />So for fans of mythological adventure movies or Viking movies or just those looking for a good action fight movie here's a decent one to take a look at....
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A friend recommended this movie, and it has been on my movie wish list for almost a year.  I was traveling for work, and had a night in the hotel, so I logged in with my PC.<br /><br />This was an incredibly touching movie.  Little did I know that my husband would fall this spring, and I would have to be his caregiver for so many intimate tasks.  I remembered the patience and love of this movie.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|This movie is nothing but people screaming at each other for over 2 hours.  Paul Rudd and some of the vulgar humor is the only redeeming quality making this movie worth renting.  There are better ways to spend 2 hours.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Bejeweled meets rpg, this game is fun and enjoyable.  Runs smoothly on my verizon galaxy s4 and doesn't seem to use that much battery
B002RI9ZUE|3.0|All things considered, a relatively disappointing work.  The self-obsession that fires Plath's poetry does less well in prose. The humour of the first part is effective and surprising; unfortunately it does not last.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An interesting read but seems to have a lot of &#34;hey, look how great I am&#34;.  I'm still wondering if the family is still together. The nomenclature of the weapons could have been covered in an addemdum rather than repeated everytime a weapon was picked up. Overall the writer captured what he wanted to convey and it gave good insight into what our troops faced in Iraq and Afganistan and how individuals met their responsibilities.  I thank God for what our men and women in service do to keep us free.  For those that think the war in both countries wasn't needed and troops should be withdrawn they are discounting the sacrafice of those men and women.  Remember the words in the Battle Hymn of the Republic which says, &#34;He died to make men holy and we die to make men free&#34;.
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson has written a fascinating and relevant political account that I cannot recommend more highly.  Being born in 1940 I read it to understand better those turbulent years that affected the perceptions of my family and community. But it also provided unique insights into our political condition -- our polarization and the approach of our leadership today.<br /><br />Perhaps its most unique attribute is how well Olson probes the primary characters, their impact and their motivations, whether Lindbergh, Roosevelt, Wilkie, Stimpson, and a host of others who affected the interventionist versus isolationist conflicts that so fired up Americans' emotions. The life and impact of Lindbergh and the phenomenon of the Wilkie candidacy and his effect on our foreign policy are particularly fascinating.<br /><br />Perhaps some readers will be dismayed by the portrayal of Roosevelt's caution and apparent indecisiveness at key junctures, and how the fate of England was held in the balance. But Olson presents the facts  and emotions at play with supreme objectivity and with writing that never loses its refreshing clarity.<br /><br />I cannot imagine any reader finishing this book without applauding the author and appreciating the insights gained.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This movie has been seen by my children with me n by themselves dozen of times. It's a good holding movie that keeps you on the edge, good theme n has good clean language that a child can watch n not be exposé to the fowl language some films have. Has a very good message to teach a child n adult. I recommend this films a lot.
B008M721MS|5.0|Free, easy to use, clear, instant messaging, video, voice....it all works for what is intented for. Just need internet connection.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have enjoyed Rod Stewart's music for some years now. His voice and raspy voice is quite different than most Pop singers . This CD to my taste has been one of the best to listen to all the way through. Very enjoying and recommend this to everyone.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|The film presents a variety of contrasting styles and performers. Some are totally improvisatory. Some are precisely rehearsed. The the songs are -- dare one say it? -- uplifting. There, I said it.
0060763280|5.0|The book exceeded my expectations. It was hard cover and in excellent condition. There were no marks anywhere on the book. I would purchase a book from them again and will recommend them to my friends.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is the coolest game. So much fun and really makes you think. If you like puzzle games, you will love this game. Well worth the money. I hope there will be more levels sometime soon.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. It may be hard for younger ones to understand.  well  Worth the money.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Pretty sweet game.  It's addicting.  Buy it or your dumb.  Seriously though it's worth the dollar I spent on it.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This a great movie  for anyone. It will make you laugh and cry. Worth the money.  I would suggest it to anyone.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Follows pretty much the same formula as every other romantic comedy out there, but the actors in this one really make it stand out. Characters are entirely believable, especially if you grew up anywhere in the tri-state area.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My six year old loves it.  Great animation. Good story.  Fun for parents too.  Worth owning as he watches it repeatedly.
B000FZET5W|5.0|Happy Good Nice Sweet Not Bad Very Good Awsome COuld not be better Just buy it I like it Cool!
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Very enjoyable movie.  Especially enjoyed the actors and actresses in this old version.  Can't believe I never saw it before!
0425263991|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. So I give it 4.5. Why not 5? I thought it was repetitive sometimes but not as much as Kiss of Snow ( which I loved by the way). Moreover, I would have wanted to see more interaction with Sahara's family. How would her father, cousin and father react when they know about her relationship with Kaleb? This book really deserves a novella sequel or additional chapters.<br />We learn a lot during this book about Kaleb (love him almost as much as Judd). we also enjoy a love story that is wonderful and the deepest you come across in the series. We get to see characters from the other books: Judd, Anthony, Vasic, Aden, Faith, Vaughn and others from the changeling packs. Some big changes in the Psynet occur at the end. Now I look forward to the next books. I would love to read about Vasic (god I love this character) and also about Aden. I also would like a novella/book about Anthony and Nikita. They might be older than the other characters but they are wonderful. So many wishes...I know...<br />Thank you Nalini for such wonderful book! I only hope that the next book will be as good as this one and not as bad the last one (sorry I really did not like it).
B000HL09SA|5.0|As good as Marley and Me but a younger dog owner and WWII setting.  Highly recommend it.  Some of the music may remind you of Rudy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it was an awesome game! buuut my kindle has hiccups and doesnt wanna purcase things soketimes, so i go to pay for tue rest of the game, and all I get is the loading screen. :/
B00008CMR6|5.0|I have many of his movies, and this just adds a further expansion of this talent and his acting abilities.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I think I remember reading one or more of these stories a long time ago. It was a lot of fun finding this collection and reading all of the stories
B005LAIISA|5.0|Computer graphics has certainly improved since Ice Age first came out. The whole series is wonderful and I'm glad I was able to get this one, too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game. plenty of players online to make use of social functions. only complaint is curve of time required per quest.
B001TODCII|5.0|Saw the original on screen at the theater.  Can't wait to get the DVD.  Liam Neeson rocks in this movie.  His character is a far cry from Schindler in Schindler's List.  Action , Action,and more Action.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was very happy with this installment of the Crossfire Series.  I knew ahead of time that there would be more books but I hope there is only 1 more book instead of two.  I felt this book needed to be about Eva and Gideon having time together because they spent so much time apart in the last book.  There are to many loose ends with Gideons Family, the crazy therapist, the mystery around the \\"bracelet\\", Cary.  Eva and Gideon found each other again in this book now they need to blend back into society in the next.  I will say I am disgusted with Eva in this book and her actions in general. She is selfish and immature in some ways and I hope I see more maturity in her in the next book. But I have to say I do love this series, I love Sylvia Day and all of her books she has written and am very anxious about the 4th installment of the Crossfire Series:)  I do love Gideon Cross!! XOXO
B00BF11STU|5.0|Jessica Chastain is fantastic in this movie. Great cast and performances. This is not just an action movie for guys.  Just a few parts  you may want to cover your eyes or look away. Worth watching.
0061992860|5.0|I just love this book, I just know this will be an awesome edition to our backpacking and camping activities. It is small and very easy to pack and carry.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I actually purchased this book by accident while groping in the dark to turn off my kindle that was on my night table.  Seems like I pushed the purchase button and when I learned of my purchase, I decided that there must be a reason that it occurred.  This is an easy, thoughtful read and easily a book that could be read at different stages of life with different gems discovered.  Easy to understand why it has been translated into so many different languages and sold so many copies.
B005HF0GMA|5.0|I don't know how I could have missed this series on TV. I'm in the process of watching the series and not getting that much else done. Can't stay away! Good story line, lots of humor, strong family morals, and tons of psychic moments. Who could ask for more?
B009YP9L7U|3.0|chemistry with 2 main characters starts out plausable but toward the end just doesn't work realistically.  No guy that wants to have a marriage as an &#34;arrangement&#34; without love is going to one day come around and change his mind about &#34;being in love.&#34;. I found it to be disappointing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I just had to with this one.  I thought the characters were realistic and had depth.  I laughed my booty off in places and probably could have cried in a few places if I were a crier.  I also enjoyed just having the view point from the man's perspective. Yes, I could have slapped him a few times, but I have no doubt that men sometimes think the way Drew does.  Thanks Emma for the story!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a really telling tale of an unimaginable experience. It's intense. I appreciate the reflection chapters which answer the questions that pop up in the preceding chapters.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I love this movie, in spite of its somewhat anti-feminist ending. It's a ton of fun, which is great when you're not looking for something serious. Anna Faris and Chris Evans have good chemistry, and the supporting cast is terrific! The resolution leaves something to be desired, especially as it caps off what had become a more feminist-leaning movie.<br /><br />Quality from Amazon is all the could be desired.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Loved the seen after Sheriff Owens jumps into the diner for cover...<br /><br />Irv: How are you sheriff?<br /><br />Sheriff Ray Owens: Old.<br /><br />:) just sums up some of my days.
B002XHN776|5.0|I can't really get some of these songs out of my head. Escape is a great intro, and Vox Populi has barely left my head since I first listened to it. Awesome album
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|the wolves scared me. i liked it because it was like mindcraft.  its pretty fun and interesting. the game should be free
B0050SYS5A|4.0|The item does work well, it's hard to describe how it ultimately ends up doing what it does.  i thought it would help me out since i'm a very big guy (6'5&#34;) but it didn't
B00514HDNW|4.0|Read it in one day. Very good. Interesting take on the end of the world. Seems the movie is different. Will have to see it now.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|This movie is great as long as you're not expecting an oscar worthy film. It's lots of fun, gore, bikinis, and good 'ol B-movie horror.
B0018O51LU|1.0|I was not able to view the movie because the one sent to me was for the wrong region.  My DVD player couldn't read the DVD.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|This movie had a very interesting and suspenseful story and I feel that it was overall a great watch and great.
0425263924|1.0|Crossfire has been one of my very favorite series to this moment, couldn't even sleep last ninth waiting to read this book but for the first time I feel like Sylvia is drawing it out for the money. Only two hundred and something pages, really!?!? . There was absolutely no need for it to stop where it did and I was very annoyed. Just.... No. And now I have read on her sight that this will be a FIVE PART SERIES. Five? REALLY??? sad sad sad  and instead of giving us happily ever after she's just throwing drama on top of drama while weakening the relationship that, until now, I was rooting for.now I want so badly that Gideon leave Eva.<br /><br />So disappointing that Sylvia Day has now officially ruined one of the best love stories, only to get more money out of this :'(
B00CLO3G54|5.0|It was a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it! Overall, it was funny and had a good story.
B001HN6922|3.0|It is a great movie my kids love it, but this distributor sent me a disc that scips. Not terrible wont freeze on tv but has a few little glitches. On a positive note the dvd came very quickly.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|I forgot just how good Derek and the Dominos and the Layla album/CD was.  This is the Deluxe addition and improved recording.  Duane Allman and Eric Clapton teaming up is just incredible.  Place this in your CD player and turn it up!!  You will not be disappointed and just listen to the intricate guitar work!!!
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Funny Girl is a wonderful example of a musical beautifully adapted from the Broadway stage.  The quality of this print and the 4K master shows why collectors prefer Blu-ray.  Sound is wonderful and a joy to listen...repeatedly.  The length of the movie also lends itself to the Blu-ray format...one disc.  Chapter stops make it easy to continue and the return from previous play is a great feature.
145210655X|5.0|Let's see what happens when Darth Vader has to deal with a willful child. &#34;Luke, do you have have to go potty? You are doing a little dance.&#34; We also loved Vader's Little Princess.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I did not get it it was so bordering and I don't like it at all it is just boring
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Nice game I am very pleased with g5 games I would love to play it so m e more I really dig it
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is a movie my child loves and it is available at a wonderful price. It is so difficult to find this movie in stores. I am so happy I now have it.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Not the best or the worst movie I've seen.  It was average entertainment.  It is not a movie that I would watch again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have a game in the subway surfer. Im trying to  get Nick.but it is so much coins to get Nick
B003PIUBZS|5.0|ENJOYED COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ... WENT ON TO PURCHASE SECOND SEASON ... PERIOD SETTINGS OUTSTANDING ...<br />ACTORS AT TOP OF THEIR GAME ... RECOMMENDED TO FRIENDS
B001JI72AI|4.0|I like the quality of the movie on amazon, and the movie is very good.<br /><br />thanks for keeping this movie on amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was willing to ignore the long wait for the conclusion to this novel but expecting it to be worth the wait, but it wasn't it was a rushed all over e place mess with characters and plots that had little to do with the original story line. And he worst part it isn't even over, I have no interest in the next two books in this now five part trilogy. As far as I'm concerned e novel ended when Eva and Gideon got married on that weekend vacation. This series is becoming a $2.99 purchase in no way was it close to being worth $9.99.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I know this is not a Sanrio product, but it is as cute as they are and functional too. Fits right in the card holder in my wallet. Just the ticket to keep track of my SD cards
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It's not a good is I thought it will be for me to play too can get enough money<br />Toplay
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I would love to see them take this all the way through &#34;Red Dragon&#34;.  I love Mads as Hannibal...makes more sense than Anthony Hopkins, given Hannibal's back story.  Give this one some time;  if you love Thomas Harris's characters, this is a worthy effort.
B005LAIHQS|1.0|Must have been contract obligation, spent almost no money on effects i looked up reviews for explanation what a surprise that people liked this garbage!
B0064W6728|5.0|After the silliness that was &#34;Crossover&#34;, this book gets back to what I love about Fables...surprisingly deep and emotional writing with twists and genius turns that never disappoints.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|If you don't mind reading at least 200 pages of unnecessary details for no reason, go ahead!  This book makes you believe that mr. King is paid by the word instead of by the book.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is awesome. I guessed every main character from Gossip Girl and it got every one right! I even tried Ronald McDonald!
1451696191|3.0|For the 1st time of my life i have to say that the movie (which I loved) is better than the novel.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|This is a standard in the field, and deservedly so. Yin's coverage of case study research is well-written and and thorough. I bought the Kindle version of this edition when it was at a bargain price and the text has been fine -- I agree with the other reviewer that Sage probably reissued the ebook with corrections. Having this with me wherever I go is proving handy for my grad work!
B007MB5OCE|1.0|Couldn't put it down. it would make an award winning film. A great history lesson and life lesson, as well.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|KHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!! (echo...echo...) Sound travels in space for James T. Kirk<br /><br />They even made a prequel, of sorts for it.<br /><br />The needs of the many out way the needs of the few, or the one...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I paid $9.99 thinking I was finally finishing the storyline only to have another cliffhanger!!  The book was so slow - not nearly the enticing storyline of the first two books.  I guess the author slowed down the pace so she could milk the storyline for two more books.  Well, the story is finished for me.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Loved this series just wish it was on another TV station so I could watch it even if it was on late at night.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I saw the original Parent Trap at the movies when it came out - a period of time my nephews refer to as pre-history.  This new version is even better.  The storyline works well in about any decade - whether it's in the 1960s as in the first version or in the early 21st century as in the new version.  The choice of Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as the parents works really well.  There is a good chemistry between them, even as they portray totally opposite personality-parents.  It all comes together to make a very entertaining movie.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|I just didn't like you ending the series so soon - completely loved everything about the series, it just ended to soon.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I used to fly real rc airplanes. This simulator comes close but just doesn't work like the real thing. It is OK!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|We have loved this movie for years.  Our dvd is literally worn out so we love that Amazon has it as a rental.  Love my Prime!!
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|The story line was hard to follow. I think this is a great book that I never read.But as a movie, it is too short to cover the material. The plot twists and mix ups were covered too quickly, and they're important. The acting was great the actors did well but they jjust didn't get enough time to develop the story better.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Loved the movie, but after two tries, both copies of the blu-ray stopped working at scene 18. I will try again later with a new batch.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|this vender I have ordered stuff from for yeaRS  they do a great job and merchandise is always here when they say or before it was a Christmas present
1442359919|3.0|Oh please, 7 plastic disks? What a waste. Just give us one disk with the mp3s. That's what everybody does with the disks anyway. Insisting on selling in this format is a waste. 11-22-63 was sold as mp3s, why not Joyland too? King is such a confused liberal, you'd think he'd eventually put it together that 7 plastic disks is worse for the environment that 1 plastic disk.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br />Audio File 1-2: Joyland is narrated by Michael Kelly and is written in the first person narrative voice of an older man remembering his 21st year. From the beginning the tale established itself as another coming of age story that is so popular with younger readers. Michael Kelly's narration comes across pretty well and the technical quality of the recording is good. In the first file, two accents are presented. The first is a southern accent that is supposed to be Carolinian and the second accent is a Brooklyn accent. The accents don't appear to be overdone but I will leave it to actual residents to say whether or not they are accurate, but for this New Englander, the accents were close enough without seeming extreme. The initial part of the story hooked me nicely and foreshadowed events to come. Beginnings are important and I'm adding an additional star for hooking me right away. Will provide additional review info at the middle and end of book as well.<br /><br />Audio File 2 - 6 There's a really nice build through these early audio files. King establishes a voice for the first person protagonist that is unique (and not merely the writer). He's helped considerably by explaining the Carny slang which is used throughout the book. Michael Kelly's does a nice job making the slang flow easily. Dev says goodbye to his girlfriend and then his father. Some might be tempted to say the deer sighting is hackneyed until one spots a deer. King's description of the \\"moment\\" was quite familiar to me. Nice job. I loved the first description of Easterbrook, Joyland's owner. King paints a picture. The scene were Dev finally wears the fur to begin his Carny metamorphosis is a lot of fun and well delivered by Michael Kelly. Suiting up  before going in was just excellent.a picture. The scene were Dev finally wears the fur to begin his Carny metamorphosis is a lot of fun and well delivered by Michael Kelly. Suiting up  before going in was just excellent.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|It's neat to see another group that's been around a long time really evolve their sounds. It's not going after the latest trend, but trendsetting. They are some cool samples, a few retro-pop tracks and overall just a fun album to listen to end to end.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I really like this app.  I did not realize how much easier the app makes shopping on Ebay.  Highly recommend this app!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Great film! Dialog is well done. Filmed as if certain frames are paintings. An interesting vision of the history without losing Site of plot of the movie.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book kept my attention, but I'm not sure that it was worth it.  I had high hopes for this book, but was a little let down.  It has good insight to mental illness, but it was a little confusing for me at times.  After reading it, I wish I wouldn't have spent $5 on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is very great for kids adult and family.this Is a nice relaxing game that involves competition and has ongoing missions.I encourage everyone to get it no!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is outstanding! I wasn't expecting it to just change. The characters are great and hard to unlock. The unlimited characters are very special. I love the power ups, how you move, and the hover bloated. The creaters of subway surfer should make the challenges harder, add more challenges, and make collecting weekly character tokens a bit easier.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Great cd! I listen to it often.... It's in my iPod, in my car, and in my house. Sweater weather turned me on to them now Afraid is my favorite by them....tho they are all good songs.
B009NY43NY|5.0|loved it  too bad not many more coming, couldn't wait for the next one to come out  maybe there will be spin offs
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Interesting show, city and rural life, good comparison, actors make this more real, easy going, watch it with family, enjoy!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We also have episode 1 , and during off season we watch an episode almost every night. We are still intrigued by the thought that goes into the stories. Awesome!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|terrific music from the movie's soundtrack, makes you want to hear more from these musicians, great voices, excellent song writers
B005CAATXG|5.0|I love this band i got it a day after i ordered it I highly recommend getting this CD u should order some cookies yum
B0018O4YT0|5.0|This video goes on a lot of peoples lists as unknown which is a crime if you love Sci Fy and great love stories you need to watch this movie it has a great cast script and direction this is also a great family movie I'm purposely not trying to tell you much about this movie to pique your curiosity you will not be disappointed I want you to watch it and judge for yourselves
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|loved it loved it loved it. what else is there to say. thank you amazon for a wonderful transaction.<br />take it to the limits baby
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Skyfall was a good movie.  It was filled with action.  However, the best James Bond ever was still Sean Connery.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|what a waste of my money. For all the spectacular settings and visionary designs, Cloud Atlas left me feeling disconnected
B001HDWKMA|4.0|I listened to all of the sampler files for the album and felt everything sounded wuite nice.  this is a soulful album with softer sounds of lament and not much not the driving angst of songs like &#34;How Come&#34; off his first album.  It makes good ambiance music for work or reading.  Ray is great and this makes 3 of his albums that I have.  Cheers,
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Now, it has nothing to do with me being in love with Liam Nisson, but he acted his character very well. Made he wish he was my father! The script is very well written. \\"A very particular set of skills,\\" indeed!
193700788X|1.0|Honestly, this book is so uncharacteristic of the series I'm going to pretend I never read it. I can make up an ending myself, and that would be more satisfying than Harris' last three or four novels combined.<br />I don't think authors OWE their readers anything, but come on, don't play us for fools. Yes, Harris, you have created Sookie's universe, but we have been along for the ride also. You contradict the most basic rules of the world you made to justify and support what you deem to be a resolution to the series.<br />I feel the biggest shame is that the author has betrayed her very own characters to make a quick buck.<br />If I had known this novel was the finale for the buildup from the past three novels, I would have finished the series at novel 8.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|One of the worst cases of torture documented. The first time I had seen this, I was aghast by under what conditions a human being can be exposed to and survive. Billy Hayes displays true courage and strength under unbearable circumstances. The audience will be horrified at what horrific incident will be coming next.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is addictive and fun to play. I especially like the sound effects.  I like to play this game after a stressful day since it doesn't take a lot of thinking and it's a low stress game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have never read anything by Landay, but Defending Jacob was an entertaining and intriguing read. It was much more than just your basic murder mystery, and it contained some thought-provoking elements that made the book very interesting.
0553386794|5.0|I became addicted to this series just like everyone else after starting the show. Its infuriating and wonderful all at the same time.
B00CRW2066|5.0|This is one of those rare albums where you can easily listen to the entire thing without having to skip through lesser songs. In fact, there are no &#34;lesser songs&#34; on this album. Every song is worth listening to.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of The National, you will not be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're not familiar with them, this is a great album to start with. Buy it!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is the best for allowing me to open a PDF file with ease.  I don't know why you would use anything else.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this every day, sometimes more.<br />Very useful and it's free.<br />I recommend it to everyone who has a android phone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the best app for reading classics (all FREE!). Easy to use and just what a teacher needs during summer break.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm only 40% done and I don't even want to continue. This was porn wrapped up as a book. After book 2 that had me hanging by a thread I had such high hopes for this book. I am so disappointed I waited for this, for nothing!  And after reading everyone's review I'm glad  to see other people are feeling short changed too.  I'm tired of these books being spread out with no substance in the middle books. See I don't even want to go back and read, that's why I'm writing this review. I'm returning for my money back, I'm not paying to read how many time they want his man part inside of her.<br />Sylvia needs to rewrite this and actually write a story! It felt like Never Too Far by Abbi Glines! We want romance and chemistry and dialogue!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the timed version. It continues to keep you on your toes because these symbols all look very much alike
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am so thankful that I read this book at this time in my life (pre-kids, early thirties, making some important decisions about my future). Sheryl is inspiring, thought provoking and entertaining! I can't stop talking about this book, all of my friends are sick of hearing me continue to quote it....but it's that good.
B003VW8GT6|5.0|With the cast list you might think it would be pure camp, but the actors do a magnificent job and even though I can't think of another western - certainly not of this period especially - that my husband or I like, we can watch this one over and over.
B005723JSQ|4.0|an easy beach read. light and fluffy. a good read for a plane ride, you could probably finish it in a few hours.
B00B9EQS98|5.0|No problem with this disk at all.  Much better alternative then the $30+ you ll pay for a &#34;special edition&#34; that has extra footage you ll never watch.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle, my phone, my computer and in Chrome. it is indispensable and absolutely clutch.  I am 100% in love with this app. Been singing its praises for 3 years already. One of the first apps I download on any device.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Utility apps like replacement calendars and email programs need account access.  Not some silly binary search game.<br /><br />Passing on this one.
1892005034|5.0|Great book in terms of what to do to bring peace to yourself and others.<br />Its got many useful examples which makes the learning and practicing more efficient
B003YFJ5U4|4.0|The subject has always fascinated me and being Danish and knowing that the Dansk scientist Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein debated this subject 100 years ago. I have to say that all the formulas were a bit over my head. I had really bought the book for historical reasons but got bogged down i the technical. I have a knowledge from long ago about the understanding of Quantum physics related to consciousness via the VEDAS. Anyway I enjoyed it and it made me look for more information on Wikipedia, so it is  worth reading even for the lay person.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I love this series! Great entertainment and love the storylines.  I am now on season 3 and loving that also
B00AKFG15S|3.0|This is not as well written or constructed as were the previous two books in the Chronicles. There was almost a sense that the author had been under pressure to complete it in a hurry. The characters had less body than previously and the plot lacked plausibility. I trust that the great story-teller will do better with number 4.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|2013-06-05
B004MYFV0O|4.0|I ordered this book on my Kindle and I usually take a lesson a day and just practice with it.  The pictures are very clear and easy to understand.  He does give you the link to his webpage where you can watch his animated art lessons which is helpful.  I learned a lot of basic art instruction by going through this book that will translate to other drawing that I do.  A nice book that can be used for an adult or a younger artist, but not for children.  His website would be better suited for that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover,  Keep the books coming!  I have loved every book she has written.  What a great story about what a family will do to protect their loved ones and how love lost will find its way back to you.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Fun game, very creative... but too short. It needs more levels. I am disappointed that i finished it so quickly.<br />And contrary to other reviews, it worked fine on my kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've been searching hard for a fun horse app that is both easy to understand and fun to play, as well as offers more to do then just racing,and this game is it! I adore playing it.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|i love cozies! i have enjoyed the first three of the books in this series. light entertainment, interesting characters, perfect for a summer's read.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is a lot of fun, and managed to guess a Japanese singer and NASCAR driver for me, amongst many others. It's great to play with friends, too.<br /><br />No problems with this app at all on Kindle Fire 1st gen.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Michael Buble's new album showcases a mix of songs and styles. His voice and ability to deliver a song is unquestionably incredible, but the songs themselves really didn't excite me on this one. His forte is singing standards with a big band and while I understand his need to do other material, he could have found some better tunes.
B0053R1QXU|4.0|Starts out a bit slow but then pics up speed.  A great cast and Al Pacino gives a fantastic performance.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This book was just as good as the first two. Jeffry Archer leaves you hanging waiting for the next book. I'm only sorry that I have to wait a whole year to see what happens next.
B00CE004XM|5.0|With their sophomore effort Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa bring it! Highlights?  &#34;I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know&#34; and &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; Enjoy!
B000IDEORY|5.0|I remember going to see this in the theater when it was first released, and I never tire of watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are awesome together.
B001F12J48|1.0|I was very dissapointed in this DVD, the quality of DVD was very bad and could not even view it. A waste of money on this one.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Couldn't put the book down! Can't wait for the next book I the series! Great read, great book, amazing, amazing!
1416583432|5.0|This is the first book I have ever read about dog behavior that is based on scientific observation. If you love dogs you will love this book.
B005HSL626|5.0|I watched him play, tried it out, then downloaded it myself. Progressively &#34;difficult&#34; and keeps you on your toes. At a low level, the music's pretty cool.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Ryan Lewis & Macklemore are superb artists and I cannot wait to see them go even farther and change the music scene. I can listen to this album over and over and over... they have a sense of humor but also talk about serious things, important things that I think every man and woman face in their lives at one time or another. LOVE IT!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|For myself this game has been ridiculously addictive. I have a few games dl'ed on my Kindle but other than WWF this takes the cake for a fast game that I can play by myself at any time!!!!
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|Happy Feet is great and it has rhythm. Great for little kids, but I even forced my mom to watch it because it has all the Oldies that she would recognize haha. Good show and good message!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It catches you from the first page, I could not put it down, I'm looking foward to reading the remaining two books of this trilogy, amaizing!
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|no real guide on how to play so you just have to hope you do your best.  you hit on items but nothing moves so it is now in the cloud
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting. Everyone plays it and sometimes people even try to fight over my tablet just to play it lol. It may be hard to get used to at first but when you get the hang of it you wont want to put it down.
B0064QNS62|3.0|this might not be as good as mario but it comes in a close second.  I haven't made it very far but trying to stay on the ladders take a skill I have to master.
0307352153|4.0|I like the analytical parts of the book, but didn't realize that it was kind of a self-help book as well.  I found some of her descriptions of introversion very helpful, particularly, the fear of mingling in large crowds with alot of unknown people, and the fear of public speaking.  I am a professor, and am an excellent writer, but I dread giving presentations.  I wish there had been more on how to get over that fear, which I see as my biggest obstacle to success.  Also, I think she essentializes introverts and extatroverts a bit too much, such as her description of the married couple.  I am an introvert when it comes to large groups, but very outspoken and feisty with people I know, and rarely withdraw into my shell when in the middle of a disagreement, but tend to like to fight it out (often to my detriment).  Not sure how that fits with her model.  I guess it was a bit more self-promotional than I had expected, but there were certainly parts that were valuable.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|this one has lots for it.  the towns and other layout can really hide the numbers that goodness for the hint button.
B009YN2M7S|1.0|It is so boring I am having a hard time getting into  it. It reminds me of a lame movie on lifetime.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I have up loaded all the game from playrix but they do get harder as they go.  this one at least has a plot to it.  the more you go the more you can try to get ahead of the guys trying to stop you.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It took me a while to get to this film but I'm so glad I did. I'm not usually a fan of chick flicks or romantic comedies but the unique premise and rave review &#34;silver linings&#34; got had me curious. Not only did it live up to expectations, it was easily the best romantic film I've seen, partly because it explored the romance in a realistic context and acknowledged a sweet family dynamic as well. The blend of poignancy and humor is very well balanced and the performances are phenomenal. Jennifer Lawrence absolutely deserved all her awards, but Bradley Cooper was also a real surprise, he shattered the &#34;eye candy&#34; or blandly interesting attractive lead mold he usually occupies and gave a very convincing and vulnerable portrayal as a man suffering from what can be a debilitating illness. The supporting roles were also incredibly well played, there was not a single weak link in this cast and it was refreshing to see Robert De Niro in a role that matched his caliber. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has not yet seen it.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Big fan of Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crow. Interesting twist in film. Catherine Zeta Jones is the consummate actress as always.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read the first two books and couldn't wait for this one to come out. There were so many questions left from book 2 that I wanted answers to and I am happy to say they were answered.<br /><br />Gidion and Eva still have their work cut out for them and it seems everyone is always against them. They can never just have a quit happy week. Everyone wants a piece. And no one wants them together. I was happy to see this did not stop them from what they wanted. And they are strong for each other.<br /><br />Once again we are left with more questions. Always leave us wanting more and I will be waiting again for the next book. Hopefully not so long this time.<br /><br />Enjoy! I did.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The third book in the Crossfire series picks up right where the last book left off.  We see Eva and Gideon struggle to work through their issues.  Their commitment to each other is stronger than ever though and we see their trust of each other finally take hold. However, there is so much extra, unnecessary drama that as I approached the end of the book I just knew there was to be a 4th (and 5th) book in the series.  There are just too many lose ends that left me hanging.  I also felt that by the end I found myself disliking Eva more than I love her and that makes me a little sad. I know many people are angry that there will be more books, and I admit that I am frustrated as well, but I will most likely end up reading the rest of the books since I cannot go without knowing what happens to Gideon and Eva.

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|wow awesome movie  the acting was phenomenal  i even got myboyfriend to watch it with me on a Saturday night.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Just finished reading ENTWINED WITH YOU..I was so excited and I am completely disappointed. Nothing has been resolved and everything is drawn out...painfully so. It is like this circle that never ends and the book just needs an ending. A door has been opened up with Cary and his pregnant Girlfriend and then Eva's parents slept together...i just want my money back. All $30 I have spent on these three books. I am soooo disgusted right now. And then the authors note at the end of the book... says something like...\\"Well as you see this can't possibly be the end so we will see where this goes...\\" This book should have been condensed and rid of the stupid drawn out stuff and made this the end of the \\"trilogy\\"...that still means three, right?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I must say I enjoyed book 3 of this series and finished it on one day. READ IT! However, I was disappointed that the series has been drawn out yet again! Of course I will wait anxiously for book 4, but enough is enough. The book was HOT and moved quickly, but it seemed the best of the content was in the last third of the book. The one real plus is that Day has deepened the supporting characters setting up what I hope will be a great addition to the series. Maybe next time a warning that the series will be drawn out into more than 3 books I wouldn't have been disappointed in the end.
193700788X|2.0|A must read if you have read the rest but very disappointed in the ending. Leaves you hanging about the future of some characters and others are nearly absent from the whole book.  Honestly it seems as if this book was written by a ghost writer.  It is not true CH fashion.  Characters were demolished did things they would never have done after they way they were built up in other books.  Horrible book not worth the money even to complete a collection.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I always wanted to write this book.  As passionate as I am on this topic often could not hold my interest. Like a text book in college.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved it!!! You can tell that the characters have grown so much.  There is still some more to be told about them, all of them.  There was just some kind of peace to the book.  The scenes were steamy but I was more focus on the plot and characters.  Well done Sylvia Day well done!! Can not wait till the next book and see where it ends.

0307279189|2.0|The book reads like a long GQ article, it's interesting well written and mostly made up.  The author eats salad for breakfast which is better than pancakes and syrup.  And now he can run down deer but make sure you don't actually eat the meat.  The author makes the claim that the mexican tribe are all natural runners, well if you lived in the middle of nowhere with no stores and had to run to buy the most basic of items you would be a great runner too and oh your life expectancy would be 45.<br /><br />10 years ago it was Chi running now, it's barefoot running, 10 years from now it will bea  different fad.  Here is the magic bullet get off your ass go outside and run and don't eat 3 hamburgers a day.  Forget about the magic drinks or salad for breakfasts for whatever the latest fad is.  Just enjoy yourself and you will have great results.

B00BC24NT4|4.0|Engaging plot, though as with other of his recent novels, le Carre does have an axe to grind.  An engrossing read, nonetheless.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Very timely. Awesome graphics. Looks amazing on the 54&#34; Plasma. I can't wait to see the other seasons, and am excited to hear they will re do DS9 and Voyager! Can't wait for those.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Bridging over 4 decades, LeCarre is always topical, current and amazingly prescient. Whether its about 'collateral damage', faulty intelligence, corporate immorality or governmental hypocrisy its hard to find a false note. From Moscow to Berlin, from London to Gibraltar, from the Mid East to Africa his view of events, current or past, always open new insights. His portraits of the human condition reveal unexpected depths while offering unique takes on why people act the way they do. Being an American, I find his British take on the world, on class, on education and on 'the cousins' fascinating. I purchase everything he writes, am never disappointed, and actually reread them periodically- something  I rarely do with other authors. Russia House, Smiley's People, The Honorable Schoolboy, The Little Drummer Girl, Constant Gardner, The Tailor of Panama, etc, etc.- provide great reading, good history and a disturbing look at how things really happen while we are being distracted from the truth.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I researched these phones a lot for several days before I bought them. They seemed to be the most reviewed, best rated, best reviewed phones out there in that price range. Listening to music in these phones is like sitting in the very back row of the stadium. The music seems far away - not up close and present. It is clear and well balanced but I'm afraid I'm going to blow my ears out due to the volume needed to get the music to a level where I can actually hear things. The bass is heavier than my near-field studio monitors so I can't trust them for mixing. They might be fine for tracking - I haven't tried that yet. I don't know why they wouldn't work for laying down tracks. You don't need $4,000 phones for that.<br /><br />All in all, I'm a little disappointed but I guess in this price range they are fine.

B008220BLG|4.0|Warm Bodies is an interesting variation on the zombie genre, with the zombies communicating with one another and the normal people holed up in a walled part of the city.  A teen zombie eats a guy's brains and then has the thoughts and feelings of the deceased towards a teen girl who had been the girlfriend.  They forge an unlikely romantic relationship and must guard against her father, a militant anti-zombie killer.
B00B4JIVOS|5.0|This is definitely one of the best metal albums this year. In Vain has really outdone themselves. Highly recommended for all progressive metal fans.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|This unusual story concerns two little girls who lose their father and mother and are raised by a ghost in a forest cabin until they are found and adopted by their uncle and his wife.  This is not the average slasher where blood abounds; it's more about tragic love and loss.  Great performances especially by the two youngest.

B0031TZ9VW|2.0|This &#34;book&#34; is actually a short story.  One of McEwan's most disappointing so far.  Didn't experience his usual wonderful writing style at all - was waiting for it to flourish and it never did.  A bit like the story.<br /><br />Would not recommend it to a real McEwan fan, or to someone new to the author.  Sorry Ian.  Try again.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|based on true story<br />value of self respect and education<br />from the Bay Area<br />great acting<br />importance of hard work
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It sees my router. In a crowded area it gives a decent visual representation of which connection is strongest.<br />One more word required.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|To say I was disappointed in the ending of this book would be putting it mildly. As so many others have said, this series was advertised as a trilogy so when it appeared on my Kindle, I thought I was getting the ending as it was the third book in a trilogy. To then get to the nonending and find a note \\"Yes, dear reader, you're right. This can't possibly be the end. Gideon and Eva's journey isn't quite finished yet\\" and to hear that the trilogy has turned into a series of 5, I feel like I was promised one thing and given quite another.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, after waiting 8 months since the last book came out, I found myself quite lost when I first started reading so I ended up going back to the second book and at least skimming the last quarter of it or so to catch up.  With so much time in between, I felt like there should have been at least a short summary of where we were.<br /><br />Ms. Day and her publishers are going to have to hire their own Eva Tramell to put enough spin on this one.  Book 4 doesn't even yet have a title or a release date (at least not ones they're sharing with the public) so I'm guessing that a good many readers will have simply put Gideon and Eva in the backs of their minds or created their own happily ever after for them long before then. I don't know why it changed from a trilogy to a longer series. I've heard hints of money. It may also be due to the author's missing of deadlines (which I saw somewhere). Regardless, I think damage control in the way of an explanation and a hard date for book 4 is the least they should do if they want to sell more books to us.<br /><br />That being said, I did quite enjoy what I did read, unable to put the book down and finishing it in just one evening. I just wish the disappointment in the ending and furthering of the series didn't have to dampen my review.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really like the idea behind this show. Acting is good and plots are twisty. Looking forward to season three soon.
B00846REIS|2.0|Unless you truly enjoy being left hanging, I advise not starting this series until all the books are written. I fell in love with this book on the first read, couldn't wait until the second and third in the trilogy came out, even preordering so I could be one of the first to read them. I loved book 2 as much as the first and even loved book 3... until the end. Someone has decided that this series will no longer contain three books as originally stated, but rather 5 (or at least 4). The ending of book 3 leaves the reader hanging and with no date for book 4 in sight, left a bad taste in my mouth and many others (just read the reviews for book 3).  So, unless you are prepared to wait, perhaps forever, for the ending, I suggest reading other books until ALL the books for this series are complete and released.

1402790546|5.0|_Bomber_ is a fictional account of 24 hours in the night bombing campaign of World War 2.  Deighton interweaves multiple stories that touch on all aspects of the campaign: the pilots on both sides; the German civilians, firefighters, and soldiers on the ground; support staff and families back in Britain. _Bomber_ is terrifying, heartwrenching, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />One of the very best war novels, on a par with _The Cruel Sea_ and _Life and Fate_.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|I must admit, my initial reaction when I saw this album was mixed.  Like many have stated with their reviews, it is a different chapter for AIC.  So I will say first that I still miss Layne.  With that out of the way, this album rocks.  The vocal harmonization are authentic AIC, dark and haunting.  I am surprised that AIC still has the gritty energy that set them apart from many of their peers.  Highly recommended.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|A pretty cute movie all in all. Good cast. J-Lo is always good. Some real out loud laughs. I liked it!
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Of all the comebacks to have been mounted in the 2000s, perhaps no one had to fight harder than Alice In Chains. Moving on without a frontman is always a challenge, but especially so when said frontman is thought to be the heart and soul of your band. It didn't matter to fans that guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell was essentially the core of the group's sound from the get-go, for without Layne at the forefront, it was a dicey proposition. Imagine everyone's surprise when their 2009 effort, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue,\\" was actually a smashing success, both creatively and commercially. The band had seamlessly integrated newbie William DuVall into the fold while retaining their signature flavor and keeping with the times. Now, four years later, they aim to work that magic all over again with a long-awaited follow-up.<br /><br />While \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" worked so hard to earn its place, its follow-up -- the amusingly-titled \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" -- has only to sit back and reap the benefits. Perhaps then that's why AIC 2.0's second affair is a bit disappointing by comparison upon its first listen. Alice In Chains circa 2013 -- Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney, bassist Mike Inez and vocalist William DuVall -- simply don't have anything left to prove. Rather than ensuring that every song touches on what its audience thinks an Alice In Chains song should sound like, Cantrell and company instead focus on slowly gestating jams that reveal subtle nuances upon repeated listening, rather than delivering an onslaught of instant emotion and adrenaline. Even the radio-ready opening jam, \\"Hollow,\\" sounds creaky by comparison to the likes of \\"Check My Brain,\\" which isn't necessarily a bad thing. While \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" was an instant hit, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is indeed a grower.<br /><br />If nothing else, the guys certainly put their all into crafting this album. At 12 tracks deep and over an hour long, there is not a single moment wasted. With Nick Raskulinecz (Deftones, Rush) once again at the helm, Alice In Chains continue to chip away at their craft, offering a peak into the progression the band's original line-up could have achieved had they survived the '90s. The album as a whole is less hooky and the songs sound more like dirges than hit singles. Doom and gloom permeates through the title track and its none-too-subtle chorus, pitting the listener into what can only be described as Alice In Chains' abyss. Likewise, \\"Phantom Limb\\" -- the album's only written contribution from DuVall -- stands out from the pack as being a brutally ominous and yet utterly decadent exercise in sludgy riffage and arena-style drumming. \\"Lab Monkey\\" is an equally dark number that harkens back to the band's early hit, \\"Man In The Box,\\" complete with talk-box and all, while \\"Scalpel\\" updates the AIC oeuvre with a slight hint of honky-tonk influence.<br /><br />If one had to sum up the essence of this album, they could refer to it a Alice In Chains' progressive phase. Not everything here will click instantly and the keen ear is rewarded for return visits. Once it sinks in a bit, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" really rises to the surface. Fans who can put their allegiance to the line-up that made \\"Dirt\\" aside will find themselves grinning from ear to ear before long. Nobody does it like Alice In Chains does it, and the glut on inferior clones that sprung up in the 2000s stand in stark contrast to the real deal. While not a perfect album, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is certainly worth digging deep into. Just be sure to ditch your preconceived notions in the dirt.kulinecz (Deftones, Rush) once again at the helm, Alice In Chains continue to chip away at their craft, offering a peak into the progression the band's original line-up could have achieved had they survived the '90s.

0307877523|5.0|I am very impressed by this book, though its message is disheartening. Whether the argument turns out to be right or not, it is elegant and beautifully explained. But there's a real problem with the audiobook. Every time the reader hits the word \\"causal\\" (which is often, as you might imagine), he pronounces it \\"casual.\\" Every single time. It's probably quite confusing to someone who doesn't know what word is intended.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|You get the same quality entertainment with this series as with Downton Abbey!  Two small British villages, Lark Rise, whose people have to labor hard to feed their families, and Candleford, a little step up materially and socially.  The interaction between the villages and their \\"folk\\" provide stories that pull you in and keep you looking forward to the next one.  Absolutely one of the best series from across the sea!
193700788X|1.0|Save yours instead and read something more interesting. I knew it was going to disappoint but wanted to complete the whole series. Sookie is dead forever after.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this little book!  The illustrations are very cute and funny as well!  Great motivation for potty training!
B000NDDHG8|5.0|I got the original Australian album even though I'm not Australian. It's great. I wanted to see the very beginning of AC/DC. I highly recommend the Australian album. This is also my all-time favorite AC/DC album.
B009NX50DM|2.0|Never finished the movie. Just a bit to dated and uninteresting. I like Michael Cane but not in this  movie.
B00886XQO0|5.0|When I went on my search for a new gaming/general headset I struck gold. I am able to use it with: PC, Xbox, PS3, Wii, TV, and Bluetooth on my phone. Pretty much anything. I could probably even do it with my DJ setup. If you are needing to find a catch all in regards to a headset, this is the one.
B000I0QL82|5.0|One of the greatest Holiday Movies of all time.  It really doesn't get much better than Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.  Some claim the &#34;follow up&#34;, White Christmas is better (it is really good), but for my money this is the one.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's an alarm clock you can take anywhere you go.  It aways wakes you up and you never worry about sleeping in. Love it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive game. Works very well on the Kindle fire HD. Graphics are very crisp and the response time is immediate. Highly recommended.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A very unusual and gripping story. I liked the style and genuineness of it. Can relate to feelings of the parents and their children.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|We Love the Eagles.  We really enjoyed the History of the Eagles all the new things we learned about them.
B0018OFN2W|4.0|Worth the watch - just good fun to watch Paul Walker and Tyrese mix it up and give us all another good ride.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love the BBC! Most of thier shows are on point.Can't wait for the next season. I'm glad it's on Amazon!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big bright easy to see and use format. It's everything I need.<br /><br />Now, please take your considerable design talents to  get me a decent CALENDAR since all the ones I've tried really are lacking in one aspect or another.<br />Thanks
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I'm undecided about this one. it's too much like a camera for pictures rather than documents. I would neither recommend nor trash it. For me it's okay'
B008MJLGWC|5.0|My son was so very thrilled when we founf Deadpool action figure online. He has it in the box still and plans to keep it that way.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Probably the most varied Megadeth record ever. This album seems to have a piece of something from every era of the band. I think it comes out great. So it's not hyper tempo thrash from beginning to end, so what? That's been done how many times? The only complaint I have is some of the very simple lyrics in the song Burn. It's still classic Megadeth to me; political, critical, but not preachy. Don't go in expecting Megadeth circa '88 and you'll enjoy it.
B000I8G5B2|3.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel and so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD or its features.<br /><br />I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies and this movie definitely has its moments. For one thing it does succeed as a sort of a mood piece about a genetically engineered future where everyone looks like they're from the pages of GQ or High Society magazine rather than the 4F Quarterly. There's a dark, sinister, conspiratorial atmosphere that hangs like a toxic miasma over the whole film. That much came off well. But one problem with this future society comprised of genetically superior humans is that they're all self-absorbed, narcissistic twits who aren't very sympathetic  as characters. There are also significant holes in the plot which just aren't explained, such as the fact that  Jude Law's character has absolutely no motivation to help Ethan Hawke's character.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke's character is obsessed with going into space. Why this is so important really isn't explained (except that if he misses this opportunity there won't be another one in his lifetime). Maybe he's trying to escape this future society where although western style capitalism seems to have prevailed, the society itself has all the charm of a dreary, lockstep, Stalinist gulag. LOL<br /><br />I recently watched the movie again after a hiatus of many years and the best part of the film for me was the irony of seeing the patristic,  high brow, haute culture Gore Vidal (now that he's passed on) with a role in a sci-fi movie. Personally, I would have had him play a Myra Breckonridge type character just for laughs. I think the old rou&eacute; would have gone for it. :-)<br /><br />I also applaud a sci-fi movie that relies more on a traditional plot and story line to carry the film rather than lots of special effects. So overall, an okay but not great sci-fi movie which does have its moments.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If you are a fan of Joe, this has to be in your collection. Excellent sound quality done by a guitar master.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD or its features.<br /><br />At over 3000 reviews I'm not sure I can add anything except to say that I actually enjoyed the movie despite its many faults, but then I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies. It's basically a visually spectacular movie but with a cheesy plot that would be an embarrassment in a comic book aimed at 10 year olds. It's as if someone gave Ed Wood 100 million bucks to make a sci-fi movie, if you get my drift. For that amount of money you get a movie with incredible special effects, settings, and backdrops but with a plot only slightly more sophisticated than Wood's \\"Z\\" movie studio's  \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space,\\" widely considered by cult movie fans to be the cheesiest movie ever made. And this from Ridley Scott. It's actually pretty mind-boggling if you think about it. LOL<br /><br />And before I get flamed let me state that I'm usually a big fan of Ridley Scott and his movies. I can't wait to see if he does the same thing with The Deep. :-)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was the movie promo that sent me to read the book.  I still haven't seen the movie, and I might not.  I often don't if I have become attached to the characters in my imagination; somehow it doesn't usually match up on the screen.  I love stories featuring quirky and sometimes deeply painful human relationships and family dynamics; where there is a decision to love despite obstacles and characters triumph over adversity.  This book satisfies on all counts.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I was initially a little reluctant to watch this since the premise sounded kind of stupid even though I'm a long time science fiction fan but I kept reading good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's actually an intelligent show and the acting by Tatiana Maslany is phenomenal.  I went from skeptical to a full blown addict within two episodes.  I can't recommend this show highly enough.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok, so before I bought this book I read a lot of reviews.  I was surprised at how many were low ratings.  It took me about a day to read through the book but that was only because I kept getting interrupted.  To be completely honest it was not the best out of the three but I was okay with that as I didn't expect it to be.  I didn't go into this book with low expectations only realistic ones.<br />In this book there is a lot more alone time between Gideon and Eva which I loved, loved, loved!  We got to see the more intimate side of their relationship.  We also got to see how the outside world affect it too.  Eva is much more of a patient person than I ever would be.  The interactions between Gideon and his ex's specifically Corrine was a bit much.  I could not wrap my mind around his need to appease her.  So they had a relationship way back when?  So she is still in love with him, we'll who wouldn't be?  So she is completely unstable?  Why oh why is it Gideon's job to fix her?  Let her go already!  If you are so in love with Eva and she is literally every breath you take then how can you care so much about a psychotic bitch like Corrine?  He becomes aware of the fact that she was/is trying to come between him and Eva so why allow it to happen?  Eva is way too understanding for me.  She had every right to reel him in and put an end to that &#34;friendship&#34; so I am not sure why she didn't.<br />Now for Cary.....ugh!!!  In this book we see much more of Cary but I don't know if it is a good thing or not.  What I see of him I don't like.  I hate what he is doing to Trey.  I wish he would figure out his life.  Trey or Tatiana...which is it?  I vote Trey!!!<br />Now for the really good stuff.....another book!  I am really hoping that we have seen the last of Corrine. I know we haven't seen the last of Tatiana (no matter how hard I want her gone).  What about Brett?  And I have a funny feeling we might get to meet Anne Lucas......maybe????<br />So there you have it in a nutshell.  I liked this book.  Would I recommend it?  Yes.<br />Good job Sylvia!!!!nutshell.  I liked this book.  Would I recommend it?  Yes.<br />Good job Sylvia!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a pleasure to play all the time. It would be nice if I didn't have to play on line all the time though. Other then that love playing this game
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The book was difficult to read at times as a mother, but very interesting given the events in Ohio. Couldn't put it down and read it in a day.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game.It's so addictive and fun! I recommend this game for kids/adults between the ages of 5 and 25.
0439023521|5.0|This book is excellent.  It is a quick read and the move is does the book justice.  Great read for child and adults.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|The main character, Diana, has got to be the most annoying character in any book ever. This might have been a fairly good story otherwise. She is supposed to be a PHD and in perfect shape, running and rowing miles a day, but she has to be carried up a flight of stairs, the classic damsel in distress that keeps having to be saved by her boyfriend. To be even more annoying, she tempts fate all the time to get into more situations where she has to be saved by her boyfriend and carried up the stairs.  Let me tell you when she went on the hunt with her vampire boyfriend and she was telling the stag it should sacrifice itself to him, I would have been so happy if he drank all her blood instead.  Oh, wait, she wants to be turned into a vampire so maybe I wouldn't be.  I wasted $13 on the Kindle version of this book.  I won't be reading the other two of the trilogy.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The final book in the series.<br />Love it, but would have wanted another ending. Didn't disappoint, but would rather it be different.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|It really is a great compilation and I enjoyed a lot the reading plus listening experience. It is a well thought selection, varied an well performed. Ideal for classical music lovers, like me...if you read the \\"Fifty Shades\\" saga, it's perfect...if you have not, it is still excellent music. And maybe spikes your curiosity to read the books!!
B004QBWU02|5.0|A must to own in your video library.  Be sure to watch the directors cut for more enjoyment.  Get it before its no longer in production.
034580404X|4.0|Very good reading material, enjoyable...good quality impression, you have to handle with care in  case of the paperback edition.  Very thin book covers. Maybe the hardcover works better.<br />I received my books  overseas and the enclosing case  came with a little damage. Maybe the shipping and handling/packaging  could be improved.<br />A good buy.
6305882592|5.0|A must to own in your video library.  Be sure to watch the directors cut for more enjoyment.  Get it before its no longer in production.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't want to give any spoilers, so I'll be careful.  Basically, I was really please with this book because it managed to give final recognition and closure to all my favorite characters without becoming entirely about &#34;happily ever after&#34; stories.  The mystery was still compelling and kept me guessing.  I did manage to guess how to Sookie romantic arc ended but I didn't feel like it was forced or shoehorned in at the last minute or nonsensical; it all felt genuine.  If you enjoyed this series, as I did, you will definitely like this last installment.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great fun.Got for my toddlers but ended up playing myself.Music is really relaxing.Fun game,graphics are awesome.Would recommend for players of every age.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm glad that I read the other reviews to this book after I read it.  I actually liked the set up for a fourth book.  There were parts where I wasn't sure if I liked the direction of where  things were going, but all in all I did like the book and can't wait for the next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun. Great on roadtrips, and the best hit off of Temple Run ive seen. Everyone should get this amazing app!
B001KZG99A|5.0|It was a fun movie. The good wins. This is what I like to see. He was amusingly arrogant. Liked
B0090KZDSK|3.0|That is so mean!  What a way to end.  We were made to wait so long and this happens ... So very disappointing.  The story did seem a bit mild and rushed .. and too much time spent describing the sex .. We get it, ok!<br /><br />I hope the next book steps it up more.  But great to get this out the way as it was a looooooong wait!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Rented it and watched it with the family.  It is really a nice fun, romp.  I remember all the old games and the references to them are a nice bonus.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|With great imagination, John Grisham pulls you in with this fascinating tale of injustice and retribution.  It's a quick read and I was sorry it was finished.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would recommend this book to all my friends. We read it for my book club and everyone loved it. Great story and written so well. I got attached to the characters and was sorry when the book ended. I hope this author is busy writing her next book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent in every respect. Very accurate presentation of a bygone era of history. The characters are so diverse and colorful.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is the best game ever I like the weapons and characters u can choose from, and it should truly be a five star game, and it crashes sometimes, other than dat this is the best game ever.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Great story. Well done. Good acting and decent surf footage, would have liked a little more surfing. Was worries about the \\"cheese factor\\" but they did a good job of not getting too cliche.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was skeptical about the premise, but this show is very well done. I have very much enjoyed this seaason
B008602KQI|5.0|Can't wait for part 2. I'm hungry to see what happens next. Can't imagine what they have planned for the winning couple.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book really wasn't that bad and really wasn't amazingly good. But in between. I was engaged in ready and story line was great,but I'm just not sure that the reasons were structured well. But a great effort for approaching a subject that has become a problem.
0385738781|4.0|A thrilling action packed ending to the series can't wait to read the prequel and see how it all began.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I love all of Jane Austen books and any movies that are based on them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories and romance
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Does not come close to the first two book in the trilogy. The writing was flat and unless he is going to do another book the end left you hanging.  Not the usual Archer unique writing. It will be a while before I return to him since he seems to have run out of gas on this one.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love the variety.<br />You will not get bored with this one too quickly. So many different puzzles to pick from.
B00005RRG9|4.0|One of my favorite \\"feel good\\" movies and especially like Maureen O'Hara and Brien Keith.  The entire cast is great. And, of course, Haley Mills is terrific.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles are timeless.  They play music for all generations.  I have many concert DVD's since I do not go out much with two small children and this is one of our favorites.  They sounded great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it is a cool game. I like the characters.I like the surfboards. It is fun when you earn enough coins then you get changed to a new city.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|If you love the Eagles, this is a must have item, so, I suggest you get it before it's history.
1401235425|5.0|One of the best batman books I've ever read. Adds new mythology to an already dense universe and still manages to surprise.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|As European I bought this blue ray, and yesterday I set down for a enjoyable evening with my birthday present.<br /><br />Wrong zone!!!  I need zone B and this one is a zone A.  Knew DVD's use to had this problem, but I've never realized that that was still the case with blue rays...<br /><br />So I can't see it.  I threw away € 46!!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Now, the CD doesn't say anywhere on it that it is, but according to the windows media player, it is actually an HDCD.<br />This may of course just be the bonus version I got, but still, I'm very pleased.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|This started off kinda dark at first, but you see why quickly.  The story quickly evolves with so many intelligent twists and turns.  It's a great watch.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this show. I wasn't expecting much but boy was I wrong. When a show catches you off guard in a good way, its wonderful. This show has something for everyone. Action, mystery, and even romance. Can't wait until season 2!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I cannot say enough about this simple, poignent film. There are not a lot of Hollywood flair to this film and that's what makes it so good. The &#34;actors&#34; are the real musicians and they deliver a real, emotional performance. I saw the Broadway play after the film and I enjoyed it - the film still holds first place for me but it was nice to see it come to life on stage. If you love good music you will love this film.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I really love this show. This day and age we have so many reality TV shows, so I really thrilled when some show comes along that is different. It has the science fiction feel to it with an air of mystery as well. It has kept me on the edge of my seat wondering where the story will go next.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like this app it great down load is nice pic it look great and you dont need airwave to wacth your video
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I like this program.  First season was best. Each successive season adds more sex but otherwise good. I like the ongoing relationships but with differenc cases each show.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've not been able to find the first couple seasons on NETFLIX or HULU! Thrilled beyond reason to finally be able to watch GOOD WIFE!
0425263991|5.0|Where to begin, this is the twelfth book in the Psy/Changeling series and I believe this is one of the best. This book has been years in the making, we were introduced to the Ghost several books ago and ever since we have wanted to know who he is and what his plans are. This book is different than the others; it feels darker and more dangerous. We find out many answers to questions that we have been waiting for, who is true evil, who is the Ghost and what is the immediate future of the PsyNet as we have seen the disintegration from within.<br /><br />The hero and heroine of this book have been a guarded secrets and by the time this review is posted many may know who they are but I will keep it spoiler free.<br /><br />The hero has been searching for the heroine for seven years and when he finally finds her he is unsure if she is too broken and beyond his help. She tells him that she developed a labyrinth in her mind to help her through the years of torture and suffering. When she is free and is feeling safe with him, she is finally able to unravel the labyrinth and regains her abilities yet her memories are still faint.<br /><br />As she slowly comes back to the living again she starts to remember the past and what they shared, she believes they are meant to be together, however they both know that their race must face its most challenging problems. The Psy are involved in a civil war that will destroy them as Pure Psy want only Silence whereas others believe that Silence is broken and they must rebuild in order to survive.<br /><br />The Psy race must choose a path, Silence or not, who will go which way, will the Psy follow what they have know for the past hundred years, or will they adapt and survive.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy this book, the romance was off the chart and apparently caused several earthquakes as well as damaging their home, it was amazing that the love they felt for each other was so intense. The way Ms. Singh shows their feelings is amazing, as strong as the mate bond of changelings yet they are Psy and were not supposed to have these feelings. I also loved how we were able to visit those we have met before, the leopards from Dark River and of course one of my favorites, Judd spends a lot of time on the pages.<br /><br />The evil ones are pure evil, the damage done to the hero and heroine in the name of Silence and power is heartbreaking, especially when you think that they were children when it happened. The beginning of the book was quiet and deep as we learn more about the hero and heroine, how they knew each other previously and how they are reconnecting. The middle is more dangerous as the hero and heroine reach out to the Dark River leopards as the Pure Psy intensify their attacks and the last part is powerful and electrifying as they race toward the conclusion hoping to save changelings, humans and the Psy that are scared of the future with or without Silence as they know that change is coming and life will never be the same.<br /><br />I am interested in what will happen now, we know so much and I can see how the fight will escalate as Pure Psy and those that believe Silence is broken will fight on. Ms. Singh has created a wonderful intricate world and I am so thrilled to have read these books. The characters she develops are interesting and amazing. The whole series is a must read for those that enjoy intense world building, intriguing characters and wonderful love stories.<br /><br />Review also posted at Ramblings from a Chaotic Mind<br /><br />Copy provided by publisher for an honest review
B0036BK6MW|5.0|It is a great movie, the whole family can enjoy.  A strong cast with the best performance by Sandra Bullock.
B005VC4FLW|4.0|Entertaining film. Interesting though when you think about it. Wife cheats on husband asks for divorce then husband has to leave house and win her back. Hello why does he have to leave his home when he did nothing wrong other than become unromantic although seems caring. I guess it is female chauvinism. Entertaining though and ending is loving if odd. .
B002XHN776|5.0|Excellent album! really chill and relaxing. Have listened to it a bunch of times and still hasn't got old  yet
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I really like this album. Why is she so hated? I am annoyed that one of the songs has the f bomb thrown in for no good reason. Is it too much to ask, to find an f-word free album?
B005PD0VDI|5.0|The Tree of Life doesn't fit on the same spectrum as ordinary movies.  It is a spiritual message, not an entertainment.  If you get it ( I do) it's almost beyond criticism.  Many (most?) must find it incomprehensible.  Some people immersed in a rigid church life may see it as a &#34;new wave&#34; thing and hence unacceptable
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Game is cute but there should be a way to earn peanuts since there are animals that are only available to buy with peanuts.It is very frustrating.
0517543052|5.0|Loved this book back in the seventies and love it now.  Bought it for my adult son.  He loves it, too!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|what a great movie about the human mind and spirit.  my children loved the movie and we enjoyed it also
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book.  I had heard about this story and was eager to read it.  Sad, sad, sad, but a real reality check for us all.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|A surprisingly funny, yet serious romantic comedy.  Some have said it depected Bipolar syndrome to llightly, but I don't see that being what the movie was all about. Just my opinion.
1608199096|5.0|Elegantly bound volume that would be addition to any cook's library.  Great idea.  Greater photos to accompany the greatest of all Northern Italian recipes!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is great it has no problems and does what it needs 2 if u need a good alarm clock I would recommend this 2 u
B0067R0APK|3.0|I liked the app well enough to pay for it. But the maps are only working for me in the free version, not the paid.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|DocumentsToGo has some good features to it and is very similar to using a Microsoft Office app. The spreadsheet is a little tricky to navigate, there don't seem to be a lot of 'shortcuts' but it was probably designed with the assumption the user would not be using an actual keyboard. The word processing app has most of the functionality as Word does but not as easily formatted as an Office product, either. The saved documents are able to be exported to a PC that uses Office though and more robust formatting can take place then.<br /><br />Overall, a good app for a mobile device!
B008MJC6ZS|3.0|Definitely classic Testament style. It's a good album, but nothing wowed me on this one -- though when I saw them live and they played the tracks it was awesome. Kudos for to Testament for keeping thrash alive and Alex for smoking on the solos!
B009K0P10K|5.0|It is a great story, lots of intrigue, always keeps you guessing, Recommended for anyone who likes mysteries, Great story line.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|Needed John Ford directed movies for son's school project.  Found one at a local library, the other here.  Thanks for the quick delivery, added to home library, we may be purchasing again.
1603427244|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  As a reference it will live on my shelf and knitting bag when needed.<br />What a terrific book to add to my reference book collection
0891419063|5.0|Every combat veteran should write their stories because that's where details emerge that connect us all together. Without omitting shameful horrors or exaggerating heroic deeds, E. B. Sledge gives us a personal, detailed account of his time with the Marines during two of the most bloody battles in the Pacific. Reading is work felt like I was alongside him as he experienced war and his treatment of our enemy combatants exposed the demonization our troops undergo in order to make killing easier. I can see why his book was included when recent movies about the second World War were made without recourse to heavy propaganda and sensational exaggerations. This book is outstanding!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app. I play against friends and we have fun. It's great for passing the time.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I just got this app and I love this game. It is really great. You should try it. Really great.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is legit. It made a believer out of me. Nice time passer,and it is cool to try and stump. Great job to the developers. Seriously.
B0098460O4|5.0|I am so glad that Simon picked them up and recorded them. This CD is great, wish it had more songs on it. I think they both will develop into super stars. I'd certainly buy another CD if they come out with one.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this for my cousin (5 years old) and he really enjoys it. It is really fun and easy to play.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I think this game is for younger people...my granddaughter  really likes it and talked me into downloading it. I move too slow to play it.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|When I view this film, my eyes tear up and I can't stop. I wish I could watch this movie without EVER stopping, but sadly, that is Imposible. OR IS IT??? When the smart producers decide to create a second flick, I will purchase 2000 copies! This Is the most AMAZING creation I have ever lay eye on. I own 16 physical copies! Isn't that fabO!!!!!!!!! I wish I had created it myself! OR DID I? One day, I will marry MeGamind! He's cute! This motion picture deserves two thumbs up!!!!! I want to put all 16 physical copies in a glass case with a golden KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love you MeGamind!

B0015DROBO|5.0|Loved the twist and turns. Lisbeth is my she-ro. This book has replenished my love for reading. Can't wait to finish the next book. \\"The Girl that Played with Fire\\"
B004J4WLB4|4.0|But a dear book club friend continued to tout it so I gave it a go.  Very glad I did.  I thoroughly believed in Victoria and Elizabeth.  Grant was a bit too goody-goody for my taste, but I guess there are saints among men....
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun it's hard to believe it's free. You'll have a hard time putting it down.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded this app then I thought to myself I'll should read the comments and when I did I read more than 60 comments and they said it won't let you download and its a VIRUS!Please don't download this app because the people who created this app probably don't even know that it's not working and same with the pro app of this it doesn't work too so save your device and take my advice it's not worth it believe me!Please listen to me and the other comments even though most people rated it 5 stars it's probably because they probably did it right away then they figure out SAVE yourself
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a great book.  I can't wait until the third book of the trilogy come out.  Although long, it held my interest throughout.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love david bowie and loved the movie although it is somewhat outdated it is still a good movie I recommend it
B003L77G6A|5.0|I think this is one of the best seasons for BBT and strongly encourage fans to purchase. The quality of the DVDs is good and everything worked perfectly.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is awesome I wish I had more money though but the hero's are awesome and I have never been more impressed by Gameloft
B0053O89XI|5.0|My favorite show. The set came in good condition and includes both DVD and BluRay. I would recommend this set to anyone who likes the series.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Wilco is one of my favorite bands. This album is absolutely immaculate. My only complaint was that the case came in a little beat up
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this series and season 3 is no exception. I received this set in the allotted amount of time and all of the disc worked. Recommend this to anyone who likes Big Bang Theory.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It was great till they decided to update it today, now it won't load at all! I'm on a kindle fire.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was released, and let me just say it was worth the price of admission and popcorn, no doubt about it.  I saw it again via subscription service when it was released on DVD to refresh my memory and see if it would withstand the test of time and be worthy of purchase.  It was.  I watched it again last night.<br /><br />If you like Jennifer Lawrence, you will love her after seeing her in this film.  She deserved her Oscar.  If you can barely tolerate Bradley Cooper (like myself), you will be very impressed and give him another shot after seeing the Hangover films.  He deserved his nomination.  If you enjoy Robert De Niro, you will appreciate his acting skills all the more, and he deserved his nomination as well.  I won't give away any of the plot, and I highly recommend checking it out for yourself.  A few times.  It's enlightening and should become a staple in anyone's DVD library.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Loved the entire book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes Greek mythology, even if you're not really into it. I rated this book 5 stars for action, suspense, and a pinch of mystery. Prickly awesome book.
B00005N6KG|4.0|good headphones and for the price they are exactly what you'd expect.  Taking one star off since the bass is no longer there like the older sony models
0553801473|1.0|This the last George R. R. Martin book I will waste my money and time on.  I absolutely loved the first four books of this series.  At the end of the 4th book Mr. Martin said that originally all the material was to be included in the 4th book, but since there was so much it had been divided into 2 books.  Ok.  But if that was truly the case, why did it take so long for the subsequent book to be released?  Even so, I waited until finally Dance With Dragons was released.  What a tremendous disappointment!  Absolutely NOTHING was resolved!<br /><br />So I'm done.  Done with this series and with George R. R. Martin.  You've gotten the last of my time and money that I'm willing to waste on this silliness.
B00198X0WW|5.0|You MUST buy this movie!~ It will touch your heart deeply. I watched this when I was little and couldn't forget it till this day so I had to own it in a Blu-ray.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Q82O6IDZ0KEC]]I've read a lot of James Altucher's work including [[ASIN:B005VPXXVM I Was Blind But Now I See]]. I find him insightful, unconventional, thought-provoking. This time he's brilliant. He's tightened his style and delivered his message like a bullet. No pussyfooting around here.<br /><br />This book is for those of us who have found ourselves lying on the floor, barely able to lift our heads, not sure where to turn, just as James did once (twice, three times?). It's for those who are stuck. For those who are successful but want to take it to the next level.<br /><br />If you strive to be a better version of you, you owe it to yourself to read this book.<br /><br />James doesn't ask you to believe him. He just asks that you try the Daily Practice, which is practical, doable, possible for all of us. He asks that you don't ignore the only fire worth cultivating, the one inside of you. After all, he says, you are the only one capable of cultivating it.<br /><br />I'm taking that to heart. I have my own daily practice. But I'm going to put it into high gear. Because last night, when I finished the book, I felt like I could be extraordinary.
B004G6009U|5.0|Such a cute movie!~ I can see why Disney added Rapunzel as a princess. The song from Mandy Moore is beautiful so don't miss it.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|My grandson is fascinated with his feet with these socks on...he seems to love kicking and watching the colorful bugs! A very sweet and useful gift for a baby.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I am a big fan of Castle and wanted my sister to appreciate the show as well.  I bought this video for her.  She loves the show.<br />I recommend it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Highly recommend this series. Similar to fifty shades but more indepth with each character and their individual story that brings the story line together.
B000PMG16U|5.0|This collection was really great....I started to watch them all in order and the visual is nice and sound was great.  Just an FYI  it is set as a Widescreen and not standard but it looks great
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show never disappoints! It is consistently excellent!  Great acting. Great writing. This episode tugged at the heart strings. Love it!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This collection was really great....I started to watch them all in order and the visual is nice and sound was great.  Just an FYI  it is set as a Widescreen and not standard but it looks great
B000JBWWRY|1.0|This took forever to arrive and when it finally did, it did not work on our DVD player.  I do not know what part of the world it came from, but I'll bet this is a pirated version.  It was pricey too.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This honestly is the best first person shooter game out there for any mobile device! Once you start playing you can't stop its highly addictive! Awesome controls with an amazing layout that you can customize.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|There was something missing for me. All the actions were not that satisfying for me. It could have been better.
030746363X|5.0|Great read on easy changes that have large impacts on life in the topics of health, fitness, sex and sleep.
1400069807|5.0|Extremely interesting. Goes into the actual science of human cravings and will make you more scrutinizing when you pick up your next packaged food at the grocery store.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had it on Blue Ray on, so I wanted it to watch it again like I did at the movies, so I got on 3D  and its was great!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|It puts the series to shame and I love the show it has been one of my favorites since day one
B00D2K40WY|1.0|i just read the whole thing and it said wedding so mine is still downloading so make sure you read everythinh :) love cherish
B000FA675C|3.0|I knew this book was anti-Catholic, but I was curious.  (I'm Catholic!)  Story was okay, but I was more upset with the fact I &#34;accidentally&#34; purchased the audio.  I already had the book on my Kindle as a free download and the write-up led me to believe I could buy the audio for $4.99.  I ended up paying $12 and was not happy.  Beware that cost descriptions can be confusing!  For example, the write-up will say things like &#34;purchase audio for as little as....&#34; next to the book you want.  Since I have Prime, I figured that's what I would pay.  I clicked on the purchase thinking that would be taken into account when put in my cart; however, it started downloading to my Kindle and charged immediately.  Now I have $12 invested in a book I didn't particularly want!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is a awesome and I love designing looks and it is the best if you by it l promises you will love it you can do makeup and make a amazing look for her
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Wonderful as only the BBC can do. Enjoyable and interesting. Great acting as well. Surprise ending you will never guess.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series, can't wait for the next two books! Sylvia Day is a great author, so in love with crossfire!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I don't know if the movie was good. It wouldn't stop buffering every 5 minutes to get into it. I will NEVER get an amazon instant video again.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|A good story of family and empowerment of women. The stories heroin goes on her own quest of adventure and self discovery
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Once again Amazon had let the wolves have access to Kindle Fire users.  Amazon has proven they don't care about users as they do this four or five times every week.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|I love the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue cover for my Kindle Fire. It is both practical and charmingly elegant! Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the problem with this game is it wont let me update it to the Miami version but its still a great game I'm just tired of the Tokyo version
B000002LOE|5.0|The condition of this CD met all my expectations. It arrived, as promised, quickly. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this source again and would definitely recommend this source to others.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|I have a big screen so of course it felt like I was actually there. but wonderful movie, def would recommend it to purchase
1451627297|5.0|With over 3000 five-star reviews as I write this, there's little more to say about how fascinating this book is.<br /><br />However, I would add that for a good piece of companion reading, google up Bruce Bawer's article \\"The Other Sixties\\", which talks about the era that fell between the Eisenhower 1950s and the post-Kennedy-assassination drugs-and-hippies 1960s.  In other words, the era in which most of 11/22/63 takes place.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|This set is perfect for any fans of the Matrix series!  It has four disks (stacked on top of one another).
B00CC1K320|4.0|Usually the less expensive knock off case has quality issues but that isn't the case here.  The logo on the front is larger than I'd like but after awhile I forget its there.  The stand feature is only ok, sometimes I have trouble to get it to stay standing.  But the case is much more durable and protective than I would have guessed, fits extremely well, and the flip close window feature works really, really well.  All in all a good buy, and definitely worth considering over the Samsung brand case.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|this is an engaging comedy, a feel-good picture with an excellent story, believable, likable characters, and fine acting.  and rome?  it was all beautiful,
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|i was very dissapointed in this CD - can't deny his talent, sings love songs in several languages, but not the kind<br />of music i usually associate with him.  didn't like it at all
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story is engaging, full of drama and action. The characters stay true to themselves. George RR Martin creativity is amazing and will transport you to a world of heart raising events. Can hardly wait to read Winds of Winter and A Dream Of Spring!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works as advertised charges tablet faster then regular charger and connecting it is a breeze just put the connector near the magnet of tablet and it clicks into place
B007HACDLK|5.0|So many aspects of this story are so current in the political milieu of our country, it's frightening!  However, I strongly recommend the book to spark your interest and awareness of what really goes on in the US!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This, like all  Baldacci books kept all my interest throughout the whole book - could not wait to read the next page and sad to get to the end.  The characters linger in your mind for quite a while.  Balsamic never disappoints.  Keep writting
B003TH14H4|4.0|I didn't really need to own it but, having come late to Castle, I did want to see the earlier seasons. I would prefer a way to rent a season. The show is great fun.
B008U6Q90Q|5.0|Weezer's blue album is one of my favorite albums ever. It sounds excellent on vinyl, so I'm glad I got this.
0575072636|1.0|In my opinion the physical quality of this book is poor.  I wouldn't have purchased if I had seen it first. It is a hard back printed in England on cheesey paper, just a step up from newsprint.  I'm glad to have not gotten splinters or finger smudges from reading it.  To compound matters, all the type is set in extra bold, making letters blurr together and difficult to read.  It's as if receiving an overly long e-mail from a hyper angry boss trying to get a point across.  What a mess!<br />Otherwise no complaints about author, story, vendor, packaging or postal service.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have read the Book and watched this movie multiple times. I think it sticks very close to the book, which for me is a must,as this is my favorite Jane Austen book. Acting is well done, and scenery is well picked. Do not really care for the circus scene at the end. not sure what iit is all about but that may be just me:)
B00CW665VI|5.0|Every now & then if you are a voracious reader like myself, you read as a chore,simply because read so fast that you know little or nothing else to do with your time. Of course, you're making sure you read good books but once in a while you come across a book that is refreshing and just so...MORE that it reminds you why you fell in love with reading in the first place and why you continue to consume books the way regular people might consume food or sleep. \\"Tangled\\" is really beyond words good. I could not put it down once I started. The concept is great, the characters are great and fun and they feel real. This book is laugh out loud funny (more than once I woke my guy up because I was laughing so hard...I kid you not). Underneath all the humour and hot sex (and boy was it hot....phew) there's just so much enlightenment for a woman. It's like a funnier, sexier version of \\"Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man\\". A very good look into a guy's mind. Writing in 1st person & from a male perspective was a stellar move. And yes, Emma Chase has to be a guy, it's just that convincing. If she's not then she either has a guy going through this stuff for  accuracy, or she's able to do what mere mortal women have been trying to do since the dawn of time, get inside the brain of men. BUY THE DAMN BOOK, you won't regret it. Emma Chase is in my top 5 great new author finds for 2013 and she's leading.
B009CGGA9I|5.0|I grew up with this movie and I still love it, the fam and I will watch it many more times...!
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|Broadens your perspective in such a way it is impossible to return. This book sent me on the road to taking control of my life. I've probably bought 15-20 copies in the last couple of years since reading it, I just can't resist giving it away to people I meet that are searching for a way to better their life. The answer? Change your thoughts, and your reality shifts to reflect it. We are not living in a physical world, separate from the objects and other people around us. We are living in a vast unity of energy, where miracles are not only possible, but probable and expected, when one learns to allow space for this kind of magic to take place. An empowering and inspiring work, that will convince even the most scientific, logical mind that there is so much more than meets the eye.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Every episode is very intriguing.  Love Dr. Bishop's character.  Always has me thinking what are they going to come up with next.<br />Very imaginative.  Can sometimes be a little gruesome so would not recommend for children.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Was disappointed. Odd when you feel the movie has more depth than the book. I thought the book just felt rushed.
0525478817|5.0|John Green is amazing, this book is amazing it was worth the buy. And thats why it gets 5 stars.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I always have a high expectations for Rick Riodan`s books. He<br />Always out does him-self. Every time I finish 1 book. I`m dying to see the next one. He`s the reason I like Greek mythology
B00AFEY354|5.0|This book is amazing. Many teens or adults can relate to the people in this book. It is great and for sure deserves a rate of 5 stars.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I always enjoy a good game of Mahjong and this one is great on my Kindle Fire. I have played it several times.
B008HSJVCK|1.0|After being terribly disappointed with 1969, I only bought 2009 to complete my collection. I wish I hadn't read it. I can't stress hardly enough how much I hated this book (If I really tried to we'd end up with Sartor Resartus Part Two)<br /><br />In this tiny volume, Alan Moore manages to fit horrible characterization, terribly clichéd dialogue and a highly predictable plot (except for the deus ex machina ending which was surprisingly bad).<br /><br />I first started reading the League because it had the great writing of the genius who wrote The Watchmen and was starred by some of my favourite book characters. The first two volumes I proudly display on my shelf next to the books that inspired it: Dracula, King Solomon's Mines and so on, because I feel they are just an extension of the books I read as a little girl and love so much.<br /><br />The only place I could \\"proudly display\\" 2009 is in my trash can. Honestly, I was deeply saddened by the quality of this book. Seeing the man who inspired me to become a comic book artist and writer (The Watchmen stands as my favourite graphic novel and one of my favourite books) commit these crimes against some of my favourite characters was a hard hit.<br /><br />I don't care how much symbolism this has, or could have. I don't care how many pop culture references there are. This book has a terrible plot and nothing can hide that.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the art is TERRIBLE. It used to be great but now the figures are plain deformed, assymetrical and with ever-changing faces.<br /><br />Did they put this whole thing together in a weekend? Were they drunk? Did they just not care? All of the above?
B008XKSW7M|3.0|cute and funny movie about being a parent and pregnancy.  some parts were a bit over the top but entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was okay, there were parts that I wanted to hurry up and get through, kept me somewhat entertained.
B008XFJEE2|5.0|Very interesting movie! The concept of intimacy and all other issues in a relationship is exhilarating! I totally recommend this to all the chicas out there!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely the best crossfire novel yet! Can't wait for the next one! Can you say cliffhanger!!!! I hope to read about a baby cross in the next novel!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has once again delivered a book that I devoured, as with the other books in the Crossfire Series, and in which I wholly immersed myself. While Bared to You and Reflected in You had Gideon and Eva in constant turmoil, Entwined with You brings their relationship to new and happy heights. They still face obstacles and have much working against them, but they are determined to overcome and seek the healing that is desperately needed individually and as a couple.<br /><br />The steamy sex is definitely kicked up a notch, but the romance stands out just as much as the sex. When that thing I've been waiting for to happen actually happened, I couldn't help but gasp, garner a huge smile, scream, and laugh from the excitement I felt. Cary's sexual exploits are catching up with him more than ever before. His indecision between Trey and Tatiana may be decided for him by fate. There's plenty of crises to go around for everyone, but the crisis that comes at 92% is devastating. There's a lot going on in this book, more than in the previous two installments. There are so many solved and unsolved mysteries and turning points. The cliffhanger ending is so mild and not anything to alarm over. It doesn't really seem to be a cliffhanger; it's simply more open questions outside of Gideon and Eva's relationship left unanswered. In my opinion, Gideon and Eva are stronger in this book than ever before, giving me a happy ever after ending. I enjoyed Entwined with You immensely and recommend it for the Gideon and Eva fans who want to see the light at the end of this couple's dark tunnel.<br /><br />Full review can be found at romanticreadingescapes (dot) net
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I am somewhat new to the Doctor Who world, I had seen some of the Doctor Who episodes from the 70s, but I have not been following them throughout the years.  I had always enjoyed the older version and had heard amazing things about the new start-up and I was not disappointed.  I love the quirkiness of the Doctor and his almost immediate bond with Rose.  I would definitely recommend checking this show out, it is great fun and has some outrageous story lines that will keep you guessing about what is going to happen!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is one of the few cds I have purchased that EVERY song is good. Usually you purchase for one song, which I did but once I got it.. I have played it numerous times. I would highly recommend this cd
B00886184A|4.0|This is a nice collection.  I was reminded that I was not a huge fan of some of the earlier studio albums because they were just stuffed with so many creative bits and pieces it was hard to follow along.  Then the live CD, Playing the Fool, comes out and of course it's stripped down for a 5 man performance and suddenly it all made sense...it just flat out rocks!!  The dynamics, interplay, music IQ, and just plain funkiness came blasting from the stage that night and thankfully it was caught on tape at the peak of their career.  The later more &#34;commercial&#34; albums benefit from the remastering.  I read that Giant quit because they felt their commercial efforts were a joke.  Hell, I think &#34;Giant for a Day&#34; is their best album...the songwriting was darn good and the material was still challenging and complex but the musicianship makes it sound so effortless.
B00899DR40|5.0|It's Justin Bieber, what else whould you expect!  This is from the mind of an 11 year old.  She loves him!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. Quick reactions and decisions are required and its constantly changing. Thats what i like most is that each game played is different from the start. U never know exactly what is next. Plus the city u play in may change. Lots of missions-rewards-bonuses-frustration-fun!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Ordered for my daughter who already seen the movie.  She watches over and over again.  I have not actually seen the movie yet!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves this little app. It is hard for him to understand the issue of earning coins and needing coins to add cats and dogs to his cars(mice are always free), but that does not distract from his enjoyment.  The only suggestion is to be sure you turn off the internet on your device before you hand it over to a child- it is easy to accidentally purchase something through this app.
B003VANOFY|1.0|[[VIDEOID:bdbeaaaede0512909e4b11ed722a682f]]Headset would auto turn off after a few minutes it's idle. It takes like 10 seconds to turn it on by pushing on a tiny button. Had I known that headset will turn off when it's not used even when it's plugged in, I'd reconsider purchasing it.  edit: Take a look at the video. This happens every day at random time. Strong static noise plus it truns off few seconds after.
B008N1V11U|4.0|It is a little hard at first but my kids and I have really enjoyed playing the game. I really like the graphics.
B0063IH60K|3.0|These games are easy to play and fun! I usually play them in the evenings just before bed to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the day.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game but only four stars due to the when it updates the game IT wouldn't let me reconnect to Facebook  besides that it's awesome  to play
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|It is excellent!! I usually don't like fantasy but the characters are good and the plot is intriguing. Thank you
B0094K20FK|5.0|After going to see ST-Edge of Darkness, introduced her original Space Seed, then Wrath of Khan. She enjoyed so much we then had to watch Search for Spock. She liked that too. Now interested in seeing more ST. Go figure, my wife a Trekkie! (Not yet...but who knows) :-)
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|What can I say ? I love Arnold Schwarzenegger , every movie I have watched he as always been enjoyable to watch.
1452115567|3.0|It was more pictures of just Maddie..she really wasn't on very many things..but for 10.00 I don't regret my purchase. I think it would have been great if she was on alot of the weird side of the road things, like the watermelon....but you know what the say about your opinion...everyone has one.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I did not expect this movie to be as entertaining as it was. I liked it and gave it 5 stars. I thought the acting and story line were great.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I use it with Google Earth fishing.  Also with Microsoft Streets and trips for travel.<br /><br />Compared with marine Garmin options, it is a treasure.  Fast picking up satellites, extreme accuracy.<br /><br />Heck of a bargain!
0880796863|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR A FRIEND WHO WAS HAPPY WITH THE SET AND SAID IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.
1623420148|5.0|OK, where do I begin. 5 stars..REALLY? this book should get the freakin Pulitzer or possibly a Nobel. POSITIVELY the funniest book EVER!!!! Now I have laughed so hard I have wet my pants(thank you GOD for Poise) and I have cried while reading, but I have never hysterically laughed so hard that I cried~I mean the kind of laughing where you can't stop.....and even days after your still laughing.<br />DREW~it's his story told via his POV, and he is a HOOT!!!! then there is KATE...it's like a sexed up WAR OF THE ROSES. Damn this book has the BEST quotes of all time...and the \\"filler\\" characters Alexandria and Drew's niece. This is a perfect story, told from a man's view. I find it highly suspicious that a female wrote this.....because the men's dialogue is RIGHT ON!! This book will take you on a ride, from the very first page....you will not be disappointed. It was very refreshing to actually read a love story based in actual reality. LOVE LOVE this book.......<br />Bought the ebook, loved it so much had to buy the softcover too...
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Third book in the series predictable and was a let down after waiting for the third book.  Disappointing at best.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is a touching film on several levels.  It's funny, heartwarming, sad, even violent at times, but after watching it , one has to wonder why can't the different people of the world understand we have so many more similarities than differences.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|The first two people I thought of he got it wrong and I defeated him twiceeeee.<br /><br />This guy asks the same one question. Really? Was the DEV that lazy to leave this app half ass done?<br /><br />I've seen better!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book is such a disappointment. The past 4 books have been increasingly poorly written and rushed, this being the worst of all. I was so hoping for a great ending but everything was just pushed together to tie up loose ends.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|my nephew loves the thing.  He holds onto it and is able to keep it in his mouth much easier.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Liked all the seasons very much.  Interesting group of characters.  If they come out with some more seasons, I will be watching.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|The ending wasn't what I expected but overall it was a good movie.  It was the first movie I bought as an amazon instant video but it played without interruptions and was crystal clear.
0394818237|5.0|To this day, my 35-yr-old son says when he drives to work every morning, he automatically identifies and thinks about people he sees & &#34;what they do all day.&#34;  :)
B00936A0RU|5.0|the movie was great from the start.  The characters were well thought out and each actor/actress did a great job for the time frame of the movie.  Lots of actions and a little romance and overall great movie
B00457WZEI|4.0|I liked the book War Horse.  I really thought that how the story was told in the view point of the horse was great.  It was a story overcoming the hardship of war and a story of love between a horse and his owner.  I was a good story that shows World War I in the point of view of an animal who can only be loved.  I would recommend it.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|All the hype about this movie proved to be true.  I was hooked instantly rooting for the main characters.  They were easy to watch together and showed a real on camera romance.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|We had a few spots in the movie that were out of focus.<br /><br />ok for a chick flick<br /><br />not the best picture
B0055PMURG|4.0|My kids loved this movie.  Great motivation for those who are self starters. Acting could have been a little better, but overall I recommend this purchase.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|There were a lot of intriguing twists to the story. I liked it so well that lee child will be my next purchase for books on tape.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This album has been playing constantly on my iPod. I've been waiting for another album from Queens' for a while now and this is my favorite since Rated R. Very highly recommended. So far I think my favorite song has to be \\"If I had a Tail\\" but all of them are rocking in there own awesome way.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wanted to read this book because it was recommended to me by some friends, also has been on bestseller list for a long time.  But was disappointed with the story, just plodded through.  Thought it was highly implausible, and drawn out!  Not great literature, and didn't find it all that interesting.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game it's sooooooo much it is so addicted game you have got to try it if you looking for these kind of games
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I have read this book twice now, and just like the Bible, I have learned something new with each read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|fabulous series. very happy to have it at such a reasonable price. it is worth the money. A spectacular cast
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This film dragged and I felt the gore was way over the top even for Quentin Tarratino. I also felt that the story was just not well developed and the acting was predictably average. Tarratino likes to use a lot of the same actors and the one he chose for the bounty hunter who befriends Django just didn't cut it.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifly acted with and insiring and uplifting message message of hope. in my opiniun the film should have at least one oscar to show for it's brilliance.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is an exciting and edge of your seat read. It was entertaining to the point where I lost track of time and I was at work! This is one that will be a movie soon. I liked it alot.
B004GYY714|4.0|I have not used this a lot but when I have, I have enjoyed it. Good selections of music types and sounds good
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Simply one of the best tales of fantasy in our time, by one of the finest masters of the art. Not to pass by, as it is well worth the read and will capture your heart and imagination forever!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app I just down-loaded when I was at my daughters, she had her Kindle all figured out using this app. I am slow in learning, but this app I feel will help me get organized too.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't believe that we are going to have to wait for the other book to come out, I just hope that we don't have to wait a long time for it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy Mahjong I have played it for many years It is a fun app to have on your Kindle
B00881VLCE|2.0|Let me see how can I rate this game? Well I downloaded it less than 10minutes ago and I was in the middle of doing my second puzzle, when all of a sudden I'm on the web being connected to a slutyteengirl sight. Once I was off that I had trouble 're-opening the app. I gave it the two<br /> because the pictures are beautiful. I hope the sight improves.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy Spider I have it on my desk top and have played it for years It is a good past time
1455523542|5.0|I was happy to find out that my book was exactly as i expected! i hadnt realized that i had ordered before a holiday weekend, so it did take a couple of extra days, but it came the day it said it would
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Fun mystery book. It was fast paced and enjoyable, just don't think too deeply about the scientific repercussions of the theoretical research.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Everyone I knew was reading the trilogy so I thought I'd try it.  It was what I would expect one of those silly romance novels.  The sexuality was fine with me, but the dialogue was absolutely inane and the entire book very poorly written.  Is the author about 15??
B00555X8OA|2.0|I wanted so bad to enjoy this book, but the pretentious nature of the writing caused me to dislike the author so much that I could no longer focus on the overall themes.
B005ES1E4E|5.0|I live in SOCAL so I wear Crocs pretty much everywhere, specially in Newport Beach or Dana Point.  I love Crocs because it is perfect for the beach lifestyle.  I can go out for breakfast, jump on my Kayak after, then go to the mall in Fashion Island.  All that without changing footwear.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The Duet has a thicker sole so it is more comfortable.<br />2.  I love the Blue and White combination. Looks very nice.<br />3.  Perfect for everyday use and is ultra comfortable.<br />4.  Very inexpensive.<br />5.  Excellent traction.<br />6.  Easy to clean. Just hand wash them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  Not great for walking long distances or running.  But then again, that is why they sell running shoes.<br /><br />Summary:<br />These are my second pair.  I love them.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|I guess,  in my opinion, it would have taken at least 3 hours for this movie to have been really great. It showed him (Will) and Sam (dog) alone for most of the movie and then once dialog was possible, with other humans, it was basically over....
B004G0DN7W|4.0|Choose a vacation, pay for a week...then, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, everything goes awry.  An older movie, but a good one.  Picture Yul Brynner as The Terminator...
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I want to thank you for all you folks do to keep older books alive and offer them as you have done.
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|This is one of the movies I saw more than once when it was in the theaters (back in the dark ages).  It's basically a documentary about cycling.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My daughter and I really love it!!  it helps me get to sleep. I especially love the sleep timer.  makes such a difference. We listen almost every night.  Worth every penny. The most used app on my phone. Thank you for making this app.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|My 15 year old and I watched this movie together, at night and it scared both of us. Well worth the watch!
B000GT7XXW|2.0|How can you stomach this after L. Olivia? All actors in it are unbearably bore, waste of my time even for just a few minutes.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It was a great movie. We watched it right before catching the sequel in the theaters and it was seamless. I was never really into Star Trek other than watching it on UPN on Saturdays and Sundays, but they did a good job explaining everything. I finally get the whole concept for the first time.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie with a lot of thought provoking dialogue (specifically from Spock) and great space battle action.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I loved this bio. I am so saddened about Chris Kyle's death at the hand of a man he was trying to help. The true world is truly cruel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this, but its soo limited becuase the update isn't on the kindle fire HD yet, whens that coming out? I really wanna know
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|It had some great twists, but unfortunately it was still predictable because there was only two ways it could go.  Also the whole short selling thing was a stretch.  I know too much about securities and to make a fortune in one transaction you have to risk a fortune.  That is a hole in the scheme of the plot. Why would you do that if you already had a fortune.  Wall Street junkies do it out of greed not out of need.  Enough said, don't want to spoil it.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|GOOD MOVIE AND CAST OF ACTORS.  DID NOT REALIZE IT CONTAINED SO MUCH MAGIC.  MAGGIE SMITH  ROLES ARE ALWAYS WORTH A WATCH.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I have only seen the first episode, so this review is provisional.  I like the 'looks' of Homeland: very nice camera.  My husband and I don't love the setup predictability of the plot, though we expect this will be part of the game.  Actors are all appealing, but not much invites us to pursue this more than a couple of episodes...(to be continued)
B00BF124PC|5.0|This is an intense and uspenseful movie with an amazing climax. And the lead actress is phenomenal. Believe the hype!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I bought the movie when it first came out on dvd, so since I couldn't rent it at that time I was forced to buy it. OMG was that a mistake. It was awful. I thought because knightley was in it, that it would be good. Wow was I mistaken. Boring movie.... judes character was bad too. Nothing good about it... I am stuck with this movie in my video library. Ya I could delete it but my god I paid 13 for it
B0063M22QO|1.0|for a cheap game its lame, no progresion to next level just one level choice<br />not worth the download, and i got it free
1250006341|4.0|The book has beautiful photos, and, besides giving information about the series, it also brings some historical facts. That´s it.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This was one of the best shows on tv. Great Family entertainment! Fabulous stories! Comedy, adventure, high moral values ... Great for the entire family!
B0027MJU00|3.0|I really enjoyed GONE GIRL so decided to give this book a try. Again you need to be in the mood for something dark, creepy, and makes you unsettled in a check your door locks kind of way! Well written and visceral to the max, especially in the descriptions of terrible violence, but I couldn't read this type of book all the time. Give it a shot if you are in the mood to go over to the &#34;dark side.&#34;
B002WY64HA|5.0|i know neon bible and suburbs got quite a bit higher reviews, but this album is still my favorite by them and i think really showcases their true talents and diversity. sounds great on vinyl, too!
B00915G6YE|5.0|This show rocks, and it keeps getting better.  Sadly all good things come to an end and it's no exception with this one.  Watched all seasons twice over.
B000005AYL|3.0|I was amazed to see this album on vinyl for only $7. However, when I got it, it wasn't the whole album, but rather 3/4 of the album. I think the add is very misleading, as it states that you are gettign the entire album. However, 3/4 of this amazing album or $7 is still a great deal, and it contains most of the best songs on the album (not that there is a bad one). Love the whole album, but was disappointed that I was mislead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfers is awesome. I think so because they are awesome and they are cool and Awesome and great
B0015RB72W|2.0|I remember seeing her a few years back at Coachella and the live show was great. Got the album and it really didn't live up to what I saw that day...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is real now because because they in Miami and new dude and he is so real an so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The game.is awesome p.s game is cool and fun
B000069AUH|5.0|this is the best thing they have ever done. i know they get crap all the time, and 40 year old virgin didn't help when they were making fun of each other and one seth rogan says to paul rudd &#34;you know how i know you're gay, you like coldplay.&#34; well, this album kicks ass and there is not a bad track on the whole thing. they might have gone a bit more VH1 after that, but this album was solid!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I love the B52s so I did Kate Pierson. I thought it would be tricky. HE GOT IT RIGHT! He has never gotten it wrong and it is very VERY creepy. This App is very cool
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Well I had high hopes but am seething at the lack of fluid plot or focus in this book. And the ending? Really?! It's like Sylvia got a phone call and had to go and said... The end. If there's to be another book great but at least build the story to indicate that it's needed. Not just because you got too lazy to finish. Very sad after how good the first two books were.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|excellent  everybody should have this...the music is superb...doesn't get any better<br />the live DVD is also a must have ...buy it
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love all his books but this one was special. It held my interest all the way to the end.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|For readers who keep their BOB handy while reading, they will be pleased.<br /><br />Sigh. Seriously? All these five-star reviews that gush, \\"Can't wait for the next two books,\\" or \\"Loved the ending\\" are so very obviously posted by those who have not actually read the book.<br /><br />My 'refrigerator thoughts*,' and ::spoilers::<br />1. Oh, so we are to believe that Corinne Giroux didn't know she was four months pregnant?<br />2. As if Eva Trammell could forget Gideon Cross's reaction when she allowed Brett Kline to kiss her the first time? So she invites Brett up to her apartment after the video release event, knowing who lives next door?<br />3. Perhaps the much-hoped for actual HEA will appear once the all designer gowns and shoes, five-star hotel, and hot sports car product placement contracts are secured by the publisher?<br /><br />*Refrigerator thought: After just returning home from the movies, you stand at the fridge deciding what to eat since the movie popcorn didn't really constitute dinner. With the fridge door open, you puzzle through the movie's plot points, and there is a disconnect in the storyline: some pivot point that says to you, \\"Screenwriter( or author) took me for a ride.\\" That's when you scowl and realize you've been had, when a plot point is so contrived or unbelievable that it insults the reader's / viewer's intelligence.<br /><br />Occurs mostly frequently in movie sequels, romance novel series, and television drama series that seek to continue the money-making franchise.<br /><br />Sorry, Sylvia Day. Books 1 and 2 were fascinating. I wish I could just return Book 3. My local retailer doesn't allow returns. No Book 4 or 5 for me. The various fan fic sites' take-offs on the first two books are worth reading, and they're free.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I started reading this series being told it was a trilogy, but apparently not!  Could we throw anymore drama their way? Why is Gideon still being secretive? Why is Corinne still around? What is the matter with Gideon's mom....who still doesn't believe her son? And Eva's mom? I just want to throw a big bottle of 'it's not about you' in her face! And why are all the side characters getting so much time? Why can't you write separate stories for them? Errrrr, this book was  beyond frustrating for me. I'm not pleased at all.
B008220BP2|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was fun, and it had a lot of heart.  Rob Corddry is great and steals every scene he's in.<br /><br />I do have some issues with the movie though.  The Romeo and Juliet references kind of beat you over the head until I got to the scene with Julie on the balcony looking down at R, and I just kind of groaned.<br /><br />I also found it a little hard to find R likeable after witnessing him brutally attack and eat a human at the beginning of the film.  What kind of makes you care for him is when Julie says that she sees him trying harder than most humans she knows.<br /><br />Rob Corddry really steals the movie though.  He gets the best lines, and his delivery is fantastic.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|About 5 minutes into side one, track one of this LP, my system got the workout of its life in the deep bass region.  If your system can reproduce the 20-40 Hz region accurately, this LP will be a real treat for you.  And, you get the wonderful Vangelis music, as well.  If you collect SciFi soundtrack music albums, you really should get this one.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Broad, well written coverage in several categories from around the globe. Presentation and format are first class. Generally the first news site I go to.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is a bit different and more challenging than the previous ones offered.  Patience and try try again is my motto.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|cannot  put it down....fascinating.<br />CURIOUS  as to authors mind and how fiction novels develop.<br /><br />WELL WORTH THE TIME TO READ
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Gives detail information in a numerical format that you don't get with other search engines. Gomes in very handy for a quick summary.
1451695195|5.0|This is an incredible book! The author is a a highly educated  aetheist surgeon who never believed his patients stories about their Near Death Experiences. It is an easy quick read. I finished it in an afternoon. I couldn't put it down!
1449410243|5.0|This is definitely a hystericaly read! Any cat owner would understand. I have a cat I think is plotting my demise!
B00BOLE7X0|2.0|Trailers and media hype fooled me again on this one.  While I am interested in the political and social factors that influenced the events of that time, this movie did not deliver on any.  I think Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal was excellent, the script writing and directing leaves much to be desired.  I am sorry I purchased this movie as I will not watch it again.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This series was hands down my favorite romance series out there.  This book just killed it.  I don't understand what happened, it doesn't feel like the characters or the story are the same.  Some things I noticed:<br /><br />- The plot was exhausting.  Every day, Eva would go to work and come back having somehow accumulated so much drama that I started to really dislike her.<br />- Eva seems to sort of progress naturally, but I don't know what happened to Gideon.  I guess in this book, his actions are meant to be driven by his guilt and regret over the second book.  Either way, I couldn't stand how clingy he'd become.<br />- The first chapter of the book opens with Eva running into a reporter.  If you start a book with a sub-plot, FINISH IT! I have no idea what happened to the reporter.<br />- Megumi is MIA at the end of the book, and this is made to be a bigger deal than necessary for a secondary character.<br />- SO. MUCH. PADDING!  The book is 30-40% padding.<br />- The ending between Eva and Gideon: WHAT? What happened? Did I miss something or did she just end a book mid-conversation?<br />- Cary: His cycle of dysfunction is officially hackneyed and irritating.  We get it.  He has emotional problems.  Just when I thought he would start resolving them, BAM the book ends one page later.<br /><br />In short, don't spend your money on the book.  It was not worth the price.  Also, if you can stand to wait, put off the frustration and wait until the 4th book comes out.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Having not read the books, I purchased this due to the reviews on Amazon from previous viewers.  I was not disappointed and I became interested in the Reacher novels as well.  Not a bad flick for the money and you will not be disappointed.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Once the zombies come your going to wish you read this. Such a good read. Will have you prepared for the war against the zombies.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful show-full of interestinG and well-developed characters. Maggie Smith is a hoot! The scenes are beautifully shot and you just want more, more, more. The Bates love story as well as Mary & Michael are beautiful to watch.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|keep  them  comeing  it  is  in a great  format  the  color  is  super i would  advises  any  to  start  the  collection  it  great  to  have
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|When I fist saw this movie I thought it would be predictable like most. It started off in that direction. The ending was most unexpected. I really liked the way it was written and directed because it had a unique twist in the ending.
B00018D3RI|5.0|its  like  steping  back  in  the  80s sometimes  it  hard  to  find  good  shows  like  this  i want  to  collect  them  all  so  that my  son can  enjoy  what  i  came to  be clean  shows
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Sucked! This book couldn't keep my interest. I still read it so possibly it would get better and it never did.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Has many features to edit your pictures. I like the meme feature  sets the size and locations automatically.  Good app.
1856697525|5.0|the years it took to perfect this master work were well worth the wait, as it is the definitive document on the life's work of jennifer's father saul.
0812982622|5.0|Really great book but scary to realize there is a place like this where identity is non-existent.  They accept whatever reality they are presented with and we don't necessarily...a big difference among members of the human race.
0316247545|5.0|The quality and beauty of this book was a pleasant surprise!  My daughter absolutely LOVES it!  Just ordered another copy for my niece's birthday.<br />I also expected it to be bigger, but the small size is actually so much more appealing than a huge guidebook size (I was expecting the kind they sell for videogames - obviously, I didn't read the dimensions in the description).  When I saw it was smaller, I was happy, since my daughter LOVES smallish books that she can carry around.  She is 5 and is a HUGE fan of the show!! :)<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Update:  Book has TOTALLY fallen apart!  OK, I know what you're thinking - a FIVE-year-old's book, of course she abused it.  Well, you'll just have to take my word for it that that is not the case.  (I'm the kind of mom who is kind of 'anal' about things being put away properly, etc., so not like this book was shoved down in a couch cushion or anything like that.)  This book wasn't abused in any way but the binding has totally failed and all the pages are falling out.  I tried to contact the publisher only to get the run-around.  As much as I HATE to do it, since I've already paid for it once, I reordered a new one for my daughter because she loves the book.  But out of all the books I've ever owned, this one is the ONLY to fail like this, so it was obviously defective.  Maybe it was just our copy or maybe it's a defect in the binding glue or whatever.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I returned the DVD because it is a bluray and I found out I cannot play those on my player.  The movie itself is wonderful--one of the best ever.
B009R659L8|4.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark.  This sample hooked me and I had to buy.  The only problem is that with Mary Higgins Clark about half way through the book I figure out who the killer is.  I wish she would draw out the suspense longer.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Rented Monsters Inc. for my 2 year old and she couldn't get enough of it! I chose to rent rather than buy because I personally find the movie a little annoying. I'm not the kind of parent that just sits their kid in front of the movie to watch it by themselves, we watch movies as a family an anything that she's watching I've at least seen it once myself. So, that's why I can only give it four rather than five stars; she wanted to watch it over and over again lol.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Having read all three of the books, I was not sure I was going to add to my bucket list at this time. When it popped up I had to watch and watched it twice with my husband. He told me I always pick the best movies! He he of course I do;)<br />We give this four stars it was excellent. Wonderful cast
B0090SI42Y|3.0|I love Rza, I really do. He is one of the best musical talents around! But he really should have learned to project, not mumble, open his mouth when he talks, or they should have put a mic right next to his mouth because I could barley understand anything he was saying! In total opposite Russell Crowe was a complete delight! I really enjoyed him in this role, funny and bad azz! I think everyone did a really good job, Rza when it came to the music but not the acting. It's just one of those really quirky movies that you'll either like or not like. Overall I liked it; it has some cool fighting scenes an even if the top billed actors sort of carried this movie, it's still really entertaining.
0380018179|5.0|This is a must read.  Although, there are lots of graphic details about the location, you will definately enjoy reading this book.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Incredible story hampered by quite a few long drawn out scenes and relentless close ups of Naomi Watts with pale eyes and chapped lips. Apparently, no one in the family got cleaned up at all until they landed in Singapore.  The story is an incredible story.  The movie version is, well, a movie version.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Not knowing anything going into watching it, it was a very pleasant surprise! Acting was great, especially Jude. I can highly recommend this to any fan of intellectual movies.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|I'm a V.N. Veteran and I like this kind of movie, I can separate what's true or not true.  Makes me think about all the shady stuff that goes on in our Government that we don't know about.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Pros: Challenging, pretty graphics (if you like the 'neon oldschool' look), good sound, great price. Gameplay is simple fun, controls are solid.<br /><br />Cons: Some framerate chug when the screen gets busy. The constant power cell grabbing mechanic to keep your guns juiced up is interesting, but clutters the screen and is somewhat counter-intuitive at first (the small cells look like bombs you should dodge at first, imo.)<br /><br />Played on Kindle Fire HD
0783114893|4.0|On the run from a psycho who is smarter than you and wants to torture you before he LETS you die. Great performance by the actors. A worthy addition to your library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept me very interested in the story line. People who like love stories should read it.
0394800184|5.0|Loved this book as a child.  I bought it for my children and I'm now buying it for my grandchildren.
8866130915|5.0|Its the perfect size and is made of good quality stuff. I will always be a moleskin owner from this point forward
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Love this movie! One of my favorited dance movies of all time. Plus the eye eye candy is great, Tatum has some killer moves.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I don't have a blu-ray player but I bought this to watch the dvd copy. The dvd version<br />does not include any of the extras, they only appear on the blu-ray disc. I think this should be mentioned in the film description. I was very disappointed. I don't think I<br />should be forced to buy two discs because of the push to sell blu-ray which doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
B009NY43NY|5.0|She writes in an easy style that you can relax into and then it is just easy reading and fun reading.  Wonderful escapism into fantasy world of vampires, werewolves and shape shifter<br /><br />The characters are well defined and it takes nothing but imagination to read about her fantasy world.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show is a slam dunk all the way around. Clever writing, great plot twists, fabulous casting/acting and chemistry, mystery, humor and brains. You know a show is great when you can't shake it, long for the next episode and chuckle to yourself the next day about some of the great dialogue.
1401324649|4.0|Great piece of satire.  The &#34;Old Man' is just amazing.<br />You feel like you are his side kick.<br />If I have any criticism, it is a tad long and the ending could<br />have been better...but that is just being picky.<br />Really GREAT fun and if you are a BOOMER you will<br />more than relate to the scenarios.
B000T45C6E|4.0|This is a good movie. My only complaint is that it's kind of depressing for about 90% of the movie.
B00ALK82SG|5.0|Adult oriented themes, several famous faces and decent music make this movie a laugh out loud experience. You have to have an offbeat type of humor to enjoy this movie. If you like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, you might want to give this movie starring Roger Daltrey from The Who a try. See if you can recognize other faces such as Ringo Starr, Paul Nicholas (Cousin Kevin from Tommy) and Oliver Reed. If you are looking to forget your troubles, chill out and have a laugh (even if it's at the expense of the film itself) then give this movie a try!
B008220B0C|4.0|Cute movie. Would live to just see the whole concert. I thought the drama between her and her hubby was wasted space. This kind of film didn't need such a lame climax.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the intrigue.  It's a great book if you don't care what time you have to go to sleep.  It certainly kept me awake at night.  Very enjoyable as are all the Clifton Chronicles.<br />CTK
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|This movie is predictable, and somewhat felt like Fast & Furious and Die Hard with all the shoot and dodge bullets action and never get hit like 007...I do not recommend buying it ever, watch it when it comes out on cable or rent it for  a buck or Netflix it! You've been warned...
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I don't want to see people's private parts honestly but the STORY!!!! The ACTORS<br />Jonathan Ryes Myers? Henry Cavill (the new Superman!!!!) the cast is brilliant.<br />And the Set? Yeah it's Ireland but its Georgous!!!<br />Must see
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is the first book of the series I've read and although a bit tedious at times it picks up along the way and becomes hard to put down. By the time I concluded the book I wanted to know the sequel; to date I've not found it based on the brief Kindle descriptions. Part 6 was a logical choice but was not a sequel. It was instead a poorly written, feeble attempt to explain why it all happened.
B00B2FDF54|4.0|Clint Eastwood belongs in the westerns. Good movie, but mani character shouldve been Charlie Sheen, Tom Seleck, Brad Pitt, or someone that has played in a previous baseball movie.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|This book is ground breaking in that it effectively questions many of our negative attitudes or new items. And Ridley's reasoning is indisputable. This has become my favorite book of the last five years.  Everyone I have shared it with has given it equally rave reviews.  Read this book! It is that good and extremely well reasoned and supported.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This product is amazing! It was just what my boyfriend wanted for Christmas, and I was thrilled to find it! It was in perfect condition. Shipping took a bit longer than I had hoped, but still within the reasonable time frame. Thank you very much!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Keeps me informed on colleagues. I use this app for referrals also. It also lets me add more classes that I have completed for my profession and confirm my friends and colleagues accomplishments.
0802473156|5.0|I first read The 5 Love Languages when going through premarital counseling.  The insights provided in this book have helped my husband and I more effectively communicate our love with each other and our children.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I do not get the game at all, but a four year old will be happy with it.  There seem to be endless adventures for the birds. I am happy to have it.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|There were no likeable characters in the entire book. I plan t<br />read it again to try to understand it better.
8866130915|5.0|Very useful and i write everything in it. Work hours, and for meetings. Has very good quality.Thank you so much
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and entertaining to a teenager like me. I play this all the time and I hope they come up with another version of it soon!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Great adventure, intrigue, mystery and action.  The saga continues with this book using many of the Same characters continuing the story.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|A fun action/adventure with a fairy tale twist. The protagonists deliver a believable brother-sister act that specializes in whacking witches. The fight scenes are TOTALLY off the charts...Hansel & Gretel must be made of steel the way they bounce back from the abuse dished out by their opponents. Wouldn't be surprised if there's a follow-up, but if not I won't miss it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|If you haven't yet seen or read this series, get on it.  If you like any of these genres: fantasy, historical fiction, sci-fi, drama, political thrillers... you will be completely engrossed.  Got this as a gift for my 18 year old brother and he went nuts.  HBO gives us another quality, beautifully shot and costumed series that is superbly acted.  It's violent, explicit and chock-full of sex, so enjoy.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Kind of a grounded &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. Not for the squeamish, and not sure of its historical accuracy (in terms of portrayal of the Viking lifestyle), but a very entertaining romp that will leave you hungry for Season 2. Terrific storylines, and top notch acting across the board. Of course, these guys (and gals!) will have you believing that a few sword slices to the gut are nothing to worry about, but still, that's all part of the fun. Give it a look!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|most of the songs were great but the bb can do without the transidental meditation songs in the middle  but that's whaat a cd recorder is for I highly recommend it
B003F9G8B8|4.0|This is a very good film about the sport of rugby and the interaction between President Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African national team.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My mom has this game on her iPad and I have  been waiting forever for it to come out on the kindle fire. If you are looking for a very fun and easy racing game this would be it. trust me.
1594204217|5.0|A primer for fundamental change. Michael Pollan explores the prospects of a quiet revolution, one that you can participate in.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Im a classic Rock fan and this is exactly thaht great classic Rock & Roll very good music for us older types
6305212112|4.0|The movie has unbelievable moments, made believable simply because of the way the women are characterized - true Southerners in a small town where they make a fair living with a corner restaurant - beautifully acted.
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|I thought I would try this CD Im a Susan Tedschi fan I thought this would be more bluse music
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is actually believable - that one brother could drive his only transportation - an old tractor - halfway across the US just to make up for hard feelings before they die.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love books &#34;written&#34; by dogs.  This was a sweet book and lots of fun; depressing at times but so touching to see and feel the dog's reactions to the family's experiences.  Loved the part about the evil zebra!  I think my dog has experienced that. Great ending.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva are done dancing around their relationship.  They have matured and are putting each other first.  No more running away when things look bad.  Okay, there are doubts and worries, but these are two damaged people overcoming their pasts and striving for a solid future. The sexual attraction that first drew them together has evolved into something much deeper and meaningful(but still sizzling!)<br /><br />To rebut the complainers:<br />The ending is abrupt, but no more than in Bared to You and Reflected in You.<br />There are loose ends, but no cliffhanger.<br />The publisher sets the release date. Sylvia gave us snippets and there were snapshots to keep up interest during the wait.<br />The author decides how many books are needed to tell the story in her head.  If you want to read the book before deciding to buy it, patronize your local library. Accusing an author of being greedy is just plain rude.<br /><br />If I like a book enough to reread it and I want to own it, it rates 5 stars.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it because I can set the type of ring that will really alert me. And it has a big display.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|After recent update I can't even open the game. Would of rated it at least a 3star before. Oh well time to find a new game cuz I am not restarting for a fifth time..
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book kept me constantly guessing as to what would happen next.  The ending was a great surprise!<br />I would highly recommend this to female readers.
1402736924|5.0|Cannot keep it in the library - children love the series they find the books easy to understand<br />And to use for their essays

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I don't remember the last time I was anxious to get back to a book to see what happens next; it's a great feeling to rediscover. Buy this series if you are a fan of the genre, you won't regret it.

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|It is kept in the teachers resource room and available to all teachers for down time - the childen love it
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Like three pieces of gently warmed bronze, these three boys just glow. They don't have to prove anything to anyone. Their music speaks for itself. Okay, yeah, maybe the voices are a little thin and harmonies not always there, but to me, that doesn't mar the performance at all. They are outspoken, playful, yet with deep purpose. A must for the long-time fan as well as the newbie.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I am never unimpressed with Modern Family's wit and obvious love for all the characters. It shows in the writing, it shows in all of the actors, and it never fails to amaze me at how sweet Jay is (Ed will always be Al Bundy to me). Great season!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|A grand insight into the man and his music. You'll hear the very first song from Stephen he ever recorded, somewhat nervously, at the age of 17 in a Voice of America studio in Costa Rica. Nearly five hours later, you finish with Ain't It Always. In between is a marvelous ride, buoyed with rock, gentle folk, Latin, blues, and jazz. He quite simply is an unsung genius. And this tome barely eclipses every song he has written. The enclosed booklet is a little window into his life with rarely seen photographs and tributes from close friends. You simply have to treat yourself. :)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|When I first purchased this book I was saw that it was a trilogy and that the books were coming out with only months in between. When I finished the second I found out that the third was pushed back. I had to wait 6 months! I thouroughly enjoyed this book, lots of ups and downs in emotion. Finished it in one day. When I got to the end, it ended so abruptly! I freaked! Then got on her site to find out that there is going to be more books. HELLO!!! Could she not have informed us sooner! I don't buy books that have more than one unless they are coming out quickly together or I wait until they are all out before purchasing them. When you look at her site, it doesn't even give a release date. Are you serious!!!! Loved the book, but very upset about finding out that the trilogy has now been extended and I once again have to wait. UGHHH!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm used facts to back up his idea very convincing. He unfolded his story that covers wide area from hokey players to lawyers to detail his ideas that I think most people have not realized.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|The disappointing thing is that in a capitalist society, nothing will change as the system was designed to make people ill in order to make large profits from pharmaceuticals.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Um, how can anyone say no to an adorable fuzzball named Gizmo? Keep in mind that this movie is from 1984, so of course you're not going to get HD on your tv, but the movie is great.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Solid show with good characters that get developed over the season.  They do lose a few folks over the course of the series which makes it more realistic which is a good thing.  Watching the end of season 2 and waiting for the start of season 3.  Give it a try for a few shows and see if it grabs you too.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I generally like sci-fi movies but this was a little too episodic and soap opera like for me. I like plot driven stories with episodes, not episode driven stories with no plot. At least we were treated to a happy ending coming out of this whirl wind of tragic plights transcending time, space and places. I guess the theme is: What Goes Around Comes Around on the Wheel of human destiny.<br />Frank C
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is one he'll of a book!  I am so glad there is more to come! You will love Gideon and  Eva even more and want the story to go on it does end well but leaves wondering about different characters yes I want more but please don't make us wait long
B00821PCJS|1.0|The writing for this show is terrible and the acting is subpar... I would recommend they hire someone with a military background as an adviser and a writer with syfy experience.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although I liked the first book, this one was better for me....when I read, I like the thrill of my heart pounding when it comes to the drama in stories....this gave it to me several times!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|waste of time. could have been resolved in 2 book. do we have to look for answers in book 4. DON'T THINK SO, NOT WORTH WORRYING ABOUT.
0765325950|5.0|Hard to say goodbye to characters and a world that have been a part of my life for so many years, and yet, this book, the final of the series, did a fabulous job of wrapping up loose ends, and giving us a conclusion that was both satisfying and delicious. I will always wonder how the story would have played out had Mr Jordan not died, as his writing style was a bit different than Mr Sanderson's. Not better, not worse, just different.  The Wheel has turned..
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Thought this was a funny and enjoyable movie. Had a great cast and didnt drag at all. Also enjoyed how it ended.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I had seen this show on reruns and thought I might like it.  Amazon Prime helped me watch it without commercials and I got the whole season watched in one weekend.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed this great book and continual series form Sylvia Day. I love Gideon and Eva,... So many twist and turns, anticipation, and not happy about the ending. I just wanted to keep on reading. Great book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game is ok as a time killer but can't achieve some goals without buying credits which I refuse to  do so just plod along with what I can build for free.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I GAVE 5 STARS BECAUSE THIS IS 1 OF THE BEST SY-FY MOVIES EVER. I HAVE ALL THE ALIEN/PREDITOR MOVIES. IF YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF MOVIE THIS ONE TO HAVE.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris disregard towards her readers is mind baffling, do she not understand that we put her there and we can take her down? I will never again buy any of her books and from now own I will not only not recommend her books but will go out of my way to tell everyone who listen how she defrauded us by selling this very badly written book. Thanks to the reviews I ended not buying it but instead borrow it from the library. Major waste of my time reading it. I always knew she was no Stephen King or Anne Rice but I though she at least love her characters. You do not have to be an English Professor to see that the writing was rush with story discrepancy at every turn. I have seen better writing in the reviews. I guess her true nature has finally come out, money before creativity.<br />And no, I did not wanted her to end up with Eric, I wanted her with Bill. I wanted Pam to end up with Erik.  I agree with a great number of readers that Erik deserve a role in this book as big as he had in all the other books.  For me is not so much the breakup between Erik and Sookie, as the small footnote is made about it in the book. Others have given some very good plausible alternative ending, all showing much more creativity that what Ms. Harris has been showing us for a while. As a matter of fact I have been reading all the reviews because of that. Leaving us unsatisfied and wanting for a true ending could be just another way of Mrs. Harris to pave the way for another book, which will just validate my theory that she has no love or respect for her characters or her readers.  Believe me when I tell you, she will never again see a penny from me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i've read this book twice.  i never thought i would reread it since the story is so dark.  still enjoy it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love these kind of games but why does progress always cost money or you have to wait for energy. Very annoying.
B007KLEHUQ|5.0|This was  really great DVD.... the concert had all Phil's hits as well as some tunes I have not heard, plus a great bonus DVD with him doing his stuff in big band style. I would recommend this to any Phil Collins fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game, keeps your attention.  My Grandson downloaded it but I play it when he's not here.  Really exciting to see how far I can get.....(by the way, kids are better at this than I am)also very challenging...
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Had the true essence and chemistry of Carol and James. They still have it after all these years! I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone who has ever love James Taylor and Carol King and anyone who loves good music.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|great movie and wonderful HD quality on my Kindle 8.9- i love these movies all of them well worth the watch
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG! Hot in every way. I can't get enough. To know their story isn't over is exciting and has me wanting more. Gideon truly is a perfect dream. Never has a book had me tormented for having to put it down. Eva is a lucky woman!! Their love is intense and intoxicating. Book 4 won't be here soon enough.
B00CATSONE|3.0|A little light on but I still enjoyed the read.<br />some interesting facts and stories about the man and his inventions.
0425263924|5.0|Note: contains minor spoilers for the two Crossfire novels that precede Entwined with You: Bared to You and Reflected in You.<br /><br />Troubled young billionaire with a taste for kinky sex starts out lusting for a beautiful young woman -- and finds love that replaces his inner darkness with a light he never dreamt was possible.<br /><br />That's the only similarity between Fifty Shades of Grey (and its teen-friendly version Twilight series) and the much-better written Crossfire series. Much better written by an author who is not simply someone who dabbled in writing romance and became an overnight sensation almost by chance. Sylvia Day started out as a Russian linguist/interrogator for U.S. military intelligence, and her gift for the subtleties of language shines in well-crafted fiction.<br /><br />But no matter how talented a writer is with the mechanics of language, it is the imagination that makes the difference. Her characters, which she has said arrive fully-formed in her mind, are so vivid as to be Technicolor, a welcome alternative to the black and white characters (pun intended) featured in Fifty Shades of Grey. Most especially the heroine of the Crossfire series, Eva Trammell.<br /><br />Eva is not one of those ingénue innocents ripe for the plucking by the sexually experienced hero. She's got a sexual past even hotter than his -- and every bit as troubled as well. Childhood sexual trauma broke something in her, causing her to turn to sex as the only way she can connect to men. Yet she suffers from such low self esteem that she's willing to demean herself if only she could get love.<br /><br />Gideon, the hero, gave up on love years ago after a three-year relationship ended because of his own sexual problems, whose roots also extend to childhood. Since then, sex for him has been a soulless series of short flings with random women. As for women he dated, a series of stunning socialites, none of them got into his bed, let alone his heart. He won't sleep with women he sees socially and he won't be friendly, period, with women he screws, because every one of them is destined for the reject pile. Simply stated, the man can be a coldhearted S. of a B.<br /><br />It's a story of two abuse survivors whose lust turns to love and who manage to make it despite overwhelming odds. Psychotherapy plays an important part in the personal journey of both Eva and Gideon, and author Sylvia Day has an especially keen insight into the ways childhood trauma can manifest itself into adult dysfunction. Eva acts out, while Gideon shuts down.<br /><br />Sex scenes are a key component of the narrative -- this is, after all, erotic fiction. But Crossfire also features a crime-story plot compelling enough to cross the genre from romance to legal thriller. Here, it's the villains, that provide the true thrills. Compare that to Fifty Shades where the thrills were cheap in the form of sex toys.<br /><br />New readers intrigued to know more about the series can start with the just released third volume in the five-volume series, Entwined with You. It's not essential to read the first two volumes, for the hallmark of any well-written series is the ability for each book can stand on its own. Once hooked, readers can go back to the beginning for the full backstory of how the characters changed from the people they used to be to the persons they have become.<br /><br />In Bared to You, Eva started out as incredibly insecure, despite all the help she received from a gifted therapist. Deep down inside, she still believed sex is the only thing she has offer Gideon. Circumstances forced her to reveal the sexual skeletons in her past, and from that point onward, she lived in fear that her past would ultimately drive Gideon away. Yet it was his own skeletons that repeatedly brought the relationship to the brink of break-up, because he refused to even accept his past, much less trust Eva to want him in spite of it. Mistrust ate away at them like acid.<br /><br />Reflected in You is a true tear-jerker where Eva's dark past did finally succeed in driving Gideon away -- straight into the arms of his ex, whose sudden re-appearance in Gideon's life destroyed Eva's already shaky trust in him. Or so it would seem -- he ditched his new girlfriend (Eva) for another shot at \\"the one who got away.\\"<br /><br />What really caused Gideon to leave Eva is a secret so shocking that the novel's cliffhanger ending left readers wondering whether the pair of them could ever move past the knowledge of what actually happened.<br /><br />Entwined with You cleverly answers the question -- and the question is NOT whether Eva and Gideon can move past what happened. The question is - HOW will they manage to do so.  The answer takes the readers on a plot roller-coaster ride so exciting they'll line up for another shot -- the shot to learn where the Crossfire series will take Eva and Gideon next in the yet-to-be named fourth and fifth volumes.<br /><br />In Entwined with You, Eva and Gideon finally become secure enough in their love for one another that they cease further destroying what they have together, and they begin to build something that might last a lifetime. However, enemies -- some open, some subtle -- are determined to destroy them both as individuals and a couple. Entwined with You replaces one set of answers about the past with an entirely new set of questions concerning how the past will continue to play itself out.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved this story because of the interaction between the main characters and that it felt that all the other books had been leading to this book. I would say anyone who likes nalini singh books will love this one.
0316247545|5.0|When I was first introduced to MLP FiM by pressure from a friend to view it (he works on the series). I balked, knowing the nightmares of the previous generations of the ponies and whats best described as Hippos with hooves and endless tee hees and \\"Lets have a tea party!\\"<br /><br />Not to mention the annoying human little girls involved.<br /><br />I recall seeing the commercials on the Hub, promoting the re-release (known as Gen 4) and instantly thought \\"Dear God NO!!\\"<br /><br />But my friend Dennis insisted I see an episode...Okay, so I watched one, and Immediately realized something...A: Well written, even for adults, B:Well animated, especially for Flash animation C: NO ANNOYING LITTLE HUMAN GIRLS!!<br /><br />Then my daughter joined me to catch another episode, and even said \\"You hate My Little Pony!\\"<br /><br />I told her \\"But this version is different!\\" And even she agreed that this was a far far better rendering of the ponies.<br /><br />We were both instantly hooked!! And been fans since. Something I can watch with my daughter and NOT want to put a brick through the TV!<br /><br />Yes, we obtained Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD, and had to get the Friendship Express, just to get the original Derpy episode intact (Hasbro, you IDIOTS!! Being all PC like that!!)<br /><br />Then, when ordering the storybooks for my daughter I found this book offered. The Elements of Harmony was just the thing for any fan of the show. I literally left a smoking trail pre-ordering off Amazon.<br /><br />The book itself is a surprising thick book, well laid out, talking about the various characters in the series, including the frequent background characters.(*EDIT* BUT they show Derpy Hooves, but do not discuss her...CURSE YOU HASBRO!!) Plus even concept sketches. Details about Canterlot and Ponyville as well.<br /><br />Plus an episode guild for all three seasons so far and for those who asked, even song lyrics from the various episodes and quotes from various ponies.<br /><br />Overall I am happy that this book was released and well worth the investment. My daughter is already going over it with a glee I so rarely see in a child about a book.<br /><br />Take it from a dad who is also a Bronie, You will not be disappointed!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really addicting game, fun for all ages, but getting gems should be easyer. I would recommend this to family an friends

B00BVYLBP2|4.0|I wouldn't say this show is the cream of the crop by any means, but it's a little different and entertaining.  Tatiana Maslany's multi-character acting is pretty impressive.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series. I don't care that 2 more books are coming out. Gideon and Eva are moving forward and their bond is getting stronger.He sacrificed everything for her by killing Nathan. Very touching.  Beautiful story.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a good games for the whole family. This is a good game if you like animals and dinosaurs
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lead was in excellent character.  He was always for the people and what was best for them, no matter how they treated him.  I'd love a second movie to finish out his life in office.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Our grand daughter loved this season enough we ordered season 2 and now we will order Season 3 for her.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Love the version of &#34;Free Fallin&#34; on this CD.  I only wish that I had discovered this CD sooner. I've been playing this one over and over because it's that good.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|There is so much that happens in this book it made my head spin, but at the same time captivated my interest. The only downside was when I got halfway through and realized, \\"oh no, there's going to be another book because no way all of this can get worked out in the pages I have left!\\"
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you liked Downtown Abbey you will like this series- not as opulent but very beautifully done with fine acting and sets
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very exciting.Good rewards.I would recomend this game to many of my friends.I have been playing this game f poo r a year now.
B0090X4GLW|1.0|This is NOT the actual soundtrack to this movie... this is a redo or a post product!!!  The songs were WAY BETTER in the movie.  One of the songs portrayed in the movie as a boy's vs. girls song actually was sang by both the boys and the girls.  No Diggity wasn't AT ALL as good as the live performance in the movie.  Key songs from the movie was also missing!  This was a HUGE disappointment for a movie that I LOVED SO MUCH!!!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This game was able to guess Anne of Green Gables, Orville Redenbacher, Christopher Columbus and Ted Koppel with no problem. I've only been able to stump the game once, and I think that was more because I gave too many &quot;I don't know&quot; answers for the game to be able<br />to make a good guess. Graphics, music and animation are pretty good. The genie looks so smug and funny when he's close to giving his answer!<br /><br />I'm giving this game four stars (I wish I could give another half) because an app really has to be special to get the fifth one from me. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 20 questions type games. Give it a shot; this one is a lot of fun.
B00942XS04|5.0|For the past three days the only thing my 3 year old wants is to watch professor Finn McMissile...  Good movie for grown UPS too as I enjoy it equally

0062101897|5.0|I've been wanting this book for some time, since I had seen a copy last year when I went to the NY Discovery Center Harry Potter Exhibition.  It has SO much in it.  I think putting together a movie and beginning with story-line drawings, picking actors to play the charactersl, etc is so very interesting and takes a lot of work and preparation. It never fails to amaze me. I was very happy with this book. I would also like to get the &#34;red book&#34; on Harry Potter, have heard a lot of good things on that, also.  But I'm very tickled that I've got this book to sit down with!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got very frustrated with this game because it wouldn't update but i have gotten over it good bye minecraft computer
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I would recommend this book to a friend or co-worker. The season gave me the opportunity to see the characters come to life!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Very good book and it is just like the Percy Jackson series that also makes it very predictable I knew what was going to happen chapters before it actually happened because everything was so similar.  But very good over all book
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a wonderful novel on so many levels. So sad to read about the orphanages in Iredland. It was a very heartwarming and uplifting to think that a loving relationship can make such a difference in a child's life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited months for this book thinking that it would put all the pieces together.......yeah not at all....a woman madly in love does not act like Eva does...she finds every male from her dad to Angus sexy....just wrong....I wanted to punch her for some of the stupid things she did. The sex scenes dragged on too much...we get it...they are hot for each other...I guess since I thought this was the last book of the trilogy (instead of book 3 of 5) I was expecting some sort of an ending and not a tease.....Will I buy the next 2 books??? Probably not...I have enough imagination to end it how I want. Just can't help feeling like I was cheated out of $30 for the first 3 book only to be asked for $20 more to get the final story...when the last 2 books actually come out...Good for You Sylvia Day for milking this cash cow....but from the reviews I have read...you just may have lost a ton of fans....
B009IF8CH6|5.0|For those of us who can relate to this odd group of Nerds, this is the best show on T.V.  I love it, and recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is great! I love it.....its just like temple run but even better!You must have it you get chase by a cop and his dog!You can jump on trains, dodge obstacles,use a jetpack and hoover boards but thats not all!!!=)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book takes a different perspective with the zombie craze. It chronicles different accounts of the war with wonderful creativity.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I'm not a core science fiction reader and in fact I'm fairly new in this genre.  I read this novel as it was recommended to me.  It has an interesting premise in which those that have lived a full life have the option of going into military service and the chance of a new life in a younger body.  The story is easy to understand; the language is crisp and it follows a fairly simple and linear plot.  Scalzi sets in this book an interesting world where humans are amongst the most technologically advanced race in the universe, but may not be the best well intended one (or maybe they are???).  I'll have to see in his next books to find out where this tale ends.  It was an entertaining story, but by no means the best book  I have read.
B009LA6US6|3.0|This is a collection of rather musty Victorian stories that are largely entertaining.The book is effectively split in two.First, you have have your \\"horror\\" stories.Then, you get stories of American artists studying in Paris and the models they cavort with.THE REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS is easily the best horror story here.Brimming with paranoia and a vision of a secret world waiting to engulf us, one can see why this would have intrigued H.P.Lovecraft. Of the artist stories,I enjoyed RUE BARRE the most.It contains some honest social class commentary and the stories trajectory and conclusion are intriguingly weird.It's the only story in the book that is somewhat funny.Throughout , the prose in KING is rather purple and the imagery florid.The style pays homage to symbolism and decadence and one can readily imagine  characters in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY reading THE KING IN YELLOW- the mythical play referred to in this book. Although thankfully they get to read A REBOURS instead.<br /><br />A word on this edition , as the previous reviewer noted, the introduction is complete nonsense. It  appears to be about  another person.However at  99 cents , the price is right .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!! So addicted to this game!!!!! My mom and i agree that this is the best game everrrrrrr!!! Just love it!Cx my mom and i go against each other all the time!!!! :):):):):):):)CxCxCx
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This is one of the first timed management games I tried and I liked it so I got the Kindle Fire app version. It's fun to see if I can get things done before night falls. I do wish there was the option for an untimed mode for those times I don't want to compete against the clock and just have fun casually. But I have since purchased other time management games, some with an untimed mode which is cool.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Hooked on the first book, this book you really needed to keep track of who was who, but could not put it down....
B003Y74KAW|4.0|It pushes off the phone easily but for  a cheap protector, it's fine! and I love the color. Nice for a change up!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|After reading  book 1 & 2 could not wait to read book 3.  I could not put this book down.  I totally enjoyed this trilogy Mystery, Action and just loved this young women who had people who believed in her.  I recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Oh how I have been waiting for this book!!! So good but the ending??? Really?! I better not have to wait months and months for book four!!!
B009KHCT94|3.0|One films burning airships at one's peril.<br /><br />Iron Sky starts brightly, with well-rendered pastiche of the Space Waltz from 2001: A Space Odyssey, accompanied not by an Austrian Waltz but a Mid-Western Polka of some sort. It's a nice dissonance. The scene is shot, framed and executed well. The effects aren't Weta Digital, but they're not so far off as to warrant complaint. The picture ends with a riff on 2001 too, come to think of it.<br /><br />American astronauts land on the moon, with no greater purpose than advancing their president's re-election. On their space walk they discover not a monolith but a colony of Moon Nazis, mining Helium 3 (the airship super fuel of the future, apparently). It transpires they have been camped out there since 1945 and they're ready to come back.<br /><br />Cue pandemonium.<br /><br />But first, stop and note: to this point, all seems well enough. The election gag was weak, but otherwise the auguries are good. But then the actors open their mouths. Iron Sky never recovers. Its screenplay and script are equally dismal.<br /><br />Why do film-makers do this?  Vuorensola has done so many things well, but has egregiously overlooked the one thing that doesn't require a multi-million dollar investment, but can single-handedly ruin one: screen writing.<br /><br />A screenplay that is all over the place is an indulgence allowed in a zany comedy (see Monty Python And The Holy Grail, Airplane!, Top Secret, Team America World Police, Spinal Tap) provided the needle on the gagometer stays in the red zone. But Iron Sky's never gets out of neutral. Frequently, it stalls.<br /><br />For a film so wittily conceived, put together with such verve, the hackneyed dialogue and lame pay-offs are a tremendous disappointment. \\"Obvious and overstated, as usual\\", remarks one character of one plot development, without the self-awareness the line demands. Opportunity knocks for a some Sacha-Baron Cohen style outrage. Or even just some cross-dressing slap and tickle. None is forthcoming.<br /><br />Julia Dietze and Chrstopher Kirby struggle gamely with their material, but there is only so much a talented actor can do. The more limited Peta Sergeant and Stephanie Paul make heavier weather of their roles, but in fairness, have even less to work with than Dietze and Kirby.<br /><br />There are some in-jokes (at least, I presume that's what caused sections of the audience to erupt for no discernible reason), a couple of film references that fall flat (a corny riff on Hitler's bunker tantrum from Downfall is used to introduce Vivian Wagner (Sergeant), so comes entirely without context) but mostly the wisecracks are humdrum commonplaces.<br /><br />We have a US president (Paul) who might have made the film, Dr. Strangelove style, if crafted originally and given something clever to say. But being modelled on Sarah Palin, she is a pale rendition of a great idea Tina Fey had five years ago. The comparison is inevitable; Stephanie Paul was bound to come up short, and does, handsomely.<br /><br />This is a dreadful shame: the idea is great fun and, otherwise, the execution is first rate. The production design and lighting are great (shades of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow), the special effects impressive, the editing assured and the camera-work excellent. And all crowd-sourced and run on a shoestring. But, because the cheapest thing to fix was overlooked, Iron Sky is likely to go down like a burning space Zeppelin.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonlap and tickle.

B00COGXX7A|4.0|Romance for the girls and a little action for the guys.  Nice love story!  The guy that wrote this tends to have questionalble endings but this one had a nice ending!
B00BZOFUI2|2.0|I was a real fan of purple but the las few discs are quite the same style. The same kind of stuff. This one is no exception. It has beautiful passages, specially the keyboardist shines, but but IMHO they offer nothing new, at least for me.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book!!! To top it all off all the readers get it a sentence saying the story isn't over???  Come on now, I'm officially done with this series!
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Looks good and relatively inexpensive but dos not keep accurate time. It is self-winding rather than a battery watch but I have it to wear every day. The first one I received worked as advertised for 2 days and then promptly lost over 2 hours. A second one was sent to me and it loses a couple of minutes every couple of days; I reset it but the error would aggregate if I left it alone. A watch should be accurate and that is not the apparent case with this model.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|very nice watch, there were some problems with the delivery but now everything is ok thaks for your assistance, is good to have purchases with you
B00CWV8X04|5.0|PLOT TWIST!!!!!  This movie had us on pins & needles the whole way through, but how it turned out in the end blew us away!  Watch it & see.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  It was really heart wrenching to think that Jamie McCloone's childhood at the orphanage was probably true to life.  Amazing that religious people could be that cruel!  All in all a very good story and I liked the ending.  Seemed realistic to me. The one part that really made me laugh out loud was when Jamie and Lydia met at the restaurant and Jamie had his problem with his toupee.  Still makes me laugh just thinking about it although I did feel sorry for him.  I also loved it when Lydia decided to start really living and enjoying her life.  This is a book that you'll think about long after you're finished reading.
B009R659L8|5.0|First time reading this author, and I wasn't disappointed. Plot line is well developed, and the characters are interesting. I especially liked the suspense. . .
B00BF123WG|1.0|Very poor character development - basically canned stereotypes.  Moves tediously until the end, which arrives at long merciful last and which we all know anyway without having to watch this movie.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Was at first skeptical of Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher (I've read all of Lee Child's books), but was pleasantly surprised with the result. The book One Shot was always a favorite of mine, and I liked how Cruise portrayed Reacher. There were some changes in the movie version, but this didn't detract from the end result.
193700788X|1.0|I recommend to...Don't read. Stay in the delusional state from when the books were good over three books ago.  Sookie is someone else in this book.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Starting the show, having not read the books, was very confusing with a barrage of characters thrown at you very quickly with unusual names.  But even with that difficulty, the show is gripping, and a strong recommendation for anyone other than children.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My four year old and I both enjoy this game.  It is very cute and engaging.  It is simple yet fun.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was written as a narrative and that is my least favorite type of book to read.<br />I found it disturbing - the characters were very combative...<br />it just wasn't' a good read.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I rated it a 4 star because the game pieces are so small that I have to squint my eyes to see them.  Other than that, I loved the variety of lay-outs you could choose from
B008TTPQXA|4.0|I like the experience and the openness & simplicity about the existence of other dimensions. The ending was, unfortunately, quite abrupt.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game was great!  Its great exercise for your brain.  I never get tired of playing it.  Its hard to put down once you start playing it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|LOVE the cast. Well done! Tatyana Manslay is incredible. I can get over cancellation of The Fades now that this series is out. So excited for the second season!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It keeps you thinking of the various possibilities to come up with all the cards to make up the suit and the  time it takes is easy..
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|My husband usually hates foreign subtitled movies but both of us are telling all our friends \\"must see, ASAP\\"...I heard him use word \\"uplifting\\", too<br />Wasn't available streaming on Netflix, but well worth the Smazon price.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|I carry my Kindle Fire everywhere with me and I was so worried that the screen would get scratched that I wrapped it in a wash cloth. The case is much more convenient and less silly looking when I take it out in a Drs. office. Love it!
6305161992|5.0|Showdown in Little Tokyo is an action packed Yakuza smacking film.  Dolph is great.  I especially liked the scene where he smashes his fist thru a door and then yanks the Yakuza bad guy thru the hole from the other side.  Brandon Lee is great too.  He's no Dolph or Bruce Lee, for that matter, but he holds his own in this film.  A young Tia Carrere (age 24 at time of filming) is a knockout.  The hot tub scene where she climbs in with Dolph is memorable.  As with all sword play films, there are some very gruesome scenes but overall not too graphic.  If you saw the movie \\"Black Rain\\" with Michael Doughlas, it's along the same lines.<br /><br />Overall, the movie works.  It's a highly entertaining, never a dull moment kind of film.  Brandon and Dolph are the perfect odd couple team and the film contains just enough sex to keep you interested.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My daughter-in-law turned me on to the game.  I really enjoy playing it  It isn't as easy as it looks.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This has to be one of the best metal albums I've ever heard.  The songs are well written and performed in a way that makes you feel the emotion.  Since I've bought this album I've pretty much shredded my ear drums daily with the ridiculous solos, Matt's powerful vocals, and awesome melodies.  I can't believe that after The Ascendancy I didn't check any of their other material, and it took me this long to get this album.  I've heard some of the newer stuff and it just hasn't impressed me as much as this and the Ascendancy has.  If you're thinking about getting this album it's a no brainer.  One of the things I was disappointed with was on Amazons end.  It said that the title track wasn't available for digital download, so I purchased the hard copy and a digital copy of the album went into my cloud drive.  Low and behold it contained the title track, so I don't know what the deal is there.  I haven't even opened my hard copy....
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is ok although it's pretty much the same as temple run and especially temple run 2 it's kind of a fun game.Anyway I deeply suggest Temple Run 1 & 2 to me it is just the same as pretty much all of the others that's why I deleted it and am giving Subway Surfers Miami a 3 or 3 star rating  even the other subway surer games aren't that good there is also annoying game music.So please take my advise!!!!!!
B008COPZ60|5.0|I loved the song Love Me but don't  know if I want the whole collection .IWill listen to some clips and decide.
1439170916|5.0|This is a wonderful history of Cancer and it's treatment.  Very readable for the lay person.  I thought that the topic would be depressing, but quite the contrary, it shows the difficult work of research and how vital it is.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Nice &#34;in between&#34; Galaga/Galaxian and Phoenix with a touch of Asteroids. Three control modes, all of them very easy to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is easy and entertaining. Just what I enjoy at the end of a long day. Find tools and use them to open cabinets and find the way to open the elevator. The touch is sensitive and so it picks up tools without beating up the inventory. Enjoyable all around.
143350393X|5.0|I was very impressed with the Bible we bought for my son on his birthday.  We were looking for a Bible that had good study helps and this one fits the bill.  I have a Thompson Chain Bible which I love, but I am so impressed with this one that I'm thinking of buying one for myself.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|An unsparing look at love and relationships.  This is such a well-written book that it was hard to tear myself away.  To say more would deprive another reader of the pleasure of discovering the characters and the painful choices we make in the name of love.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|The controls are good. Graphics are good. Takes me a while to get a feel for a game. Well done game.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.  There is always action and suspense.  This book/series is fantastic.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Not their normal fare but a great album none the less! Chances are if you like music as a whole, especially music with a different sound or that pushes the norm than you'll appreciate what Daft Punk is trying to do here. However if you're a die hard Daft Punk (EDM type music) fan than this may not be for you.<br /><br />(One note, I grew up in the 70's and 80's)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is one of the most affectionate tales I've ever read.  A true bonding of family, a true love of siblings that will stay in your heart and mind forever.  What a great talent Khaled Hosseini has in writing such a heart warming story of family love and affection.  My only wish is that it never would have ended.  What a great read!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed 3-D effects and the movements of the room as I solved pieces of the puzzle.  The double click and zoom features very helpful.
B0089LOG02|5.0|When you buy this book, set time to read it because you won't be able to put it down. One of the best books I ave ever read.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|(Review by rebyj)<br /><br />I didn't find Entwined With You to be as bad as some of these reviews have been.<br />The first thought I had after reading it was that it seemed like an episode in a serial than a novel.<br />I did however enjoy it and consider it a \\"build up\\" story that hopefully will have resolution in the next.<br /><br />A lot of readers like myself enjoy a hot scene here and there but we read our fiction for the story and want it to take us on a journey with characters we've got fondness for. The journey in Entwined With You felt like we were packing our luggage but missed the plane. Fun preperation and a great build up of anticipation  but no lift off.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars. I did enjoy reading it but there were just too many hints at story lines that simply never developed enough to get fleshed out or resolved. Mainly where did the Russian mafia come from and why was it even mentioned since it was just tossed in there with no more information.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first 2 books and I'm going to trust the author to take us on the journey in the 2 books to come.
1449320104|5.0|Echoing other reviews it is a great book!  As a very experienced C# developer, I've enjoyed reading it.  One of the nice things about it is that it covers not only 5.0 but also 3.0 and 4.0.  With the evolution of C#, it has been difficult for developers to \\"keep up\\" but this book helps a lot.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again! I am enjoying the emotional, the sexual, the physical and most of all the love of Gideon and Eva and all the evil villains that keep popping from their past! Can't wait to book #4!
B00190N4E4|4.0|Humans never cease to amaze me. This mans life is truly an example for us all. Selflessness is obtainable if only we strive for it.
B00BK5D95C|4.0|I claim no musical training (disclaimer), but the first five tracks on this album are likely the most addictive out of everything else (though there are other stand-outs, like Fitzpleasure and Bloodflood). The rhythm and electronica woven into each track, particularly &#34;Breezeblocks,&#34; is what keeps me coming back to listen. The vocals are probably the most hit-miss among other listeners - some people are going to be driven crazy by lead singer Joe Newman's strange slides, while other people (myself included) will love it. Otherwise, it's an excellent debut, and highly recommended for fans of indie/electronica/trip-hop genres. Did I mention &#34;Breezeblocks&#34; is my favorite? Props for the Sendak reference, see if you can find it.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I typically expect a couple of meh songs, but was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed every single one right off the bat. Demi's best yet.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We started watching Good Wife mid-second season.  Very happy to see it is on Amazon Prime and now we can watch the first season!  Excellent series. Love the dynamics between the cast members.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great case that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Very roomy! I love it.<br />All that I take with me fits in it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was so excited when this book came out (I'm a bit late with my review, obviously), I re-read the first book so that I wouldn't be confused with any information I may have forgotten and I finished this book in one setting when it finally became available on my kindle. The only other series I have done that with is the Harry Potter books. America and Maxon's relationship is put into a pivotal position in this book, and it definitely left me rooting for Maxon more than in the first book. If you need a book to compare it too, like some of the other reviewers said, it was a fluff book, not extremely necessary (think the second book in Twilight, most people's least favorite of the series), but at the same time, I don't think the series would have been complete without this book. It gives some insight into the rebels and leaves the reader wondering who is right, exactly? I definitely recommend continuing on with this story if you read the first one. I for one, cannot wait for the next one!
B0097EWK3A|3.0|it started out easy but as the game went on I could not get over the bridge I am stuck.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I think once you agree to write serial series, you loose your ability as an author to maintain 100% creative license. Does Sylvia Day have the right to write whatever she wants in as many small pieces as she wants? Sure, but then your audience isn't going to come back for more. I give her credit for still being able to come up with new plot twists this far into the series that are actually intriguing but I really was hoping for resolution. The whole time I was reading I felt like I was purposely been led to potential spin offs for subsequent books. Now I realize that our trilogy is having quints. All I can say is, well, crossfire.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|love the game I am good at matching games but this one you've got to fast or u loose out. I stay up past my bedtime knowing I 've got to work the next day.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This was an epic movie. Very breathtaking and emotional. Would recommend to see It at least once in a lifetime.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this bible is great I love it because it's easy to get to the books of the bible.the big thing is there is a narrator.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Talented actors and storytelling that takes risks can bring about visceral responses in viewers, and isn't that what quality entertainment is all about? These characters make people feel - we love them or hate them or are annoyed by them, or root for them, and we keep tuning in to see what happens next. Real surprises, too. You never know what to expect.
