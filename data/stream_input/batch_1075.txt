B00192IV9U|5.0|Got my album on Monday 12/13 and immediately popped it open & listened to it...  There are some instant MICHAEL CLASSICS (Hold my Hand & Monster), plus other very good songs.  I'm glad it's not all slow music, but upbeat and interesting.    Also got the DVD Vision and its very good too, although I was hoping for the full version of GHOSTS which I've yet to find in blue-ray...but still good. It's a shame that Hold My Hand video didn't make it in since it technically IS a Michael Jackson video.
B00192IV9U|3.0|Michael Jackson is back after a 9 year gap back to the patchy Invincible. Although there are moments of brilliance, it is obvious that several of these tracks were cast offs from previous projects or possible tracks for a new album that might have been released had Michael lived.    It is a joy to hear his voice on unheard material and you have to put aside feelings of negativity if you are a person like me who remembers Michael in his heyday. Is it a classic? No. Is it worth buying? Yes, if you are a fan. Behind The Mask is the absolute best track on this set and the rest is not too shabby either. Ideal Christmas stocking filler but Michael just does not stand up against Thriller, Off The Wall, Bad or Dangerous.
0545123283|4.0|My Thoughts<br /><br />I really, really loved the first book in this series, Shiver, and to be honest, would have much preferred it as a standalone. I thought the ending of Shiver was poignant and perfect. However, I do enjoy series and definitely wanted to continue the saga to see where it went.<br /><br />I was immediately upset that Grace and Sam's point-of-view are now joined by Isabel, and a new character, Cole. One of the best parts of Shiver was the intensity you felt from hearing both character's most intimate thoughts about the other. While those thoughts were still present, it was no longer as intimate because we now had 2 other characters to \\"listen to.\\"<br /><br />Granted, I love Isabel. She is fantastically snarky and sarcastic, but it's all a cover up for the extreme guilt she feels about her brother's tragic death. The new wolf, save-me-from-my-thoughts-for-I-shall-perish Cole, was ok. I see how broken he is but I wasn't very attached to him. I did enjoy him challenging Sam about his past and pointing out how alike they really are. There is a very intense scene involving Cole and a doe that made my stomach lurch. I think Cole had to face some personal demons during that scene, and it was definitely emotionally draining to read! I assume we shall see more of his evolution in Forever, which will be interesting to watch. The connection between he and Isabel is interesting, but honestly, did nothing for me. Two broken people pining for one another is not a new concept, and it was a tad `emo' for me. But hey, this is YA...<br /><br />Grace and Sam are still in love and they still made my heart swoon. Sam's distress over Grace's well-being was so heart wrenching. Grace and Sam fight opposition over their relationship in Linger. Grace is a do-gooder by nature and has never stepped a toe out of line, so her blatant disregard for the consequences of seeing Sam shows just how important he is to her. Besides, her parents have left her to fend for herself, providing no emotional involvement. Phooey on them. I loved the scene when Grace escapes to Sam while he's in the shower. She slips into his bedroom, enjoying his army of origami birds, and he enters the room. Such a beautiful scene!<br /><br />Stiefvater's writing is beautiful, rich and engaging. The ending is highly emotional and a great segue into Forever, which I look forward to reading in 2011!<br /><br />My Favorite Quotes<br /><br />My life is in that bed. Please let me stay.<br /><br />\\"You might not want to put your tongue in her mouth; her dad's looking out the window. Also, you'd better hurry,\\" he said, looking at Grace, \\"because in two seconds, I'm going to need you\\" - now he looked at me \\"to pick up my clothes and I don't think you want a parental audience for that.\\"<br /><br />\\"You want to talk? Fine. Talk. Tell me something you've never told anybody else.'<br />I thought for a moment. 'Turtles have the second-largest brains of any animal on the planet.'<br />It took Isabel only a second to process this.

B004FEWYXS|5.0|This CD, like so many before it, has songs with great beats and amazing slow songs. Although we may never know which songs Michael truly wanted to be released on his next Album, I would say these weren't too far off. I am a fan of his CD Invincible (which it seems many fans were not fond of), and this CD is even better. My only regret (other than Michael not being around to be a part of this release :'( ) is that there aren't more songs on this CD! I look forward to the next releases that Sony has promised from Michael's estate. This CD will be in my car/stereo/iPod on repeat for weeks, easily. The King of Pop truly was an amazing artist and this CD proves it!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a great book, after the percy jackson seires being so good i was critcal about this book but it turned out to be one of my new favorites!
B00005JNDZ|5.0|i liked it better than the first one. i like how Bridget has her own unique cuteness that wins over her chubby body and age; i like how easily she gets mad, sad, and happy and her British English. This story is unrealistic but I can definitely understand her feelings and i am sure most women can.Also, Hugh Grant ( i forgot his character's name)is a perfect guy for the sexy play boy character!!
044656740X|5.0|Even though this book was 10 years old when I read it in 2010, the message is still solid.  It was recommended at a conference of college-age entrepreneurs by a successful college entrepreneur, so the book has primary traction with young people.  After hearing the young person's endorsement, I decided it was time to read a business book, and was I pleasantly surprised by the stories and the lessons.  I puchased 5 more to give to our kids (ages 28 to 44), so they can learn, and then pass on the message to their children.  I'll be purchasing the cashflow game for adults - you're never too old to learn!
B000001H00|5.0|I just wanted to give this CD five stars.  I recenlty bought the Hahn Partitas and thought I would ompare them to another master. In a sense it is like listening to music.  The pacing and tempo are different, but i cannot say one is better than the other.  i just know they are both great and have given me hours of enjoyment.
030746363X|5.0|What a great book and a great writer! I've read a lot of books on nutrition and fitness and this was by far the best. I can't wait to check out his other books!
B0015DROBO|3.0|I truly have NO idea what all the hype is about?  It took awhile for me to get into this book.  Usually, I wouldn't bother delving into it further, however, since there was so much great press, I persevered onward.  To say that the ending of the book with all the graphic sadistic, and weird sexual innuendos appalled me is an understatement. I truly have no idea what the hype was all about, but I did Kindle sampled the 2nd book and I can assure you it gets a \\"YEAH? NO!\\" from me.  No way am I going to bother reading future books.  Been there, done it, DONE!
030746363X|5.0|I have waited to read this book for months. It exceeded my expectations. I have a pile of diet and fitness books and this one has completely broken tradition.  It's designed to facilitate the improvements YOU want to make - it's not just another \\"weight loss\\" book. The Four Hour Body is a practical step-by-step guide to self-experimentation and transformation.   We all have different goals and there is a chapter or \\"adventure\\" in this book for everyone.  As a scientist, I am amazed that people will read an article in a magazine, or scan a blog on a website, and not even question where that information came from. Tim has gone the extra step to document - go to the sources- as well as taken the time to self-experiment and distill it down to a place you can start.      He's not limited his focus to one plan or one macronutrient (protein, carbs, or fat); There's even a fantastic section on a Primarily Plant-Based Diet (PPBD) and great (non-political) discussions of Vegan diets. If this is something you'd like to experiment with, the \\"Meatless Machine II\\" contains a 28-day experiment by John Berardi, PhD (meat-eater), who specializes in exercise and nutritional biochemistry. His success with a vegan-diet demonstrates the objectivity found throughout the book. It's not about telling anyone what to do, but giving them the verified tools and foundation to begin personal exploration.     With this book, you can do the same self-experiments, but begin your investigation with the advantage of someone's first-hand experience. I think the integrity of the book can actually be found in the Appendix. \\"Spotting Bad Science 101 & 102\\" is an EXCELLENT explanation of data collection/analysis and what others do to mislead or exaggerate results. Tim even demonstrates these tools by analyzing his OWN Slow-Carb Diet results for bias!  While it will take years to verify all the information in this book, I find it refreshing that he's given the average person the tools to be SKEPTICAL and to self-experiment with a focus on finding success. I fully believe that if anything in this book turns out to be incorrect, Tim will revise that section and be thrilled to have learned something new. Why would anyone give you the tools to disprove their findings if all they were selling was snake-oil?    This book will be the start of a new revolution in transformation. If you have a TRULY open mind and follow this guide, you're going to learn.  It has something for everyone and the price is worth the references alone.
B0001VTPWM|2.0|The second disc, Robocop 2 was defective and would not play at all, so I am giving this set 2 stars.    For MGM to release this with a known defective disc is inexcusable.

030746363X|5.0|I'm an author and receive review copies from other authors and editors daily. As a result, I have a general policy of not posting reviews (although, I've done a few over the years) because a) I don't want to appear biased and b) it gives me an excuse for not writing reviews of books I don't care for. However, I'm compelled to strongly endorse The 4-Hour Body and it's author.<br /><br />I expected a high quality product given the popularity of Tim's blog and the success of his first book. However, just because someone or something is popular doesn't mean it's valuable or effective. (Think: Paris Hilton's foray into music.) Tim Ferriss, and the work he produces, is unique within the self- and business-help industry. In fact, I'm pleased to say it's disruptive. It's like a new kid has come into the class and gets such good grades (read: does such good work) that it has throw off the curve and you realize that what you thought was good is merely mediocre.<br /><br />After reading the entire thing (almost 600 pages) I believe this is the book Tim was always meant to write. In fact, as you'll learn, he's been recording every workout he's ever done since he was 18. He's a research and measurement fanatic. He studied neuroscience at Princeton. And, because he's a non-conventional guy, he loves to go after silly, pseudo-science and debunk conventional wisdom in the process.<br /><br />The subtitle of the book suggests that if you read it you will become superhuman. Obviously, that's a bold statement. But, ultimately, I think that's what the book is about. It's not just about loosing weight, or getting stronger, or having better orgasms (you'd be surprised that a 32-year-old guy can write about how any woman can have a 15-minute orgasm without coming across as a schmuck, but he does it with grace and even good humor). It's about finding the most elegant solutions to solving your problems, accomplishing your goals, and living your dreams.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body is not an \\"Uncommon Guide\\" as the subtitle also suggests. It's more than that. It's a remarkable guide to becoming great at whatever you set your mind to.<br /><br />- Michael Port<br />NY Times Best Selling Author of 4 books.<br /><br />P.S.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|I just bought the Beatles Revolver (UK version) cd on amazon.  And I have listened to it a couple times in my car and just love it.  The UK version from 1966 has 3 additional songs that I have never heard before- I'm Only Sleeping, And Your Bird Can Sing, and Dr. Robert.  So, its like hearing brand new Beatles songs.  Which is great.  Revolver is considered by many Beatles fans to be their best album, although most \\"best ofs\\" list Sgt Peppers as the greatest rock n roll album of all-time.  What I would say is that Revolver is a real ground-breaking kind of album.  The best songs are Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, and Tomorrow Never Knows- the 1st, 2nd and last tracks.  Harrison, McCartney, and Lennon respectively.  I've read Taxman is punk/soul 10 years before punk was created.  Eleanor Rigby was the first \\"rock song\\" to have a string quartet and probably the first to not have any bass, guitar, drum, or keyboard.  John Lennon invented psychedelic music (I think) with Tomorrow Never Knows - my favorite.  One guitar chord, a five beat drum riff, humming sitar and a lot of weird sounds.  And Lennon singing like a rock god.  You don't even need the mind-altering substances to appreciate the musical trip.  Listening to Dr. Robert I thought to myself this doesn't really sound like Beatles, it almost sounds like early Jefferson Airplane.  Then  I read a review of She Said She Said from one of my many Beatle books and it said Revolver started the West Coast or the San Francisco rock sound- the Airplane, Dead, Big Brother, etc.  Never heard that before.  Harrison has a song Love You To that I believe is the first sitar Indian rock song.  I was thinking I don't think anyone followed up on \\"Indian\\" rock, although Jimmy Page's Black Mountain Side and White Summer sound a lot like Harrison's guitar on this one.  My favorite McCartney song on the album- Got to Get You Into My Life, again doesn't sound like Beatles- has a r&b horn section- they had never done that before and sounds like Otis Redding or the Blues Brothers.  Then it has Ringo's Yellow Submarine which some say is how young children were introduced to the Beatles.  Ironic since Ringo later went onto be the voice for Thomas the Tank Engine.  Finally, I'm Only Sleeping has the first backward guitar solo- which the Beatles discovered by accident playing a tape the wrong way and went with it.  It is said that all psychedelic music from that point on had to have backward guitars and other effects.      So, i just keep playing the album and loving it!
030746363X|5.0|Having read the blurb as well as half a blog post regarding this book I think I have fulfilled the minimum effective dose and am ready to change my life! Thanks Tim!
030746363X|5.0|My name is Sean West, and I've got no commercial interest at all in any of Tim Ferriss's companies or the sale of this book.  I'm an avid fan because his first book afforded me alot of freedom to travel, and in the summer of 2009 I went from 204, 19% bodyfat to 170, 9% bodyfat just based on one of this guy's blog posts (also a chapter in this book).  Little did I know, the blog post that changed my life barely scratched the surface.  I think there are 50 or so other positive reviews, shouldn't you just buy it?  You can always sell the book used when you are done, so you're basically gambling $5 on the off chance this dude can dramatically change your life.
030746363X|5.0|Tim's books are great.  Last year I purchased copies of Four Hour Work week for friends, family and several people I work with.  I was lucky enough to get a copy of Tim's new book last week and spent basically the entire weekend reading it.  I'll be picking up a number of copies as gifts again this year.  This book is by no means a fad or something that you'll stick on the shelf and forget a few months after your post holiday workout fix.  There is tons of valuable information in this book.  You'll be struck by how much content you are getting and how well cited the information is.  Worth every dollar, you'll be glad you made the purchase.
B000UR9T82|3.0|For those who love the movies, this is a great box set.  However, for those who look forward to special features, get ready for a great disappointment. There is only one special features disc, for the third movie (by all accounts the worse movie in the series). The second movie, and 2.1, which are in my opinion the best in the series, recieve no real special features, not even \\"the making of\\" documentry.  Bottom line: Great movie quality, no special features.
0446402397|4.0|This is a top notch Russian thriller. It's not quite Alan Furst or Martin Cruz Smith but it's a very strong first outing. Military hero becomes wonder boy cop becomes disgraced cop and is hunting a serial killer of children as The State in turn hunts him. \\"There are no criminals in a perfect society.\\"<br /> A lot of research went into this. Great descriptions that really make you feel the dark aura of Russia in the mid fifties - the tail end of the Stalin era. I'll definitely be reading more Tom Rob Smith. You should too.
030746363X|5.0|I was so excited to receive my advanced copy of the Four Hour Body, and I have been reading it on and off ever since. It really isn't like your ordinary book, let alone your conventional health/fitness/diet book, as you can pick up from where you left off, or start on a totally different chapter. There's going to be something for everyone, whether you're wanting to lose weight, gain muscle, change your diet, run or swim faster, have great sex and the list goes on! The chapters most valuable to me include uberman sleep, cold showers, and occam's. Great work, Tim! This is a masterpiece, and I'm sure it will help thousands like me looking to try something new to improve their health and bodies, with stuff that actually works! Bravo! :)    Long time fan and forever follower,    Angelo

B00371QQ0M|3.0|The hi-def release highlights the strengths and weaknesses of David Lynch's wonderful/horrible adaptation of the classic novel.    PRO'S: Lynch's artistic genius is undeniable. Dune is alive with wild, weird details and atmosphere. The beautiful widescreen compositions are full of fantastic and grotesque imagery. Freddie Francis' gorgeous cinematography never looked better.     The cast is terrific.     The music by Toto is one the 80's great fantasy scores. An underrated knockout.    CON'S: Script is a mess. It feels like what it is: A vast epic chopped down to 'releasable' size.  Needed a LOTR style trilogy treatment.     Special effects are pretty woeful-even for 1984. Where's ILM when you need them?    Action scenes are clumsy and unexciting. Lynch's great attention to detail doesn't translate to the kind of propulsive kinetic vigour this film needed.
B000WS4P5G|4.0|This album is like AC/DC, Black Sabbath,the Cult w/Jim Morrison-type vocals and you get DANZIG! The songs are very classic rockish(the CD is over 20 years old so I guess it is now).If you like your music heavy and stipped down to the basics, this one is worth a listen! I feel as if Im going to Hell just listening to the lyrics.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is one of the best sci-fi films I have seen in a long while.  It delves deeply into the idea of the subconscious mind and reality.  Inception has a pretty straight foward plot and not so complicated concept (can be explained more).  The plot and action of the movie is very intriguing, mind-bending, and keeps you interesting throughout the entire film.  I'm very satisfied with the casting.  Leonardo DiCaprio has another brilliant performance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fine job as well.  At first I was skeptical about Ellen Page, but was quite impressed with her performance in this movie.  Ken Watanabe did a terrific job as Saito and made his character a lot more interesting than I thought given credit to.  Inception is a very good movie, has its Cons.    Like I stated earlier, Inception has a very straight foward plot and concept, but because of that I think it could've been explained a bit more, thus I thought could've been explained thoroughly in a trilogy.  There were alot of times in the movie where I thought Nolan could have been more specific.  The totem concept is simple, but the ending made it a bit confusing (If you're the architect of the Dream, can't you control the totem, regardless of knowing the texture?).  I thought there was a bit too much action near the end of the movie to the point where it made me a bit irritated.  I think if Nolan removed some of the action at the end and added more depth with the plot I would've given a 5-star without a doubt.  The ending of the movie was obviously left hanging and ambiguous for the audience to figure out, but to this point it is still leaving my friends and I with discussions of what really happened.  I like what Nolan did, but at the same time, I want a definite answer, therefore causing me to want a trilogy, or at least a sequel.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie alot and highly recommend everyone to watch it.    If you love sci-fi films, you will not be disappointed.  I recommend renting it if youaren't such a big fan of sci-fi films, but if you are, this is a good movie to keep and watch a couple times if you have the urge to understand the movie more!
1423113497|5.0|My son is 9 and is in 4th grade. This year he has to read daily for at least 30 minutes and write a summary.  He always wanted to read just 15 mins instead of 30. It was a challenge because since he didn't like reading at all, he was having a hard time to write the summary, he was not focusing. I got him this set of books and he loves them.  He even read ON A SATURDAY four chapters.  I was shocked. He remembers all the characters' names, what is going on, and the reading log is so good that his teacher gave one example of a great job, and she used his work to show the class.  I still remember his smile when he told me.  He was so proud of his effort.....and so I am.  Thanks Rick Riordan for such a great work!!!!

030746363X|5.0|Tim has a unique style of writing that is completely distinct from traditional self help books.  Not only does he make you feel entertained, he also makes you feel empowered to do something about your lifestyle.  The 4HB is set to become a very important book in how people take back the power in maintaining their health.  Even if you don't want to be as ripped as Tim, there is something in this book for literally everyone.  I'm more of a sleeper than an exercise fanatic and guess what - there's a chapter for that as well!
B002ZG980U|1.0|Plain and simple this was one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Too many sub plots and jumping from dream to dream. (and at times it was unsure if they were dreaming to back ro reality). Don't waste your time, much less your cash on this movie.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|this is a solid HSF unit. the included 120 mm PWN fan is quiet running at 70%. definetly quieter than the intel 92 mm fan. I installed a 2nd PWN fan on the other side of the heatsink for better cooling as this unit has an option for. it does cool much better than the retail intel HSF as temps dropped from 53C to 46C at idle and 95C to 82C at load on an i7 950. the HSF did not block any ram slots on my Asus X58 motherboard and is actually smaller than the Zerotherm FZ10 HSF i have installed on a Core 2 Duo system. installation is not difficult. you must remove your motherboard from the case in order to install the bracket on the backside of the motherboard. the heatsink fit snug on top of the cpu and moves very little unlike some others have reported.   i would not recommend this HSF to anyone who is attempting some extreme overclocking. the direct heatpipe contact for this unit is actually a drawback compared to units that have one even, smooth finished surface. that one surface is going to cool better than the alternating surface on the bottom of this unit. but for most people who are looking for a cool and quiet pc, the hyper 212 plus gets the job done very nicely.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I couldn't wait to hear this new CD from the late King of Pop and have enjoyed all the tracks they've previewed these past weeks, including the sneak peek of the entire CD. I've listened to the whole thing in its entirety numerous times now, so here's my early review:<br /><br />There's been a lot of hoopla over the pre-released songs from this CD -- but remember -- MJ wasn't just the King of Pop, he was also the king of publicity stunts. And by his own assertion, he was also a master illusionist. MJ knew how to create a buzz, or as he more aptly put it -- SIZZLE -- and his estate is rightfully carrying on with his masterful illusion. I'll run through the advance preview tracks first, then the rest of the CD:<br /><br />First, \\"Breaking News,\\" was released, and the sizzle behind that song was that it wasn't really MJ singing. Personally, I think this \\"controversy\\" was intentionally stirred up by his estate; carrying on the MJ tradition of creating a buzz, building excitement, grabbing headlines, getting noticed and... \\"breaking news.\\" Because if they aren't talking about you, then you aren't sizzling, and if you're not sizzling, then you're cooked and done. It's not my favorite song on the CD, but I do like it a whole lot. It starts out with the audio tuning into different radio stations and news broadcasts, reporting on... who else?... but the latest breaking news about MJ. No one can deny the autobiographical lyrics; an aptly titled tune and apropos first glimpse into this much anticipated posthumous CD from the paparazzi's (and mass media's) favorite target -- Michael Jackson -- but I guess scrutiny like that comes with the territory. It's the price one pays for being the King. This song has definitely grown on me - LOVE it!<br /><br />To be fair, the real credit for creating the art of MJ's sizzle belongs to Joe Jackson himself. Say what you want about the man and his methods, but he's the original mastermind behind all of the Jackson's success, and he laid the foundation for the King of Pop to build upon. Joe taught his children well, and little Michel took the ball and ran with it to heights I suspect even his father couldn't imagine. After all, \\"the estate\\" is also comprised of family, and if they truly didn't believe it was Michael singing Breaking News, then it would not be on the CD. The Jacksons aren't just music royalty, they're American icons. Beyond that, they know how to create buzz; they've been doing it for decades, and arguably doing it better than anyone. They even hired two teams of audio forensic analysts to verify the recording's authenticity; it's 100% MJ, and 100% Sizzle!<br /><br />\\"Hold My Hand\\" was released next, and the sizzle there was that it was an over-produced Akon song with just a smattering of MJ looped to fill out a sparse vocal track. Well, I'm no music producer, or self-proclaimed audio expert timing clips and counting the loops of MJ's vocals -- and with all due respect to the detractors, it all sounds a bit like spinning a Beatles record backwards looking for the hidden message. I'm just content to be an average listener, and on that basis, I have to say I truly love Hold My Hand. No, it isn't Heal The World, or Earth Song, but it IS classic Michael -- a simple yet universal tune that everyone on the planet can relate to, no matter the age, country or period in time. Everyone, young and old, lovers or friends, parents or children -- knows the simple comfort and love that comes with holding someone's hand -- classic MJ through and through. And some of the most memorable songs in history are the simplest with sparse writing and musicianship; and this song is much more than that. It's hip, cool, current and catchy. L-O-V-E it! This could easily be Michael's next #1 hit! And the music video is stunning, heartwarming and bittersweet. To see the way they used archival footage of Michael (some we haven't even seen before) the different races, age groups, and even the disabled -- the visuals ooze Michael through and through; it's clear they had his spirit, memory and intentions in mind. Bravo! Brilliant! A stunning tribute to the late King, and a befitting first video to emerge from his posthumous work.<br /><br />The next song to be previewed was \\"Much Too Soon,\\" an aptly titled ditty since MJ left the world and us all much too soon. Like Hold My Hand, the tune is simple and gentle, yet sweet. I consider it to be MJ unplugged - sparse and delicate music, accompanied by Michael's angelic vocals. I think that's what always impressed me most about Michael's vocals -- his ability to rock our world with Bad or Earth Song, and then a gentle tune like this, with such pure and effortless mastery. Unlike the other pre-released tracks, there was no controversy about if this was really MJ singing, or that his vocals were too sparse. Actually, it was very well received and is a hauntingly beautiful track -- again, classic MJ. The man had a knack for making simple, yet universal tunes that are relatable to the masses, which isn't easy to pull off. Remember, this is the guy who made us cry when he sang about his pet mouse! And we all related that to our own relationships and lives -- simply masterful, and at such a young age! But then, MJ himself said it best, \\"I was a veteran before I was a teenager.\\"<br /><br />Next, a snippet of Hollywood Tonight premiered on the Ellen show, but not enough to really appreciate it. But after hearing the full track, I just love the beat. The song starts with what sounds like a church choir, followed by MJ beat-boxing and free styling vocally before the song reaches full lift-off. Cool song, great beat, high energy and gets you moving in your seat -- or in my case, impulsively jutting my head and shoulders in a lame MJ impersonation. The tune has an interestingly haunting feel, especially near the end. Cool!<br /><br />I Can't Make It Another Day with Lenny Kravitz was the next preview to debut, and the instant I heard the beat, I could just picture MJ grooving and wowing us with his legendary moves. This one feels the most like MJ at his best, and is the most authentic song on the entire CD; like it was plucked right off one of his best selling albums. I don't know what album this got cut from, but it completely holds its own and is on par with his previous works. This song could easily go #1, if handled right. And unlike Hold My Hand, it's not actually a duet. Lenny makes a fantastic musical contribution (I've always thought he is cool and talented) and backs up the King vocally, while the rest is all MJ in full vocal spectrum and power like only he can pull off. What a great song! Sounds like classic Michael from the 80's but apparently was recorded in 2008! I keep listening to it over and over -- Love this one! Go MJ! In other words: \\"Yo Dawg, it's hot, Hot, HOT!\\"<br /><br />Next, there were some very brief audio clips played on Oprah, but that's the basic breakdown of how the previews were rolled out. As for the rest of the CD...<br /><br />One can't help but wonder what Michael would have thought of all this. Or how he would have changed all these tunes had he known they were going to be released. Clearly he didn't see a place for them prior or we would have heard them all before now. But even though these are \\"B\\" tracks that MJ didn't really approve of on some level, they are still sung by the King of Pop and carry with them, all his talent and excellence. \\"This Is It\\" was just raw rehearsal footage, yet remained mesmerizing thanks to the man who was its focal point. Having said that, there's definitely songs here that rise above the rest, while others are a little lacking for me; here's my breakdown:<br /><br />Keep Your Head Up - is a passionate, optimistic song. That's MJ for ya, trying to give us hope and something to believe in. This one can't help but make one feel there's a light at the end of the tunnel (and that it's not an oncoming train!) It's nowhere near the level of Man In The Mirror or Will You Be There, or even Cry, but it's definitely of that ilk. I love it!<br /><br />(I Like) The Way You Love Me - is pure bubble-gum pop; no stellar vocals or hook, and not all that memorable. The best part of the song is the opening, which has a brief clip of MJ leaving a voice mail or speaking on the phone to someone and explaining how he envisions the song -- great insight! I'm not all that fond of the mix, but it's still an ok song. I think a little less going on musically would have made MJ's vocals shine through better. An acoustic version maybe, with less of the airy 70's hot air balloon and rainbows type feel. But then, maybe that's just how MJ wanted it.<br /><br />Monster - featuring 50 cent, has a lot of power behind it with a good hook. I'm not usually a 50 cent fan, but I like it. For me, it's not on the level of other great tracks on this CD (like Hold Your Hand or I Can't Make It Another Day) but it's kinda catchy and has a good feel to it. It's in the same ilk as Jam, but not as good. However, I do find myself moving to the beat and enjoying it; a solid entry within the context of this CD.<br /><br />Best Of Joy - a decent tune, but another one that's reminiscent of a 70's kind of mix. I know it wasn't recorded in that era, its just the impression I got. A bit dated in feel, and a middle of the road track compared to the rest of this CD, but still decent enough. Though it certainly doesn't hold up against MJ's top hits and most famous songs.<br /><br />Behind The Mask - WOW! What an amazing song; definitely one of the best on the entire CD! It has a great opening, a great beat, and the usual high energy vocals we love and expect from MJ. My foot just started tapping all on its own on this one, and I was grooving with MJ before I even realized my body was bopping to the beat. It was just innate and natural; classic MJ, infusing his music and passion into us via osmosis. It's songs like this that make it hard to believe he's really gone -- lively, upbeat and downright infectious. It's vocals like this that made him King. A really great song with a good shot at being a K.O. hit for the K.O.P. -- Hee-Hee! -- Glove to Michael!<br /><br />Lastly, a few words about the CD cover art itself -- just like the Hold My Hand video, this is the first posthumous cover, and as such, it has a lot to live up to; our memory of Michael, honoring his legacy, the invariable criticism that follows him everywhere, even in death. But I think the art work is an impressive collage of MJ's life, career and most significant highlights. Apparently, there's a lot of Sony haters out there, and perhaps with good reason. But for me, I feel like they're making a good effort to put forth a CD his fans will love and appreciate; and the cover art is evidence of that. My sense is that they may not do all the right things at all times, but it seems like they'd like to honor MJ's memory and are as much his fans as the rest of us. It's cliche to blame the big bad money-grubbing corporation for all our frustrations, and there may very well be some questionable things going on behind the scenes. But overall, I do sense an immense love and admiration behind what they're doing for MJ. It's just a little too cynical to blame it all on the greed of making money. A whole team of people are helping to put these projects forth, and they won't enjoy much success (or profits) if their intentions are solely cynical and tainted. I bet most of the people working behind the scenes love MJ as much as the rest of us, and are likely very proud to be part of these new projects and feel a heavy responsibility to do right by MJ, his family, his children and his fans. And speaking of which, MJ's family is involved in all this to some degree too, so that adds to the love behind all this that I'm sensing.<br /><br />A humble word to the detractors -- many people are convinced this CD is a fake, and that it's not really MJ singing. Just like there were many convinced that MJ couldn't handle the 50 dates in London -- but what are those people really saying? -- That Michael was a has-been, that he was completely washed up? That his talent no longer shined as bright? That he lost his voice, his electricity, his genius? That he was so delusional and intellectually vapid that he didn't know his own limits? Surely you couldn't mean that; not if you ever truly loved him and his talents. MJ was a perfectionist and would never have agreed to take the O2 stage if he didn't believe he could handle it; and was likely very proud of his Guinness Record for selling out 50 shows. And as far as this not being MJ singing on this CD -- are those same detractors saying MJ's talents are so ordinary that they are easily replicated by a common impersonator? And WHO is this impersonator, and if they have the talent to flawlessly impersonate the King, WHY don't they have a stratospheric career all their own? American Idol has probably auditioned a million singers over the span of all its seasons -- have they found any Michael Jacksons? Talent like that is extremely rare -- once in a lifetime rare. So I just don't buy the whole impersonator thing. MJ's talents are legendary and can't be duped by anyone. However, to those MJ detractors, I say -- more power to you! Keep those conspiracy theories alive, because it all adds to Michael's sizzle. Because in show business, you're truly dead and forgotten when everyone stops talking about you.<br /><br />Bottom Line -- At first listen, I thought this CD didn't measure up within the context of Michael's entire catalog, shoulder to shoulder against greats like Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, Off The Wall, etc. But after repeated listenings, I have to say this CD is pretty stellar. I'm giving it 5 stars -- because although these are tracks MJ never intended to release, like This Is It, they offer a rare behind the scenes glimpse into the creative process of the greatest and most successful entertainer in history. And that unique aspect alone makes these songs all the more priceless. For me, this isn't about finding a lost hit to rival Thriller, or finding a new Billie Jean; nor do I think that's realistic. It's about peeking behind the curtain to see how the wizard worked, and embracing this talented, unique icon in ways he would never have allowed were he alive. Having said that, songs like Behind The Mask, I Can't Make It Another Day, Hold My Hand and Much Too Soon WILL be timeless, memorable new hits for MJ and will be standouts from his entire catalog not only for their musicianship, but because they are posthumous masterpieces. And incidentally -- if Michael were alive to support this CD with his genius moves, a This Is It world tour, and the invariable media frenzy that would follow -- I'm confident many of these songs would skyrocket out of the stratosphere; a place MJ was quite at home and has always resided.<br /><br />In some ways, Michael's self-created \\"sizzle\\" was designed to keep us all at bay, and only now, in hindsight, are we able to get the intimate look into his life and creative process that we've always craved. No, the MJ of this world would not have liked that; but if he continues to exist in the great beyond, I bet he's quite happy with all of this. Obviously, Michael would have done things differently with all this music were he alive to oversee their mastering; likely he would have kept most of them unreleased. But even MJ's \\"B-side\\" rejects are impressive and better than most artists out there.<br /><br />Much has been said about Sony \\"botching\\" the release of this much anticipated CD, but personally, I think they've done a great job. Face it, you can't please everyone. Especially with someone like the late King of Pop; expectations and emotions are just too high. But they've been quite generous in giving us ample opportunity to hear all the songs in advance, and even tried to appease the King himself by making Hold My Hand the first official single;as MJ himself apparently wanted, via a handwritten note he left behind.<br /><br />Overall, this CD sounds very current and contemporary, and it's such a pleasure to have new music from a man we lost \\"Much Too Soon;\\" as per the aptly titled final track. Truth be told, I like this CD a whole lot. There will be those that won't be happy with anything posthumously released; for the rest of us, this is a great CD from a gem of a human being who continues to entertain and inspire -- a feat few ever accomplish while living, let alone from beyond the grave.<br /><br />Sometimes ya gotta stop griping about what woulda/coulda/shoulda been and be grateful for what we've got -- and what we just got from MJ is pretty darn great!<br /><br />Bravo, Michael... and thank you for continuing to give so generously.<br /><br />Keep Sizzling...being a K.O. hit for the K.O.P. -- Hee-Hee! -- Glove to Michael!   Lastly, a few words about the CD cover art itself -- just like the Hold My Hand video, this is the first posthumous cover, and as such, it has a lot to live up to; our memory of Michael, honoring his legacy, the invariable criticism that follows him everywhere, even in death.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Well what can I say about John Adams that hundreds of reviewers havent already stated... This miniseries was something I REALLY wanted to see but couldnt as I didnt have HBO the $60 and sometimes $70 price point was out of my range for purchase until that killer lighting deal sprawled across my screen on Black Friday where I picked it up for a SHOCKING $18.99!!! As far as the series goes, I agree with most of what is written here it was kinda dark but I was engrossed with the characters and felt drawn into the time it portrayed.<br /><br />General Washington was great! Never knew he ponied up men (1k) or the defense of Boston when it was quite in opposition to \\"rebel\\" I thought the continental congress scenes were awesome. I wish too that more Jefferson stuff was included especially down the road as some mentioned for the second election. I thought his Paris exploits were terrible to his own right and that when he comes home his children hardly no him/visa versa... That was a terrible thing to see.<br /><br />I thought the overall feel for the story was again fantastic, it really takes you there I do admit to have never read the book but will be buying it as I loved 1776/ I think HBO should do a follow up on this book that would be extremely awesome!<br /><br />With Band of Brothers (overall Favorite hands down book was great too) and making my way through the Pacific I have to say that their history docu-dramas are really turning out to be sensational in my opinion.
0316098337|5.0|Told through the voice of a five-year-old boy, \\"Room\\" feels disjointed and awkward at first. I almost gave up after five or six pages--and what a shame that would've been! By the twentieth page of Emma Donoghue's tale, I was in wonder, swept away into a world cramped and dark, but also full of love and hope. Ma has been trapped in a suburban garden shed for seven years, kidnapped by a lonely bachelor. Young Jack is the result of her kidnapper's unwanted attention, and yet Ma finds new reason to live through this beautiful, strong-willed child. It's a premise that sounds like something from the latest news flash, or from the reports of the Austrian man who held a woman in his basement for years.<br /><br />Jack is an unforgettable narrator, giving us glimpses into Room through his broken English. Though highly intelligent, he is sheltered beyond belief. Aside from the TV that is allowed by their kidnapper, Jack would have no insight into the Outside. Even so, he later says in his own words: \\"When I was four I didn't know about the world . . . Then Ma told me about if for real and I thought I knowed everything. But now I'm in the world all the time, I actually don't now much . . .\\" Jack and Ma begin to imagine a way of escape, and the results of their attempt are surprising, inevitable, incredible, and entirely believable. Donoghue has created a masterpiece, entering the psyche of a sheltered boy and revealing his hopes and fears with marvelous literary and imaginative skills. Over and over, I was amazed at the authenticity in Jack's responses to the world around him. Ma, too, responds to her shifting world in ways that are tragic, courageous, and humble. In the end, together, their responses lead to a poignant and understated conclusion.<br /><br />Through the course of the story, we see that Jack enjoys making word salads, combining two words to form new ones. He knows he must be brave even when he's scared: he must be \\"scave.\\" And, when he runs into a situation that is cool but also scary, he calls it \\"coolary.\\" It's a fine description of this novel, cool, scary, dark, and full of light. In \\"Room,\\" my favorite novel of 2010, Emma Donoghue has created a work similar to a Van Gogh--crude, yet vibrant and colorful; childlike, yet unmistakably genius.so scary, he calls it \\"coolary.\\" It's a fine description of this novel, cool, scary, dark, and full of light.

1423134206|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2JTJPZ7AJHDV2]]Of the three books from The Archive Series, this is my favourite. It covers design or the concept art for animated films.<br /><br />This 256-page hardcover is filled with beautiful character designs, background paintings and storyboards. There are Mary Blair's paintings, wonderful layouts from Hans Bacher, the Lilo and Stitch drawings from Chris Sanders, pastel colour scripts from Bolt animated films and more. The art here is way more colourful than the previous two volumes on Story and Animation.<br /><br />There is work dating back to the 1920s up to the latest animated films like The Princess and the Frog, and even Tangled. You will be able to see how the art has evolved with time, and the various Disney artists that have worked there and some are still working there now. There are so many styles to look at, from pencil animated characters to watercolour scenes to oil paintings.<br /><br />If you have other Disney art books, some pieces of work are actually repeated, but about one fifth of the them are published here for the first time. Even so, this is a wonderful collection to get. And if you have to get only one volume out of The Archive Series, I'll recommend this volume.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and inspiring collection.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of the best ever funny Chrismtas movies or Griswold movies for that matter.  On TV, they cut out a lot of the funny stuff (that they aren't allow to say).  We watch it several times a year around Christmas.    If you've somehow never seen it, buy it, you won't be sorry.  If you don't have a Cousin Eddie in your family, be thankful.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy still has the creative edge. Along with his new guitarist, they make what I feel, an excellent production team. This is a far better CD than Black Rain. I've been an Ozzy fan and Black Sabbath fan since the early '70s and a few of the riffs and \\"momentum shifts\\" in a few tunes on this CD harken back to the fresh sound of Black Sabbath way back then!

B000A0GYD2|5.0|How ironic that the candidate that Tom Hanks supported is now ending America's manned space program.    This DVD set tells the amazing story of Project Apollo. I know the history of Project Apollo well, and I consider this series to be quite accurate, and entertaining, I highly recommended it.    NASA was implementing plans to return to the moon until President Obama canceled the Constellation program and America's return to the moon.     Obama's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy's liberalism and Obama's.     Kennedy's was an expansive, bold, outward-looking summons. Obama's is a constricted, inward-looking call to retreat.   Fifty years ago, Kennedy opened the New Frontier. Obama has shut it.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What more can be said about \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" consistently ranked among the world's greatest films? It's funny, and gripping, and suspenseful, and gut-wrenching, and the final scene makes you want to stand up and cheer, with happy tears running down your cheeks.<br /><br /> George Bailey is a quintessential American in this most American of films: From childhood, this bright, energetic youth wants to \\"shake the dust of this crummy little town\\" Bedford Falls from his feet, see the world, build things, do great deeds. But ... while his mind wants to do things for himself, his spirit instinctively and unhesitatingly drives him to help others. He saves his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in one ear in the process; he saves his part-time employer the druggist Mr. Gower from accidentally poisoning a family with a prescription wrongly mixed while Gower is mourning the death of his son. Later, as an adult, George Bailey saves his late father's savings and loan from the clutches of the grasping millionaire Henry F. Potter, the \\"meanest man in town\\" who puts us greatly in mind of Ebenezer Scrooge.<br /><br /> George marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary Hatch. The scene I remember the most clearly from the first time I saw the film, as a child, was the one where little Mary whispers into little George's left ear, which she believes he can't hear out of, \\"George Bailey, I'll love you 'til the day I die!\\" I've often wondered if he really didn't hear her -- or whether he just showed a remarkable self-possession for a young boy in not reacting.<br /><br /> Potter, thwarted in his efforts to destroy the Bailey Savings & Loan, finally calls George to his office one day and offers him \\"the chance of a lifetime\\" -- employment as Potter's properties manager, at an un-heard of (in 1946) $20,000 a year, trips to New York City and Europe for himself and his wife ... One thinks of Jesus Christ wandering in the desert, and Satan appearing and offering him all theriches in the world if he will only betray his mission on earth. George Bailey almost succumbs -- until he shakes hands with Potter, realizes what he's about to do, and with an angry wave of disgust, says, in effect, \\"Get thee behind me, Potter!\\"<br /><br /> The years pass, George and Mary have four children -- and then one day George's kind but bumbling uncle, Billy Bailey, loses $8,000 in cash of the savings and loan's money while on the way to deposit it in the bank. Events quickly spiral into the crucial night of George Bailey's life.<br /><br /> All is resolved happily in the denouement, of course; Americans have always demanded happy endings. This one is almost overwhelming, with all the people who have appeared in the film gathered in the Bailey living room on Christmas Eve, having come to the rescue of this unselfish, self-sacrificing man who has helped so many of them. As the camera pans all the by-now familiar faces, the crowd sings \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\" One is reminded of certain Shakespeare plays which also ended with a sing-along by the cast. Meanwhile, George, Mary and little Zuzu, their youngest child, decide that Clarence the Angel's saying, \\"Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings,\\" is true indeed.<br /><br /> The casting and direction of this movie are impeccable. It was the last and greatest of Frank Capra's series of \\"triumph of the little man\\" movies. James Stewart probably never gave a better performance; Donna Reed, not a towering star, was nevertheless just right as Mary Bailey. Lionel Barrymore's villain Potter is convincing to the nth degree. Thomas Mitchell, one of the great character actors, does a wonderful job as Uncle Billy, whose simple goodness is attested by the animals (the crow, the squirrel) who fly and scurry to him as to a close friend.<br /><br /> Is \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" the best movie ever made? I don't know; most reviewers wouldn't rank it quite that high. But it's a wonderful film.
030746363X|5.0|From the moment my advanced copy arrived, I knew that Tim's latest book was a breakthrough read.  The 4-Hour Body is filled with information that will make an instant and positive difference in your relationship to your body.    Tim Ferriss is one of the unique authors who puts his words into practice and is able to show his readers exactly how to emulate his success.    No matter what topic you turn to in The 4-Hour Body, you will find well written, on-the-ground experience reduced to the essentials of taking action and finding personal success.  Now I want to be clear that I haven't tried everything in the book.  I know, from personal experience, however, that in a few sections of The 4-Hour Body, Tim has distilled work that took others many years to perfect, into a simple and engaging how-to, that has the potential to literally transform any couple's physical relationship.  This alone is worth the price of the book if you read nothing else in the book.    Tim's writing style is fun, engaging, and highly informative.  If you care anything about your body, you will not be disappointed when you open this book, whether you you actually take action from the information in its pages, or simply sit back and be entertained.  Either way, you will win.
6305041156|5.0|Not only is RAN a great film, the disc I received was in perfect condition, not seeming the least bit used.
030746363X|5.0|This book really has it all. I understand anyone just reading the list of topics on the back will be skeptical because it just seems too good to be true, but this is the real deal. Tim has been there, done that, and lived to tell about it, and we can all benefit from the wisdom he has presented us with here. Great job!
030746363X|5.0|Tim's book is a bible for both men and women as far as health and vitality are concerned.  Tim's writing style makes this a page-turner instead of a big yawn like other Authors writing about health.  I love that Tim is his own Guinea Pig/mad scientist:) and won't recommend something he hasn't tried himself ad nauseum.  So I TRUST his opinion, recommendations and research. I think that Tim has this subject nailed and I think this book should be a staple in every household because there is something for everyone there.  Plus, it is always great to hear about Tim's Sexual Exploits lol! and I'm hoping that guys brush up on their  bedroom skills after reading this book! I highly recommend this informative and captivating must-read.

I have no idea why he says his name in this song as he has never done it before. The whole album is amazing and if the others over the next ten years I can't wait.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Really, I can't imagine how they could have made this final Toy story movie much better than they did. It's got action, laughs, and a whole lot of heart-touching moments. My wife was in tears a couple of times, and I felt my own eyes water up at one point. Great movie for the whole family!
B000A32KJQ|4.0|Typical ECM fare this - a sparse, slow tempo recording where the instruments have plenty of space to breathe. Although on paper this is a Manu Katche CD, in practice it's the rest of the band that take centerstage with Katche happy to play a mainly supporting role. If I had to summarize this album, I'd describe it as \\"friendly, listenable jazz that could easily serve as background music or would reward concentrated listening''.    It's good but because it doesn't break new ground, it ain't great.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|This film is a classic revenge film. You will like this film because Butler has acted very well and some of the action scenes are like a good quality thriller. The story is very lacking and though Jamie Foxx made a great Ray Charles - in this film he made me question his being an actor. He was very average. The whole film revolves around the character of Butler, there are some action scenes, prison scenes, half intelligent dialogs and grit but that's about it. I felt the ending was so so, please watch this film before buying it blindly. Not recommended for a younger audience.

The book provides readers who are willing to think out of the box with a viable alternatives for achieving their fitness goal. More importantly, I believe it will show readers that \\"conventional wisdom\\"must be questioned. Previously assumed limitation of the human body are shattered in within its pages. If people are willing to try his suggestions, this book will cause a paradigm shift.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|When I saw the ads for Avatar last year, I have to say I was very excited. According to Fox and James Cameron this film will change the face of cinema and the way we saw movies will never be the same after Avatar. Boy, that was a lot to take and like a lot (and a lot) of people around the globe I couldn't wait to see it in the big screen. Finally the day came and I went to see it anticipating a wholle new era for films. This are my thoughts after I saw it in theaters:<br /><br />The film brakes new ground in every possible technological aspect. Pandora is a masterful creation and is the greatest scenary I've seen. I can't believe all that world was done in computers. It looks so real and breathtaking. Performance capture was also promoted to a whole new level and the Na'vi and Avatars look so real that was indeed a whole new experience in this aspect.<br /><br />While visually the movie has no match, in the story department it lags a little. A cliche story, enviromental message, some wooden performance and a not so original screenplay detracts the movie from being the true ¨New Cinema face¨ that Fox was claiming.<br /><br />Nonteheless with this problems, the movie is really solid entertainment. While you might pick some of this problems, your experience will still be pleasant and you are for a real treat in the world of Pandora.<br /><br />After I watch the movie in theaters, I knew that this movie was great if somewhat overrated.<br /><br />While I did like the film I am not a die-hard fan of it. I never bought the barebones Bluray that came last April knowing that a better edition will come. And what an edition it is!!<br /><br />Avatar looks fanatastic in bluray, in fact I think is the best bluray transfer I've seen. Is even more breathtaking than in theaters. Sound is equally impressive, very dynamic and clear.<br /><br />In this edition you can choose for three versions of the film: the theatrical edition, the special edition re-release (with eight more minutes) and an all-new extended edition (with 16 more minutes). I haven't seen the extended edition yet but soon I will and will update this with my apreciation of it.<br /><br />This is a three disc blu-ray set so you have 2 bd discs full of Avatar goodies. You have 45-minutes of deleted scenes some of which I would've liked to see in the final version. \\"Capturing Avatar\\" is an hour and a half documentary that covers everything on the production of the film and is fantastic.<br /><br />YOu also have galleries, deconstructions of scenes, an enviromental documentary called \\"a message from Pandora\\", screen tests, trailers and more. Without a doubt this set is one of the best of this year and one of the best ever.<br /><br />While checking other reviews, I saw a lot of negative reviews which only argument for a one-star review is that this set is lacking a 3d blu-ray. While I understand that some people is into 3d (I'm not) and Avatar is the best 3d film out there, awarding one star to an excellent set like this one just because of that seems rubbish. Come on, if you double-dip from the barebone BD to this set, you also will buy the 3d BD when it arrives. You must understand that Fox will milk this film as much as it can and I'm not saying that is correct but that is the way it is. For the majority of us who hasn't \\"upgraded\\" or care about 3d this set is the definitive edition of Avatar.<br /><br />Overall my score is like this:<br />Movie 4/5<br />Picture 5/5<br />Sound 5/5<br />Bonus features 5/5<br /><br />If you like Avatar this is a no-brainer purchase. Totally recommended!!utes). I haven't seen the extended edition yet but soon I will and will update this with my apreciation of it.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I would love to write a review but I never received my DVD in the mail.  Partly me fault, but it would be nice if Amazon would let you put your own send to address in your order.  Then I would have gotten mine in the mail.  So if you have ordered from Amazon in the past and you have moved they keep your old address in the send to space even though you have ordered from them with your new address several times.  They claim that it is your fault no matter how many times you order from them.  That's why I started using other places to order books and cd's and dvd's from.  I never have a problem with them.
B0038BBA4I|3.0|After reading all the hoopla, I was expecting something really exciting.  I'm sure it is to some.  The music is certainly listenable, but just doesn't reach down deep enough to touch my pocketbook.
1416550550|4.0|\\"The Secret Garden\\" was my favorite childhood novel, so when I saw the title of this book and the picture on the cover, I was curious as to why a contemporary writer would give her book an almost identical title. I found out why as I read. The connection was slightly surprising and a bit contrived, but it worked for me, perhaps because the entire book carried through the same quiet, soul-searching tone as \\"The Secret Garden\\" did.<br /><br />When I began the book, I felt as if I was reading the last page first. And I detest finding out what happens to the characters on the first page. But I stuck with it and I'm glad I did, because the author skilfully wove a mystery into how the characters' lives interconnected and ended up as they did.<br /><br />Although the storyline traced the lives of three generations of women, for me, it was Eliza's story. Eliza was the most fleshed-out character -- the most lively. I would read the novel again just to get to know her better.
B00192IV9U|1.0|When I heard about the announcement in March of a new MJ album by Sony I was thrilled. Some fans said it was wrong of Sony to capitalize off of his unreleased material, but due to how nice the This Is It film was it seemed that a new album could only help his legacy. I would go on various fansites and the memebers were all anticipating this album for months. Finally in early November the album was finally announced. At first I thought it was kind of weird to have artwork of him in every era and call the CD \\"Michael\\" but then I thought I didn't care. I didn't want to be nitpicky and knew it was the music that mattered. After the announcement of the album some Jackson family members including his brothers, children, mother, and father all said that it is not his voice on the album. Me along with the rest of the fan community thought it was a made up story by the Jackson family who wanted to cause controversy like when Joe Jackson said that This Is It used body doubles, only to later withdraw that statement.     On November 8th the song Breaking News premiered online, I couldn't have been more excited. For the first minute or so of the song it was a funky instrumental beat and I was about to burst in anticipation of hearing the King of Pop's voice on this song. All of  the sudden I hear this strange voice saying \\"Everybody's talking the news of Michael Jackson\\". I thought that maybe there are other vocalists who take part in this song and was anticipating when Michael's voice would show up. I would occasional hear his screams which were blatantly sampled from older songs, and was waiting for his singing part in the song. I kept thinking that they picked such a terrible back up vocalist to duet with him and thought Mike's vocals could save the song. Before I knew it the song was over and Mike didnt sing at all besides a few grunts and mumbled words. Me, along with most of the fan community could not believe what had happened with this song, how could a company as big asSony publish a song like this under Michael's name? Well, it turns out that they were duped into not only buying 1, but 14 of these fake songs which were sold by Mike's friend Eddie Cascio and 3 are included on this album.    During the controversy some tabloid organizations who usually trash Michael started saying how great the song was and that his voice had just changed between recording 2001's Invincible and these 3 tracks in 2007. However, anyone who has seen the film This Is It knows how his voice sounded and although some playback was used, it was always apparent that Mike was singing vocals.     As made evident by Michael's nephew Taryll and brother Randy, the Eddie Cascio songs were copy righted just a few days after Michael died, and the Estate of Michael Jackson executors were so busy trying to start projects that they didn't even visit Mike's funeral. After the deal with Sony was made the executors visited the Cascio home, listened to the songs which were suspiciously only in finalized versions (no demo tapes, accapellas, or work tapes) and decided that the sounded enough like Mike and spent millions of dollars on the Cascio tracks. The reason Breaking News and the other Cascio songs have not been removed from the album are because the Michael Jackson Estate Executives who bought the songs do not want to lose their jobs due to negligence and that the upcoming holiday release of the album was imminent.    Ok now after the long back story I would like to break down the album track by track.    Hold My Hand- Demo leaked in 2008 online, was never a favorite of Jackson fans due to how cheesy it is but it seems like the perfect radio friendly song for fans of newer pop music. The mastering the have done to the demo and the inclusion of a new string arrangement along with additional MJ vocals that weren't in the internet demo made this song worthy of the Jackson name. 7/10    Hollywood Tonight- Supposedly recording in the 1999 Invincible sessions and additional vocals were added to it in 2007 by Michael, this song is another upbeat radio friendly dance track which is heavily designed to sound like newer pop artists. The vocals have obviously been autotoned, however it is unapparent if this was Jackson's intent or not. His nephew Taryll has a long speech during the bridge of the song that drags on just a bit too much but Mike's energy saves the song once the bridge is done. 8/10    Keep Your Head Up- The first Cascio track, style of the song is made to sound just like a song Michael would've written. The song is so cheesy and uninspired that it is laughable. Whoever the singer is sounds like some bad 90s boy band singer. This song is the biggest disgrace to Mike's legacy. 0/10    I Like The Way You Love Me- Sounds more polished than the version which was already released in 2004's The Ultimate Collection, has a nice intro which includes Mike beatboxing the rhythm over the phone. It's a great song but this should've been a bonus track for a deluxe version instead of a rerelease of the same song trying to say it's new material. 7/10    Monster (feat. 50 cent)- The most blatantly fake Michael Jackson song I have ever heard. The singer goes into a falsetto many times that sounds nothing like Michael. Its supposed to be a song about how the paparazzi are monsters, but Mike's days of constantly being stalked by tabloids were very light in 2007. Although I hate rap, at least 50 Cent's part is better than the song itself. Another song that tries too hard to sound like Michael Jackson, but so much so that it is an obvious fake. 0/10    Best of Joy- Probably the biggest gem of the whole album. A unique song that will make your heart stop from the first trace of his voice, it is this magic that only the real Micheal Jackson can have.  A ballad sung entirely in trademark falsetto where Jackson says \\"I am forever, We are forever\\", it sounds like a new style of song Jackson was creating that cannot be categorized. The song was recordeda few months before his death in summer 2009. So touching that it almost brought me to tears, and a great performance by Michael. 10/10    Breaking News- Already discussed in detail above, however I would like to say that having a song like this right after hearing Best Of Joy is disgusting and sucks away the magic Best of Joy created. 0/10    Another Day feat Lenny Kravitz- This song was put up online in January 2010, and is a great rock and roll song recorded during the 1999 Invincible sessions. The version here is a bit less powerful and hard edged than the version that was leaked online, however the vocals and instruments are cleaner. Knowing the soft type of album Invincible was, I believe that this is probably the way Michael intended the song to be. It is softer than the original but still rockin. 9/10    Behind The Mask- The vocals of this song were written and recorded by Michael after he heard the 1979 song of the same name by Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra. There were vocals he recorded in 81 for Thriller, which didnt make the cut and vocals recorded in 1985 for Bad which didn't fit in well with the rest of the album's tracks. His keyboardist Greg Philianges recorded and released version with him singing Michael's lyrics in 1984. This was the song I was anticipating most when \\"Michael's\\" tracklist was revealed. The song starts out with crowd noises and a jazzy saxophone, which really builds up energy for the rest of the track. The awesome Yellow Magic Orchestra instrumental kicks in with Mike beatboxing to it and his vocals are pure gold. The techno sounds are both futuristic sounding yet retro at the same time. Mike's voice is so high energy and this is probably my favorite song on the album. I believe Mike would be proud that this song was finally released. 10/10    Much Too Soon- A soft folk song which was recorded originally in 1987, then again recorded in 1994 to be released as an extra song on HIStory which was originally going to be a Greatest Hits album with just 1 or 2 new songs. The 1987 version has been online for a month, and what is released here in the 94 version. A touching song about love and rejection, and it is definitely a new style for Mike. However this really should have gone after a song like Best of Joy instead of the upbeat Behind the Mask. This is the perfect album closer though. 9/10    How is it that something that millions of fans around the world were wanting to buy was ruined so much that fans are keeping their money to not support what Sony has done to Michael. The album definitely has some great genuine Jackson songs, but since the rich stubborn Estate Executives have decided to keep the fake songs on, the whole project is a huge disrespect to Mike. I hope that fans realize what Sony and the Estate are trying to do with this, they are setting us up for an infinite supply of \\"lost MJ tracks\\" which are recorded by the Cascio track impersonator whenever Sony decides they need more money. The fact that there are dozens of real legitimate, great Michael Jackson songs from throughout his career on the internet such as Hot Street, Work That Body, Xscape, and Blue Gangster to name a few, makes it apparent that there are tons of great Michael Jackson outtakes from his 30 years as a solo artist. Don't buy this, don't let Sony fool you into giving them money for fake tracks, by not purchasing this you are encouraging better treatment of Mike's legacy and the future release of real outtakes that the fans and world want to hear.

Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee almost personifies cancer, tracing its life story back 4,000 years.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|We have both the 1st & 2nd seasons of The Legend of The Seeker. We love the show, and watch this dvd series, when we want to escape to a Fantasy type realm full of Magic, Sword-Play, Great Characters, and Good vs. Evil. This series was based on the same book series that can also be enjoyed once found. The show follows the books somewhat, but of course with so much written material, much of the storyline is left out of the show. This doesn't take away from the enjoyment of watching this fun series though. If you enjoy Fantasy type genres, then you may indeed enjoy purchasing this and the 1st season for yourself. Great Fantasy Fun!!!
B004BLTNJI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. The music used in the movie makes it even better. I have bought two copies of the movie and plan on buying the new version. It's a bit eerie, but I like that Coraline is sort of a heroin and not easily bullied. She stands up for herself and saves the day. Good movie!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|A Christmas Carol, remake, that's sure to entertain both adults and children alike:) This movie revisits/revisizes this classic tale, and adds todays technology of computer generated animation to the tale. Jim Carrey depicts the old, miserly, & not so friendly Mr. Ebeeneezer Scrooge. The charming tale of C. Dickens follows the storyline quite well!! Although, I will say, I myself coming from a generation prior to the computer age, that this classic tale is more enjoyable in earlier accounts both on film and in plays, this movie still brings a fun themed genre to the current times:) I highly recommend this to any Christmas/Holiday lover!!! Great Fun!!!
B003WTE886|1.0|She sucks. Her songs are terrible. She's a bad song writer. You would think she's 12 years old based on her lyrics when she's really 21. Her voice doesn't sound good at all, especially live. She needs to go away.
B000I0QM04|1.0|I recently bought this DVD.  There is a sneaky factoid that is not available to the buyer until they break the seal and open the box.    Basically the notice indicates this DVD may not run.  That's Madison Avenue speak for \\"Will not run!    When you insert the DVD, it provides a on-screen note that it is updating something.  Apparently it is really hard to do, because at the 1 1/2 hour mark, the DVD was still running and thinking about it.  If you make a move to shut it off, another note pops up and tells you not to do that.      Everyone that wants to buy this movie has probably seen it before and that's why they are buying it. So I'm not going to review the movie.    My observation is, when a purchase is a crap shoot, I would prefer the probability of the product being \\"dead on arrival\\" be stated on the OUTSIDE of the package.    If I had the money, I would buy the DVD manufacturing/distribution facility, have it bronzed and left in place as a living memorial to the enormous amount of BS there is in this world.    Zero stars for this turkey.    Jim

0865479186|5.0|I was lucky enough to pick this up on a visit to England. I opened it on the flight home and was riveted for six hours.    First a caveat:  This is not the best-organized book I've ever read. American readers will have trouble following some of the regionalisms, both of language and of media coverage of health issues.  (As Goldacre points out, ridiculous media hysteria over \\"health scares\\" are almost always limited to a single nation.)  As an example, if you've never heard of the MMR debacle, I suggest you go to the index of the book and if that doesn't work, Google.  The book unfortunately references the problem several times before the primary discussion of it, and even then, I don't think Goldacre ever really defines what the controversy was, or even what \\"MMR\\" stands for.    That said, this book is so brilliant and so important, it gets five stars from me despite the flaws.  Also, even despite organizational problems, Goldacre has a readable and often quite dryly humorous writing style, which adds to the enjoyment.    \\"Bad Science\\" is an eye-opening introduction, written for the non-scientist, into the critical questions of what constitutes proof of cause and effect in the health sciences, what is required for valid research, and what to look for when you hear health claims.  He very clearly and easily leads the reader to understand such intimidating concepts as \\"reversion to the mean\\".  Do you think you know what a placebo is?  Well, okay, you know the basic concept, as I did when I started the book; but I was astonished and delighted at the breadth, depth, and importance of the placebo effect.    If read any health advice in the newspapers or magazines, or even watch the (comparatively competent) Dr. Oz on television, you will be astonished at how much of the advice is unproven, untrue, or possibly even dangerous.  If you have a sneaking suspicion about the claims of weight-loss products, and yet feel pulled in by those before and after pictures of fatties whohave become lean and trim (and usually tan, LOL) after taking the product, this book will teach you how to tell the valid claims from the invalid.    And don't think doctors necessarily know this stuff.
030746363X|5.0|I first discovered Tim's writing on his blog - specifically, his work on fitness and nutrition. When the book was announced I had mixed feelings. I had found the information on his blog to be great (it actually worked!) and expected more of the same, but I was concerned the book would largely be a collection of those blog posts. My first suspicion was correct (more good content), but my second was wrong - though he does include material from the blog, it is expanded and updated in such a way that makes it even more valuable. By giving glimpses of the material online, I feel that Tim was able to even more effectively fine tune his protocols and have insight into what we, as readers, would have questions about. And of course there is a ton of new material covered (this book is BIG)! I'm glad to say there is enough content here to easily keep me busy for a year : )
B000YABIQ6|5.0|A refreshing TV series with brilliant dialogue and scenes where nothing is said but so much is communicated.  Very atypical.  It's 1960 so there is rampant sexism, drinking, smoking (even pregnant women b/c nobody knows the health risks yet) and many relationships lack any emotional connection.  The clothes are elegant, the stories are typically very good and the music matches the period.  The supporting cast are particularly better than in most shows.  HBO turned this one down so they lost it to AMC.  Woops.  WHEN WATCHED: November to December 2010; MY GRADE: B plus.

0399536108|5.0|Chris Guillebeau is well-known for his kick-ass goal of visiting every country before he turns 35.   He has a deserved reputation as a travel ninja, and has books about that on his site.    This book is about more than that.  What's almost as well-known as his travels is that his traveling is part of a conscious, well-thought out, altruistic life plan, based on personal responsibility, creating meaning and leaving a legacy that motivates and assists others.  This book is a compactly written, compassionate and direct manual for you to do the same, on your own terms, from your own values.    He says it right up front in this book: if you don't care, if you don't want to work hard and make your work count, this book is not for you.   For all the reasons he mentions, this isn't for everyone. The faint of heart need not apply.     For the rest of us, a huge community worldwide, this book is a battle cry.   This book is a direct challenge to being pecked to death by the ducks of conformity.     This is aikido writing. No aggressive confrontation: instead from a stance of self-awareness, a powerful, perceptive force of ideas.   Wham, and we're relocated into possibility. We are shifted back into our own lives.  We are left upright, active, sure-footed, and moving toward who we really want to be.     > All of you who know there's more to you than you currently act upon, buy this book now.   Get inspired. Live your own life.   Make a remarkable difference.
B004BSEKH6|4.0|This album to me has the right about of rap and pop to it. I like rap and r n b, weirdly pop. This album definitely has what I want on it. The pink haired barbie trying hard to be the best. She is definitely on the way to going there.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|Sew me I like this more than Casino Royale but I'll explain why. Directed by Marc Foster I though he did a good job for what he was given. It picks up from Casino Royale which I like when sequels do that & make it like it's 1 big movie. Daniel Craig Judi Dench Giancarlo Giannini & Jeffery Wright all return. Mathiew Amarlic as Dominic Greene Joaquin Cosio as General Medrano & Olga Kuryueko as Camiele Montes. Like I said it takes place right after Casino Royale you open up with a pretty good chase scene & a cool opening theme by Jack Whit & Alica Keyes. During questioning of Mr. White about his organization Quantum then 1 of M's body gaurds turns & almost kills M & tries to escape & enables Mr. White to escape. Bond chases after the body gaurd that turned. They discover that he had contacts in Hati. We are introduced to Camiele Montes & finds out about Dominic Green & he's working with Bolivian General Medrano. Camiele figures into the plot cause Medrano killed her family. Bond investigates further on Greene who runs Greene Planet a ecological organization. Bond is blamed for the murder or a CIA agent & his credit cards are revoked then he turns to Mathis for help. M sends a field opertive strawberry Feilds to bring him back to London. Bond has to put the moves on her so he can continue the mission. He attends a party hosted by Greene Bond meets up with Camiele Mathis was attacked & put in the trunk of Bond's car cops pull him over in a struggle Mathis is killed frmaed for the murder. Bond & Camiele accquire a plane but they are shot down they parachute into a sink hole Bond discovers that Greene is trying to dam Boliva's water supply so the villains are kind of lame. Felix Leiter tells Bond that Greene & Mondrado will meet eco hotel which leads to a action packed finish. QOS began pre production before Casino Royale started filming so to those who say it was rushed it wasn't 1st time a opening theme was a duet. The original release date was suppose to be May 08. PaulMcCartney turned down offer to write & sing another opening theme. 400 women auditioned for the role of Camiele. Paul Haggis finished the final draft 2 hours before the writers strike began. Shortest film of the 007 series. 1st to be a straight sequel. I like this movie more cause with a action movie I watch them usuallly for the action even  though the villains were lame they were bad in Casino Royale too I just pay attention to Bond going for redemption. Daniel Craig does a good job he barrowed some tricks from Timothy Dalton LTK style. With CR I really didn't care if he came back but after this I would like a sequel. Judi Dench is great again. Olga Kuryunko she was good Mathiew Amarlic was ok Joquin Cosio was ok. Marc Foster brought a lot of energy to this movie it's shot well. I saw this in the theater I like it better than Casino Royale sew me.
030746363X|5.0|It is mostly the approach that should teach us. Think differently, be smart and exhaust the barrel of doable effective tricks.<br /><br />Thus, i see tim as a giant of thought and action rather than a mere writer. And a source of inspiration.
B000MNP2K8|2.0|Deciding to start fresh with Casino Royale. Directed by Martin Campbell he did a better job with Golden Eye honestly. Daniel Craig plays James Bond now. I'm glad they brought Judi Dench back as M even though it's a reboot. Mads Mikkensen plays Le Chiffre, Eva Green as Vasper Lynd & Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis. Story is James Bond has recieeved 007 status & he's tracking down Le Chiffre who is a financer for the worlds terrorists. Bond has stopped Le Chiffre's plans to blow up a Skyfleetar so Le Chiffre sets up a high stakes poker game to recoup his losses. He also joins with Vasper Lynd from HM Tresury & he meets a contact in Monternago Mathis. Now don't get me wrong I think this is an ok movie it had it's moments it's better than Die Another Day. But the poker tornamet scenes are way too long it slows the movie down. Cause it should've focused more on building up this new Bond up & the action you get some decent fight scenes some good action. I love the scene were Le Chiffre's henchies find the body of this big guy that Bond killed it was pretty funny. I liked that Bond was given depth. But they did drag it out with 25 30 minute poker scenes. The torture scene where is well done they think Mathis is a insider but it turns out later that he isn't. I do like how they delt with Vasper she had no choice to betray Bond. Bond finds out who was behind it Mr. White which leads to our next movie which I like better. This was the 1st Bond film to feature Mathis. Daniel Craig was the 1st Bond to be younger that the film series. An origins story was planned after The Roger Moore series but Albert R Broccli rejected it cause he felt audiences weren't intrested in a younger Bond. Craig was Barbra Broccli's 1st choice. In some countries it was released in 2007 which was neat. This is the highest grossing movie in the franchise. Sean Connery was rumored to direct in early production. The Venice sinking sequence took 3 weeks to complete. In 04 while Brosnan was still James Bond hesuggested Quintin Tarintino. Pirece Brosnan was considered too old to play Bond. Martin Campbell agreed to direct cause he had no other projects at the time. Longest Bond film so far. It would've costed $30 million to have Pierce Brosnan to return. 1st Bond movie to have Bond leave alone. Martin Campbell I don't know if his heart wasn't in it but he didn't have the same impact from Golden Eye. Daniel Craig gives an alright performance. Judi Dench gave a great perfomance. Eva Green wasn't bad. Mads Mikkenssen didn't get me as the villain. Giancarlo Ginnnini was good. Next Quantum Of Solace & I'll explain why I like it more.

6305754969|4.0|This is one of the great movie remakes of all time.Not as good as \\"Rio Bravo\\" (my personal favorite western)But this film is fun and first rate entertainment. This is one of those movies that you always got to watch when it comes on T.V. even if you own the DVD.
B00005JNS0|5.0|After receiving this movie, I decided to go through the reviews, and was totally disgusted at many of the 1-star reviews. Those people totally downgrade every movie and make this movie to be all horrible when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about. I was appalled at that one moron who whined about how this isn't a good \\"Christian\\" movie because there's some name-calling in this movie by some of the cars in the script.<br />Get a life, you schmuck. This isn't some Bible movie you bought, so get over it.<br />This movie was excellent! I can watch it a thousand times and never get tired of it. I'm also looking into buying the sequel too. And considering that over 800 people made reviews of this movie and how barely a handful of them are one-star reviews, the others clearly know what they're saying when they claim this movie rocks the house.<br />I'd give it a lot more than five stars, but that's clearly the highest you can go. What a shame!

030746363X|5.0|Just as he did with the 4-Hour Work Week, Tim Ferriss has taken all his knowledge, experience, and research to create an outstanding book. This giant book covers a great range of hacks and upgrades for the body.  Tim explains in the introductory chapters that he has not only consulted with top athletes, physicians, trainers, and field experts but that he has rigorously tested much of this material on himself.    The book is organized so the first few chapters give an overview of the process involved in upgrading your body and lead into the meat contained in the rest of this large manual.  The remainder of the book is laid out as a choose-your-own adventure of human improvement.  If you want to lose weight, gain muscle, have better sex, get better sleep, repair injuries, or increase athletic endurance, you can jump right into that specific chapter and get to work.  Tim's writing is clear and direct to the point with a little humor thrown in to make it even more enjoyable.  For those that are interested, he's also presented a lot of the science behind the results in sidebars, which I find fascinating.    This book is an amazing source of knowledge presented in an easy to read, straightforward manner.  With all the research presented here, increasing your body's potential for greatness has never been easier.
0375826742|3.0|With slightly diminishing results, Christopher Paolini weighs in (literally - it's 750-odd pages) with what was to be the conclusion of the dragon trilogy he started writing when he was 15.   He (over-) packed the story with so much, that he stops in the middle here, with a fourth (and promised final) installment to come when he finishes the next doorstop, I mean book.  I'm a completist, it's a character flaw, and I started reading these so, dadgum it, I'm gonna finish them, but Paolini doesn't make it easy.  Taking all the ideas of Tolkien and adding dragons, he continues the chornicles of the war for Alagaesia, completely with strange Germanic-sounding languages and names, long diversions into drawf politics (I'm not kidding) and a chapter entirely devoted to how to forge a sword.  Now, of course, MOBY DICK has a lot about knot-tying, but Paolini is not Melville.  The suggestion that I hated this, though, is not a true one.  It's still an enjoyable enough tale.  It's just that what should be a romp is something of an epic slog and I just wish it were a little fleeter.  The older this young writer gets, the more convinced he seems to be of the need for length.  He should check in on Suzanne Collins and her HUNGER GAMES to see how much you can pack into so much less.  Still and all, when the big, heavy last volume arrives, I'll surely be one of the nerds reading it.  Me and my dragon.
0345505387|5.0|i am a fan of the outlander series and believe this is a must buy for any other fans ....  getting to see what jamie and claire look like through diana's eyes (or as close as we'll ever get) is priceless.    as for the storyline, it adds a little more detail since it is from a different perspective than outlander, which makes it a fun read.  i am not a graphic novel fan (seriously, i had to confirm i was looking at the panels in the right order at one point) but IMMENSELY enjoyed the hour it took me to read and analyze these pictures.
030746363X|5.0|At first I was skeptical I'd ever read this book. After all, the flip side of all that \\"obsessive research\\" Tim Ferriss has put into this, is length and detail.    Didn't happen for a moment though; plenty of anecdotes balance out the detailed 'how to' steps and the sheer craziness of some of the self-experimentation keeps you hooked.    Given that Tim Ferriss became famous for outsourcing - it's fitting his latest book has effectively allowed me to outsource a bunch of left-field fitness-research-experimentation (that I'd never even think of, let alone do).    The best way I can think to describe the book is real life meets google analytics. For anyone who ever discovered an unexpected massive boost to results from wild experimentation and obsessive testing... with a webpage... this is the same philosophy applied to your life.
1926778103|2.0|The art in this book is great - I've been a big Joe MAd fan for a while now so I was excited to get this guy when it was first released.  If anything I feel like the editors packed TOO much art into the book - there is hardly any writing, but there is so much that the size of the sketches is sometimes frustratingly small.  Still all-in-all the content is GREAT!<br /><br />The issue lies with the binding.  The glue completely separated from the pages after the 2nd time I opened it!  It seems from the other reviews that this is a common thing - Pretty lame/cheap binding job it seems - beware of that before you buy.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss has done it again. If you enjoyed \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" and have even a passing interest in being slimmer, stronger, healthier, or better in bed (and really, who doesn't?) \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" will hit the spot. It's an extremely well documented hacker's guide to the human body - any one of the hundred or so tips in the book will make a noticeable difference in your health. The book is all about hacking your biological systems to produce maximum results with minimum effort. Before reading it, I expected some pretty radical methods (knowing Ferriss). However, what is really contained inside is documentation and the results of the radical methods Tim undertook. You don't need to implant a blood glucose monitor to benefit from the fact that Tim did.<br /><br />In addition to tons of specific body hacks, there are two overarching themes to the book:<br /><br />1.) Measure everything, trust your body. There's a lot of \\"wisdom\\" out there, but the ultimate truth is what produces results for you.<br />2.) The best diet or exercise routine is the one you actually do. Tim spends a lot of time coming to routines that are repeatable and easy to follow. Everything is designed to help you actually stick to the plans, which is really 80% of the battle.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|so hard to explain. mcr is my fav band, the songs are just awesome!<br />it just keeps getting better every time :D
B00192IV9U|2.0|Hold My Hand - 7  Pretty good, despite Akon being in it.  His non-singing actually hinders a great tune, however if your can listen beyond this it holds the weight.  Hollywood Tonight - 9  Awesome.  Perfect kind of track that would have fit well on Dangerous as well as some the other unreleased Dangerous tracks.  Love the \\"When Doves Cry\\" - like synths and the funky bass.  The melody and the lyrics are well done.  Keep your Head Up - 1.  Fake vocal track with samples of Michael Jacksons acapella of Earth Song at the end. He may or may not be in the background vocals, however the vibrato and his delivery are off from what Michael Jacksons voice shounds like.  I give it to them for making it anthem-like...Michael trademark kind of songs  I Like The Way You Love Me - 7  Never got into this song that much even on the Ultimate Collection (which features the original demo version).  Its a bit cheesy, however catchy.  Monster - 1.  I do like the lyric effort in this fake track.  It sounds like something Michael would sing too...problem is that he is not singing.  Believe there is a sample of Michael Jacksons voice from Sunset Driver in the beginning...  Best Of Joy - 10  I completely love this song.  Unenieable favorite track on the CD in my opinion.  I really love the hard fingersnapping and his adlibs at the end...wonderful.  The melody is unique and harmonized very well.  Breaking News - 0.  Wow..for them even trying to put samples of Michael Jackons voice in the song again from Another Part Of Me and the \\"aaah!\\"  from Bad.  thenerve of them to do this is rediculous!  I really hope Sony learned not to associate themselves with fake tracks ...when there are REAL Michael Jackons leaks coming out on the internet now like \\"Do You Know Where Your Children Are\\" and \\"Blue Gangsta\\"  Behond The Mask - 9  Awesome...my second favorite song on the album.  The remix is well done, however I feel the original music would have fit more with his vocals from the 80's.    Much Too Soon -8.  Very sweet and a great closer on the album.  In the end...I ended up replacing the fake tracks with some leaks that came out recently..\\"Do You Know Where Your Children Are\\", \\"Blue Gangsta\\" and \\"Slave To The Rhythm\\".  Other than the other bunch of unreleased tunes Michael has out, I am still flabbergasted why they would hurt Mike's legacy with that..but in the end...with some adjusting it is a great release...
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is a great cd as well as a great band as soon as I heard them on the radio I immediately knew I had to get their cd. Plus I was able to get it on Cyber Monday for only $4... No regrets!!!!  :)

0756665949|1.0|not bad, but some of the info was false. check out lostpedia if you don't believe me. also it's kind of boring. not extremely well done and doesnt really answer anything.
030746363X|5.0|First of all, in 100% complete transparency, I have met Tim in person at a few business conferences, but I'm not a close friend or anything... So this review isn't biased.  Now with that said, I did receive an advance copy of this book 2 weeks ago, because I'm a fitness publisher myself, so I wanted to have a chance to review it before release. Therefore, I have had a chance to go through and read most of it.<br /><br />As others have said, this book is a monster at over 500 pages! At first, that intimidated me because I'm a slow reader.  However, it's broken down into bite sized chapters that can be read quickly and you can skip around without having to read the book from front to back.<br /><br />Even with my slow reading, I've been flying through these chapters... some of the stuff is just so interesting, you don't want to put it down.<br /><br />Some of the experiments Tim did on himself and others are really cool.  What I like most is that Tim doesn't just give a hypothesis about the results he \\"thinks\\" a particular test will give...for example, if he thinks eating a certain amount of a particular type of fat 2 hours before bed will give you a particular hormonal response, he actually backs up that theory with actual blood tests he did on himself or others.  That's the great part of this book, he has actual proof of the results of different experiments.<br /><br />When I read through a book, I use those little yellow tabs to tab pages that I found something particularly interesting or noteworthy...and I've already got about 60 pages tabbed in this one.<br /><br />The experiments with the ice baths, ice bags, all of the tests with herbs and spices and other little known supplements... very intriguing stuff.  He's definitely a \\"mad scientist\\" (in a good way) with some of the tests he's done.<br /><br />Any negatives of this book?<br /><br />Well, overall there was only about 10% of the chapters that I wasn't very interested in.  About 90% of the chapters were fascinating to me and applicable to stuff that I might want to try.<br /><br />I definitely give this 2 thumbs up.  One of the best fitness books I've read in years.to try.    I definitely give this 2 thumbs up.  One of the best fitness books I've read in years.
1608870081|5.0|This Harry Potter pop-up book is a delightful summary of four themes in the books.There are only for large pop-ups but each is well-illustrated and wonderfully complex. Additionally, on each page there are between one and three additional small detail pop-ups. I refer to this book as a summary because it does not tell the specific story of any of the Potter books but rather very nicely brings together major themes that appear in many of the books.  This is a worthy book not just for a Potter fan but for any serious collector of pop-up and other movable books.
B002ZG9846|5.0|It's not a movie for kids, and of course, it's not \\"Oscar\\" material, but it's a fun-to-watch action flick!<br /><br />The fact that it comes in DVD, BluRay, and digital formats, with plenty of special features, makes this a great value. You should also watch the making of the film. It's really cool to see how Chloe Moretz trained for the role of \\"Hit Girl\\".<br /><br />If you just want to have fun, see some great action, and get plenty of laughs, this is a good film for it.
B00436GNVC|1.0|Sorry, have not bought this album, so my comment is limited to listening to the samples. Think that is enough though. Did buy her first album, and saw Duffy in concert in a small  venue.  Where's the great band that backed her?? I'm hearing lots of \\"producer\\" designed music in the samples, but not that great band. Rockferry (and IMHO Duffy as a singer) works so well because Duffy's unique voice was  in front of some great musicianship. Oh well, wait for her third album, and hope she gets together with another great band to work on both writing and playing the final product. Cheers.
0525421580|3.0|This is another \\"young adult\\" novel that will probably hit home more for the teen set than it did for me.  It's an interesting enough story of two high school boys who have the same name and their friends, but it's a bit superficial.  If you are still in high school or middle school, and if you're gay, it's well worth the effort and will probably have a somewhat profound effect on you.  For the rest of us whose high school years are further behind us than we care to admit, feel free to skip this one unless something in particular about it grabs your attention.  It's not bad, but unnecessary.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|I worked as a dental assistant. I was over 50 and children would respond to my brightly colored eye glasses, grey hair, smile  and this watch. Adults, also enjoyed the watch and am pretty certain I was a walking ad for Lego.  Making a band exactly the size and color combination is a plus.  The light weight in hot weather was great.  It started many conversations when I would be shopping and I met many interesting people.  The clasp broke and I contacted Lego and they sent me a new one at no price.  The reason for the 4 instead of a 5 is you can't replace battery.  I tried but failed but it lasted for a very long time so is a minor complaint.  At such a low price I will replace it unless someone in the family puts one under the Christmas tree for me.
B0043RGY60|5.0|I haven't bought a CD in a long time - newbie fan of this band - they don't disappoint.  Love it!
030746363X|5.0|I did not follow the directions of the author, using it as a buffet of information and skipping around.  Instead I started at the beginning, and read through.   And I'm glad I did.  Even in the chapters which did not seem applicable to me I gleaned useful information.  Tim did an excellent job self experimenting to find minimal effective dosages of activities and lifestyle changes that could improve your well being.  I will certainly not be implementing them all, but those that I have begun using have already shown great effect.  I'm sleeping better, eating better, and shedding pounds.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Sigh No More is a great CD.  I had never heard of Mumford and Sons until hearing some cuts on WXPN out of Philadelphia.  I loved every cut they played and when I got the CD, I discovered even more I loved.  Start to finish a great piece of work, that really holds together.  The lyrics are moving, the music fantastic and they put it all together with passion.  Our 11 year old son loves it too.  I have to steal it out of his CD player so I can listen to it.  There is something deeply spiritual going on here.  I grant that I might be reading into it a bit since I am a minister, but they find depth that hits both emotional and spiritual places.  I give this CD my highest recommendation.
0399215921|3.0|Just a quick note - I didn't see that anyone before me had mentioned it.  This is the MINIATURE version, which I didn't realize until I opened my box to find it.  $7 for that?!?  Seems pretty pricey.  When I finally reviewed the listing I saw that they do say it's a mini-version.  So...what can you do?  Just be warned, this is a small, small book!
B003V4AK8E|1.0|When I first bought a ps3 I was hesitant because I really liked the x box controller's design over the dualshock 3. So I went online and googled \\"xbox shaped ps3 controller\\" and what do you know the power A pops up. After reading the reviews on best buy, walmart, amazon, etc... I only heard of the dead zone problem but I decided to give it a shot anyways. I ordered it online at bestbuy and started playing it. At first it felt exactly like the xbox controller and the grips felt nice and I really wanted to like it but...    THIS CONTROLLER IS NOT WORTH BUYING. I had it for a week before I noticed the problems. It's true there is a dead zone, I played Black Ops for about 8 hours a day for a week and it started falling apart on me too. The analogs kept on getting stuck on the sides and the buttons eventually started jamming on the 7th day. I get its true that 3rd party controllers are cheap in quality. Anyways, I returned the power A to a bestbuy near my house and now I just ordered a silver dualshock 3 on amazon. While waiting I've been using the dualshock 3 that came with my ps3 and I have to say i really feel the difference. STICK WITH THE DUALSHOCK 3 IT IS A MUCH BETTER QUALITY REMOTE, in the sense of feel, lightness, and button/analog stick response.
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|This is not a music CD, but is a mini documentary. It is cute to see, but not what I wanted.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|This album is, in my humble opinion, the best album of 2010. Each song is amazing, with deep meanings, full of emotion and uplifting (though it speaks mostly about sad themes). Mister Hutchcraft`s voice is stupendous! I like all the songs of the album, something that never happened to me before. The only regret that I have is that this album does not contain the song \\"Mother nature\\" and the band`s incredible cover of Kylie Minogue`s song \\"Confide in me\\" (I personally consider the cover better than the original). Thank you HURTS for your wonderful music!
1401324029|4.0|What you see is what you get. If you like the TV show, you will like the books. Its light and fun and is a good read. Has fun with the banter between them like on TV. As for a who done it book, has just enough to keep you guessing.  Glad I own it, and will buy the future books as well.
B00192IV9U|4.0|No it's not Thriller or Bad or Dangerous or Invincible or OTW but its all that is left. All that Sony and his estate will allow to be released... Please keep this in mind when listening. Some of the vocals indeed have more vibrato then I've ever heard from Michael's voice and the only song that I really really liked at first listen was the piece with Lenny Kravitz...Remember this is all we get love it or hate it...I suggest everyone listens to the samples that amazon has provided and judge for yourself.  Be at peace MJ
0375756728|4.0|I regret having put off this book as long as I did, but I must say that I did not like it as much as I thought I would. I guess I was thinking too often the movie I so loved (the 1994 version) since there was so much that had not been in the movie, making it more drawn out and boring at times. However I still loved the characters and the tale. I was not as awed by the ending either, since it seemed more drawn out than in the movie. Though this is not my favorite classic I find it a very important one, and will surely read it again in the future.
B003THN75G|5.0|This Season Is Awesome So I Bought The Whole Season. It Has A Good Plot And Funny Comments And Remarks To Go With It.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This album is great for what it is, a posthumous release of unreleased songs.  I'm not sure about all the allegations that some songs aren't MJ's voice.  Seems to me any record company would be out of their minds to do that.  They could sell just as many albums without 3 fake songs and include some other songs to fill it up (like some of the stuff off ultimate collection).  So me, I don't buy the impersonater theories some people are so positive of.    Don't try to compare to the major albums, just buy it and enjoy.  Or just buy it so the 3 kids don't have to grow up and get real jobs like us!
030746363X|1.0|This book serves as an excellent example of what happens when an individual has way too much time on their hands and chooses to use it to focus on themselves. He comes off as quite self absorbed, and while this on its own would not discount the information provided in the book, I see that a large majority of it are just reposts from his blog. Quite disappointing.    UPDATE:    After reading a comment, I realized I should go into a bit more detail about what I didn't like, but I don't feel like spending a ton of time so I'll just say whats on my mind. I expected that this book would contain minimalist strategies for improving health and fitness, but instead I found the interventions to be quite time intensive and complicated, and several of them required paying attention to your body (and lab tests etc) to a degree that I just find very uncomfortable. If a reader wants to be as obsessive as Tim is about his body, thats up to them, but personally I feel it is a losing and frustrating battle. For example, with regards to his chapter on living forever, I could die in a car crash tomorrow, and then what would all my testing and metabolism micromanagement do besides isolate me from my peers and the vast majority of humanity who are more concerned with having meaningful social connections than ten percent body fat? I already exercise and watch what I eat quite carefully (one might even say I'm Paleo (Gasp), I just like things as simple as possible. Let me say that other people may not feel this way, and thats totally fine.  For them, this book may be quite useful. I don't mean any disrespect.    UPDATE 2    Even worse then I thought. Just for an example, the chapter on reversing permanent injuries. How does taking 15 pages to relate how going to Charles Poliquin to get Active Release Therapy help anyone. Its just a testimonial, albeit for a provider that no normal person could possibly have access to. But saying \\"I had active release on my shoulder and it helped, amongst other things like surgery (which he admits to having) and various oral medications (which he also admits to taking)\\" couldn't possibly sell a book. The worst kind of hype is here in this book.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought a copy of this movie for my granddaughter who is 9.   I'm certain she will love it.   All dog lovers will LOVE this movie.  It's a tear jerker.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I still can't stand it when movie writers have to use God's name in various ways and so frequently. God has nothing to do with the actor's issue.<br />What a cool story though. I really enjoyed the plot!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Very interesting movie.  I was amazed at the footage they had of inside and on top of the Twin Towers.  I was expecting a lot of reenactments but was pleasantly surprised with what they had.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Thank you, Temple Grandin, for fearlessly writing this book, so this eye opening movie could be made from it.  As a mom of an Aspie, I have watched this movie again and again.  It is a heartwarming story, although difficult at times to watch.  My husband and I have been given great hope through this movie.  I recommend this to everyone, and believe it should be required material for all teachers.  There is no exaggeration in the movie. If you live with someone with Aspergers, you have lived through most of this movie, and you will be glad you saw it. Watch, pray, hope, believe!  Look at what Temple made of her life!
B00192IV9U|5.0|In one way this music should never have been released because MJ was such a perfectionist - as someone who has listened to his music for nearly 20 years I know instinctively that all tracks except Hold My Hand MJ would not want released as 'finished' tracks on a proper solo album.  He might want them released as 'demos' and the like.  Hold My Hand however, he would have been happy with as a first single as he always went for those mid tempo songs for a first release ( a sort of a warm up) - Girl is Mine is an example on Thriller.    On the other hand, they have been released and therefore deserve to be given the credit they deserve as unfinished pieces of work; there are some very good tracks that could have been 'album tracks' such as Breaking News, Keep your head up, Much too Soon and Hollywood Tonight.  If they had been strong enough finished pieces then Another Day and Monster might have been singles.      Behind the Mask needs singling out as a fantastic throw back to the early 80s funky MJ - its incredibly infectious and interesting to listen to; vocals are great, Yellow Magic Orchestra sample is so cool - if you are an 70s or 80s kid this will take you back! You can also see how this band influenced alot of MJs mid 80s work.  However, there is a reason MJ never released this before; dont know what because I love it but probably because it didnt fit on the Bad album - it isnt 2010 and MJ always wanted to be a pioneer..one of the reasons why if you listen to 2001 Invincible Album it sounds as fresh as anything Rhianna, Black Eyed Peas, Alicia Keys or Jayz put out today.      So altogether; Michael is comforting for fans who just want to hear his voice on something they havent already heard a hundred times.  Its interesting for general music lovers just because MJ is an important pop artist in culture and if you are going to have an opinion you need to be familiar.  Some of the songs are cool enough to release anyway.  However, there is no point judging it nextto Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, Off the Wall, History, Invincilbe or even Blood on the Dance Floor because it isnt made by MJ..so it isnt an MJ album.  It is an ode to a much missed and loved artist by a money spinning Sony music, an ambitious Estate that want to cement MJs legacy, a handful of music industry talent who worked with MJ and want to contribute to that legacy.  So to conclude; if you listen to the album with this context in your head and dont try to compare it to an actual MJ album then it is a brilliant buy - great listen and will enhance your music collection.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|I love all of the Twilight movies and was really exicted to preorder this DVD since I was away on vacation.  I had expected that the DVD would be here upon my return however it took over a week for it to get to me.  Very dissapoined with the time of deliver.

B0000DZTIL|4.0|A space-time warping object from a UFO, that was stored at an old military base, becomes Mike's (John Stockwell) science project. Atilla the Hun, dinosaurs, weird aliens (no not illegal aliens), and futuristic weapons mingle at the high school.    By today's standards for special effects, this movie doesn't rate that highly, but 25 years ago it was pretty good! Dennis Hopper is the 60's hip science teacher that is demanding that John Stockwell (Mike), a Pontiac GTO fanatic, move out of his mechanical comfort zone and do something original.     Over all... it was a fun flick back then and it is still fun to watch!
9889979942|4.0|This book has great photos and a nice focus on the people of China. However, the shape of the book (6x6 inches and almost 3 inches thick) and extra small text makes it awkward to read. A normal coffee table format with larger text and larger photos or more photos per page would be much easier to read.<br /><br />If you're interested in this subject, buy the book for yourself or borrow it from a library. I don't recommend buying it as a gift because the awkward format means that I doubt any of my friends would read the whole thing.

B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This adapter is very flexible, well designed, and functions perfectly.  It arrived packaged in Amazon's frustration-free packaging, so opening involved cutting a label and just popping the top on the box.  The adapter was nestled inside.  There is a gold male connector on one end and a gold female end on the other.  The adapter can bend 90-degrees in either direction.  The male end is on a swivel, there are 9 different positions it can click into, not quite going to 90 degrees at either side.  I tried the adapter out between my PS3 and receiver as well as Mac Mini and receiver.  I did not notice any degradation in quality with either component while watching 1080p video.  I'm very pleased with this product, it works as it should and with it's ability to bend and rotate it will fit many configurations.
031603438X|1.0|Decent book for non Stones fans. Kieth shares some funny drug stories and comes off as a good guy. But if your a big fan you will be disappointed when in comes to the music side of things. I don't remember reading much new info as far as making music goes and it seems like the writer is just rehashing a lot of old interviews here. Kieth's revelation that he never brought a full song to the band until \\"All About You\\" in the 80's is peobably the only thing that surprised me. Nor does he address any of the controversy about who played on some of the important (to me anyway) tunes. For example Ry Cooder has said that he came up with the riffs for \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" or Wymans statement that he had the \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" riff. What about Mick Taylor's claim that Kieth wasn't even in the studio on some of the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" stuff like \\"Sway\\". He does say that Jagger wrote \\"Brown Sugar\\" all by himself but I had heard that before. There are some errors here and there and hey it's only rock n roll but I'm not sure why Kieth still believes he brought Blues to white America despite the fact that Bo Diddley,Luis Armstrong,Jimmy Reed,Ray Charles etc were already big stars here before the Stones got rolling. Heck, Howlin Wolf was playing frat parties at Ole Miss before the Stones ever saw America. I lived next to a work farm in the late fifties so trust me I heard the Blues every day not to mention from all the Black radio stations. But I digress. for the hard core fan I'd recommend Bill Wyman's two books. For the casual fan this one is a fun and an easy read.
0739344269|3.0|It would seem normal for Hawking to not have any belief in a supreme being considering his condition.  Kinda left me with a feeling that we will never be able to really leave this planet or solar system.  Life forms such as ours seem too fragile to travel through the great distances of space and it is way too dangerous.  Would also apply to other life forms on other planets.  Left me with \\"Too much to learn ....not enough time to learn it\\".
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I have quite a few pairs of Toms and I love them!! Aside from wearing my sneakers to workout, I only wear Toms. I order mine a 1/2 size smaller because they do stretch out and mold to the shape of your foot. In addition, I wear \\"footsies\\" and they fit perfectly fine. I have a pair of year old Toms that are still in great shape and I've worn them everywhere!! I've never had any issues with the construction of the shoe nor with the fit. Toms shoes are great! They are comfortable, durable (mine have lasted) and I especially like what they represent.
1439177783|5.0|This was a delightful book! I saw in my mind what she went through and I go through the same problem although I do eat but I can't seem to lose weight fast enough. I just quit trying because when I lose weight, I just gain it back with extra pounds. We are built the way we are so there isn't a way to be skinny unless it's in our genes.   I felt like I was the one in the book. This is a terrific read!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I can't say how much i love this movie batman is at his best in this film were he has to track down the red hood who seems to have the same type of training batman has. I do not want to give away to much but the plot is very well written and even though kevin conroy is not doing the voice of batman in this movie. the actor that does the voice is pretty good. I am gald to see that with these animated movies coming out that they finally get batman and superman right unlike that justice league show that ruined batman and superman were they treated them like they were nothing and nobodies.
0439023521|4.0|This is an incredibly engaging, fun fantasy. It's a combination of Gladiator, The Truman Show, and Survival. The premise is absurd. Beyond that, though, this is an addictive story with interesting characters and a world that draws you in. 24 kids are put in a fight-to-the-death game by the government, and we cheer on the underdog heroine. Kids love it. As an adult, I did too, after I ignored the credibility factor. It's a fun, somewhat violent page-turner.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I haven't seen the Band of Brothers which this miniseries disaster supposedly compares to, nor have I read the T.Hanks comments which have polarized people, and frankly I couldn't care less.  I attempted to watch this series for what it is without any bias, positive or negative, and my inspiration was a book I'm reading on the American-Japanese war (Nemesis by M.Hastings).    This series is an utter train-wreck on all dimensions: it has absolutely horrible acting (when it's not horrible it's simply sub par). The writing follows script with bland dialogues, disconnected and uninteresting side plots, and battle scenes that are at best generic and boring.  If you've read any quality history books about the American-Japanese war, you will be easily disappointed with how flatly the two adversaries are represented in the series. To be more precise, it's only the American side which is depicted at all (the Japanese are shown as zombie figures getting shot at in the dark mostly) and even then we are seeing unprocessed characters which cannot involve the viewer emotionally.    I can continue with the Pacific's deficits but I don't want to waste any more time with this disaster than I already have.  If you can keep your expectations extremely low and can be satisfied with precious little go on and give this a try.  Otherwise, save yourself time and stay away from this.
B0030IIZ3S|5.0|This is a film that is quite didactic and full of personal achievement and camaraderie, something rarely seen these days in theaters. I recommend viewing in the company of children.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great work out for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of time working out. It has three levels, the 3rd being most difficult. The first level is hard, but doable. However, she throws you right in to push-ups and if you haven't exercised much it's pretty difficult. You get a good sweat for a 20 minute work out and Jillian is very encouraging. There were a few things I didn't like- 1. Jillian rarely does the moves with you. She stands by her two girls in the back to explain the moves, even after you're already doing them. It seems like she doesn't want you to see her get tired..  2. I've had some issues with my knees being sore during a work out or long run, and this was hard on them. There are some back lunges that take a toll on them. If you have no history of problems then you should be okay. By the third level you can definitely tell that the moves get harder. The first time I did the 3rd level I was grunting towards the end- I could feel the burn! I usually run versus doing videos and after doing this dvd for a month I noticed a huge improvement in my stamina while running. I had a running route on some hills and was usually really tired at the end, but after doing this dvd for a month I did my route twice in a row!
1597801585|5.0|Love this book. I hope the author writes sequels or other stories set in this world. Others have written more comprehensive reviews. I echo their sentiments. One thing worth pointing out is that the main characters are not easily classified as heroes or villains. I've enjoyed discussing they moral uncertainty with my friends that have read the book.    This is a great novel and I look forward to reading his other (and future) works.    (Anyone that enjoyed this out to check out Market Forces by Richard K. Morgan)[[ASIN:0345457749 Market Forces]]
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Say what you want about his issues but the truth remains: the man is a genius. He put his heart in this album. I didn't even buy 808's... His lyricism is alot better than before. This is a solid album and I'm glad he's back to putting in the same effort of College Dropout and Late Registration. Producer albums are expected to really bring something entertaining and it's always evident when the producer has put in real work. Welcome back, Kanye.
0767821629|5.0|Both movies are about virtual reality, and how can you tell the difference?  For my money, The Thirteenth Floor does a better job of handling the subject.  Matrix had a bigger budget, better special effects, bigger \\"star\\".  But Thirteenth Floor had the better plot and character development.  (How much character development can you do with Keanu Reeves anyhow?)   It is, of course, a matter of personal preference.  So see them both and decide for yourself.    I'd say the kids prefer Matrix, the adults Thirteenth Floor.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is an outstanding movie and in 3D I don't think it can be beat.
B002ZG981E|5.0|it was outstanding  there is only one tiny little hitch which gave me about an hour of trouble, but is completely avoidable. This problem would be obtaining the digital copy. There is an extreme lack of instruction involving the code as there is no digital copy disk, as far a an itunes copy is involved, the WB website it says to go to is useless unless you need a link to download itunes, just take the code that is on the slip in the dvd case and inter it into itunes just like you would and itunes card.  But besides that(which doesn't even effect my 5/5 stars rateing)little issue buying this was a totally worth it, %100

B0015AARJI|4.0|There isn't another PS3 controller better. I have big, heavy hands and the controller breaks too easy. I have to buy a new controller every four months. I have not found a better alternative. PS1 and PS2 controllers lasted longer for me.
030746363X|4.0|I'd really give this 3.5 stars but I can only choose \\"whole stars\\" through Amazon.  If you are considering this book though, get it.  It has a lot in it and worth the buy.  Why I did not give it 5 stars?  I haven't been able to try all the methods yet and since that is really the purpose of this book, I can't say I love it - hype = lame.<br /><br />I really like it but it at times is only ok.  A lot of examples are of just Tim, which I do appreciate, but I was hoping for a greater selection.  Although, he really does explain everything in plain English and then even borders the \\"scientific\\" stuff if you get overwhelmed you can just skip it that way.<br /><br />What really makes this a must buy is the break down of how to do everything.  Tim promotes doing things the most efficient way possible.  Not the way that will take the most discipline.  Not the most effective way either (which is a good thing).  Tim promotes doing the least amount possible for great results.  With work, life, family etc, most need the nuts and bolts to get going, see results and then continue with the motivation.  Everything is here....nutrition, exercise, fat loss, muscle gain and even some sexual stuff for adult readers.<br /><br />All in all, a good and easy to understand blueprint to get America back on track.
0307460444|5.0|I really love this book. Lots of Great color pics and ideas for presenting these amazing cupcakes. I refer to this book even when I just want ideas for presenting baked goods for parties and for friends. Highly recommend it.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|This includes two DVD's and a digitally remastered CD. We just watched the 1st DVD.<br /><br />A live performance at Hammersmith Odeon, in London '75.<br /><br />I like discovering new (to me) music like I did earlier this year in John Mayer. And I really love it when it takes me somewhere unexpected and it's too wonderful for words and I laugh out loud.<br /><br />Well, the set I just saw a young Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band play, like no other, took me up and wouldn't let me go. When I thought I couldn't get higher, I was on my way to a new level.<br /><br />I finally had to save the last four songs for tomorrow. I'm wore out.<br /><br />Incredible energy and talent on that stage!

B00005K3O4|5.0|If you're looking for an Academy-award worthy film, this is definitely not it. If you're bored and you want a good laugh, this is definitely the movie you want to see. Chock full of goofy sight gags and purposely bad acting, this film is a goldmine of comic silliness. The film uses nearly every concept one would associate with clowns and circuses, and turns them into tools to reinforce the sci-fi goofiness of the movie. If nothing else, get a bunch of friends together and make fun of it; it seems like that's what it was made for...
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I looked at the Garmin site for several months pondering on whether I wanted to purchase such an expensive gadget. I am glad that I finally did and wish that I had sooner.

030726999X|5.0|Outstanding book which finally pulled the loose ends of the previous two books to a maximal climax.  Very well written.  The court seen was one of the best I have ever read.<br />Lisabeth is a unique character.  I have never read a novel in which a person with Asperger's syndrome was the heroine.  I loved her.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|My husband had the 305 and was pleased with it, but I had never used it.  So when I got it, once I realized how the bezel worked, it was so easy to use.  I love that came with a smaller wriststrap as my wrists are tiny.  It makes training so much easier.  Easy to navigate while running.  Love that you can lock the bezel so you don't accidentally stop the timer.  Love how it tells you your time every mile!  I'm sure there are many things I haven't used yet, but for what I need, it's perfect!
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the seasons.  Season 6 was not their most stellar moment - but they made up for it in Season 7 . . . and what a GREAT way to end 24.  They had pretty much done everything under the sun, so there wasn't much more left to do.  I will ALWAYS treasure the character of David Palmer (and through extension, Dennis Haysbert).  I'm watching the first season again, just to see how much it has involved.  In this season, we finally get to see Jack completely lose it - after his girlfriend (or closest thing he has to a girlfriend) leaves the episode.  It deals with a lot of raw emotions - absolutely wonderful!
B000035Z3K|5.0|Lugosi just has something that cannot be denied or ignored, if you can suspend your disbelief and enjoy this tale.  I watched this almost back to back with the Spanish version (made at the same time on the same set with Spanish actors), and still think that this is the best version by far.  It is because Lugosi brings this atmosphere of predatory menace and mystery and regret at his condition.  He is arrogant, little caring for the lives he ruins, but still somewhat self-aware - and with an instinct to survive that cannot be denied.  Lugosi pulls it off to perfection.<br /><br />I will probably watch this once a year now that I have bought this.  There are so many priceless moments, like Renfield laughing as he eats his flies or screaming as he fights the hypnotic compulsion from Dracula.  Though perhaps Mina could have been more interesting and Harper more than a nice suit, they are peripheral to the duel between van Helsing and Dracula.  It is truly a classic and far better than all the imitations it spawned.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00445JSX2|5.0|Always for great show Depeche really put on a wonderful, concert,  like the Stones of our time,  and one best groups since the Beatles,  this four disk set has extras, and the show is on a cd format, as well.  So you can here the same show on the go.  The second dvd has extras that interveiws with the band, and videos, the back screens.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|This woman is almost frighteningly bright and goes right to the jugular in re-interpreting old music. She is no mere copycat but almost a kind of historian making self referential comments and updates on her genre. The appearances she did on British TV to promote \\"Frank\\" are hall of fame type stuff. The name of the album could've been, \\"Seventh Chords Ain't A Bridge Baby\\".<br /><br />When you watch her face during her performances to promote \\"Frank\\" and see the different emotions that flit across her face not only do you see how engaged she is but how, in opposite fashion, how easily she gets bored and how creativity bubbles out of her. She is smart enough an artist to keep it in check and never vocalizes a song the same way twice while at the same time keeping the essence of the performance, something very rarely seen. Her performance of \\"Stronger Than Me\\" on Jools Holland is so wonderful and her vocals so right on it is just something to watch. Amy Winehouse is the brightest talent that we have seen in many a year.<br /><br />The lyrics to such songs as \\"Know You Now\\" and \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\" are staggeringly original as are all the songs really, compared to the innocuous and obscure poetry that suffuses pop music today. Although Miss Winehouse is not admirably served in the production of this album the raw gem is only too obvious. The company probably wanted to market her as just another Mariah Carey/Rihanna character but this is way beyond those girls, way beyond.<br /><br />As a vocalist Winehouse has no peers in the industry today and that is quite a remark to make about such a newcomer and so young at the time of the album, 20 I think. Rather than impress you with how many notes she can sing over one lyric al&aacute; the Carey/Aguilera/LaBelle/American Idol syndrome, Winehouse restrains her raw power and serves the song rather than her ego; there is no showboating here. If there is a vocalist today is who is at once so technically gifted, emotional and artistic all rolled into one, I don't know who it is; she is a jazz singer in the true sense of the term. For those of you who like this album I recommend the songs from \\"Frank\\" and others on her Jools Holland appearances; awesome.don't know who it is; she is a jazz singer in the true sense of the term.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|Josh Fox's GASLAND is an entertaining, high energy piece of art that will make you laugh and leave you terrified. Fox traveled across the country and through the gas patches in his old Camry with nothing but his curiosity, ample passion and a camera. Watching GASLAND is an interactive experience; you will laugh, cry, shake your head in disbelief, curse and marvel at the triumph of the human spirit. If this film doesn't make you think about the future and motivate you to action, check your pulse.<br /><br />I live on top of the Barnett Shale and for six years now I have blogged about the devastating effects of natural gas extraction. Everything in GASLAND, I have witnessed firsthand and captured in video and photographs on my blog.<br /><br />Natural gas is not a clean energy, and if this is our bridge fuel, we aren't going far. It's another dirty fossil fuel that creates massive amounts of toxic and radioactive waste for which industry has no plan. They are spreading this waste on our farmland, dumping it in streams and ditches and burying it in fields. The water use is simply not sustainable and our surface and groundwater is being contaminated.

B003U657OA|4.0|As a person who loved the series, I loved the movie too. But the way the movie is done makes it accessible to people who have not seen the series as well. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend to others for a lazy Sunday treat.
1416550550|3.0|I read this awhile ago but decided to review it now so I can't remember much about the plot, mostly just the feeling it left me.  It was a very promising story, and abot 2/3 into the book it just got too slow and boring for me.  I didn't really connect much with the main characters and that's a sure disaster for a book.  So story and plot good, but weak in the characters.  Easy read but not memorable.
B004C3DLJ8|4.0|I have seen all the Toy Story movies. My son, who is 7, couldn't wait for Toy Story 3. The animation is beautiful, especially in HD. This movie is definitely one of the best to be released this holiday season. Enjoy!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|As a native Jersey boy who's been living in Chicago for the past 25 years, I was eager to return to my roots via \\"The Promise\\" made by Springsteen. My license plate reads NJKID-1, its my little tribute to growing up on the Jersey shore in the 70's & 80's with Bruce's lyrical twists, Roy's melodies, Clarence's haunting horn and the awesome integrity of the E-Street sound.<br /><br />I received The Promise on its release date and spent the evening deciphering Bruce's notebook scribbles and listening to the unreleased tracks as memories of DJ's in Belmar, surfing @ Manasquan inlet, concerts @ Madison Square Garden filled my soul with the pride of being a Jersey boy inoculated with Springsteen in my veins.<br /><br />If your a true Springsteen fan, The Promise as a product is spectacular! I never, ever was disappointed by Springsteen during years of witnessing his 3++ hour concerts. He's a guy who keeps his promises. The Darkness Story delivers sounds, scenes and scripts that will portal you back, then forward, culminating in a deep appreciation of this gifted performer and rooted man.  The best part for me besides the music were the 3 DVD's. The visual story and perspectives on the behind the scene struggles that fueled the birth of this album is a true gift. Seeing the brilliance of Springsteen in the creative flow of his youth, the perfectionistic strivings and dedication to delivering on his promise post Born to Run, is a deep and satisfying documentary of an artists process to manufacture memories that will last a lifetime.<br /><br />Thanks Bruce and E-Street for shaping my Jersey experience and always delivering on your Promise!<br /><br />Dr. Ken Celiano
030726999X|5.0|This was a great book, although \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" was my favorite of the series. I thought the plot line was well developed and it frequently had me guessing. I stayed up and read from dusk until dawn to see if Lizabeth Salander would be acquitted of the charges. This was an intriguing series and I wish Stieg Larsson could have survived to write more books.
B00432QAKK|4.0|This review will not focus on the merits of this classic TV show since anyone visiting this page already likes it enough to possibly buy the entire series on DVD.  Rather, this review will hopefully clear up the confusion regarding exactly what is being offered with this Complete Series collection.  Sony originally released the individual seasons on DVD from 2003 to 2009.  This 2010 Complete Series collection simply repackages the exact same DVDs from the individual seasons.  There are 32 discs in all spanning the entire 11 seasons for a total of 261 episodes.  Unfortunately, there is no episode list included showing what episodes are on each disc.  The bonus content is slim and includes:<br /><br />Season 1- 42 minute 2003 reunion special with all of the principal cast members.<br />Season 2- 13 hidden \\"Easter Eggs\\" featuring short interview clips with the cast.<br />Season 3- 10 hidden \\"Easter Eggs\\" of cast interview clips + the unaired \\"I'll See You in Court\\" episode.<br />Seasons 4 to 11- No series related extras.<br /><br />It should be noted that the opening theme has been replaced with generic music starting with season 3 due to music licensing issues.  Also, season 4 has 7 episodes that are the syndicated versions, meaning each is missing about a minute of footage from the original broadcast versions. All other seasons appear to have the original, uncut episodes.  The video is presented in its original full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio and the audio is in 2.0 Dolby digital stereo.  Neither the picture nor sound quality shows any noticeable signs of remastering but are still generally good considering the age of the series.  The packaging is also worth mentioning as it is very different than the individual season sets.  The discs are housed inside a cardboard box measuring approximately 7.5\\"H x 5\\"W x 5.5\\"D.  Inside the box, there is a fold-out digi-pack with 9 clear plastic trays stacked on top of one other on either side, holding 2 overlapping discs per tray, with 4 trays holding 1 disc each.  Only time will tell just how well this case keeps its contents secure, but in terms of being a space-saver, this excels over other complete series DVD sets.  In 2011, Sony re-released another [[ASIN:B005CGI4EG Married...With Children: The Complete Series]] DVD set but with much cheaper packaging comprised of discs stacked on top of one another in two separate spindles.  The re-packaged version is clearly the better option for those on a tight budget, but the original digi-pack release is superior in terms of its convenience and better protection of discs.  Over all, despite some of the aforementioned drawbacks, there are still enough positives with the Complete Series collection to entice fans who do not already own the individual season releases.ith 4 trays holding 1 disc each.

B00192IV9U|5.0|I bought this album on day of release and have been loving it ever since. Yes, it is a post-humus album so it might be too emotional to listen to it at first, but for the second or third try one hears this album is a different to Jackson's previous works - it is lighter!   Thanks to producers it contains songs from 3 decades hence less sing of anger, sadness so overwhelming on HIStory or Invincible.   Taking tracks from Thriller outtakes (Behind the mask\\" is a dance floor killer - back to the 80as man!) and Dangerous sessions (Hollywood tonight) is an excellent mix.   Hollywood tonight\\" is a dangerously addictive song - the kind you want to play at a party all over, you want to blast on your car radio as you drive by on the beach.  Hold my Hand, and Keep your Head up are nice ballads (and unlike in the case of Butterflies it is in tune!) I can't make it an other day (the collaboration with Lenny Kravitz) is a great song too- even thought it is clearly unfinished. Monster\\" is a song one would find on Invincible - dark and heavy lyrics hidden with a lot of over layers of noise - clever disguising used in tracks like Shout or Morphine.    My least favorites are Best of Joy (I don't like the tune) Breaking News (I don't like the song intro).   My favorite song has to beMuch too soon\\" is said to be a Thriller outtake, however it seems to have been re-recorded in 2008 -very unlike to your typical Michael Jackson\\" track - this is why it is simply breathtakingly amazing!  Buy this album and you will get a mosaic of music - might not be the most polished work of MJ but it is his work and whatta great piece of work it is!  Big Thank You Shout Out to All who have made it possible for us to hear these! THANK YOU!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|While I didn't jump on with the first season, I became a major fan of the series \\"24\\". It took all the elements of the best action films, spy films and thrillers and put them not just on the screen in one show but in real time format as well.<br /><br />Real time format means that the show pretty much takes place in actual time. I mean come on; real time doesn't pause for a commercial break so it wasn't exact. But the fact that it took place in real time added to the cliffhanger mode that it clicked on, each week ending with something that wouldn't be solved or corrected until the following week, each episode ending with the digital clock counting down the last few seconds of the hour.<br /><br />Kieffer Sutherland shone as CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer. In a world gone mad where terrorists hijack planes to fly into buildings, there was a need for an agent like Bauer. The suave and sophisticated James Bond could manipulate women to assist him in finding out a bad guy's secrets over time. Bauer and a pair of pliers could find the same information out in moments. Yes it was cruel, yes it was torture but in today's world while we talked about how we should treat people humanely secretly many folks were hoping that a real life Jack Bauer existed to insure the safety of our country.<br /><br />Along with a continuing cast of regulars who either stuck with the show or found themselves cannon fodder for the latest bad guy, all did an exceptional job as well. While Bauer was the focus of the show the supporting casts were family members we grew to love and cherish and cry for when they ended up killed by terrorist's gas or bomb attacks.<br /><br />This brings us to \\"24 Season eight\\". This was the last season of the series. It brought a close to the world of 24 and of Jack Bauer. Promises have been made that Bauer will return in feature film form minus the real time element. Fans are waiting anxiously. But it is this final season after the show was canceled (due to the cost of production and dropping ratings) that has just now reached DVD.<br /><br />Season Eight begins with President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) about to sign a peace agreement with the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, a Middle Eastern country, that could solve the problem there for everyone. It would be a first step that would cause others to think and consider the benefits that would outweigh the problems that lie between the countries there. But not everyone wants peace to happen. Die hard fanatics rarely seek out peace and always think their way is the best.<br /><br />Attacks and kidnapping attempts on President Omar Hassan (Anil Kapoor) of the I.R.K. bring Jack Bauer back to take on the bad guys. Once again he's tried to leave behind the life that nearly destroyed him and did take the life of his wife. As he is about to leave and head out west with his daughter and her family, duty calls once more and only Jack can save the world from total annihilation.<br /><br />Tossed into this plot is a mole (a traitor hidden in the organization) in the new CTU. For some reason this organization that is supposed to protect us always had room for one mole or another nearly every episode. This time around the mole is offering information to the kidnappers. Its just one more thing Jack will have to deal with as he races to save the world in just 24 hours.<br /><br />CTU is different with a new man in charge, Brian Hastings (Mykelti Williamson), who seems to completely miss the abilities and assistance that could be afforded by Chloe O'Brian (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the computer genius and perhaps the only best friend of Bauer still alive. Each time her advice is ignored more trouble follows until the new director finally discovers how valuable she truly is leaving us something at the series end to consider.<br /><br />New characters arrive to help the story along, old characters make reappearances as they try to gain power once more and through it all Jack Bauer scrambles to save the day in spite of politically motivated bureaucrats more concerned with their stations of power or planned dreams than of making this country safe. The most recent elections as well as numerous polls make one believe that many in this country don't find many politicians to trust these days and if they're anything like those found here it's understandable why.<br /><br />The final season, known as day 8, offers everything that fans have come to love. It has a problem that only the hero can solve and then twists and turns several times over before the real problem or difficulty is seen. And that makes for an enjoyable ride as we go along with Jack to find the solution, the bad guy, the way to save the world.<br /><br />As season eight comes to a close, we're left with one burning question.

B004132I4S|1.0|While I am normally a huge Sufjan fan, this album is a major misfire. The whole thing is too electronic and when you combine that with there being too much going on musically throughout the record, it ends up an unlistenable mess.     Stick with Michigan, Seven Swans, Illinoise, or any of his EPs until he's done with this phase and throws the laptop away.

0740748475|5.0|If you're considering purchasing this, I'd presume that you're familiar with Calvin and Hobbes already. Bill Watterson did an amazing job with this series, and having it all together in one well bound series is well worth it for me, as parts of my collection have been lost or damaged over the years. This was an amazing series that gracefully bowed out of the limelight before it began to get stale and recycled, and I'm thrilled that I'll be able to share it with my kids.
B00192IV9U|3.0|It's really nice to hear Michael's voice again in the form of new music.  Unfortunately, as someone else stated, the songs \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" aren't Michael's vocals.  They don't have the natural breaking voice that he naturally has.  Both are just average songs.  Most of the music on this album isn't memorable, except for \\"Much Too Soon\\" which stands out, possibly because Michael's voice isn't drowned out by the music. Akon, Lenny Kravitz, and Fitty Cent's songs are just average, nothing memorable about them.      It definitely feels like something is missing from the music on this disc. Probably since Michael couldn't craft it himself.  I have to admit that I am a fan of his music from the 60's, 70's, 80's, and early 90's, but I was not a fan of his Invincible album.  This compilation falls at the same level of average sounds reminiscent of Invincible.  I would just get the single version of \\"Much Too Soon\\" and forget the rest.    UPDATE: It seems I'm getting several negatives on this review.  Here's my feelings on that: I am definitely a Michael Jackson fan, but his style of music changed in the 2000's to fit the sounds of the current music of the industry, and it is prevalent in his Invincible album. Michael Jackson never needed to fit his music to anyone's style. It was always different. He was a pioneer and genius as a musician. This music on this album is lacking in something that keeps it from being memorable.  How many of you will still be listening to the songs of this album in a few years? Not many.  These songs on this album aren't like Michael's older songs which are still very memorable to this day, from his Jackson 5 days to his beginning solos, to when he was the \\"King\\".  Like I said, it's great to hear his music again, new music, but I'm still waiting for the incredible songs that are still hidden in the vaults.

1592332803|5.0|I have another vegan baking cookbook but it doesn't compare to the wonderful recipes in this book.  I've made things that I thought were lost to me once I became a vegan.  Apple pie,    chocolate chip cookies, berry crisps (which I've already modified with different fruits), cornbread.  The best thing of all is that my whole family, including my very picky grandson, eats everything I bake.  My son had three pieces of the cornbread which he normally doesn't like.  And I love it when my omnivore husband declares \\"there's nothing wrong with this!\\" or \\"I wouldn't eat it if I were you\\" meaning he likes it so much he wants it all for himself!! Thank you so much for this wonderful vegan baking cookbook.
0694526088|1.0|After reading this book I was not very impressed.  Jim Collins started with a template and tried to find companies that would fit into his template.  His leadership idea is nothing new and he could have taken all the leaders in the world and found stories that fit into his mold.  His revelations are obnoxious and he spends about half the book talking about the good to great concept instead of using deep analysis to uncover some hidden truths.     One of the greatest flaws of this book is how he took a good look at certain companies through interviews but he failed to study any of the accounting changes that effected some of the businesses he discusses.  One of the most notable is Walgreen's and circuit city who were able to structure their leases in such a way that they did not have to disclose them on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities.  Walgreens and Circuit City grew because their bankers didn't get the full picture of how much debt the company was able to take on under the table and not disclose.  Now that these companies are forced to disclose that information they appear less solvent and their stock price has adjusted to reality.  Additionally Circuit City tanked when the new accounting practices and bad economy showed how insolvent they really were.    Other things Jim Collins failed to mention involved the establishment of right to work states that ended union control on companies and allowed NUCOR to establish one of the most efficient manufactures in the world.    Most of the companies Jim talks about have fallen apart in heaps and are bad to average.  He should have written a book about how little research he had to do to write a book that would get praise from the entire academic sector but be a complete bad to worse book at best.    Don't buy the book! Save your money and take some accounting classes and you can then uncover what takes a company from good to great!
030746363X|5.0|What is special about Ferriss' book is not only the specific guidance he gives on fat loss, etc but the way he has approached the existing science.  His use of mental models quickly empowers the reader to recognise the amount of loose and lazy \\"thinking\\" that is constantly marketed to us in the name of science.  For this alone, I would give it five stars.    But on the physical body recipes that Ferriss gives, he does bring new thinking.  It is to his credit that he has tried everything on himself- hence his credibility and probably the large number of perfect reviews.  Rather than taking the medical establishment's approach of \\"Do/ don't do this because I say so\\" (subtext: because I know better), Ferriss says \\"Do/don't do this because I have experimented on myself and here's what I found.\\" Most GPs are, by nature, generalist, and give general rules.  I have been running marathons for 11 years and when I went for GP advice on losing weight, I was just told to \\"eat less and exercise more\\" (current mileage is in excess of 60km/week).  That is as non-specific and silly as \\"I want to get healthy\\".  Instead, as Ferriss says, how about \\"eat less of x, eat more of y and do specific amounts of z so you can lose 20lbs.\\"      A great contribution to intelligent conversation about the physical body.

0439023521|5.0|This book was the first in a very long time that had me so emotionally invested I had to purchase all three books after returning my boss's copy.  I read the entire trilogy in about a two week span, and am looking forward to re-reading it in the future.  I've already lent it to my brother in law, and from there it is going to my younger sister and her boyfriend.<br /><br />It was written in a way that didn't make me feel like I was reading a young aduly fiction novel... it was so descriptive in it's twists and turns, and it really made you appreciate the charactres... good or bad... they were written in a way that you could understand.<br /><br />Of the trilogy, Catching Fire was definately my favorite.  The story through all books is written very well, and to me, this is a very fast read... because it is hard to put down.
B0000025T6|5.0|My only exposure to the \\"Nebraska\\" album was me hearing the title track and \\"Atlantic City\\" a few times. I had the basic idea of the album though: the Boss armed with his lonesome howl and his guitar. After taking long enough, I finally went out and got me a copy. After listening to it once, I only have one thing to say.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />This album is stark, dark, lonesome, and hard. It's a complete turnaround from Bruce's usual loud, fist-pumping rockers. These songs are stories of everyday people, as usual, but these stories are bleak and have no happy endings. This is a rough album.<br /><br />Nearly all the songs captured me (except for State Trooper), but some standouts are the title track, Atlantic City, Johnny 99, Highway Patrolman, and My Father's House. The track Nebraska is truly terrifying and stays with you long after the last song has been heard.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent CD. I'm still trying to stockpile Springsteen's discography, but this one is a definite winner. Highly recommended!
030726999X|4.0|I bought the hard cover copy of The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest and paid $26 for it and am not one bit sorry.  I read the entire trilogy in less than a week, barely getting any sleep at all.  I couldn't put them down and began this the final book in the trilogy immediately upon finishing the second, The Girl Who Played with Fire.  The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest was the slowest and most difficult for me to read.  Lot's of details of Swedish history and political corruption.  I just had to find out what happens to the 2 main characters, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist.<br />Stieg Larsson, the author, died shortly after delivering the manuscripts for all three books in the trilogy.  I must say that certainly added to the intrigue for me.  And I certainly respect the socially redeeming value of his trilogy.  USA Today says Larsson \\"writes for the heart.\\"  I felt that.  All the pieces of the puzzle come together in a very enjoyable way.  And I learned a lot about Europe, Sweden, Psychology and Social Democracy.  Thank you Stieg Larsson for giving us such a memorable hero and heroine!  Congratulations on an awesome life's work.  May you Rest in Peace!

0307473473|4.0|This is the first part of a trilogy originally written in Swedish.<br />It did not grab me at the very onset; but then I could not put it down.<br />It's a novel that \\"combines murder mystery, family saga, love story and financial intrigue.\\"<br />There are 2 main characters, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant computer hacker, and Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist.<br />Here's what The Washington Post says about the book:  \\"Wildly suspenseful... an intelligent, ingeniously plotted, utterly engrossing thriller.\\"<br />Fresh Air (NPR) says, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is \\"a super-smart amalgam of the corporate corruption tale, legal thriller and dysfunctional family psychological suspense story.\\"<br />The author Stieg Larson is a \\"leading expert on antidemocratic right-wing extremest and Nazi organizations.<br />I normally do not read books like this.... A girlfriend and junior high school art teacher told me they were a must read; so I bought all 3 and paid $65 for them in an airport.<br />This one is written in 4 parts.  Each part is introduced with the following statistics:<br />\\"18% of the women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man.\\"<br />\\"46% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man.\\"<br />\\"13% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship.\\"<br />\\"92% of women in Sweden who have been subjected to sexual assault have not reported the most recent violent incident to the police.\\"<br />So, the aspects of feminism I would say are what really held my interest in this first of the series, which I highly recommend.

After staying up all night reading, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I was wondering if I was mentally ill, diving right into The Girl Who Played with Fire.  Then I noticed that Entertainment Weekly calls Stieg Larsson's trilogy \\"a gripping, stay-up-all-night read.\\"  Whew!  OK!  I'm alright then.<br />The Dallas Morning News says, \\"You might as well give up on the idea of sleep till you've finished the book!\\"<br />I was happy and relieved when The Girl Who Played with Fire starts right off where The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo left off; and with the same 2 main characters.<br />Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist, this time is exposing an extensive sex trafficking operation.<br />Troubled Genius, Lisbeth Salander is on her own studying complicated mathematical equations which introduce the 4 parts of the book.  In the end, you don't know if she is dead or alive; so you have to begin the third part of the trilogy immediately with eyes wide open whether you've slept or not!
0307272702|4.0|Gary Taubes is a highly respected, repeatedly published, talented author.  He presents a quality, fact-filled book, with scientifically and medically based guidelines for a proper diet.  Not only does he say \\"what\\" to do, but \\"how\\" to do it, and \\"why\\" you do it. This is a great lesson on INSULIN--what it is, how it is the key to so many things--our weight being only one of them.<br /><br />I am a personal trainer, and struggle to get my clients to dedicate themselves to a dietary program--it's very hard to cram their heads full of the facts--all of the information as to \\"why\\" we choose different foods than the mainstream. There is SO much to learn when you change your habits.  This book does indeed lay out the \\"why's\\"--the insulin factors, the different sorts of carbohydrates, the roles of proteins, fats, good (and bad) carbs, etc.  It explains the genetic factors, too.<br /><br />I spend a LOT of time studying diet and watching the effects of clients who follow the diets (and those who don't).  I spend a lot of time teaching, and trying to find good educational aids to supply to my clients.  This book is one such aid.  I feel that this book is very clear and well laid out.  It is a great tool for repeated reference, and will guide you back to the right path when you veer off course or have questions about dietary choices.<br /><br />I would like to say that this book is great for everyone.  I gave it 4 stars because sadly, it is not.  It is very technical and quite frankly--boring to read for those that aren't carried through with an inherent interest in the topic.  I don't think that I could get many of my clients to read this book, because they want the answers in a simple, bulletized handout.<br /><br />Many of my clients do not want to know \\"why\\" they should eat certain things--they only want a list of foods that they \\"can\\" eat.  Unfortunately for me, as their trainer who wants to teach them to become independent in the gym and regarding their dietary choices, the lack of dedication leads to their continued dependence on me and their unquestionable weight gain when they stop using me as their trainer.<br /><br />I LOVE this book and recommend it to all personal trainers as an informational tool for you to use with your clientele.  I also recommend it to any dedicated and truly interested person who wants to learn a heck of a lot about diet, exercise, and genetics--and their roles in your overall health and weight.<br /><br />He does lay out a dietary plan that seems very simple and easy to follow.  I think that this does help those people that like that bulletized plan that I alluded to above.  Perhaps it would behoove a tenative reader to read the diet plan before delving into the scientific details of the rest of the book.<br /><br />So--it's a tough read, full of amazing information, very scientific and factually based.

0316078913|2.0|If you're looking for a collection of funny Christmas stories to lift your spirits, I wouldn't suggest this book. The first story has quite a few funny moments, is believable and written well, but I found the rest of the collection to be a little too bitter, minus the foreign Christmas story. That had a funny ending but then the last line put a damper on even that one.  Also, who uses the word \\"retarded\\" anymore..?  It's so NOT funny to call anyone that.
1400079144|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel! I ended up reading this book to 6 AM one night even though I had 3 college finals exams that day! I couldn't put it down. It has so many interesting aspects to learn from; D.C. architecture, Freemasonry, Noetic Science, and Religious interpretation. I loved every second of it. If you are interested in the previous list, get this book!
B001AVCFK6|3.0|This should have been a combo directors cut and theater cut package. Considering the deleted scenes and cut story lines that tie the story together this screams for a long version. I'll be waiting for the directors cut version and pass on this thrown together thing.
0385504225|2.0|It might seem like things are moving along, but the truth is that the STORY is not moving at all.  The characters are sitting in cabs or buttering bread or waiting in line, but for over 50 pages the stoy hasn't progressed a single step.  Let's be completely honest, when you're sitting for several hours in traffic - is it exciting?  NO!  So why would reading about it be exciting?      Dan Brown stuffs a lot of information in his book: what color the tie is, what color the shoes are, how fast the protagonist can run to avoid a rain shower.  None of that information does a bit of good in telling the tale.  The biggest thing that will cause me to abandon a book is being bored and this novel is the pinacle of humdrum.
B001TODOCM|5.0|I wasn't too sure how I was going to like this novel but I had heard it described as a cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice so I thought I would check it out.  I love a good book about books and this one is very original and different from other literary thrillers I have read in the past.  I really enjoyed the story, it is about Lucas Corso a mercenary book hunter, a man who is hired by shady characters and rich clients to find rare books and manuscripts for them.  He is good at his job and a very interesting and different kind of hero.  When a well known bibliophile commits suicide, a rare handwritten chapter from The Three Musketeers is left behind that leaves Corso becoming involved in finding out if it is authentic along with finding out if another rare book about summoning the devil is related to Dumas.  This is a very interesting and intricate plot, with many twists and turns and characters that seem to have run out of The Three Musketeers.  I was pleasently surprised with how much I enjoyed this book, it is a rare treat and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good intellectual mystery with a very unlikely bad tempered, gin loving, Napoleon obsessed hero who you can not help liking and rooting for.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|If you live in a zone increasingly referred to by its residents as being, \\" on the shale\\", you are certainly aware of the documentary \\" Gasland\\", Pennsylvania native, renown off Broadway theatre director and now Sundance Film Festival special jury prize award winner, Josh Fox's attention grabbing foray into activism through film. So powerful is the result, the oil and gas industry, via a PR group, \\" Energy-In-Depth\\", drafted a paper circulating around the internet called \\"De-Bunking Gasland.\\" Fox responded with a 39 page retort,\\" Debunking the De-Bunkers\\". Commentators, bloggers and posters have been weighing in around the country whether they have seen the film or not. Viewers report reactions ranging from nightmares to insomnia to joining the fight.    Those of us living above the geologic layer known as the Marcellus shale have no need to ask why all the fuss. The 15 million or so who reside in or draw their drinking water from the watershed of the Delaware River, as well as residents of 34 other states living above gas bearing shale formations, perhaps ought to find out.    Synopsis: Youthful, sincere, witty, brilliant, urban hick Fox and his family receive an offer  to lease the old family hippie homestead located on a tributary of the Delaware in northeastern Pennsylvania for natural gas \\"exploration\\". Close to $100,000 for the right to drill a mile under their 19 acres in moist, luscious, secluded, fern and forest country. Fox has heard of the water well contamination from gas drilling in nearby Dimock, PA and embarks on a quest to discover the possible pitfalls to accepting the windfall. With remarkable ability to gain access into people's homes and lives, Fox makes friends everywhere he goes, documents people's horror stories, gets rebuffed by corporate gate keepers, dismissed by bureaucrats in charge of protecting the health and safety of we, the citizenry, and finds a couple of genuine scientific heroes along the way. He also discovers - surprise! - our evil former Vice President cleverly cleared the path for the expansion of a technique pioneered in environmentally deprived Texas, known as high pressure slick water hydraulic fracturing, which opened up previously unexploitable gas bearing shale formations to massive development in areas all over the country. One of which, the United States northeast's Marcellus shale, has been called the \\"Saudia Arabia of shales\\". Potentially the second largest resource of \\"natural\\" gas yet found in the the world.    In only his second effort at film directing, highly political theatre director Fox, along with a very skilled film editor, crafted a remarkably moving piece of work. Why do we allow corporations to roll over people's lives, trashing our various pursuits of happiness and right of quiet enjoyment of our real property? Why are representatives and bureaucrats so unresponsive and unemotional when presented with evidence of ill treatment of their constituents? Why do some brave souls risk their livelihood or at least their neighborhood standing in fighting for health and justice? These are among the questions that may haunt a viewer of \\"Gasland\\".    Is it possible not to be moved by 3rd generation cattle rancher, John Fenton, as he expounds, \\"This may not seem like much to most people, but its my way of life. My father and grandfather were the old time cowboys. This is my family's heritage, my wife's family's farm. We're proud of this. But by God, if your way of life is being besieged....I don't know what else you could do. I don't know where the hell I could go. This is happening everywhere. That's what I want people to know.\\" ? Is it possible not to understand the injustice, when seeing the Fenton family cabin perched on a dry Wyoming range country hillside, overlooking gas well pad, after pad, after pad; storage tank, after tank, after tank, or when seeing their home enveloped in a sick looking toxic fog, or watching tranquil mooers you may one day find on your dinner plate slurping from watering tanks amidst an industrial wasteland? Is it possible to see and hear all that, and, comprehending that the Fenton's do not own the gas rights to their ranch property - that all the mess was all imposed on them without their say and without benefit to them - and not be emotionally moved?    Maybe not if you make you living in or around the extraction of natural gas. Then you may be moved by \\"Gasland\\" in a different way; moved to near panic. What if people catch on that the current extraction process is a vast experiment, what if the public figures out that the risk, the potential trashing of our finite fresh water supply from a combination of toxins added in the fracturing process and naturally occurring elements and compounds released by the high pressure forcing of these fluids deep underground, is just too much of a gamble? What if people begin to think: we've got to get off hydrocarbons asap? Not worth the risk, not worth the environmental degradation and its potential effects on our loved ones health. Or on our ability to enjoy and renew ourselves in the natural world we ultimately depend upon for our existence.     These too are among the questions \\"Gasland\\" slips into a viewers mind. On screen, unintentionally, Fox proves himself one of the heros he brings into focus. His friendly, empathetic manner not only gains him amazing access, but wins viewers over. He is open minded, curious, funny, non judgmental when it comes to people ( not necessarily corporations), a bit disheveled, and very determined.     All of these characteristics are on display when you see him enter the modest home of Mike Markham and Marsha Medenhall in Weld County, Colorado. As Mike lights water directly from his tap on fire, Fox's first reaction is a completely unselfconscious: \\"Woah! Jesus Christ!\\". He joins Mike in a hard laugh at the absurd circumstance of a huge billow of flame erupting from the family kitchen faucet, then asks, as any adventurous kid might,\\"Can I do it?\\" When he does and is taken aback by the flames and the potential danger, he reels away from the tap physically moved. You see on his face a change from astonishment at his personal circumstance to true empathy, as he appears overcome by the emotion of the havoc that has entered the lives of his hosts. To the viewer it becomes clear, by the circumstance of having the camera turned on him, the heroic nature of the Director. It is hard not to think: those hippie parents sure did a good job with this one. Raised a real human being who feels sincerely for others, looks at societal issues critically and is able to act effectively to move things in a different direction, all with his sense of fun and passion for life intact.      If we are to move forward as a society in learning to treasure our home in the universe, we need real heroes like Josh Fox and John Fenton. And like Weston Wilson, long time EPA environmental engineer who boldly faces the camera and holds forth regarding citizen's experiencing well water contamination via migrating methane gas and plausibly, from \\"proprietary\\" chemical formulations used in hydraulic fracturing, \\"This is America. We shouldn't be assuming corporations can keep a secret. Especially when they are practicing in our backyard. The onus should be on the industry to prove that their practices are benign. Even if it weren't true, they are citizens of the United States and they certainly don't deserve to be exposed to secret chemicals. It's un-American.\\"    There is a myth going around the parts of Pennsylvania once know as the \\"Endless Mountains\\" and the \\"Pennsylvania Wilds\\". As residents find the rhythm and pace of the place where they chose to make their lives changing almost overnight, as semi-truck and pick up traffic become more like the overwhelming hassle they see in urban areas, as roads disintegrate before their eyes, as stories of incidents of pushy land men, water well contamination, illegal dumping and overweighttrucks become common place, as Texas license plates proliferate like rodents, the myth gains circulation: The shale area of Texas once looked like the present day northern tier of Pennsylvania. Then gas development began to take hold. As it grew, eventually the streams and rivers dried up from water withdrawls and associated micro and macro climatic changes in annual precipitation, leaving only bone dry stream beds most of the year. As more and more trees were removed from the forests to make room for well pads, storage tanks and ponds, pipelines, pipeyards, roads, metering and compressor stations, and all the other infrastructure of gas field development, remaining drought stressed trees began to die in droves. When the big trees were mostly all gone, succeeded mainly by invasive weed plant species, people moved off the land into endlessly growing urban and suburban centers which soon sprawled together in a huge toxic blob. Rural land was left abandoned, unfit for human and animal habitation, deemed an unnecessary obstacle to drilling and pipeline efficiency. The mountains were flattened, hollows filled in and result: Texas.    Will the myth prove prophetic for places you care about that are \\"on the shale\\"? Not if enough people join the fight. If you need motivation, check out Gasland.

0786868724|5.0|I absolutely loved this book... as I read it, when Mitch mentioned the Rebbe, I was beginning to wonder if this was the Rabbi who married my parents...then he mentions a particular synagogue and I was almost completely convinced... then when he mentions going into Philadelphia and then I was sure it was the Rabbi who when he first came to that synagogue, prepared my father for his Bar Mitzvah; my father was his first... This Rabbi also married my parents, my aunt and uncle, knew both sides of my family, and when there were synagogue sponsored trips to Israel, my maternal grandparents always went with him.  When I remarried in '06, I asked him if he could marry me and my current husband.  In his loving and supportive way, he gracefully declined say he was extremely honored to keep in the family but he was just too sick to do it.    I have learned many lessons by reading this book and I hope to learn more each time I read it over and over again!
B002ZG994U|4.0|Okay, so /I was not expecting much from the A Team.  I was intrigued by the cast though.  Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper in particular.  When it hit theaters this summer and got such terrible reviews I decided to skip it.  Now that it is available on DVD I watched it and I was really surprised!  It is actually a pretty good action movie.  Yes, there are huge plot holes and some of the action is so totally unbelievable.  Such as the team drive a tank through the air, crash in a lake and then drive away in the tank!  I mean come on!  But the actors seem to be having a blast, especially Cooper and Sharlto Copely, who hams it up as Murdoch.  The A Team is a fun way to spend a winter afternoon!
0307463745|2.0|The tone of this book is arrogant and insulting. He speaks in absolutes, which is a clear sign the advice isn't very well thought out. There is some good advice here and there, but it can basically be extrapolated from the table of contents. Not really worth reading let alone buying.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|a very good movie. i was very surprised at just how good, after reading smoe fo the reviewes it had gotten before.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|We liked it so much that we purchased the DVD. Our family agreed that this needs to be kept with our Christmas movies. This movies is entertaining for all ages.
B003LZJI86|5.0|This concert was the second show at MSG. I saw the first show and seeing this one, made me wish I had tickets to this onw as well. It is Bon Jovi at their best!!      If you haven't had a chance to see them live buy this concert dvd. You will not be disappointed. It is like you were there at the show. So buy and enjoy. Cheers!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love this movie. I knew I wanted to own it the first time I saw it in theaters. I was so tempted to buy it immediately upon its first DVD release, but I'm glad I didn't. I was holding out for this collector's edition, and man, is it awesome! If you have any interest in how movies are made I would highly recommend buying this version. There is extensive behind the scenes footage of scenes not only that were taken out of the movie, but also scenes that were not completely animated, which really makes you appreciate how much went into the animation. Also, there are three different versions of the movie in this set and each extended scene really gives you a better sense of the movie and the characters. Also, lots of deleted scenes.
B0041T52S6|4.0|I'm not sure why this film did so poorly at the box office, Scott Pilgrim vs the World has a little something for everyone. It's a smart film about dating and breaking up, which makes it one of the better Romantic Comedies of the year While it has plenty of video game style action that gamers will enjoy. Also, if you like films about music and rock bands, then the film is for your too. But what I loved about it is that it's...cheesy and but enjoyable while it's being cheesy.<br /><br />  The cast is excellent too. Michael Cera seems to be only able to play it dead-pan while playing a young man with a rock band. But that's what makes him for perfect for this movie. Since Scott has a band and since also his dead-pan works well in the film. Mary Elizabeth who's just adorable steals the show along with Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate. The cameos are pretty damn funny too. Brandon Routh \\"the under-rated Superman\\" has a funny appearance, as do Thomas Jane, Chris Evans and Jason Swartsman .
B00192IV9U|5.0|It has been a very long time since I can honestly say that I have listened to an entire album and did NOT feel the need to skip over a song. Not one song. I love all of them. Of course I love some more than others.<br /><br />Best of Joy - I love his high voice here and the message. He is forever, we are forever!<br /><br />Keep Your Head Up - this song is my life right now. I feel he is singing to me. I wish that love would come today! I cry, laugh and smile with this song.<br /><br />Behind the Mask - brilliant song! I can't stop beatboxing with him in this song.<br /><br />Hold My Hand - I have loved this since I heard the leaked version, the song has an addicting beat and makes me happy listening to it. Extra bonus is that my family is in the video!<br /><br />Hollywood Tonight - Very dance-able track, I live in Hollywood and I just love singing about it with Michael.<br /><br />Monster - another addicting beat and very dance-able. I think Fiddy does a great job here with Michael.<br /><br />Much Too Soon - makes me cry, his voice is so beautiful and I hurt because he hurts.<br /><br />Breaking News - I like the beat and I love singing and dancing to it.<br /><br />Another Day - my least favorite song out of them all, I like the leaked snippets, but I know the words and sing away.<br /><br />Buy the album, it is too short, I want more already. I am looking forward to the next Michael Jackson album, in the meantime, this is a wonderful way to continue his legacy. I hope the radio audiences get to hear these songs! It should be a number one hit!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|After finding the Half Blood Prince to just be dark and dull, I wasn't looking forward Deathly Hallows: Part 1 much at all. With that said though, I was pleasantly surprised how well done the movie was.<br />  The film isn't just dark with barely any charm or laughs like the last film. There's plenty of magic, excitement and heart-felt moments that will keep you entertained through-out. This Potter is easily one of the years best and one of the best Potters!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I must admit to purchasing several items from amazon.com over the last year. Books, CD's, Lkindle DX, DVD's, and with each purchase I am more impressed with the companies quality and customer service. \\"Dexter\\" is the best series on TV!!!!
B002ZG98PA|4.0|Tangled is a magical and funny movie that had my attention from beginning to end. I took my niece to see it and expected to be bored but that wasn't the case at all. I just wish that the white horse Maximus had more scenes because he's just hilarious and he's a scene stealer. I think he's the most original Disney character in awhile and he didn't even need any lines to be funny.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I love this movie and the whole saga, but first, I pre order it and I never got it, second, my friend did get it but it's missing the bonus features! WTH! the 6 part of the making of and the deleted scenes are missing. This is a crappy movie version. DON'T BUY IT AND IF YOU DO BUY IT AT TARGET OR WALMART!

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Highly recommended.  A classic movie for all dog lovers.  Learn about a breed you probably never heard of.  All of the actors do a fine job.  Get a tissue for the last 30-minutes.  Then, enjoy!
B003UESJF6|4.0|One of the best animated films of the year, it looks great, is romantic, has good action and it's very funny.

157421327X|4.0|This book is perfect for anyone who likes to doodle in thier spare time. If your looking for a book that teaches serious art skills and techniques this is not for you. It is shorter than anticipated and very very basic but a great book to cure boredom.
0375413405|5.0|I was intrigued to get this book after seeing the new movie, of course, and I really, really like it! We will be making some dished from the book for our christmas dinner. I have tried several omelets and they are just yummy. I think Americans get to obsessed with butter because they are generally out of health anyway and all we hear about is \\"get the fat out of your diet\\"     Butter is just fine as long as you are eating little to NO processed food, fast food, pop (SUPER ICK!!) and you don't burn it. That is not a pretty thing--burning the butter. Hah!  I think we forget that eating well can be fun and taste great---BUT it takes TIME and many don't want to give the time up for healthy cooking,or decadent cooking for that matter!    LOVE THE BOOK!
6303191347|5.0|This was the best concert by 10K Maniacs (with Natalie Merchant), and the best MTV Unplugged concert.  Natalie, of course, went on to write music for herself and became even more popular; while, unfortunately, the rest of the band - needing someone like Natalie to provide the artistic/creative force - fell into obscurity.  There were a few great musicians in this band, though.<br /><br />If you like music at all, the chances are excellent that you'll like this performance.  After that, you'll likely find yourself searching for all of the 10KM disks, and all of Natalie Merchant's solo stuff as well.  None of it will disappoint.<br /><br />My only gripe is that there is no DVD.  VHS tape and Laser Disk (if you can find it, and laser disk players are like snowballs in hell) were the only two formats.  How difficult would it be to transfer the original to DVD?  How many would they have to sell to recoup the cost...ten?<br /><br />(Note: right-wing ideologues and propagandists need not bother.  Natalie's lyrics will surely cause you to stroke out, leaving everyone to wonder why such a selfish nutball didn't outlive his uselessness.)
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great film. You have to appreciate the ambition and execution by Nolan and the team. Worth every penny and every second.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|When I buy a DVD series, it is because I have already watched it and LOVED it so much that I want to own it. Being a True Blood fanatic, I was excited to see this on sale for xmas and snapped one up. The packaging is great! Very high quality, not flimsy cardboard, and the whole case has a strange tactile feel, almost rubbery. I love the package art, and the commentaries are good--I like to hear commentary from the people who produce and write the shows; they often have more interesting things to say than the actors; however, both SM and AP do wonderful commentaries. I only wish that there were some deleted scenes or more featurettes!
B0037AGASG|1.0|Wow, this Justin Bieber fellow is quite a character isn't he?  UGH.  I really consider South Park's recent of Bieber to be hilarious because, quite frankly, Parker and Stone putting on screen what thousands are fantasizing in their heads is almost charitable.  Poor kid just had to have a god AWFUL voice.  I heard one person say that his voice is akin to an angel (!!!).  Not to steal this line from somebody else on here (I forgot who), but if the voice of heaven is Justin Bieber's ear splitting, whining, kid screaming mess, then please sign my name up on the eternal damnation sheet immediately.  Thank you.<br /><br />In all seriousness, I can't wait for this guy's popularity to dumb down because his music is corny, lifeless, and cliched.  Justin Bieber just recycles the same old trend about long lost love and just about every other button pushing topic, guaranteed to make millions of money for vapid entertainment while not giving any real musicians a fighting chance.  It's just sad to see some hack-wash singer from Youtube makes millions of dollars practically doing nothing but \\"entertaining\\" the population (did you know there could be a Nuclear war in Korea?), while musicians who are dedicated to expressing themselves are doomed to toll in obscurity.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Kids, try something else and just see what tuning out peer pressure and listening to real music can get you.  Heck, I was listening to Blues music when I was seven.<br /><br />Sure, this awful music is successful, but success doesn't equal greatness.  The success argument is lame because really, when it comes to entertainment or the arts, success does not necessarily deem importance.  Most of these successful artists fade from the spotlight and never return, because they don't have importance for a lasting impression.  Because, let's be honest, it's junky and disposable.  So why always equate these two?  Should we throw out films from directors like John Cassavetes, Ingmar Bergman, Martin Scorsese, and Yasujiro Ozu for movies like Twister, those terrible Aaron Setzer and Mark whatever movies, High School Musical, and every romantic comedy that comes out?  Or should we swap Mort Stahl and Lenny Bruce (two influences on George Carlin, by the way) for some moron like Dane Cook?  I'm not saying the latter are completely worthless to everybody (so these people were entertained by junk entertainment.  Okay fine).  But for anybody who has a knowledge of arts and entertainment would know that the latter aren't good enough to be fifty feet away from the former, even though the former is not as popular as the latter.<br /><br />There's no way that popularity and current success could convince anybody with a workable brain that the former are inferior and less important than the latter.  Ten years later, this clown will be remembered as a mere product for the music industry for those who even bothered to care by then (I rest assure you, not many), and 50 years most people won't even know who the hell this is.  Meanwhile, important, artistic musicians (Beethoven, John Coltrane, The Beatles, Chuck Berry, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Suffocation for starters) will keep on inspiring other artists and emotionally moving people with their art long after they hit the pearly gates.<br /><br />Don't kid yourself, this hack isn't worth a dollar.  Justin Bieber is just another flash in the pan pop hack that people will laugh at akin to \\"hits\\" like You Light up My Life or Sugar Sugar.  Only this wretched pap makes the latter song sound almost good by comparison.  Quit when you have a chance kid.  Once your voice matures, for the love of god, try something along Broadway and don't spend your life spouting the same old crap about love and whatever else the record companies want you to use.  You may not make millions, but you might find yourself artistically involved in something, knowing yourself better.orsese, and Yasujiro Ozu for movies like Twister, those terrible Aaron Setzer and Mark whatever movies, High School Musical, and every romantic comedy that comes out?

B0036EH3U2|5.0|My husband & I recently got hooked on BSG and we knew we wanted to own it. We pored over the reviews on Amz and were a little nervous to order the boxset after the horrible reviews of the packaging. However, ours is great! These are the first Bluray DVDs we've bought and I was surprised that the whole set was so small--I expected to have to clear a huge space on our shelf for this. The packing looks fantastic, and the plastic inserts for the DVDs have a small lip on them to hold them in, which I like--the plastic center on my Office DVDs have broken over the years, and the disks fall out constantly (hello scratches!). The deleted scenes are great (and pretty helpful at times, too); loved the extended versions of episodes. We haven't played around much with the other features (again, these are our first Blurays) because we are just eager to watch the series right now, but we definitely plan to on our next run through. As if I need to say it, this is a GREAT series, and you won't regret the purchase!

B003ZJJHWK|5.0|I really liked the CD a lot.  Some of the earlier CDs do seem a bit better, but the only issue I have is some of the lyrics seem a bit simplistic and without depth.  I thought several times on several songs that perhaps if the story in the songs were as interesting as the melody I'd be more satisfied.     I would recommend the CD and certainly the artist.  Still love to see a concert of his....his music is masterful!

B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Pink Friday is a solid debut from Bad Bitch Nicki Minaj. Well, this isn't technically her debut album, but her first solo non-mixtape-album album. A lot of people are complaining that this album is very pop-y, which it is, but in a new way. For decades, pop music has incorporated rap elements, but Nicki mixes it up and makes rap music with pop elements; which is refreshing. As a debut, it is important that she rap bums under the table as well as bare her soul, and she does both very well.

The thought that being detailed and specific in comments means ranting seems to be counter-productive. After all, it is just one person's opinion.  To pick apart each and every song is rather........arrogant.      I love the album, realize some won't, but don't like at all to see those from his fansite - of which I'm a member - coming here and writing a book that seems to give them the right to include all members of fojg.  It borders on the offensive.     To others who come here, I imagine it's out of curiosity if you've either never heard Josh or are interested to see what's on the new album. Please make that decision for yourself.  It's hard to tell from a 30 second clip, I know, but this album differs in that it's comprised first of all Josh's stories, and the production is not the stamp of just another Producer, but Rick Rubin who pushes his artists to be who they are, not who he is. So maybe go to a book store, try out the headphones and give it a listen if you have the time.  It's a treasure - an effort that may never be repeated, who knows?  If you're looking for the same grandiose that marked his first albums, don't bother.  Basically, because you may already have every other song he's ever recorded and would be perfectly happy with those.  But if you're interested in spending time with an very talented musician and willing to be honest, then this is for you.
B003W5C0VW|3.0|Well, the good news is it's not the Stones fault. They played great. They rocked big time. This is the Mick Taylor era... the Stones absolute peak as a touring band in my humble opinion. Neither Brian Jones nor Ron Woods ever came close to matching the guitar mastery of Taylor. With the power of Wyman, Richards & Watts in their heyday behind him & Jagger out front, it's an untouchable combination.    Sadly, this show is plagued by low tech difficulties of the worst kind. The camera work is so poor it's literally unwatchable. It looks as if if it was filmed in a dark cave by a cameraman and/or director who had two 1970's porno films and not much else on their resume. But no matter, I figured, I don't need to actually see this... all I really want to do is hear this rare recording of the Stones live in all their 1970's glory. With the near magical digital restoration software available these days, I imagined the soundtrack would be all that & a bag of chips. Wrong. Either the recording quality was so atrocious that even the top sound wizards in the biz could not fix it (my first guess) or the  Stones or their record company put no $$$ into the restoration (unlikely). Either way, to my huge disappointment, this was a great performance that was convincingly NOT captured on film, tape or anything else. My biggest amazement is that this was ever green-lighted for release as a major motion picture at all, even in the early 70's.    What a shame, I always wondered what happened to this \\"lost gem\\", but now I know. It never actually existed.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson's opening chapter in the Stormlight Archives is epic. If you've read any of his other books, you'll be familiar with his unique and complex magic systems, and this is no different. The Way of Kings is grand in scale and as it follows several characters through the war torn world, you'll find yourself drawn into the complex net the stories weave. If you're a fan of his previous works, Sanderson continues to expand his storytelling muscle. Easily the most prolific work thus far, The Way of Kings promises a legendary saga that I can't wait to continue!
0312600844|5.0|Books like Freedom are the reason I love to read. Most of the books I read are fast-moving thrillers, full of suspense, twists, and turns - the exact opposite of this book. However, I feel like I would have missed a wonderful experience if I hadn't decided to read a book by Jonathan Franzen. Nine years ago Franzen won the National Book Award with Corrections. The fact that it was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection prevented me from picking it up though. Nothing against her personally, I just assumed our tastes in literature wouldn't coincide. Fortunately for me I bought Freedom before Oprah selected it for her book club as well.     Walter and Patty Berglund are a typical Midwestern couple. They marry young and while Walter fell head-over-heals in love with Patty the moment he first laid eyes on her, Patty never felt that way about Walter. In her mind, she feels like she always settled for Walter. She loves the way he treats her more than she loves him. He's an environmental crusader, always looking after the little guy, which eventually leads him to the plight of American songbirds. She's a former high school and college athlete who was initially attracted to Walter's roommate but agrees to date Walter only after his roommate rejects her advances.    The brilliance of this book is Franzen's characters. He follows the Berglunds and their two children throughout their lives. He exposes their flaws and shortcomings as well as their humanity in a way that I can't remember reading in another book. I can't say that I considered any single character in the book \\"likable,\\" yet each one resonated with me, and ultimately I ended up caring about every one of them. My only qualification with recommending this book is its frequent adult content. Some will find that aspect of the book off-putting. But it would be shame if they put the book down because of it. The book as a whole is very rewarding and is sure to appear on every \\"Best of . . . \\" list for years to come.
B000MGATTE|5.0|Anyone looking for another generic spooky tale should reconsider. While some may be dissapointed by this love letter, King's most genuine story to date. This story, while including a supernatural element, truly examines a marriage, with all the love and ugliness and trust it contains. King manages to demonstrate how a true love penetrates everything, and its near gut-wrenching at times. Some readers have been turned off by some of the authors conventions and inside phrases, its hard not to find yourself thinking of the unique language every marriage develops. If you approach this book with an open mind and a willing heart, you can't possibly be dissapointed. Sometimes it feels like King pumps out books just to meet deadlines, but when he's on, he is masterful. Lisey's Story is something special, indeed.

B000063JZQ|4.0|This 1971 movie is simply a magnificent filming skill demonstration. Polansky takes a 400 years old drama, written in the most anti-cinematic language you can imagine, and he manages to generate a solid, powerful, dark film, which resists nicely to 2010 standards comparison. He also uses the filming industry resources at hand to make us believe we are in Middle Age Scotland, with its rainy skies, muddy roads, armored knights, stone castles and barbaric violence. No silly transposing to modern time, this IS what Shakespeare surely had in mind. Macbeth is a play of shocking bloodshed, and Polansky shows us all the blood scenes that happen off-stage in the original, thus adding a stunning realism. No matter how many miles of filmed violence are there since 1971, Duncan's murder here is still a terrifying thing to watch, believe me.<br /><br />Polansky players are very good. They are much younger than those we usually see on stage, because cinema requirements are different, so we can see true-to-story aged characters. Jon Finch is quite convincing, as all the rest of the male cast. Beautiful Francesca Annis lacks (completely) the dark, choked, evil voice Lady Macbeth needs (Kate Fleetwood in the recent Macbeth PBS presentation has that voice, wow!), and Annis \\"Hollywood look\\" may seem frivolous to some purists, but she is cleverly directed by Polansky, so finally makes it.<br /><br />I have no trouble with some non-original issues, like Ross unmoral collaboration with the tyrant and Donalbain visiting the witches: they distract, but don't spoil the whole picture. I think the film soundtrack, by The Third Ear Band, is quite poor: I miss a heavier, richer instrumentation on some scenes, according to the all-time masterpiece we're dealing with.<br /><br />My 1999 Columbia Pictures DVD has very good image remastering in HD, Dolby 2.0 sound, Spanish subtitles are just bare information (with some big mistakes). All in all, a highly recommended DVD.

B0000AKOVP|5.0|I bought this album for my best friend who has just taken his first steps into nicer audio at home. I had bought it on vinyl for myself when the album first came out and again when it first came out in CD format.<br /><br />I've always loved this one as possibly my favorite Stones album, but WOW! On a dynamite system with a very good turntable, preamp, amp and some Thiel tower speakers in a room with good acoustics, this one just blew us away when we first put it on.<br /><br />Nice hefty 180 gram vinyl disc feels substantial in your hands and that's simply a bonus in this case.<br /><br />The sound on this record has been remastered and the result is nothing short of stunning. Crisp clean highs, warm thick mids and solid big-belly bass tones - this album is a solid performer across the frequency spectrum.<br /><br />So if you're looking for an album that will reward you every time you listen to it, you might have to work some to get one better than this little beauty.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones at the height of their powers with a little Nicky Hopkins on keyboards thrown in... YESSSSS!

B002JVWR9U|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is one the best TV Series ever. When I watched the first episode, I thought wow, the plot is exactly like Twilight (which I also like) but as I watch new episodes each week, it just gets better and better. Every episode is filled with intense moments, action, and suspense. As the series goes on, each episode just gets more intense and then ends with a cliffhanger making you want more! This is such an addicting TV show, just one episode and you're hooked! Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley are such great actors. This is a must watch series! :D And I would say this isn't one of those Teen Chick Flicks, it's just a great series for anyone who likes drama, action, and romance. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
0783230079|4.0|I'm a fan of Robert Downey, Jr. but hadn't seen this movie - released in 1993 - until recently when I saw it on TV.  I like it so much that I bought the DVD.    It's the story of four completely different people in the late 1950's who are killed in a bus accident at the precise moment that Robert Downey, Jr.'s character, Thomas, is born.  The four - well-played by Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard and Tom Sizemore - can't get to heaven and their souls are involuntarily linked with Thomas. Thomas is able to see and hear them but others cannot and they act as guardian angels until the boy is about 7 or 8 years old and they realize they are adversely influencing his life and schoolwork.  They explain that they'll watch over him but he'll no longer be able to see or hear them.      Fast forward twenty or so years, and Thomas has grown up to be a very successful but driven businessman who has a somewhat rocky relationship with a young woman, played by Elisabeth Shue.  The four souls reappear to Thomas when they learn they cannot get to heaven until each of them have resolved an issue in their former lives - but they need Thomas' help and  assistance.    This is a sweet, touching and funny romantic comedy with a lot of heart.

1847879071|5.0|I've been teaching statistics for 37 years, as well as consulting with undergraduates, graduate students, colleagues and professionals in the community.  For most of that time, SPSS has been my computer program of choice.  Unfortunately, SPSS has a maddening tendency to revision every couple of years, and those revisions often make it difficult to figure out how to get things done with the program.  There are plenty of other reviews herein that outline what is covered in the book.  I've looked at a number of books designed to facilitate using SPSS, and Field's book is clearly my first choice. It occupies a prominent place in my office.  My only complaint is that it's a bit heavy to carry home from time to time.  What more can I say?
030746363X|5.0|I've been following Tim Ferriss for a couple years since reading his previous book, \\"The 4-Hour Work Week.\\" He is always an interesting read and provides a creative outlook on whatever he finds interesting.    The \\"4-Hour Body\\" is no exception. While I certainly don't recommend taking this book as the ultimate authority on all things health (something Ferriss agrees would be a foolish idea, I might add), it is packed with tips, tricks and techniques that I would have never stumbled across otherwise.    I think my favorite part of this book is the wide spectrum of ideas and health aspects covered. For instance, where most books provide a single diet, Ferriss offers some dietary guidelines he likes most, but then provides multiple tweaks and alternatives. The same goes for his exercise advice. I wasn't very excited about the \\"sets to failure\\" portion, simply because it sounds too hard. In any other book, I would have left discouraged because I didn't want that option, but with the \\"4-Hour Body\\" I simply turned to a new chapter where I read about kettlebell workouts and a creative ab routine - EXACTLY what I was looking for.    Don't think of this book as a health Bible - something you need to memorize and follow religiously. Instead, approach it like a movie rental - browse through the content and only focus on the few chapters that catch your fancy. Each time you reread the book, there will be new intriguing chapters waiting for you ready to help you hack your way to a better body.

B001UV4XFG|2.0|Love Lesson From Twilight #4,267: \\"Love\\" turns all guys into controlling jerks who don't do anything except compete to see whose dingdong is bigger.<br /><br />Sadly that's most of what's going on in \\"Twilight: Eclipse.\\" It's the best of the series thus far, mainly because some underdeveloped characters get some backstory and there are some interesting action scenes... but the movie is smothered in a thick coating of phlegmlike teen angst, whining and bickering. It gets to the point where you WISH the bad guys would arrive.<br /><br />In summary: Edward (Robert Pattinson) is pestering Bella (Kristen Stewart) to marry him. Bella doesn't want to because (boohoo) her parents are divorced and marriage is dead to her, but she DOES want to become a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wants Bella to dump Edward and be with him instead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the evil Victoria is raising an army of newborn vampires to come to Forks and kill Bella. Yes, seriously -- she raised an entire army to kill ONE bland human teenager. Not the Cullens, or the people of Forks. Just Bella. And since the entire universe revolves around Bella, both the werewolves and the Cullens are desperate to protect her. So they overcome centuries of mutual hatred and join forces to protect her.<br /><br />I will admit it: \\"Twilight Eclipse\\" is easily the best movie in this series... which is like saying that a pinch is less unpleasant than a poke in the eye. Amazingly, there are actually some taut, fast-paced scenes here, as well as some creepy eerie scenes involving the newborn army (like their  too-briefly glimpsed mayhem in Seattle).<br /><br />Too bad that isn't what the plot is REALLY about. Instead, we're battered with a bad teen soap opera -- lots of heavy breathing, kissing, whining, and romantic estrangements that last about two minutes. The dialogue is painfully vapid (\\"You love him.\\" \\"I love you more.\\" \\"I know\\"), and the director seems to be desperately trying to come up with some kind of plot other than Edward and Jacob being emo jerks.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice. And the insipid Bella just drifts through the movie, more of a living MacGuffin than a heroine. It's hard to see why not one but TWO boys would be ready to die for a boring girl who just sits there breathing through her large front teeth.<br /><br />Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort. Unfortunately his character has turned into a controlling jerk to rival Edward, and the two male leads have more sexual chemistry with each other (the tent scene) than with the leaden Stewart. In fact, the only decent character development is given to Jasper and Rosalie, and seeing their backstories (especially Rosalie's bloodthirsty bride rampage) makes them richer and more intriguing than our bland protagonists.<br /><br />\\"Twilight Eclipse\\" is the best movie of the Twilight series.... which isn't saying much.

B002SQ364Q|5.0|This has to be the BEST movie to capture the *spirit* of the late '60s that I've ever seen. And it never makes it to the stage! It's worth seeing for many reasons.  The fact that it's simply a great movie, all the period details (there's a bonus feature that shows you the depth of work that made it all very authentic) and the  *very best* depiction (creation) of taking acid, ever on film!     It does what Johnny Depp sees in the patterns in that rug in the hotel lobby (\\"Fear & Loathing\\") & expands that by a factor of ten (or more). After the movie, I   went back and watched it two times again. I wrote down the songs that were used in the film and because I KNOW that music, I was able to figure out what  was played during the trip - it starts with \\"Red Telephone\\" by Love and then they process it after a few minutes where it gets very psychedelic, then it blends  into part of \\"Mind Flowers\\" by The Ultimate Spinach and then blends into \\"Raga Manj Khamaj\\" by Ravi Shankar & Ali A. Khan. It ends where the main character  and a hippie (\\"Flower Girl\\") are standing on a hill, looking at the whole Woodstock event at night, where the stage turns into the center of a galaxy, with the  surrounding crowd spinning around that and ends with the most inventive psychedelic experience ever captured on film! (The two of them have tears running  from their eyes, in a close up of their faces, just after experiencing all that, enhancing that most profound and beautiful experience.)    (Amazingly, the director is Ang Lee, mostly well-known for \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" which he won the Oscar for Best Director at the Academy Awards in 2006.)    Taking Acid - I mean Woodstock

B000001GK9|5.0|In late 1982, when I was but a mere lad of 25, I flew to New York to attend two concerts with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. On the last evening, a Saturday, the only piece on the program was a performance of Mahler's Ninth Symphony. While I had heard several versions before the concert, including Karajan's studio recording from 1981 and the Walter/VPO version from 1938, nothing could have prepared me for the experience of hearing this work performed live by Karajan and the BPO. It was the greatest single concert I ever attended of hundreds, bar none. It was a performance that has had an almost mystical effect on me. The passage of time has not diminished my vivid memories of that concert. In fact, if you want to come close to what it was like, listen to the Adagio of this 1982 live recording. There are many other great Ninths, but this one is definitely the desert island record.

0743277708|5.0|I had always heard of this book in relation to being assigned for school, but it was never assigned to me, and I didn't really give it much though. I had heard it described as boring, and books that people have to read for school aren't known for their entertainment value, so I had no interest in reading a stuffy 'modern classic'. I happened to stumble across it in the library one day and flipped through it just to see what it was about, and before I knew it I was several pages in and already loved it. It was charming like a children's book, but the detail in everything-the land, the rabbits, their characters, the plot-was fantastic. I was immersed in the book, just surrounded by the story. I'm sorry it took me so long to find this book!

031603438X|5.0|There is a mysterious aura to Keith Richards that draws people to him out of curiosity.  To me he always presented a contradicting persona, often pictured as sullen and aloof, yet feted as the consummate life of the party in rock and roll terms.  The disheveled and ragged appearance stereotypically conjures up the image of a junkie managing to survive from one fix to the next.  After all, the only survivors of a nuclear holocaust would be cockroaches ... and Keith Richards.  Yet the reality of the matter is that Keith Richards is all of the above and then some ... a recovering junkie that is also pure genius (not just musical), a survivor of the most hedonistic days of rock and roll, a family man and more importantly an openly honest man.  His book both explains and derails the mystery, providing a refreshingly deep and intimate portrait of an extremely interesting, talented and impressive individual.<br /><br />\\"Life\\" is more than a simple biography of a Rock and Roller ... it is, arguably, the only definitive history of the Rolling Stones from a somewhat objective point of view (after all, what does he have to gain or lose?).  \\"Keef\\", in all his rambling glory, spills his guts and gives us a fly on the wall perspective of his life beginning in war-torn Dartford all the way to what seems to be this very moment.  His life is also, of course, the life of the Rolling Stones.  The reader is taken for a journey that succinctly summarizes most every significant (or insignificant) event pertaining to the band.  The personnel changes, the studio sessions, the tours and the drugs.  Every step of the way, we are introduced to juicy tidbits of gossip, hilarious stories and personal feelings on just about everyone he knows and everything can remember.  There is even a testament or two that debunk decades-old myths about the man himself (like that infamous \\"blood transfusion\\" story).  But, the bulk of this memoir is dedicated to the soul or life-blood of Richard's existence ... music.  The overwhelming passion for music that courses through Richard's veins is evident on almost every page of this bulky 570 page monstrosity.  We see an unpretentious and amiable music icon as being just another giddy fan of his blues heroes; as well as someone willing to make music with anyone ... anywhere.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the book starts with Richards being involved in a random drug bust in the deep South (US) during the 1970s and the scenario reads like a scene from \\"Smokey and the Bandit\\" (cunning/brazen troublemaker Richards vs. intellectually challenged, local-yokel sheriff).  It's this classic back-against-the wall story told in Keith's classic sardonic tone that hooks the reader from the start and effectively generates the desire for Keith to start from the very beginning.  Although the book is basically one gigantic ramble, Richard's writing partner (James Fox) seems to have graciously crafted the story into a more readable format.  The numbered chapters are evenly spaced throughout and the intro to each chapter includes an italicized paragraph with tantalizing hints of each chapter's contents.  After reading the entire book, I sensed that these chapters hinted to three major phases in Keith Richard's life:  the meteoric rise of his early years (rise to superstardom to the sudden loss of innocence of Altamont that started a path to oblivion), the dark and blurred decade of the 1970s (where drugs and pure genius seem to function at such an amazingly productive level) and rebirth (a survivor seeing life with a relatively clear head).  Each chapter reads like Keith speaks and the stories are somewhat incoherent at times with brief, choppy sentences and a healthy peppering of Brit jargon (I'm still trying to figure out the apparent difference between \\"mate\\" and \\"friend\\").  But, as the chapters unfold, it becomes harder to dismiss Keith Richards as anything but intelligent, witty and charming.<br />Some pleasant surprises in \\"Life\\":<br /><br />1)The story of such an iconic Rock and Roll star in his own words is priceless.<br />2) The book can also be viewed as an ongoing guitar lesson ... Richard's opens up his bag of tricks and tells us how he crafted his historic musical contributions (like the discovery of the 5-string open-G).<br />3) The frank discussion of his addiction and the depravity he experience is somewhat shocking.<br />4) The open honesty and self-deprecating style of Richard's writing is refreshing, frequently humorous and appreciated.  His is simply a great storyteller.<br />5) He is definitely an odd character with a somewhat strange point-of-view (reaction to his son Tara's death).<br />6) The dichotomy he reveals between the real Keith Richards and the one we've seen and read about over the decades.<br /><br />I thought that almost 600 pages would be difficult to digest, until I realized that his story could legitimately be a multi-volume affair (think Churchill).  While I have nothing but praise for the book, I wished he would have written more on Brian Jones' death and Altamont, as well as more details on his relationship with Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor (who are scarcely mentioned in the book).  \\"Life\\" has given me a new perspective of Keith Richards ... he is definitely not the deep-fried burnout he appears to be.

After watching in 3d you wont feel like watching in normal 2d. At my place i watch movies on Projector but unfortunately no proper 3d projectors are available, the ones which are available are priced exorbitantly. I hope PANASONIC launches a proper 3d projector soon so we (all owners of projectors) can watch 3d movies at home. PANASONIC,PLEASE COME OUT WITH A 3D PROJECTOR SOON.
1608870081|5.0|When I opened this pop up I was amazed!  Felt like a little kid with a new toy.  The art is outstanding and pop ups almost grab you, literally!!  It is one of my prize possessions in my Harry Potter collection.  So many hidden treasures as well so buy one and expect one of those \\"aha\\" moments like when we were kids.  A Must for any Harry Potter collector.
0061251305|5.0|I think get in a new level of leadership because of this book. The book is excellent for anyone that wants to have better relations, perception and influence at any kind of groups, business, personal contacts,  and even family. We start to perceive at what level of operation style is each person or group and the best way to contact motivate influence and take to de next level. We clearly understand from the aggressive primitive mood up to the more advanced cooperative. We can perceive that each group or tribe operates on different levels and even us, depending of the situation goes from one to others.  I am more prepared to deal with my team, clients to be more productive and even to select more efficient persons for each kind of work.  Excellent choice for learn more how to deal with people and groups.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Over all a very well done historical film.  The bolt action rifles used in the film on Guadacanal were later 1903-A3's, with an adjustable sight mounted on the rear of the receiver instead of the only rifles the Marines had at the time the early Model 1903, WW1 vintage, with the ladder sight mounted in front of the reciever on the barrel.  I do understand that early 1903's are not common but they could have hid the sights from the camera on the close ups. I strongly recomend this film least we forget history.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I have been listening to this album now in a snowy winter evening in cold Norway, and it really sets the melancholic, quiet mood of this season. Would be a perfect Christmas gift for any music lover :-)
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is one of the greatest gifts you can give any child. It is brilliant in its coneception , and execution. The animaiton is breathtaking and the music is superb - taking you on a journey of wonder and delight - no words needed. I give this to all the young children in my life -but truth be told - it is for all ages. I usually give this gift with a preface to the parents that they MUST sit and watch it with their children. Preferably with a cup of hot chocolate.;-))
B00192IV9U|2.0|It's incredible. There are three songs: Monster, Breaking News and Keep your head up that sounds nothing like the real Michael Jackson.     Most of us, real fans, know that is an impersonator, Jason Malachi, who is singing in those tracks.    Sony must apologize for this. They are playing with the most incredible legacy in the Pop music history.    Don't buy this album until Sony show us a real proof.
0439023521|5.0|First of a trilogy; this is an excellent dysoptian, futuristic read. Don't let the fact that it's young adult oriented dissuade you. Annually, the Hunger Games are played. Participants are 1 boy, 1 girl from each of the 12 Districts surrounding the Capitol. The 'tributes' (participants) must fight to the death in an televised Arena controlled by the Gamemakers (who can send in natural disasters or dangerous wildlife to keep things interesting); last one standing wins food, oil, respect, etc for his/her District. It's not an original concept per se, but the characters are well-drawn and engaging, the pacing is fluid and even, and I became invested in the story early in. Give it a whirl, folks.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I have enjoyed this cd soooo much. I'm not much of a country music listener, but this was most enjoyable. Norah Jones has a jazz/R&B--contemporary country style to her music and I think like it. I shall try sampling more of her music for future purchases.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Ok, the plot is basically the same as that in the previous karate kid movies.  There are a few differences.  An African-American boy moves to China when his mom gets a job there (US outsourcing, huh?).  He likes a girl who likes him back.  Chinese bully picks on him.  Janitor agrees to teach him KUNG FU.  They have match in the end and ...  The boy becomes a role model for so many American youth, his shear determination, exerting effort and dedication day after day, growth and maturity in spirit ...  He ends up at one point teaching his teacher.  That was neat to see.  If anybody reads many of my reviews, you'll find that I admire Buddhist practices AND I love architecture.  Well, from the Great Wall to Temples to Downtown Beijing, spanning thousands of years, it provides a backdrop to the story, that always mankind is faced with troubles and must learn to first look within before one can hope to successfully take on the fight outside ourselves.  Whether I'm right or not, the story is exciting!  While I really enjoyed the previous KK movies, this one is my favorite.  My kids gave it only 4 stars, but, I think it was well worth 5 stars.  Folks who like it will want to watch it again and again.  Those who don't will wonder why they bought it.  So, for all movies you haven't gone to the theater to watch, borrow this from the public library.  I suspect that you will very much enjoy it.  If so, then I'd buy it.  I think that it is a movie that appeals to martial artists, intercultural studies, eastern philosophy, architecture.  It ought to belong in public libraries, some school libraries.  I give everything a grade, and this movie I give an \\"A-\\".  I highly recommend it.

B00192IV9U|2.0|I'll keep this short - this album was released to make some executives money and not in \\"memory\\" of MJ.  Some of the songs are definitely good but the quality of the recording is just abysmal.  I know that MJ would not have released an album in this condition.  I have a very good audiophile system and can hear the difference in recording quality of various CDs, and this is one of the worst I've heard.  Some of the songs are vintage MJ and others probably shouldn't have been released - which is to be expected or else MJ would have released the songs already.  Overall, I just wish the recording quality had been there.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|If you have ever been hurt this album will make you feel good again.... Wow! I got 5 words ''Classic Soul Clinching-Soul Music''... You know being from the south some say that its the life of soul music... And I'm from the Delta the birthplace of the blues & in the past I wouldn't have agreed with that statement more.... But I learned a couple years ago that soul music can be anything not just Blues or R&B which I grew up on mainly.... But anything that literally moves your soul .... Whether its Indie, Rock, Folk, Neo- Soul, Country Etc........ I found this to be so true when dealing with heartache...... Listening to Mumford & Sons I was totally blew away.. \\"The Cave\\" catching my attention with the yells & chants & Mumford's strong voice, seemingly like it was directed towards me & \\"After the Storm\\" taking me home in the end again seemingly directed again towards me letting you know that love will heal you, I got the message in every stanza & line... From track 1 to 12.... With the lyrics of Marcus Mumford & the gradual, thunderous, uptempo build to some of the ballads & the simply sick-beautiful banjo being the X-Factor.... this album will literally have you tapping your feet & raising your hands in the air... Me being a black kid from Mississippi I would have never thought in a million month of sundays that I would ever like folk music in which I have come to love it...... From The Averett Brothers to Bob Dylan & undoubtely now Mumford & Sons.... Please try this album out it will make you feel good all over.........
B002ZG99NG|5.0|I have never been a Ben Affleck fan, for the longest time the only thing I ever liked him in was in Mallrats and Chasing Amy but after that I just felt like his career just went idle for years. I really didn't like him when he was basically banking his money off the fact that his name was tied to \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" and just mailed in a few performances. But I must say that now he's come back down to Earth and has settled down with his life it just seems like to me that everything that he's tying his name to has more merit to it than let's say \\"Reindeer Games, and Gigli.\\" What really made me start noticing the change in Affleck was when I went and saw Hollywood Land in theaters a few years ago, and his portrayal of George Reeves was just terrific. But now back to this movie, The Town is an absolute treat for sore eyes. I've seen way too many true crime thrillers over my lifetime and I must say that this one is a must have. I wouldn't be surprised if this film one day is considered an absolute cult classic. The reason why I say this is because one of my personal favorite movies in this genre is Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas. To me this film is up there with ether one of them, what it lacks in plot line, makes up with in overall character design and execution. In fact this movie reminds me of a modern day Reservoir Dogs. So, all in all if anyone of you out there have decided not to check this flick out in the theater, definitely red box it, check it out, and I guarantee you'll fall in love with it like I did.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|An excellent film. No, it is not fast-paced, yes, the camera does pan lovingly over the landscape (and takes some really outstanding aerial shots), yes, George says very little and there seems to be no traffic (of any kind) in this part of Italy. However, as a somber character study of a death dealer approaching death it is just excellent. I found the atmosphere, the pacing, the minimal dialogue (much of it in Italian) and the minutiae of 'Jack's' craft thoroughly absorbing. I see it as a counterpoint to the ridiculousness of the other films in the action/thriller genre - not that they aren't enjoyable on their own level. Whereas in other films a Matt Damon or a Pierce Brosnan would jump on a high powered motorcycle for the chase scene, Clooney uses a thoroughly Italian scooter. The weapons employed are small, subtle, appropriate. This film to me recalled Day of the Jackal (1973) in its ability to evoke the stealthy, paranoid world of the international assassin. Kudos to George for taking on such a quiet role and for bringing to it a depth of feeling (just watch his eyes) that really evokes the chilly world of unredeemed loneliness and isolation his chosen career necessitates. I like this film very much.
B0031R5K68|1.0|I fear that Dan Brown can no longer rest on his laurels.  After a promising introduction the plot becomes predictable and deteriorates into a plethora of frustratingly unrealistic interior monologues.
B0044KU7EQ|4.0|52 discs-all ranging between 50+ and 60+ minutes, with 1 disc (Vol. 38-Jimmy Rushing and Tampa Red) clocking in at 79 minutes+ and 1 disc (Vol. 25-Little Willie John and Smiley Lewis) in the 49+ minute range.  The sound (both mono and stereo) varies from artist to artist (and sometimes track to track) depending on the (vinyl) sources used.  Audiophiles will not be enamored with the sound in places, but blues lovers used to slightly inferior sound from old sources will find the music takes precedent over the sometimes rough sound.  I initially listened to this set through a good quality pair of headphones which puts everything front and center, and since it's not stated, I'm assuming this music has not been remastered in any way.  This isn't a case of the music fighting background hiss, like old Paramount recordings-these are just older analog sources used for the music.  Good quality tracks, for example, by Tommy Johnson or Skip James (Vol. 20), are harder to find, so background hiss, and snaps and crackles are inevitable.  There are also occasional short sonic anomalies on a few tracks throughout the set, but nothing that really gets in the way of enjoying some great blues.  The upside is that the music has a real warmth and straightforward honesty to it, which is sometimes absent from digital mastering.  Anyone familiar with the 10 CD box sets like \\"Diggin' Deeper\\", \\"Rhythm & Blues\\", or \\"Goin' Mad Blues\\" (released by the same company-with duplications here so beware) will have some idea of the sound.  But the chance to have so many fine early recordings in one, single collection, for blues lovers (like me), is to good to pass up.  For the most part, each disc has two performers, with artists like Bo Diddley, Jimmy Yancey, and Robert Johnson each having an entire disc to themselves.<br /><br />Each disc is in a fairly thick cardboard envelope with artist, song title, and song length on the back.  The outer box (approximately 10\\"x10\\") is substantial cardboard, with a lid that slips completely off.  The back of the box lists the performers, and has the (I'm assuming) caveat \\"Incl. Historical Recordings\\", which to me means the sound is less than pristine.  But I didn't purchase this set thinking the sound was perfect-older recordings are what they are-it's the music that's important here.  The photograph on the front of the box is carried over on all the CD sleeves.  The box is divided into fourths, with the discs stacked in three compartments.  The fourth contains the Hohner Puck harmonica, made in Germany, which is in it's own (1\\"x3\\") box-a nice touch.  There's also a 4 page advertising pamphlet on Hohner Harmonicas included.  The 27 page booklet (which is just slightly smaller than the outer box) contains some nice information (not always accurate) on the artists in alphabetical order.  There are a few (b&w) photographs of artists included with their write-ups.  However, it would have been nice (especially for blues newcomers-and easy for the record company) to have a photo of each artist next to their respective essay.  But for those interested, photographs are found easily enough both on the internet and in stand alone books on the blues.  A quick thought for newcomers-I recommend learning more about the blues, the era (s) and blues artists-it makes the music much more interesting and exciting.<br /><br />This is an overview of the blues, from the country to the city.  All the various styles of blues, featuring over 100 artists, are represented-acoustic country blues (Kokomo Arnold), New Orleans style (Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith), swamp blues (Arthur Gunter), big city electric blues (Buddy Guy), jump blues (Roy Milton), piano based blues (Jimmy Yancy), jazz/blues (Jimmy Rushing), religious (as opposed to true gospel) blues (Blind Willie Johnson), and some blues bordering on early r&b (Richard Berry-\\"Louie Louie\\").  Every style of blues has a number of representatives, from well known artists (Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Skip James, Elmore James, Little Walter, Magic Sam, Charley (Charlie) Patton, Bessie Smith, Jimmy Reed, Son House, Junior Wells, both Sonny Boy Williams 1&2, Robert Johnson, and so on), to a quite a few that may be new (Blue Lu Barker, Barbecue Bob, Cousin Joe, Tommy McClennan, Frankie Lee Sims, Peetie Wheatstraw (\\"the Devil's Son-in-Law\\"), Big Maceo, Big Maybelle, Robert Nighthawk, Eddie Taylor, as examples) to the casual listener.  To list all the artists would be quite a chore-so refer to the Amazon page, which lists the artists.  As often happens, songwriting credits are sometimes a bit loose, but the music is still great, no matter who claims credit.  The performances  are not arranged chronologically according to when they were recorded, so this is not a disc to disc history of the blues as such.  The artists are arranged more or less alphabetically, which makes for some aural jumps from style to style, but the music is so fine that that's a minor consideration.<br /><br />The music is from the early years (even the big city blues artists), with nothing contemporary, which helps with the focus of this set.  The country/acoustic blues are pure and straightforward, and the city/electric blues have some scorching performances.  The sheer time that could (and will) be spent listening to this set is truly staggering.  There is so much good music that demands to be heard that many people will find themselves going back for another listen to a favorite artist or possibly someone new to them.  This is a box set bordering on overwhelming in it's scope and size.  But the music is so good, so honest, so intense and  passionate, that it makes this collection a valuable addition to virtually anyone's blues library.<br /><br />Anyone who has a distinct bias towards the blues, no matter if you're a long time listener or are fairly new to the blues, will enjoy this collection.  There will be tracks that are familiar, but there will also be unfamiliar music here (unless you're a deep collector) that will help fill in a number of areas of blues styles.  This music has a deeper feel if you listen to it very late at night/very early in the morning when everything is quiet.  The warm, sometimes slightly distant, (vinyl) sound of these tracks gives this music real atmosphere-at times you feel as if you're listening to one of the old radio stations that plays classic old blues records, which you've somehow stumbled across and picked up late at night-and that late night sound and feel gives this music even more magic.e Hooker, Skip James, Elmore James, Little Walter, Magic Sam, Charley (Charlie) Patton, Bessie Smith, Jimmy Reed, Son House, Junior Wells, both Sonny Boy Williams 1&2, Robert Johnson, and so on), to a quite a few that may be new (Blue Lu Barker, Barbecue Bob, Cousin Joe, Tommy McClennan, Frankie Lee Sims, Peetie Wheatstraw (\\"the Devil's Son-in-Law\\"), Big Maceo, Big Maybelle, Robert Nighthawk, Eddie Taylor, as examples) to the casual listener.

B00192IV9U|5.0|Woe betide the critics who still find it relevant to compare a record (or series of unreleased records) to masterpieces of the past. It just goes to show you how extremely pathetic (and reluctantly tolerable) music is today. Woe betide the fans, who for so long have been so desperate to hear new MJ material that they've lost sight (or hearing as the case may be) of what sounds like him or not, so much so aiding a controversy that should not be, therby fuelling unnecessary debate and media attention (though the latter does the album a fair amount of publicity). Finally, woe betide the haters, who just don't know what the truth sounds like anymore, and always reminding people of closed cases that has absolutely nothing to do with what we are even concerned about now... an album that has the King of Pop on it... finished or not.<br /><br />You would think that in the state of digital music and a very worrisome music industry, people, especially music lovers, would appreciate the creativity and magnficence unfinished music that sounds finished coming from MJ had to offer. I feel ashamed, as an MJ fan and a music lover. Don't get me wrong. I am up for any music of today, but that all takes a backseat once MJ is involved, more so because of 'Michael'.<br /><br />I'm no fan of Sony, but I do commend them for what they have done so far (and expect more from them in the future as far as MJ is concerned). In my state of lack of the Christmas spirit this year, 'Michael' has made it possible for me to be some steps closer to enjoying the season. It really is a great Christmas gift for all MJ fans everywhere... at least for those who choose to view it that way. RIP Michael Jackson.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Last year I fell in love with Nicholas Spark's books. I have read all of his book in less than a month, but I think this book does not really compare to the ones he wrote  3 or 4 years ago. Please, don't get me wrong I'm not saying the book is bad, it is just OKAY! nothing amazing!
1926778103|5.0|As far as I know, this book is the first of its kind.  I've never seen a book of video game concept art published before.  This book delivers in spades, but keep in mind that most of it is NOT finished artwork or 3D renders.  The vast majority of the book is concept art in varying degrees of completion, and it gives you a truckload.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't really care to look at page after page of sketches of a particular character's head.  The book is a bit too comprehensive for those with only a casual appreciation of art.  I would recommend it to art students and fanatical Darksiders fans only.  I really like the game, but getting this book was like having an entire cake set down in front of me when all I asked for was one slice.

This is somehting that you can even do in steps if you dont want to spend hours at a time doing.  It was fun, and the directions were basically simple.  I had a few questions but I figured them out. You dont need alot of extra materials.  Just some sticks and the melts.  My imagination was running wild.  There are very good pictures with this book also.
B003L20ICE|3.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\" was released this year and shows teen-age children of same-sex parents, Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Benning) struggling with questions on the identity of their sperm-donor dad (Mark Ruffalo).  Jules and Nic have been married for many years, live in a comfortable home in Southern California and each had a child by the same sperm-donor.  Laser started the family's emotional chain reaction by asking Joni, who is now 18, to contact their father before she leaves for college.  By law, she can do so without the knowledge of her  parents.<br /><br />\\"Bio-dad\\" Paul (Mark Ruffalo),  is contacted and agrees to see the kids.  He finds he actually has emotional ties to them, and the children are impressed by his easy ways and carefree bachelor lifestyle.  He has a motorcycle and owns and runs a restaurant and organic gardens.  They contrast them to their dominant mother, Nic, who is a control freak, and conservative medical doctor.  Jules goes from one failed project to another.  Her latest idea for a job is becoming a landscaper.  The family unit is strong but when sperm-donor  dad and Jules  start working together on a landscaping project, they have a fling , and family ties are threatened.<br /><br />It is fun at first as everyone gets to know each other.  But then unexpected things happen.  Bio-Dad causes an upheaval and each family member wants to know where they fit in.  The children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) feel their parent's pain.<br /><br />Overall it is an enjoyable movie and it highlights how the definition of family has changed, although emotional dynamics remain the same.
B00192IV9U|5.0|\\"Track by Track\\"....review:    1. Hold my Hand is awesome because of the positive message: simple lyrics and great video, although the production could be turned down a notch in the final parts. Amazing final note by Michael...reminiscent of the glory days of OFF THE WALL! Yes listen to it there is a bit of the \\"good old MJ\\"  in here!    2. Hollywood Tonight: The song's instrument is the beatboxing that goes on for 3 minutes or more! Yes, show me another song like it! This a club hit! Dance song!    3. The Way You Love Me: Great vocals by Michael. A mid tempo song with MJ taking the \\"woos\\" to the infinite level. He was experimenting!    4. Best of Joy: Recorded in 2009. It proves MJ still had it, only now he was mature sounding and still manage to have the featherlight voice!This song is mid-tempo. If THIS IS IT movie didn't convince you, then listen to this!    5. Another Day: This is an awesome \\"rock\\" song. Guitar by Lenny Kravitz. Nirvana fans will find David Grohl drumming here! Song is mellow and fierce...all at the same time!    6. Behind the Mask: Razor sharp vocals by MJ bite through the 80s synthesizer! MJ creates the both the rhythm and melody flawlessly with his voice! Another club hit!    7. Much Too Soon: Fitting final song. This has a slow-mid tempo song. MJ sings about a lost love. There are many different emotions showcased in this song. Amazing.    Great compilation album. Must buy these!

B000R4SMCW|5.0|This is a review of Fracture. And the only Hannibal\\" I ever knew (from the stories 248-183 BC) that amounted to something, was a Carthaginian who marched his army including elephants into and conquered Rome and occupied it during the First Punic Wars. But this film captured my attention. Maybe it was because I synapsed many of my neurons in earlier years at a practice of medicine, but I had to watch this film four times to finally figure out each piece, i.e., the changing of the handgun, how he did it at the house as he was being arrested and subdued, and a few other parts.<br /><br />I thought for a relative newcomer Ryan Gosling did an extremely good job. Sure, parts of the film were created: the legal issues you had to believe; but other parts of the film were done very well. Anthony Hopkins did a good job as I see it, as an aircraft accident investigator though likely this would be handled in real-life by the NTSB (though a privately-sought rendition could be sought by an interested concern, though they are not inexpensive). The description of the entry wound and he path of the finally resting bullet were accurately described, as well as the residual compromise of the motor and other functions.<br /><br />The ending was not particularly surprising, but I would have like to have seen what was said at opening arguments at the second trial. I suppose that might have diminished the many other legal foibles noted and pointed out already. Altogether, I find this among the top five of the maybe two hundred plus films I have seen this year. I first got mine in a shop by trading disks but wanted to see it widescreen, so I ordered it that way as Amazon has everything.
0316098337|4.0|In her seventh novel \\"Room\\", Irish born writer (and now Canadian citizen) Emma Donoghue has created a must read for all. Triggered by the 2008 Josef Fritzel Case, this horrific yet touching novel, now shortlisted for the Man Booker prize, explores the everlasting bond of love between a mother and her son.  Seven years ago a young woman, kidnapped at nineteen, was locked in a fortified room and repeatedly raped. She now has a five year old son, \\"Jack\\", and it is through his thoughts that Donoghue tells their emotional journey of survival and escape.   Its publisher claims it to be \\"a novel like no other\\". I hasten to agree with this statement as Donoghue's unique use of language appears to explore the mind of a child with deep and meaningful understanding. The language was so detailed that I instantly found myself desperately trying to remember my thoughts as a child in comparison to Jack's.   Jack's entire life has been lived in a solitary room that measures just eleven foot square; to him, Room is the entire world. The author is able to reflect Jack's youth and innocence by creating characters out of inanimate objects within the room, and giving them a name and gender. Readers will begin to feel an emotional bond towards characters such as \\"Wardrobe\\", \\"Rug\\" and \\"Plant\\" who make up a significant part of Jack's world. As a consequence, the room takes on a life of its own.    Donoghue makes no attempt to hide disturbing events which occur throughout Jack and Ma's emotive journey. When Ma's kidnapper \\"Old Nick\\" comes into the room at night, Jack is forced to hide in Wardrobe and listen to the creaks of the bed. Using a child's innocent account to describe such a horrific event makes this an unbearable world for the reader as well as for Jack and Ma.    Although the narrative is told from Jack's viewpoint, we learn much about Ma. To Jack, Room is the only world which exists, but for Ma, it is a dismaying prison in which she has tried to build a normal life for her son.I eventually found myself empathising with the Ma through Jack's narrative. It's clear that she has spent the last five years nurturing and teaching Jack, but she chooses to let him believe that there is no world outside Room. Ma is a survivor. Despite the years of confinement, her determination and love for Jack encourages her to continue dreaming up ways to escape.  After their dreams of escaping Room become reality, Jack and Ma are the centre of a media storm. Both Jack and Ma struggle to cope in \\"Outside\\" and for the first time we see their relationship become vulnerable.  Although the storyline is endearing, I don't believe that this book would have been so successful if it had not been narrated through Jack's thoughts. Donoghue's ingenious use of language and gripping storyline create a substantial amount of sympathy for Ma and Jack, but also evoke a distinctive feeling of gratitude within the reader, which lingers on for days. I felt that I could no longer perceive the world in the same way; the novel provided me with an overwhelming sense of thankfulness for the privileged life I lead. For me, \\"Room\\" highlights a vivid and beautiful expression of maternal love between a mother and her son.   This book will touch your heart.

0739384171|5.0|Stieg Larsson will go down in history as one of the all time mystery writers.  His trilogy keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first book, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" through the last book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\".  There is violence and sexual violence, but that is the basis of the story.  The story itself gets away from the violence and concentrates on the character development, the intrigue, and the mystery solving.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is an odd duck, to be sure but the strength of character she exhibits to rise above the violence and cruelty of her past is an example to us all.
0060977493|1.0|I am in an Indian Literature course and this book was one of our reading assignments for the semester. This book however has been one of the worst books i have ever suffered through. I am about half way through it now and am only continuing through sheer force of will in order to discus it in class. The writing has such a fascination on poetic descriptions that the author take pages describing things that in no way advance the plot. Many paragraphs i skipped to avoid the needless descriptions and repetition that occurs in the story. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters because they did not seem fully developed or have any appealing attributes. In addition the story jumps through time without letting you know for many pages what time period you are reading about. I think worst of all were the random insertions of vulgarity that serve no purpose towards advancing plot and do not fit with the poetic language in the rest of the plot. Roy describes a naked man sitting on the lever at a rail road crossing whose penis and balls are pointed down towards the ground. In no way does this scene have anything to do with what is being described or what happens next. Many other similar insertions, frequently to do with human anatomy, occur that are just vulgarity for vulgarity's sake. I am not a prude, but graphic descriptions of genitalia or molestation seem needless and disgusting.
B001VNB54A|4.0|The Pacific is a follow-up to the Band of Brothers which was about \\"Easy Company 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) of the 101st Airborne Division.  The Pacific principally followed three Marines of the 1st and 5th Marines in the Pacific Theatre through the war from the invasion of Guadacanal up to the \\"bloody\\" and vicious carnage of the battle for Okinawa.  The series showed some of the horrors of the war from the USMC perspective.  The series is a good example of why we need to honor these veterans and not forget those who perished fighting for their beliefs and countries no matter which side they were on.  This was an extremely crazy period of time where countries were bent upon destroying one another, the good part is this has been placed where it belongs, in the past and we can now live in peace again as allied nations once more (US and Japan).  This series was based on the stories of actual Marines, two of whom were buddies in school in Mobile, Alabama.  There was also a portion concerning GYSGT John Basilone, a Medal of Honor receipient at Guadacanal and later killed at Iwo Jima, he is still revered by Marines and many people in the US to this day. Also mentioned was the late and great LTGen Chesty Puller, an icon of what a Marine Officer is all about.  I felt this series was quite good but not as well done as \\"The Band of Brothers.\\"  I would like to see in the future a couple of series done; one about the US Army Air Corps and their actions over fortress Europe and the other about the US Navy during the battles of the Pacific, their stories need to be told as well. I would strongly recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the War in the Pacific and the role of the USMC.  Be prepared for some very graphic carnage of war. I have always been interested in WW-II because my father an uncle and other cousins all served and these men served and fought in both theatres; one cousin was lost as a pilot on a bombing mission in 1943 MIA, he was very close to my dad and uncle and was an only child, a valedictroian of both his HS and college classes.  This cousin and I share the same day of birth ironically December 7th 26 years apart.
0061733199|5.0|If you have ever been interested in hunting, surviving, camping, hiking, or general outdoorsy knowledge - this is an essential book.  I found myself taking notes and learning something on almost every page.  Sure, there may not be much need for weaving coats from seal carcasses in Illinois - but you never know.  Honestly, there is a chapter or two that deals with things I may never see:  the remainder is a text-book style learning guide.  Medicinal plants, poisonous plants, knot making, skinning animals, hide-tanning, edible plants, tracking, reading weather, accumulating water, first aid, etc.  I was so impressed with this book, I started giving it out as Christmas presents to my buddies.  A no-nonsense wealth of information that doesn't have the \\"zombie-invasion\\" or \\"look how much I know\\" spin to it.  Buy two.

B00192IV9U|3.0|Sounds like a bunch of sound bites from pervious album recording from Off The Wall to Thriller with some demos tossed in and mashed together. Amazing what you can do with computers vice cutting old magnetic tape and splicing them together in the old dazes. Hard core fans will flock to anything that has his name on it. To coin Alice Cooper - \\"there always lost tapes in the vault\\".
B00136RYXG|5.0|I love this album.  Several of the songs are on my personal list of all-time faves (\\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and \\"Just Like A Pill\\"), and all the songs are interesting and well put-together.  Her songs range from awesome dance tracks (\\"M!ssundasztood\\" and \\"Respect\\") to funky car-singalong jams to honest and heartbreakingly personal ballads.  Her sound is original and instantly recognizable, and she always stands out from the crowd.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|I don't know if comic-drama is the right term for this film.  In watching the special features the point was made, over and over, that this was a comedy.  This suprised me because I saw it as a serious treatment of a woman with a real problem.  Then I realized that there were a lot of comic moments...hence my use of the term comic-drama.    I think that the director did strike just the right balance between a serious story about alcohol abuse and a relatively light hearted approach to it.  It's not heavy like The Days of Wine and Roses or Lost Weekend.  Yet it doesn't trivialize the problem either.    Sandra Bullock carries the film.  She's very good, showing the full range of cool and callous New Yorker and the vulnerable person underneat the facade.  She doesn't strike a wrong note anywhere.      The supporting cast is just as fine.  The young woman (sorry, I can't remember her name) who plays Sandra's 19 year old room mate in the rehab center is wonderful.  The fellow who plays the German is hilarious.  Viggo Mortensen, whom I love, is only in a small part of the film.  Unfortunately he didn't quite nail the Southern Red Neck accent, which seriously mars his performance but he looks great.    All in all, this is a well made film that gives a balanced and enjoyable view of a serious subject.
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|I'm getting tired of his rehashing of very old songs. I'm one of his giggest fans as I own every album and DVD of his, but enough already with the old tired songs.I know he's earned the right to put out what he wants, but his record company will be dumping him soon if he puts out many more dogs like this.
B0009F9O6M|3.0|As to be expected, the band third studio set \\"H To He Who am the Only One\\" was recorded amidst another round of personnel turmoil.  This time around former The Misunderstood bassist Nic Potter decided to tender his notice midway through the recording sessions.  King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp was brought in as a guest and the shake up didn't seem to have a major impact on the recording sessions.  Produced by John Anthony, this may have been the band's creative zenith.  Mind you, as you probably figured out from the goofy title (anyone got a clue?), it wasn't their most commercial, or accessible ousting so newbies and the casual fan might want to sample something else in the VDGG catalog before jumping in with this one.    - Even though it stretched out over eight minutes and found David Jackson literally freaking out on sax, 'Killer' stood as a fantastic song and one of those progressive pieces that deserved it's classic status.  Propelled by a surprisingly commercial riff and Peter Hammill's dark and scary vocals, the plotline was largely lost on me (using a shark's life as an allegory for life as an anti-social introvert?), though I have to admit that the 'fish can't fly' chorus has always made me smile.  - 'House with No Door' stood as the song for folks who didn't think VDGG could put together a straightforward commercial track.  A simply stunning ballad, Hammill kept his over-the-top tendencies in check, turning in a stark and compelling performance highlighted by what may have been Jackson's prettiest flute solo.  Great piano and organ from High Banton and Hammill.    My only complaint - they faded it out too soon.  - A two part suite, 'The Emperor In His War - Room' featured Robert Fripp, though his performance was relatively low keyed and didn't kick in under towards the start of 'The Room'.  Musically 'The Emperor' segment was a fairly conventional ballad apparently meant to provide insight into the mindset of a political tyrant ...  you can see why I normally don't try to second guess lyrics.  Not quite as commercial 'House with No Door', but with a pretty and distinctive melody.  'The Room' opened up with Fripp, then bounced around between slower and more upbeat segments.  Given the track's complexity, Guy Evans turned in some nice drumming to keep it tied together and focused.  - Longtime fans seem to consider 'Lost' the standout performance, but I'm going to go against the current and suggest that clocking in at over 11 minutes the two part suite was one of the lesser performances.  To my ears it captured Hammill and company at their most theatric and over-the-top pompous. Musically it was all over the place giving all the players an opportunity to stretch out.  Certainly listenable and occasionally even pleasant, but not my favorite.  - Hum, imagine VDGG doing science fiction lyrics ... well you don't need to go any further than the closer 'Pioneers Over C'.  Musically this one didn't do a great deal for me, the band bouncing around an extended piece without any real form or format.  On the other hand it had a fascinating lyric that seemed to have something to do with the possibilities of time travel (I/m not a big sci-fi fans).  I borrowed this Hammill interview off the official VDGG website:    \\"This is my only attempt at writing a specifically sci-fi song, although the balancing is much more towards fiction than science.  Man's first plunge into the unknown territory beyond the speed of light (c): in the light of the discoveries necessary for the attempt, the date is meaningless, although in rational terms it is ludicrously optimistic. The Pioneers... the first hypernauts... are, because of theoretical deficiencies, thrown into time-warp or absolute relativity, in which they exist as 'creatures' of limitless imagination but total non-physicality. They are thus potentially ghouls, ghosties, poltergeists and all manner of indefinable Forces: this is one possible explanation but, truly, in such circumstancesexplanations are meaningless, irrelevant and totally speculative.  My only regret is that I found it necessary to provide a certain chronological continuity in order to remain, if faintly, within the bounds of comprehension. I don't pretend that there are any answers here, and any questions are entirely subjective.\\"    Summation - One of the lost treasures in the VDGG catalog and something every progressive fan should at least hear, if not own.    \\"H To He Who am the Only One\\" track listing:  (side 1)  1.)

0439023513|3.0|My wife and I both loved the first two books.  They were very real and caused you to connect deeply to the characters.  Because of this connection, we were both very upset with the death of some characters that we fell in love with.  We have both also read the Gregor the Overlander series so we have come to expect Suzanne to kill off major characters.  The part that upset us both was how she did it and how careless it seemed.  Both of us felt that the end of this book was just thrown together and didn't really seem to know where it was going.  All in all, still a great series, but wish it would have ended better.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love Vampire Diaries. It's a great mix of intensity when comparing it to fantastic True Blood Series and the darn near G-Rated Twilight Saga.  Has more of an edge to it and the writers seem to have more freedom with nature of material used and vocabulary for that matter.  Who doesn't like Iam Somerhalder!!!
B004CAWSKE|5.0|Delain has become my all time favorite band now since discovering Symphonic Metal.  This album is one of the few albums by any band that I truely love every song.  Charlotte Wessel's melodic voice has matured and become as powerful and unique as any I've heard.  Martijn Westerholt's symphonic style keyboards and orchestration of the music is fantastic, making the sound truely epic.  The guest appreance by Marco Hietala from Nightwish on tracks 4 and 11 is once again, a very prime element of this album that is wonderful.  Over all, of Delain's first two albums I love this one the most.  Its variety within the album itself to me stands out as thier best work to date, and I am anxious for thier new release in Jan or Feb of 2011 hopefully.
B001VNB54A|1.0|I received the series as a Christmas gift from my son. Several years ago he had given me a similar gift of \\"The Band of Brothers\\" CD set. My hobby is reading World War II non-fiction and I have been at it for around 5 decades having been born during the same war.    I had previously read the senior and now deceased Steven Ambrose's account of \\"...Brothers\\". It was one of the best non-fiction books that I have ever read on any subject. When I saw, in the trailer of that video series, on the eve of D Day, airplanes with three white vertical stripes on the fusillage and wings, I knew it was going to be an authentic account of a great book. The markings were termed \\"invasion stripes\\" that were intended to help allied troops identify friendly aircraft. The series subsequently exceeded my expectations and I have watched it scores of times since and read all the other accounts of \\"The Band of Brothers\\" written by other members of Winters' Company.     I had read the individual biography of Medal of Honor winner John Basilone by James Brady. I also read the autobiography of Eugene Sludge. Brady questioned the historical accuracy of two previous biographies of Basilone, after his death in the war. One was written by his older sister and the other by his nephew. Brady felt that the books were based to a large extent on John's letters,their memories of him, and the extant public records. He felt that some of the blanks that existed were filled in by creative writing. Sludges account of his own actions were to the best of his own recollection as he stated.    I just finished watching the opening few minutes of the first CD and became immediately discouraged. There is a scene of a Lt. Colonel, (I think), making a presentation to a group of NCO's that in itself is extremely unlikely (where are the lieutenants, captains and majors?). He has a world map behind him that is clearly the product of this century's graphics. You may recall the Air Corp briefings in that time frame that employed strings and pins. The worst is that the map shows that Iceland has been invaded by the Nazis. As I recall, it was the US Navy and the Marines that staged a preemptive and friendly capture. They did not act on Hitler's behalf I do not think.    My most heartfelt thanks and love to my son Paul for the wonderful thought in buying the set in the first place. But....
B002OHN5NQ|1.0|The standard charger at least in 6 volt variety uses such small eyelets that you have to separately buy this.  Then, this product uses such a (cheap) short lead on it that it makes the quick connection point very close to the battery itself basically.  In my case plan on opening the hood or in some cases like on a Model A, lifting the floorboard and trim!  This was not acceptable, I ended having to cut the wires, splice in a longer wire, solder it, heat shrink it - by the time I was done I could have made the entire thing myself using the stock Ctek connector.  I complained to the Mfg and the guy did not see what the problem was having to buy something to make the charger work with a classic car it was supposed to be designed for, then when you get it, the thing is so cheap the cord is too short.<br /><br />The stock charger comes with similar short lead to quick disconnect, but the eyelets are designed for like tiny screws, maybe a old small motorcycle type would fit.  And the metal eyelets were so cheap trying to ream them out or drill them destroyed them.

B003EI2EH2|3.0|Entertaining and perhaps helpful book, but the kindle edition doesn't have a table of contents so if you want to go back and review certain sections you have to skip around to find them.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|Didn't buy this from Amazon, but let me tell you this is seriously the WORST controller I have EVER used.  If you do not have large hands, this controller will most DEF. cause your hand to cramp very early on.  I tested this controller on a variety of games and have several cons with the controller:<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Controller does not feel \\"right\\" with every game.  Not every PS3 game out there lets you use L2 to aim and R2 to shoot.  For example, Dead Space does not let you re-map any of the controls.  This makes the Pro Elite actually feel more awkward than the PS3 controller.<br /><br />2) CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP material was used to construct this controller.  It seriously felt I could crush the controller by just holding it.<br /><br />3) Controller auto powers off after 3-5 min.  This seems like it would be a cool feature, but actually causes the controller to become a pain in the A**!  Some games have loooong cut scenes (i.e. Metal Gear), causing this controller to \\"Auto-off\\" and become a pain in the rear by always having to re-sync.<br /><br />PLEASE do not purchase this product.  Trust me, you will be glad you didnt.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|My wife and I watched it tonight and I warned her about the mixed reviews this movie has gotten    That being said and considering the other various reviews I read, here goes:    I have zero desire to tell you what the movie is about.  It did not drag, it got right to it.  What we enjoyed the most about it was the fact we never really knew just what genes had been spliced together to create the creature.    Watching it fresh like this, we really never knew exactly what to expect and at times, we caught ourselves holding our breath, so much in fact, that I actually paused it a few times.    If you're married, have kids & love sci-fi horror genre, I bet you'll like this movie.  We both found it to be a better movie than Species in part because throughout the movie, you couldn't help but wonder at just WHAT? genes were used to create the creature.    and thanks to ALL those who wrote reviews previously. I told my wife before watching it, that the reviews were a complete mixed bag and that we might find it disturbing.....   For us, it's a great flick.

B002ZG98LO|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I asw this film.  The previous movies did not strike me all that well.  Even the original with Arnold was a \\"B\\" film and the sequel with Danny Glover was definitely a \\"B\\" film.  The original Aliens vs Preadators was not bad and I would have rated it a \\"B\\" for a decent \\"B\\" film but I never watched the sequel and again I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this film.  There was a nice review in the Boston Globe that compared this film to Jean Paul Sartre's play, \\"No Exit\\" as well as the famous short story, \\"Most Dangerous Game,\\" and really that is what this movie is most like, the famous short story, \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" a story in which a hunter is hunted on a deserted island by another hunter.  That's what this film is about in a nutshell:  Adrien Brody, the main character of this film, plays a former Delta Team, or Special Forces Member who has now become a mercenary.  He along with a few others have been captured and placed on a Predator hunting planet where he, and his companions are to be hunted to death.  All of the people selected along with Brody are hunters or killers, which makes this film like \\"No Exit,\\" an existential play by the French writer Jean Paul Sartre, who speculates that hell will be a self serve cafeteria, where people are placed in a place because of their behavior in which they turn in on each other, causing the main protagonist in that play to say, \\"Hell is other people.\\"  Here the hell is partly other people, but mainly the hell is from the Preadators who plan no less than to kill all the people dropped in there, including Adrien Brody's character, and the question is, \\"Does anyone survive?\\"  I will say 2 do, but who the 2 people are, I won't say.  If you like action, weapons, and the idea of killers defending themselves against more powerful killers, this is the movie for you.  It certainly was for me.
B00192IV9U|4.0|In October of last year, Michael Jackson's This Is It was released a few months after the King of Pop's death. It was controversial among some fans because it was speculated that body doubles were used and that Michael himself may have not intend fans to view the results of hours of film recording. It turned out to be an excellent film and many fans were happy to see it. Over a year later Sony releases a posthumous Michael Jackson album featuring previously unreleased material (even if some of these found their way to the internet sooner or were already known by some MJ experts) that has some fans doubting. Fans know just how much of a perfectionist Michael Jackson was and this being a posthumous release it is understandable that fans may hate what Sony is doing.  Maybe Michael would not have liked that Sony did this and maybe he never intended for the songs on \\"Michael\\" to be released to the buying public. Sony has an agreement that allows them to not only own and distribute Michael's music but also release new albums of previously unreleased content until 2017. You can bet that there will be more albums of unreleased content to come. Whether or not you approve of Sony's decision you have to give it to Sony though, \\"Michael\\" has some very good songs on it. There are those fans who say that it's not Michael singing on the album and those way say it is him. I'm in between; I think they're both right. Michael definitely sings on most of the songs here but there are some that while similar in voice that may not be him, I don't think I'm the most qualified person to make such a judgment and I'm not trying to ruin your enjoyment of the album with some proofs or anything.<br /><br />There are 10 songs on Michael, my guess is that Sony wants to keep material for future releases as well so they aren't putting as much song on \\"Michael\\" as they could have (which is fine really as long as the songs are good, sure more songs would've been better I suppose but I'm happy with what I've got). It's interesting that here are three collaborations on \\"Michael\\", the lead single Hold My Hand with Akon, Monster with 50 Cent (and Orianthi)  and (I can't make it) Another Day with Lenny Kravitz. It's interesting to hear the king accompanied by some of these artists and the overall sound of \\"Michael\\" is very pleasing. I'm not the biggest fan of Hold My Hand but the song has it all: it's catchy, easy to listen to and has a secure/positive feeling about it.  I like Hollywood Tonight, it was an unfinished song but they did a good song out of it and it has some of the classic Michael .The Way You Love Me was originally released on the 2004 Michael Jackson Ultimate Collection box set and I believe it sounded much better on the box set than it does here on \\"Michael\\". Best of Joy is a terrific one; this is one of the most enjoyable songs here. I don't like 50 Cents but Monster remains an excellent song! (I can't make it) Another Day featuring Lenny Kravitz and the Foo Fighter's Dave Grohl is one of my favorite songs of the whole album, Michael sounds amazing here and the song delivers. According to some internet bloggers and Amazon reviewers, there are three \\"fake\\" songs on \\"Michael\\" sang by Jason Malachi which would include Breaking News and Keep Your Head Up. I don't know how true this is, it might be it might not, buy the album and decide for yourself I guess right? If they're fakes then they just sound really close to Michael's voice.<br /><br />I don't think the King of Pop himself would have been totally pleased with this release because he didn't get to give his blessing and some of this was unfinished material but for fans this is a treat. It does have some good songs that fans will definitely want to hear. The album is worth buying, I don't think it tarnishes Michael's legacy and it's a good album but I wouldn't compare it to his past work. As far as I'm concerned his technically \\"last\\" album was 2001's Invincible, this would be best viewed as a goodcollection of unreleased material. There are fans that obviously won't be happy about this release and some who will not like the material here as much as Michael's classic works. For a collection of posthumous songs this is nice and fans who want to hear the songs should hear them but they probably shouldn't expect the material here to be as good as Michael's past albums. Like I said, skeptics can hate and make various speeches but in the end it's still Michael Jackson and my guess is a lot of people will buy it. To me \\"Michael\\" serves to make me remember how great he really was and how much he really is missed. For unreleased material, this is very good and satisfying: 4/5 stars.nreleased material.

B00192IV9U|3.0|The songs that are undoubtedly Michael singing have all the magic that we loved about him but there is no way in hell that half of this CD is him singing. Some songs are arrangements and productions styles that he would never have approved and whoever else is singing can sometimes sound close and other times, sound like bad MJ imitations with none of the characteristics of his voice. How stupid do they think we are? This CD will either be debated for years to come or outed as a fraud.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|The story follows a high school student named Olive who isn't the most popular girl in school but isn't really looking to be the talk of the school. When the weekend comes, her best friend invites her to go camping but Olive just wants to spend the weekend at home. Olive decides to lie to her friend and tells her that she has a date that weekend. At school on Monday, Olive's best friend pesters Olive about her imaginary date until Olive says that they had sex. Word gets around school and suddenly Olive is the talk of the high school. One of Olive's friends hears about the rumor which Olive confesses is not true. However, her friend does not care for he is being bullied about being gay and wants to prove to the school that he's not. So he and Olive attend a popular party where they secure and room and pretend to have sex so that entire party can hear. The next day at school the rumors about the boy's sexuality are cast aside while Olive becomes the main attraction. Olive continues to have fake sex with numerous boys in school so that it will help their reputation. Yet, the backlash causes Olive to become ostracized as she finds that though she believes she is helping these boys, she is not being true to herself.    First let me get out of the way my complaints with the film, which are few:  1. the plot is a bit contrived  2. the acting is not exceptional  3. the connection between the students reading The Scarlett Letter and Olive's being ostracized (to the point of wearing a scarlet A) is about a subtle as an anvil falling on one's head    But many tween movies are criticized for the same problems in script and acting, so I don't want to elaborate more on it here. Still, the good in this film completely outweighs the bad. These are a few of the things that I think separate this film from other asinine dopey chick flix:  1. this is NOT (thank god) a coming of age tale  2. there is little romance and some good comedy  3. it is not self righteous in its message    I think that the message of this film is very good and not something that you see everyday. Most teen films are about falling in love with the person you thought you hated (when does that ever really happen?) or being led astray by the glitter and false happiness of popularity. However, this movie is about how doing something that seems altruistic can actually come back to hurt you and others. It's about helping others while never losing your sense of self. And who doesn't like a couple chuckles while learning a solid life lesson? I certainly do!
B00192IV9U|5.0|To my mind, people who worked on the project, did their best to finalize those demo versions of Michael's songs they had and make them sound as close to what Michael would have wanted as possible. Vocals don't sound queer to me at all, it's definitely Michael's voice, in the most disputed \\"Breaking News\\" as well. Album has Michael's touch to it - his passion, energy and nerve. I'd like to point out such songs as \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Behind The Mask\\". With this album we have a chance to see what Michael did in the last few years, what music he created and wanted to share with the world.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Bought the CD for Christmas. This was before I heard Amazon was supporting a pedophile. No more purchases from Amazon by me.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Well, I know many are doubtful of this record, but I must say Michael Jackson is quite versatile. 2,000 Watts, anyone? I don't see why many find its authenticity dubious. I, for one, cannot wait to hear more unreleased tracks. These ten tracks will keep me a gleeful and content fan for now. Inside holds a nice CD booklet with notes written by Michael Jackson, himself. I am keen on the fact that these are his notes. The third note shows writing that states his goal for a 100 million records. I remember reading that he wanted to surpass the selling number of 'Thriller,' and he wanted adamantly to do this with 'Bad'. I find it simple and neat.      Frankly, I love every song. I do want to note that track 4, \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me,\\" was released on the Ultimate Collection, but I love this version more because its raw and Michael speaks and beat boxes at the beginning! I smiled at that :) \\"Much Too Soon\\" reminds me of \\"She's Out of My Life\\" because of the softness in his voice. His vocals in that particular song conveys a doleful feeling. His ability to transmit heartfelt emotions through his music is something I admire. Buy it, don't listen to the hype that this isn't Michael, it's him.
B00192IV9U|3.0|The Cascio tracks (#3, Keep Your Head Up, #5, Monster, and #7, Breaking News) are not sung by michael jackson.  This is simply the truth.<br /><br />EDIT: two years later. it's still fake. i'm never letting it go. they got jason malachi to sing on this cd, it's extremely obvious that it's not michael on the 3 cascio tracks.
B000007492|5.0|From the very first track \\"School\\" I got chills from the harmonica. This band was the audiophiles standard to test drive audio equipment. Especially the Crime Of The Century master. I hope they come back to the states for a tour some time. They did 37 dates in Europe this fall but nothing's on the radar for the U.S. Keep Yer Fingers Crossed
3822817015|5.0|I really love this book. It's filled with beautiful artistry of Gil Elvgren and I adore so many of them. I'm planning on blowing a few of them up and framing them. Awesome pictures :)
B00192IV9U|1.0|Although some of the tracks on \\"Michael\\", including \\"Hold My Hand\\", \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", \\"Best of Joy\\", and \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\", are vital, although somewhat unfinished, proof that Michael Jackson still 'had it' as a vocalist and as a songsmith, this album has been tainted irreparably by the inclusion of three clearly bogus tracks.     The fake tracks in question are:  - Keep Your Head Up  - Monster  - Breaking the News    Now, it might be that Jackson worked on tracks with these names, and that he recorded lyrics for them.     However, the voice on the final tracks is obviously not him.     This is a bewilderingly naive move from Sony and a slap in the face to the record-buying public. And it is a great shame, all the while the remaining tracks on this posthumous collection hold such a surprisingly high standard.
0307473473|5.0|Angelica Pennetta<br />Mr. Slater<br />English 9<br />10 December 2010<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo<br />  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was the type of book that took awhile to get into but in the end was worth the wait because of the \\"on edge\\" feeling you got throughout almost the whole book; I highly recommend that anyone who loves a good mystery reads this book.<br />  The plot was very intriguing; once you think you have it all figured out there is still the doubt that you are wrong and knowing this book you probably are. It seems as if every time you think Salander and Blomvist have the case solved, they find a new piece of evidence that puts a whole new twist on the story. The book starts out in detail about how Mikael Blomvist, a professional journalist, is being convicted for libel but then takes a sudden turn when he is asked by Henrik Vanger, a member of one of the wealthiest family's in Sweden, to help investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger. Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old rebellion who, let's just say, is a big fan of piercings, tattoos, and intense crime solving, eventually joins Blomvist in the search for Harriet. Step by step, as Salander and Blomvist continue their research they creep a little closer each day to finding out the truth about the Vanger family. As you get closer to the end, you'll find yourself getting ready to jump out of your skin; its one of those endings that slaps you right in the face. When it comes to the ending, you wont disappointed.<br />  The highly detailed characterization and conflict was what made this book such a fascinating thriller. When reading the description of Lisbeth Salander, not only does her striking appearance catch your attention but the way her personality is portrayed gives you the perfect imagery. It's not only the physical description of the characters that pulls you in, it's the way everything is played out and crafted so carefully. The conflict was the most important part of this book, in my opinion just because there was conflict after conflict that Salander and Blomvist then had to try and solve. This book is filled from beginning to end with a roller coaster of suspenseful conflict and thrill.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger searched for his niece for 40 years, when everyone gave up and he was all on his own, Blomvist and Salander were the only ones willing to help. By this act of generosity as portrayed in the book, I think the author was trying to make a point to the reader. The point trying to be made could have been anything from meaning do things happen for a reason to if you never give up you may be surprised at what you may find, either way it's a good read. Blomvist takes part in helping Salander find the real her, he helps her realize what she needs to do to be happy while at the same time trying to make everyone else happy.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book! It was definitely the type of book that was constantly grabbing you and pulling you in; it had me jumping from page to page just to see what was going to happen next. If you're into mind boggling mysteries that make you think, this the book for you! It never stops making you wonder. I would definitely recommend reading this book, but I have to warn you, once you get started you can't stop!<br /><br />Work Cited<br />Stieg, Larsson.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

B00192IV9U|4.0|It is hard to believe that it is nearly a year and a half since Michael Jackson lost his life in a blaze of tragedy. It isn't just that alone, he had so many hurdles of heartbreak in his life he was dealing with from his issues from debt and financial problems, to coming off a turbluent time from the child molestation trial back in 2003-2005, which sidelined him musically and personally to the very end of his world. Yet, his music had received a new lease on life, when people went crazy for his back catalog, and going through his classics from Thriller to his Jackson 5 albums, and even his lesser-recognized records like 2001's Invincible. His death opened the floodgates to a whole new generation of fans taking a deep glimpse at what made Michael Jackson the King Of Pop all this time. Sony also decided to get his music, with a $250 million deal for his estate. But, with new music that Michael had left behind, is it really worth its effort?<br /><br />Michael Jackson's Michael, the first in a series of projects from his estate, features 10 tracks from what Michael Jackson was brewing up, as he was set to make a comeback to the stage by what was his This Is It tour back in 2009. But honestly, are the tracks worth their while? Well, yes and no. Surprisingly, the ballads that were made from Michael's voice are actually good like the intimately somber Much Too Soon, to Hold My Hand which was the second single from the album with Akon, and the modern R&B rhythms of (I Like) The Way You Love Me. Surprisingly, there was some chemistry there on the tender ballads. But, when the album started to come alive with the world with Breaking News, people pondered on knowing if its really Michael's vocals. On that song if it was, it really didn't drive, neither did the dance drive on Hollywood Tonight or Monster with 50 Cent trying to reignite the 80's sound of Thriller & Bad. Most of the tracks related to how hurt Michael went through the ordeals of being accused of being things from accused of being a pedophile and \\"Wacko Jacko\\" all those years he was in the spotlight.<br /><br />All in all, while there are some moments that aren't driven to what made Michael Jackson the King Of Pop, or as being a human being all his life, Michael isn't a bad reflection of what Michael Jackson was brewing up in his music, after his absence from the spotlight. While it isn't going to please everyone from the hard core Michael Jackson moonwalkers, or those new to his music, it still is a decent showing of the first new songs from what was Michael's unfinished music. It is a fair step up to the lackluster drive from Invincible, but we'll see with more of Michael's music coming to light for his fans from the horizons.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Mastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: B-of being a pedophile and \\"Wacko Jacko\\" all those years he was in the spotlight.

B00192IV9U|5.0|I am so very sad that the Michael Jackson fans are so divided! Those who diss this album - are you real MJ fans? Do you really think MJ would have wanted you to boycott his album??? He COMPLAINED that Sony didn't market his Invincible album enough! I hear Michael singing in ALL the tracks.  If you can't hear him, you need to see an ear specialist!     I AM SO DISAPPOINTED AT PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES FANS AND THEY DISS THE ALBUM OF THE VERY PERSON THEY CLAIM TO LOVE!
B003BWQEU4|4.0|The cd said \\"70 aniversario\\", so I feared it might have a Spanish track.  Even though it was a gift for a grandson, I opened it and checked it out.  It was in English all right.  I had not seen it for sixty years, but it is as touching as ever.  Now that we have retired to Sarasota, FL, I was fascinated by the circus background which is so much part of the history here,  The station where the train leaves from is the former Sarasota station.  The Circus Museum at the Ringling Museum of Art has a miniature circus and lots of posters and costumes. Circus Sarasota is a one-ringed circus under a Big Top.  I was looking at the movie from a 4 year old's perspective and think that the story will be very powerful for him, but that the Parade of the Elephants sequence will go on too long.  His artist father will appreciate the graphics though.
B000002H6C|5.0|I love Metallica and I'd have to say this is probably my favorite album. I love the technical timing and picking. Great album and of course best enjoyed when blasted.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|I watched the pilot for this show and hated it; I did not like the main character and some of the campy-ness was lost on me. Later, I watched the season from start to finish with a friend; after seeing it in succession, I enjoyed it thoroughly. While the show is classified as drama, I figure it to be more of a dramedy; there were quite a few moments I could not help but laugh aloud at. The plot and storyline was even pace and believable, eventually I found characters that I liked. This show also gets better with repeated viewings, watching it the first time all I cared about was how some of the plots would be resolved. I purchased the season and after another watching found subtle plots and actions that help make the story more complete.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|I don't recall ever getting a bad DVD or BluRay disc but this one came in looking fine. However, when I put it into a Sharp BluRay player with the latest ROM upgrade, the disc spun up and errored causing it to eject. I tried it on a newer LG BluRay player and the same thing happened. It ejected itself from the machine. I sent it back to Amazon for a full credit. Thanks anyway Amazon.

B0016NF06O|1.0|The CD was unusable.   It skipped repeatedly and did not produce any quality of music that one could listen to.  I bought it as a used disc and took the risk. I will continue to shop Amazon for music. The risk is almost nil !!    Gabby
B00275EHJQ|3.0|I am not a fan of movie reviews since everyone has their own opinions and you can't really say something is \\"great\\" for everyone. That being said, being of fan of Toy Story 1 and 2, I purchased Toy Story 3 without having watched the film in the theaters (since they are usually overrun with children). I was disappointed in the movie and was not what I was expecting. The movie is a bit darker, and while that doesn't make it a bad film, it just seemed to not \\"fit\\" with the two previous films. Looks great on blu-ray, but didn't care for the story line.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Added to continue the set. Not as good as some of the earlier stories, much darker. Still, an enjoyable evening.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|It doesn't matter how new your BluRay player is. This movie uses every ounce of your BluRay players capabilities. You must upgrade your BluRay ROM to the latest version. Once you put the disk in the player, you will see nothing on the screen for a while. I think we were waiting for several minutes watching a blank screen until we finally saw the studio logo. Then you wait some more while the warning shows up. Finally after waiting and watching a blank screen, the main menu eventually will show. Don't expect everything to work right either. I tried to use the BDLive feature with a high speed memory flash drive in the slot of my player and couldn't get most things to play right without crashing the system. The movie looks and plays great though in the regular, extended and expanded versions. Sound it spectacular also. Most of the extras play correctly.
B000OBYLVO|1.0|I don't usually do reviews, but I couldn't let this sit with an average 4-star rating.  Especially since that 4-star rating - along with the cast - enticed me to watch it, thereby wasting 2 1/4 hours of my life.  Even what works best in this movie is completely formulaic and predictable.  What doesn't work - most glaringly - is the non sequitur sub-plot featuring an utterly unnecessary character who was made central for reasons only the creators could possibly fathom (perhaps to humor a producer?).  Largely because of this sub-plot - but also for an apparent phobia of editing in general, revealed in such worthless gems as Cameron Diaz's unfunny staring contest with a dog - the film is at least 45 minutes too long.  Though listed under comedies, the laughs are few, far between, and generally weak.  Best skip it.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story & Toy Story 2 came out when my kids were quite little. My son for 2 years talked of nothing but \\"buzz\\" and \\"woody\\". Anytime a jet when over - he'd point to the tendrils & shout \\"Buzz! Buzz!\\"  Needless to say, even though the kids are older, we still had to see Toy Story 3. And although they're \\"too old\\" now for this type of movie, they still loved it! Well done! So many series fall apart - it was nice to see this still maintained the quality and effort of the first two movies...
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I wasn't crazy about this album at first, but after listening to tracks in the car a few times I have come to appreciate it more.  If you are familiar with The Black Keys, you will probably like this album but not love it.  I admit they have some better material on other albums, but it's far better than most music being produced today!!!!!<br /><br />Give it a try!
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|What an outstanding value.  The '60s recording technology remasters exceedingly well.  The performances are stellar and we are reminded of how many composers who are now standard repertoire were originally championed by Mr. Bernstein.  The packaging is also unusually well done with striking photos of the maestro on the sleeves and a beautiful tribute book.
0307272702|4.0|\\"I went on a diet, swore off drinking and heavy eating, and in fourteen days I had lost exactly two weeks.\\"  Joe E. Lewis<br /><br />This is not a cynical review, really. Yet, Joe E. Lewis speaks for many of us.  I read Gary Taubes's \\"Why We Get Fat\\" with interest and initially I was convinced by his conclusions drawn from research and world-wide body type comparisons. Not to keep you in suspense; the answer to why we are fat is that we eat carbohydrates. Fat does not make you fat. Exercise does not make you thin. Fatty meats, or any meat or eggs, do not make you fat. It's the pasta, potatoes, and all other fiber-rich vegetables and fruits that make you fat.<br />[This book was written before news of the two-week all potato diet came out in which the man lost 20 pounds. Of, course no one can survive on eating only nutritionally incomplete potatoes.]<br /><br />Commonly accepted dietary thinking, shared by most nutritionists, can be summed up by Bonnie House, Dr. Diane Fleming, and other authors in \\"The 30-Day Diabetes Miracle Cookbook.\\"  They say, \\"We believe it's animal protein and fat that are the cause or major contributor to most, if not all, chronic diseases in the Western world, with obesity and diabetes at the top of that list.\\" If you have a reason to consult a dietary nutritionist you will hear this \\"fact.\\"<br /><br />Gary Taubes makes his not commonly accepted point in the opposite corner. He states that for too long this thinking has refused to look at all the research, especially older information, from the last century and then gives false advice. Taubes' well-written book claims it is NOT a diet book. That is until the last chapter in which the full-press commercial for the \\"The Atkin's Diet\\" reveals that the only way to lose fat is to not eat any carbohydrates and to eat the correct proportion of fat to protein. That would be: 75% to 25 % or 65% fat to 32% protein per meal. Or, if the book title were more honest it would read, \\"Why We Are Fat: We Are Not Following The Atkin's Diet.\\"<br /><br />At first The Atkin's Diet entices us by allowing all the steak, eggs, and other meats and to be sure to add enough fat to each meal and green leafy salads. That includes up to 4 tablespoons of heavy cream per day but no other milk.  I wonder, if The Atkin's Diet is so great-- and I am sure people lose weight short term on such a restricted diet-- just as the two-week, only potato diet did-- I wonder why people don't just stay on it for life? I have friends who have tried Atkin's, gone on and off it, but somehow they can't stick to it. They seek greater variety.<br />Gary Taubes says that after the desired weight is lost then you can gradually add carbohydrate foods until the body begins gaining again. So, he suggests trying one apple. If no weight is gained then perhaps a carrot, or some cottage cheese may be added. It may work. I was surprised to see that two authors, Dr. Andrew Weil and Michael Pollan, support this book with a recommendation in the front. I thought they have been telling us to reduce or eliminate animal foods. In any case, Gary Taubes certainly adds to the never ending discussion about what to eat and not eat that we who live in wealthy countries have the luxury to consider.<br />Now, no! Don't reach for that other donut, brownie, slice of toast or apple pie, carrot stick, orange, pickled beet, asparagus tip, sweet potato ....s Diet.\\"    At first The Atkin's Diet entices us by allowing all the steak, eggs, and other meats and to be sure to add enough fat to each meal and green leafy salads.

B003R0LBVW|5.0|One of the best books of the year. Franzen depicts his characters worts and all. If you awed by The Corrections, you'll enjoy Freedom. I think the reason some people might be disappointed by Freedom is they were expecting to be blown away again.  I wonder if you can be blown away by the brillance of an author more than once, or if you just expect greatness after the first time. If you want a book where there are good people and bad people rather than real people, this isn't for you; if you're looking for an honest examination of the complexity of middle class life, you'll struggle to find a better book.

B0048LPRCS|3.0|and I don't say that lightly. This is NOT a movie for everyone, but, knowing human nature to the tiny degree that I do, it is inevitable that after you little pervs read these reviews, you are going to rush out and buy your copy to show your friends how cool you are to have discovered such a perversely dark film. And they might be right. This movie+drugs can lead to psychosis or worse! Be warned, or as the late great Bela Lugosi said, \\"Beware....Take care....\\"
B000WS4P5G|5.0|Though grand assertions of personal malevolence are hardly rare in the metal world, few approach the declaration in a manner quite like Glenn Danzig does here. With his third major band's debut, Glenn's punk roots have disappeared almost entirely, replaced by a sparse, blues metal sound that places Danzig's remarkably forceful vocals front and center. Though the punk world is not known for producing first-rate vocalists, Danzig's marvelous work here places him on the list of the great hard rock/metal singers. Danzig's effort here rather reminds of a more gruff version of the other pseudonymous metal legend whose name begins with D, the sadly departed Ronnie James Dio. While the instrumental aspects of each band are very different, the singers share a similar appeal--both are extraordinarily expressive and fill the potentially ludicrous music with genuine passion. All the credit, however, does not belong to the vocals alone, and the sinisterly minimalist instrumental attack matches provides a fitting base for Danzig's theatrical musings.<br /><br />For many listeners, myself included, \\"Danzig\\" may not make that strong of an impact upon first listen. Few widely released albums have a more basic, demo-like production/sound: J. Christ's lone guitar has a plain, not terribly heavy distortion and the rhythm section is strictly utilitarian. Initially it all sounds a bit the same, but soon the vocal hooks ingratiate themselves and the instrumental subtleties are revealed, all while a uniform and quite effective atmosphere is maintained. Though everything here qualifies as a kind of atmospheric blues metal, Danzig and company ring a few twists from the formula, as in \\"Am I Demon,\\" which brings a slightly punkish energy to the album, the somewhat gothic \\"End of Time,\\" which predicts some of their later work, and \\"She Rides,\\" which has a kind of lithe sleaziness distinct from the other tracks. (\\"She Rides\\" is apparently a stripper favorite, which comes as no surprise.) The album as a whole, however, is dominated by midpaced, catchy rockers like \\"Twist of Cain,\\" \\"Mother,\\" and the Zeppelin-esque closer \\"Evil Thing,\\" all of which have a quality vocal hook and powerful main riff containing the best of Christ's back-to-basics style. The production also hides a few details that add immensely to the album, such as the barely audible backing/harmony vocals that pop up sporadically, the female choir that emerges in a few choruses and even a little bit of horn in \\"Soul on Fire.\\" (One of the best tracks, by the way.) The album does lose a little momentum as it progresses, with weakest tracks \\"Possession\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" coming in the second half, but it never truly bogs down and has no definite filler.<br /><br />It is, perhaps, best that there aren't too many other albums out there quite like \\"Danzig.\\" Even the rather similar \\"Danzig II\\" has a richer, somewhat more dynamic sound. But, as a one shot deal, the kind of hyper-minimalism displayed here is quite effective.

B000063DFS|5.0|To my ears Ozzy Osborne has made 3 classic metal albums in his long solo career.  His first two \\"Blizzard Of Oz\\" and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" in the early 80's secured his comeback from being kicked out of Black Sabbath.  His later 80's albums were hit and miss, but 1991's \\"No More Tears\\" would prove to be one of the best of his career.  Listening to this album again, most of it sounds really fresh 20 years later and not nearly as dated as some of it's peers.  The album opens with one of Ozzy creepiest characters in \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" that features some great guitar from Zack Wylde and just enough keyboards to keep it interesting.  The album spawned a bunch of tracks featured on rock radio at the time, all of them good, including \\"Mama I'm Coming Home\\", \\"No More Tears\\", and \\"Road To Nowhere\\".  Elsewhere tracks like \\"I Don't Want To Change The World\\", \\"Hellraiser\\" (A Motorhead cover) and \\"A.V.H.\\" help to round out the rest of the disc.  Some criticize the use of outside songwriters on this one (Lemmy from Motorhead Co-wrote 4 tracks), but Ozzy has always collaborated, so to me it is not that big a deal.  \\"Tears\\" is Ozzy's last truly great album in my opinion and still holds up really well today.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I am so glad \\"Hold My Hand\\" is released on Michael!  I had been looking for an officially released version for a long time!  It is one of the timeless songs that brings people together.  Love the uplifting tones in \\"Keep your Head Up\\" and \\"The Way You Love Me\\".  I especially like \\"The Way You Love Me\\".  The song reminds me of a bicycle rides in sunny afternoons.  I was surprised with the 70's sound of \\"Best of Joy\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\".  These two songs really grow on me as the more I listen to them the more I like them.  The \\"Best of Joy\\" sounds like sunshine in the meadow with gentle summer breeze blowing through my hair - pure joy!  Just like the title suggested!     If you are into fast beat dance tunes, \\"Monster\\", \\"Another Day\\", \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" and \\"Behind the Mask\\" will keep you dancing all night.  I just couldn't stop taping to the beats!        This album gave us a glimpse of Michael's genius, even if these songs were only demos.  It is dramatic, theatrical, energetic and full of love - everything we love about MJ!
0061433047|5.0|Having only recently just read the disappointing Unseen Academicals, i was uncertain what to expect with this book.  I should not have worried, as this book is much better in terms of plotting, humor and plain old storytelling.  The official review on this page states that Tiffany Aching's adventures are \\"concluded\\" with this title, and it does slightly feel that way.  I won't say why, but the hardcore fan will pick up the clues.    But you don't have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy this, you just have to like a good story, chock-full of good characters.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Band of Joy! What an appropriate title! Eclectic mix of uplifting and enjoyable songs, not a dud amongst them. Highly recommended.
B002IVLH60|4.0|I have had mixed feelings about Pearl Jam over the years.  I was never a huge fan of grunge, but Pearl Jam was one of the few grunge acts that appealed to me, and I still think \\"10\\" was one of the classic albums of it's time.  Over the years I have liked some Pearl Jam releases and not liked others.  After reading reviews from \\"Backspacer\\" and have heard a couple of tunes that I liked, I decided to pick it up.  I'm glad I did as I find this to be a solid hard rock album from the band.  \\"Backspacer\\" seems to be a bit more upbeat that many of the band's albums moving somewhat away from political and social commentary and as others have mentioned the album seems to have an element of fun to it.  All of the songs are short and concise.  Personally I think some of the tracks could have been fleshed out a bit more, but this is more a matter of personal taste than a critisism.  Overall \\"Backspacer\\" is a solid album from a band that has outlived most of  it's peers.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I found two pairs of these at the local Walmart for about seven dollars. I haven't gotten these at the time of writing but I figured I'd make a review.<br /><br />I own both an Xbox360 and a PS3, and one of the worst aspects about the PS3 controller are the slippery analog triggers. It's not a huge deal but it really gets annoying when you're in the zone and your hands get sweaty, then at that last moment, your finger slips off the trigger and something terrible happens. I've had that happen to me numerous times during a race.<br /><br />The triggers give that nice, secure feel, with your fingers locked in by the trigger design. It's not flimsy at all; once they're attached, they don't wobble or shake. It's like the controller was made that way. Whenever I want to take them off for whatever reason (since the position of the triggers is very close to the shoulder buttons and it's rather easy to bump the triggers), the attachments come off cleanly and easily. No breaking or hoping it won't break. Just pop them off and back on. Easy as pie.<br /><br />This is a great buy, although expensive for a piece of plastic. I could use that same argument with expensive sunglasses too... (I own Oakleys.)<br /><br />It's cheap and if you don't like them, it's not like you lost 20 dollars. Give it to a friend.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|There aren't very many modern bands that I really like--especially not enough to purchase all of their CDs--but I must admit, I am somewhat addicted to the unique voice of Adam Levine, lead singer of Maroon 5.  When I heard the first release from this new album, \\"Misery,\\" I thought it was kind of catchy, but I had no plans to buy the CD.  However, the song grew on me, and it wasn't long before I found myself placing an Amazon order.<br /><br />HANDS ALL OVER definitely IS a catchy CD.  \\"Misery\\" opens the album, but the three tracks which follow, \\"Give a Little More,\\" \\"Stutter,\\" and \\"Don't Know Nothing,\\" all have a very similar, pop-like feel.  This is fine; they are decent enough tunes.  But they lack lack the soulfulness of ballad like \\"She Will Be Loved\\" or the edginess of \\"Harder to Breathe\\" (both tracks from the band's first album, [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]].  Even their second album, [[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]], retained a bit more of a rough sound (e.g., \\"Wake Up Call\\") interspersed with ballads such as \\"Goodnight Goodnight\\" and \\"Better That We Break.\\"<br /><br />And that's the main problem I have with HANDS ALL OVER--the lack of variety.  Every song seems like another pure pop tune; the one track coming closest to a ballad is probably \\"Just a Feeling,\\" which is still fairly up-tempo.  Similarly, there are no singles that really stand out from the crowd, either, although the title track, \\"Hands All Over,\\" does have a bit of a funkier sound.  Also, the duet with Lady Antebellum, \\"Out of Goodbyes,\\" is well-done, but nothing remarkable.  Same goes for the bonus acoustic tracks--certainly nice enough, but they don't really make a huge impact.  I do kind of like the final (non-bonus) track, \\"Curtain Call\\"; there's nothing really special about this song either, but it does highlight Levine's vocals, which is probably why I enjoy it.<br /><br />In the end, I am happy with this album purchase, although I don't see any of the songs here becoming my new favorites.  Recommended if you are already a fan of Maroon 5; if not, go out and get yourself [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]] first.ecoming my new favorites.

B003RNXIBK|1.0|Unlike Eminem's first two albums, no songs on this CD stand out and it annoys me he felt the need to do a duet on pretty much every other track. They didn't hit hard, they weren't as angry as I hoped. I am a person who actually loved Relapsed but I hated this CD. REALLY hated it. I felt let down by Eminem.
0439023491|5.0|One of the few sequels that actually matched the pace and intensity of the first. A must read. If you are buying this for a child or youth, be sure to read it first. It is a VERY violent book and you may not want your cHild reading it. Very adult subject matter. It's the new thing to make ypub adult books with very mature subject matter. All that being said I plan to read the whole trilogy again. It was a very easy and quick read. Read it on a train from new York to DC.

B00192IV9U|1.0|i can't believe Phony Sony records would dare put this mess out? bad enough that 3 of the songs don't even sound like the King of Music and the sadder part is that these songs at best are sloppy 2nd and 3rd tracks that ain't worthy as b sides. not a money cut in the mix.  most of these album sounds rouch patches from Michael Jackson's dangeorus through History era and not the good stuff.<br /><br />the album feels like a patch work and patchy that it ain't even funny. i agree with Black Eyed Peas front man and leader Will I Am this Album should have never seen the release of day. it is a insult to MJ and he would have never put this out. Sony has already made back it's money and they are gonna cash in on the back catelog and Dvd's etc..... it is ins't like they aren't gonna milk MJ's back catelog for another decade and keep profiting off the gift that keeps on given which is MJ.<br /><br />the sad part is that this manipulation is gonna keep happening for years to come.<br /><br />which shows and tells me there isn't much left.<br /><br />i'll stick to the classics and act like this mess doesn't exsist.<br /><br />Michael Jackson was truly a one of a kind Musical Genius, however this album is so bad i hope nobody uses this album to understand his greatness. this album is so bad it ain't even funny.
1563899426|2.0|I have no idea other than the \\"bandwagon\\" effect as to why this book is at all popular.   The concept is phenomenal. Fairy tale characters forced to live menial lives in our world because of some eluded-to threat in their homeworld. This lends to some amazing possibilities of true human emotion, conflicts of culture and down-the-road mysticism with a return to home.      This does not happen.  Instead, they fill the pages with half-developed characters, bad dialogue and painfully transparent \\"mysteries\\" that all but tell you who-dun-it 10 pages in.      Maybe this series developes into something 3 books in (i bought the first two and could barely get through the lame Animal Farm parody in Book 2), but i personally think a comic should grab you in the first installment, not 400 pages later.      Skip it.  Buy the Walking Dead or Preacher or darn near anything by Mark Millar.

030746363X|5.0|I'm taring through 4HB.  This book is straightforward, easy to read, informational, and fun. It's like someone sharing with you secrets to doing things that you didn't think were possible. I've been a fan of Tim Ferriss for many years, follow his blog, and have given his first book, the 4-Hour Workweek as gift over five times.    The 4-Hour Body is a must read for anyone looking to make a dramatic change for the better or who's curious about what would happen if someone were to do all sorts of science experiments on themselves.    What adds to Tim Ferriss' credibility is that he cites his sources and makes them easily accessible.    Great job Tim!  I hope you'll continue to write more masterpieces.

B0031N2NFS|2.0|tis the season for trying new things.      Look forward to my new mojo top 50  issue.  This was #8 and Midlake also played a big role in the #1 record by John Grant   i really wanted to like both these records  i liked Midlake last disc and i like the basic concept...reworking old ideas(f.mac,etc) in new ways.   The sound on both records is great, they are gifted musicians.    But the songs just do not cut it.   There is nothing going on...  they need a good producer to smack them upside the head and force them to come up with the goods.   Concepts and mood is not enough.  You have to have great songs.   Ultimately both records are background music(John Grant's backstory is interesting, yes, but it does not excuse embarrassing lyrics)  Maybe this the point...maybe the folks at Mojo have so much going on that they like the calm these discs provide.   if you need something more avoid
B002ZG97EC|4.0|This is the kind of kid's movie that adults will love too.  Plenty of slapstick and potty humor for the kids, and lots of jokes that will go right over their heads for the adults.  I took my 5 year old nephew to see this.  He's easily frightened, so I was a little worried.  (I had just taken him to Toy Story 3, where he had a meltdown when he thought the toys were going to be melted in the incinerator, and I mean hysterical crying, covering his eyes, and crawling on my lap.  Which also happened at the end of that movie when the boy gave all his toys away.  And my sister-in-law told me that for weeks afterward he had nightmares about growing up and losing all his toys.  I'm surprised they let me take him to the movies again at all!)  But I was pleasantly surprised.  A few tense moments, but nothing really scary.  The scene that upset him the most is when the guy didn't show up for the girl's recital.  (Did I mention that he's sensitive?)  I also appreciated the length of the movie.  There is only so long kids can sit still.  I don't know why they make any kid's movies longer than 90 minutes.<br /><br />Basically, my 5 year old nephew loved it, and his 35 year old aunt loved it as well.  Doesn't get much better than that.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I doubt if Katy's main objective with this release is to stimulate our cerebral muscles but she might want to stimulate you in other ways. She's very naughty here (a shout out to new hubby Russell Brand perhaps?), veering into territory more frequently inhabited by the likes of Ke$ha, Britney, Rihanna and Shakira with such trashy anthems as \\"Teenage Dream\\", \\"Peacock\\" (hey, Toni Basil!), and another of my particular favorites \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" in which the narrator drinks too much, breaks some laws, has a three-way and indulges in other hedonistic activities. I make no apologies- this song makes me feel young again.<br /><br />Other highlights include the divine bubblegum dance pop hit \\"California Gurls\\" in which Snoop Dogg's little bits are a welcome addition. \\"Firework\\" really surprised me. I first heard it on the radio and thought it sounded like Katy but at the same time there was something different about it. Probably my favorite song on a very consistent album, the music is all joyous strings with Katy belting out this beautiful anthem of empowerment like it's the last song she'll ever sing. I love the way she goes right from the sublime to the ridiculous in the following \\"Peacock\\", a funky and hilarious ode to a man's `architecture' and back again to the heartache of \\"Circle The Drain\\", a song about drug addiction. I can't help but wonder how much of this CD's material is based on reality and how much is fiction which adds to its allure for me. \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" is my final favorite, a kind of sister song to \\"Teenage Dream\\". This record is fun, humorous and at times even touching. It even smells good! Like the sweets adorning our Ms. Perry in the album artwork, this is a pure confection of guilty pleasure.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|this was a very good and origional movie. I truly enjoyed it and would recomend it to those that are in search of something that is not advertised on myspace or facebook. the average movie watcher will probably not like this movie because it is off the beatten path, but those in search of something more should check this out.
B00361HV02|4.0|It is sometimes hard to figure how a band that has made 5 great records is still grinding it out after 10+ years. BRMC returns to its core sound on BTDT. While a bit longer than it probably could have been, the band delivers more melodic molten lava here with new drummer Leah Shapiro.  With 13 tracks clocking in at 65 minutes, some pruning might have helped keep it more focused (see Interpol). The title track and album opener stirs memories of Howl (as does Sweet Feeling). The core of the album are the straight ahead tunes with the killer choruses, Conscience Killer, Bad Blood, Evol and Mama taught me better. Much here to like and another great record from BRMC. Enjoy.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|This device works great with an old logitech optical mouse I have, not as well with the newer logitech laser mouse with more buttons. A bit of a pain to set it up, but once you are done it works wonderfully, just plug it in. My kill/death Ratio is moving up fast, I win about half the free for all games I play online in MW2, never did that well before. I still have to do the firmware update, which will supposedly give me more than the plain 3 buttons on the mouse, and I had tried a while back without success. So far with the three buttons I am really enjoying this piece of hardware.
0439023513|5.0|This is one of my favorite YA series to date.  It's filled with adventure, drama, and romance.  There's something for everyone in this series.  After reading the first two books, I eagerly awaited the third book's release.  Knowing this was to be the conclusion of the trilogy, I was a bit nervous about the direction Suzanne Collins would take.  So often, authors are tempted to wrap up the package into a neat little bow, with little regard for realism and how it would fit together with the rest of the series.  I am pleased to say that this author did not succumb to temptation.  She finished the series the way it began, strongly.  This book shows a tremendous amount of professional growth, and I believe some of the flaws from the first book (namely, slow pacing) are resolved in this installment.      I love a happy ending, but in a series such as this, I expect that ending to come at a price.  This book does not disappoint.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This album is a masterpiece! It is simply amazing.  I have all his albums, and usually there are one or two tracks I don't care for but on this one I love every track.  The uptempo tracks are infectious and make you want to dance, the ballads are beautiful, the uplifting Keep you head up reminds you of Keep the Faith or his best inspirational songs, but a notch better.  This is a remarkable accomplishment, it has exceeded my expectations.  Michael produced, wrote, composed and worked very hard on all these songs, unfortunately they were not completely finished before he left us, but thanks to Teddy Riley and  many talented producers they have been able to complete them and polish them in a remarkable way.  I think Michael would be proud.  I really would recommend this to any music lover. I guarantee you will enjoy it!  Thank you Michael for your gift to the world. We miss you!

0439023491|3.0|This is the second book in the trilogy and as such, it appears to suffer from middle-book syndrome, meaning there is too much summary and not enough new material to actually qualify this as a stand-alone novel.  I realize most people will read this book only after reading The Hunger Games, but if you are going to publish 3 separate books, each one should be able to be autonomous.  Catching Fire, however, suffers from an identity crisis.  Is it merely a segue from book 1 to book 3?  Is it meant to be a summary of book 1 and a teaser for book 3?  That is unclear, at least for the first third of the book.  Although it finally becomes interesting and resumes a decent pace, the first part of the book is unforgivable in its lack of interest.  Fans of the series, however, will want to continue reading to find out what happens next for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.

B003HGKJ3M|5.0|they will always be known as a one hit wonder band, but \\"hunting high and low\\" is a really great album from start to finish.  it is a worthy \\"time capsule\\" of early 80s and early mtv music.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|The characters and wonderful artwork/animation makes this a complete masterpiece and perfect for the whole family. As far as a fictional character with magical hair goes, Rapunzel is made into a very believable and lovable character. It is bright, colorful and action-filled enough that my 2 and 3 year old sat through the whole thing without a peep but is also a favorite of mine and my husbands. There was a lot of laughing throughout from both of us.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This album is everything I've been waiting for and more. I really love it. It's fresh, has lots of great dance songs and a few of those lovely uplifting songs that only Michael could do. His voice sounds great - not hidden by the beat, but right on top of it. Every song is good. The producers did a great job on this and as they said they had a blue print from Michael. This album will get you dancing.    Hollywood Tonight - Great dance song and based on a true story according to a note written by Michael in the liner notes.  Keep Your Head Up - this is my favorite. He takes a personal story and applies it to the global experience of humanity.  Monster - HOT, HOT song. This one might take off as a hit single. 50 Cent adds excitement to it and Michael is on top of his game.  Breaking News - Despite all the controversy, this is a good dance song and it gets in your head. I find myself humming it \\"no matter what\\"  Best of Joy - a gem of a song with a retro feel but it still feels fresh. Apparently this is one of his most recent recorded songs and it's lovely. Sweet as can be and his voice is beautiful on it.  Behind the Mask - another great dance song and a great interpretation by Michael.    The King lives on. Thank you Michael for all of the beautiful music you gave us.

B003UERZ88|5.0|Halford brings out his incredible melodic voice with Made Of Metal!  These are some of the best songs of his solo career.  Halford has used his solo work to dig deeper into the heavier, more machine-gun style of heavy metal, but Made of Metal is a return to his killer melodies of the golden age of Judas Priest.  Less Painkiller/Freewheel Burning, more (Take These) Chains/A Touch of Evil.  If you've missed the more melodic side of Halford, you will love this CD!    I am a die-hard fan of classic metal and this is the best effort by any of those bands in ages.  By far the best metal album of 2010!  Better than Ozzy's, better than Iron Maiden's, better than Kiss's, better than anybody's.
1591795230|2.0|I ordered The Biology of Belief based on the reviews I had read, but I ordered the book on C.D. since I have a 45 minute drive each way to work and quite frequently listen to books on C.D. I found the author very difficult to listen to since he quite often pauses in mid sentence, starts to say one word and then changes to another, and repeats the same phrases so often then it gets really annoying. I don't really need to hear \\"This is really interesting because of this,\\" 100 times. The content of the C.D. is somewhat interesting although the author gives certain names to biologocal functions to steer the conversation his way, like calling the bodies response to outside stimulae \\"perception.\\" There is also a lot of re-stating the same thing over and over again without presenting any new idea. After listening to the C.D. I read that the C.D is \\"an original adaptation\\" of the book. I would have preferred a professional reading the actual book.
0553573411|4.0|At the outset of THE FARSEER trilogy, a reader might be forgiven for believing that author Robin Hobb was creating a medieval historical fiction novel. ASSASSIN'S APPRENTICE, the opening entry in the FARSEER Trilogy, is the clever and entirely convincing story of a dysfunctional royal family, in-fighting over their entitlements and the lineage to the throne, squabbling over every political nit and nat, secretly lining up their supporters and implementing one Machiavellian scheme after another to support their self-centered aims.<br /><br />Bound by oath as a \\"King's Man\\" to King Shrewd, ASSASSIN'S APPRENTICE concludes with Fitz having completed his first assignment as an assassin. But he now languishes far from his homeland, the Six Duchies, sick at heart over the role he has assumed and recovering from the poisoning he received at the hands of the ruthlessly ambitious Prince Regal who would usurp the position of King-in-waiting from his brother, Prince Verity. Fighting back his lethargy, struggling with seizures caused by the residual effects of the poison and recalling his loyalty and pledge to the throne, Fitz returns to the Six Duchies to battle the encroaching Forged Ones, to protect the interests of the absent Prince Verity and to further his unrequited love for Molly, a childhood friend now in service as a lady's maid to Verity's wife, the Queen-in-waiting. Fitz's very survival, in the face of political threats which unfold at breathtaking speed, demand an ever increasing dependence on his use of the forbidden bonding skill, the Wit, and his ability to communicate with a wolf he rescued in the wilderness.<br /><br />ROYAL ASSASSIN is a magnificent blend of themes of salvation, sacrifice, love, unwitting and ofttimes  unwilling bravery and heroism, venality, evil, duty and honour accompanied by a first rate epic plot; just the slightest hints of magic and wizardry; the nonsensical, foggy wisdom of a jester in the finest traditions of the ramblings of imperial court fools, and the development of Fitz's character as a well-intentioned and driven but often weak human overcome by his near addiction to the wonders of the Wit and his joining to the personality of a free-running wolf.<br /><br />Readers and reviewers comment on the failings of the second book of trilogies so often that one almost comes to expect it. But, make no mistake, there are no such shortcoming in ROYAL ASSASSIN! Fitz's increasing dependence on the Wit, his increasing ability with the far-reaching communication of Skilling, a finely tuned and quick-paced plot and a breathtaking cliffhanger ending all make ROYAL ASSASSIN a wonderful continuation of ASSASSIN'S APPRENTICE and a suitable set up for the climax of the final book of the trilogy, ASSASSIN'S QUEST. Did I say I was looking forward to that with bated breath?<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissd the development of Fitz's character as a well-intentioned and driven but often weak human overcome by his near addiction to the wonders of the Wit and his joining to the personality of a free-running wolf.

B0043VDIAG|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again with another great reading.  He never fails to offer a good read for those of us who enjoy your writing.  When will the next one be available?
0385737947|4.0|So, this is apparently the first in a series of books aimed at the teen / young-adult audience. As such, it feel somewhat incomplete since we don't ever find out the ultimate question of what the final purpose is to the tests in the maze.<br /><br />So, the basic premise is that a number of young adults have been placed in a strange \\"world\\" composed largely of a maze and a reasonably safe area. Occasionally new young adults arrive. Nobody know much of who they are or why they've been sent there. They've created their own small society with various roles and are trying to survive the maze and its dangers (a few mechanical and bio-mechanical creations with blades, or spikes and often bad attitudes) while trying to intuit its purpose and moreover their own purpose in being there. There's perhaps some analogy to the Lord of the Flies that could be drawn. A group of young adults left to fend for themselves in a deserted place, exposed to the elements and dangers of a slightly \\"other worldly\\" realm that means them harm.<br /><br />While we learn some very minor details about the maze and its overall purpose, the book leaves us hanging as to what comes next after the kids escape and find they're being tested and prepared for some bigger task.<br /><br />For me, it was overall pretty okay. The \\"world\\" of the maze is slowly revealed through characters' interactions with it and a little exposition. The characters seemed fairly engaging. This portion of the story seems pretty well encapsulated in the pages of the book and leaves the remaining books open to embrace and extend the book's \\"world.\\"<br /><br />I guess I was just hoping for something a bit more... Something more profound, perhaps? Maybe later in the series...
0446567337|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, and this novel really got to me. I watched the movie first, and though it has a different outcome than the book does, I still enjoyed both. I had a hard time putting this one down. It deals with some emotional issues, so I wouldn't suggest for a light beach read. However, if you want something more meaningful yet still romantic I say get it!
0465011047|5.0|This book deals with a very hard subject and a issue where first hand accounts are very limited. Holding a degree in Korean studies this book fits very well with brief explination about life in the N. Korean camps.  It is easy to take some of the grammar mistakes here a little to hard but while doing so it is important to remember that the book was writen in Korean and translated to Engliss.  In my opinion we are much better for it despite its few mistakes and odd sentance structures.    I was a little surpised to find less grizzly details in this book than say \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", whos author's quote is on the front cover.  It still does not take anything away from the terrible things that were experianced by the author.  If anything I believe that he shows some class by not over loading the book with the grim and dark details,  it is after all through the eyes of a nine year old boy.      Very impressive to me was the honesty that the author has many many times in telling the good with the bad. I felt that I wasn't reading a revenge tail aimed and venting his anger for the injustice done.  Some passages do pull at the heart and even though the reading is easy the material is very heavy.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|In a nutshell, Glee is a brilliant, dark comedic musical set in a High School in Ohio. During it's first season, and especially the first 13 episodes, the show really struck a nice balance of humor, drama, music, and romance and really had something for every age to enjoy. (Thought I would recommend this for ages 12 upwards as the show can occasionally get slightly risqu&eacute;).<br /><br />The humor is of the intelligent, dark variety like you might get from a show like Arrested Development. The drama and romance is sprinkled throughout and is fairly straight forward fair that largely revolves around the Glee instructor and a counselor in the school or Rachel and Finn, the two lead high school students.<br /><br />The music, for the most part, is very well chosen and very diverse. You get everything from pop to hip-hop to Broadway classics and it all works very well for the show. While most everyone on the show is a triple threat (Act/Dance/Sing), Lea Michelle is a rare and almost unique talent and is guaranteed to blow you away when she gets to sing.<br /><br />All in all you don't get too many chances to watch creative, intelligently written shows like Glee and while the last 9 episodes weren't quite on par with the first 13, the First season as a whole ends up being a very strong freshman season. Highly recommended to all.

0380713802|5.0|Once again Bill Bryson delivers. Despite much of his sometimes cynical humour - and some of it made me laugh loudly - one gets the impression through-out of a warm-hearted person making his solo journey in Europe. Bryson's enjoyment is contagious.
0385523912|5.0|there's a photo going round the internet taken from the space station that shows a night photo of a lit up Asia other than a big dark area that's North Korea and there was story about a year ago mentioning that North Koreans are now two inches shorter then their cousins in South Korea due to malnutrition. If you have any curiosity about the almost daily negative stories about North Korea, then this very excellent book deserves a read.     Being a huge soccer fan, I watched North Korea's World Cup games last summer with curiosity but really took notice after the British play by play announcer mentioned that the 300 spectators from N Korea were actually Chinese actors given an all expense paid trip to South Africa because they couldn't trust their own people to return home. Makes you wonder what's really going on. This book gives a lot of insight on what passes for life for the average family. Hopefully, one of these days we'll find out just how much China manipulates the day to day events of the Korean peninsula.

0307454541|4.0|The book was titled \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" when it originally came out in Sweden.  It was changed to the tattoo title when it was published in English.  I will admit it took a while for the book to get going but then I don't understand Swedan financial situations nor the kronor (sweden currency) which dominated the first 60 pages or so of the pb edition.  I didn't, however, have a closed mind about it and kept reading.  I'm glad I did.  The book was enjoyable.  I figured out some of the mystery before the end but it was an entertaining novel. It's not in the mold of the Silence of the Lambs and I still wonder if people who say that really read Silence Of The Lambs. I'm pretty sure the hype doesn't equal the story but if you enjoy a mystery you will probably enjoy this book.
1400079144|2.0|The general writing style of this book is average, but that's really where the positives stop.  Much of the author's research is slightly off, from etymology to technology, both in substance and chronology.  In the book the author says that using Google isn't really research, but it seems like he just Googled everything for this book, and not very well at that.  The characters are poorly written, with most of them being overly dense and unaware, and his main character, Robert Langdon, is equally dense in some areas, sanctimonious in others.  The characters come across as unrealistic, unenjoyable, and unlikable.  I'm sorry I bought this book new instead of used, as this is one that certainly didn't deserve my money, or the time spent reading it.  If you haven't bought this book yet, save yourself some money and buy something else.
030746363X|3.0|Pro: It has a lot of great information for people who are new to dieting and exercise.           Easy to read. The split into different chapters you can read without having to read the whole book was a smart choice.          Simple programs.    Con: All the information isn't exactly new or just in this book. For example, the diet is Paleo, which is fine, but not what I expected from the ads. I really hoped for something new here, and what is new sounds dubious at best.              Some of the claims in the books description are a little exaggerated.               The work out is not the best. It's great if you are new to working out, but it's not enough for someone who is already athletic and looking to improve. If you want to be the best athlete you can, this will take you far but it will not get you there.              Reversing permanent injuries can be expensive.     I have a problem with his scientific method. He did a lot of these experiments only on himself, and one after another in a short period of time. His results might be skewed.  I'm currently applying a few of his suggestions and have been for 2 weeks. I will update this review in the future if there is any radicle change, but as of now nothing has really happened.                 I also do not like that this book has gotten so many perfect reviews so quickly, and that critical reviews are being removed.    All in all, the book is grand if you need to be introduced to the word of nutrition and exercise. But if you have read widely on the subjects already and looking for something different and radically new, this book doesn't really deliver.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Hey everyone! Before I explain why you should buy the complete version on Blu ray, i need to tell you about the non complete version on dvd. So this review is mostly about comparing the complete and non complete versions. I purchased the 2-Disc Special Edition version of this movie quite some time ago, which i was a little disappointed in. In short, it was not complete. On a serious look over, the non complete version has some slightly bad acting, and moments where the dialog seems disconnected or off. On top of that was the fact that its VERY hard to understand whats going on, EVEN when you had finished the entire final fantasy 7 game. However, redemption came in the form of Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children Complete on BLU RAY. This movie is a MUST HAVE for ANY FF7 fan, period. Final Fantasy 7 is arguably the best RPG ever made, and as such, it received what it deserved. a sequel in the form of a movie to tie up loose ends while still providing an amazing addition to its story. I can't explain how amazing this movie is over the non complete version but i can offer some details.<br /><br />First, the movie is correct, this version is complete. There are no issues with dialog, or the voice acting where its off or disconnected. Secondly, they added MORE scenes that help explain a ton more, and even ADD to certain characters, character. The Blu ray is SHARP and it is visually stunning. Most important off all is the fact that the complete version is no where NEAR as complicated to understand whats going on. It moves from beginning to end and you are left with the feeling that the movie kept you entertained, as well as held you with an understanding of its story. The non complete movie has a very difficult time.<br /><br />In summary, if you LOVE FF7, and you are a huge Cloud fan, YOU MUST BUY THIS MOVIE. I would strongly recommend if you have NOT gone blu ray yet, you hurry up and make the jump as soon as possible. When and if you do, you must make this one of the first blu rays you DO buy. As i have to give it 5 out of 5 if you think ff7 is not the best rpg of all time, and a MUST BUY DANGIT! if you think ff7 was the best rpg ever.DO buy. As i have to give it 5 out of 5 if you think ff7 is not the best rpg of all time, and a MUST BUY DANGIT! if you think ff7 was the best rpg ever.
B003KUSUSQ|5.0|Not very into the rap scene however,after reading an article about the rehabbed \\"Slim Shady\\"  I thought I would give it a look see and to my surprise he's got some hits on his hands.The white trash song turns out to be my favourite because, I have relatives who fit that song exactly. Thank God I don't have to see them very often as they live out of state.
B0041KOVNM|5.0|I bought this album based upon some reviews (Decibel, and other reviews I found online) as well as the samples here on Amazon, and some of the videos posted on You Tube.  It sounded different, and I was interested in something... different, and I have not been disappointed.  This album is very unique.  From my perspective, it's best described as a meld of early Mercyful Fate, Voivod, and '70s rawk, all adorned with pipe organs, some odd synth/organs here and there, and the occasional guitar drone; however, upon my first listen, what really struck me, and not in an entirely good way, was the crisp, clear vocal delivery.  As someone who's generally more into harsh, abrasive vocals, Ghost's clean, clear vocals really caught me off guard, and I wasn't sure if this was going to be up my alley.  At times the vocals teeter on the verge of King Diamond (ala Mercyful Fate), but not as shrill (and I like the lyrics, unlike King Diamond's, which I feel focus too much on furthering a story, and not so much on making a good song and are, as a result, embarrassing at times); at other times, the vocals are reminiscent of Snake of Voivod (ala Nothingface).  After a few listens, I was really digging the vocals, as well as the album, as a whole.  Lyrically, the subjects deal exclusively with evil, worshiping and praising Satan.  Again, very different, subject-wise for vocals delivered in such a clear and open manner, but it's all very well done.  Musically, the songs blend great rock riffs, delivered on guitars/amps/effects more reminiscent of '70s rock than metal, incredibly groovy bass tones, and as I had previously mentioned, some very cool, and very appropriate organ/synth work.  It's an unusual blend, for sure.  Perhaps a little too \\"nice\\" sounding for many who typically get into dark, evil music (generally, like myself), so if you're heavily into more extreme Black Metal (like me) or Death Metal, or Grind, etc., you may want to give this a serious preview before buying.  But I'm into very abrasive music of all kinds, and I really like this album.  I would rank it among my top purchases this year (of which I have made many... purchases, that is).  If you like Mercyful Fate, you may very well enjoy this as well.  If you like Voivod, and are willing to swap the sci-fi themes with those of hammer horror and praises sung to Satan, then you will probably enjoy this.  I'm loving it.  It's a great record with great songs, and it adds a different dimension to my daily soundtrack (of course, there have been many days, where this album IS my ENTIRE daily soundtrack, just because I love it so dearly).  I don't write reviews too often, but this is one album that I felt needed to be reviewed ASAP.  If you're reading this review, and it sounds even a little bit interesting to you, you should definitely give it a try.

B003INBNXO|5.0|My brother-in-law is a huge wing chun fan, and absolutely loves this film. It is very well made, and Donnie Yen is a great actor. The action didn't seem outlandish, and there was actually a plot. I love this movie!
B002W19I8U|3.0|I love the music from the USA release of the Neverending Story, particularly the Ivory Tower and Bastian's Happy Flight.  The music in the movie was uplifting and exciting.  Sadly, the music as translated to the official soundtrack release is not quite what you would expect.  Tracks 2 through 5, all the Giorgio Moroder tracks, were messed around with in the studio and have had cheesy synth \\"drumbeat\\" added to them.  The beat completely ruins the enchanting harmony of Ivory Tower and the other 4 tracks don't fare much better.  Fortunately the opening theme song and the Klaus Doldinger tracks are intact just as you remember them from the film.  I've been waiting for a re-release of this soundtrack with the Moroder tracks corrected for decades and at this point it will probably never happen short of a score-only audio track on a future Blu Ray disc.  Until that time, this soundtrack is what you'll have to live with.

B00004RFFS|2.0|I lasted for about 1/2 hour and gave up despite the good acting - this was arguably the best act i've seen Cruise deliver, ever (hmmm...food for thought). The sentimentality, the pathos, the Weltschmerz, the decadent male-on-male vibe are so kitchy, cliche-y and predictable that i was about to gag. Seriously - what about Rice makes people so impressed? She may be a bit more mature than the cute and vapid Stephanie Meyers but still - aren't we talking Much Ado about Nothing here? Isn't vamp gothery simply an inability to relate and communicate with fellow members of the species, an art form designed for teenagers in sexual overdrive without the erotic know-how?<br /><br />Yeah, i guess this is it - a whiff of danger (ooooh - lookit, blood), a simulacrum of eros, a dollop of sentimentality and socially acceptable queerdom and we get the 21st century hipster swooning like a 19th century matron enthralled by Chopin (oooh - Frederic, encore une fois...). Is the vampire a simple metaphor for the unlived disconnected adolescent pining for real flesh and blood? Or is it the dream product of a frustrated woman yearning for her dark knight who will, finally, take her soul?  Yes it's a sad culture we live in, disconnected from feelings & from vitality ... instead of facing ourselves we tune into cheap spine shiverings crafted by unfulfilled  matrons dreaming up their incubi (incubuses?).<br /><br />\\"The anemone and flower that weeps<br /><br />have grown in the garden plain<br /><br />where Melancholy sleeps<br /><br />between Amor and Disdain...\\"<br /><br />Confucius say: \\"Support bacteria - may be only culture some people have. \\"

B0040UAYI4|3.0|Like most I was very excited to read the reviews and watch the demos.  I ordered and installed the product, and set everything up properly.  The customer support is great, and the new firmware fixed any small issues the product had with jaggedness.  There is no lag, and aiming is, technically, more accurate than is possible with a controller.    HOWEVER, I ultimately returned the product.  The problem that I haven't seen mentioned is that the main thing that makes using a mouse so much better than a controller simply doesn't translate onto PS3:    On a PC, a mouse is LINEAR.  If you move the mouse 2 inches to the right your character turns a certain amount.  If you move the mouse 2 inches to the right quickly, the character turns the EXACT SAME AMOUNT, he just does it MORE QUICKLY.  This is not the case when using a mouse on Black Ops, Medal of Honor, etc.  The Eagle Eye basically translates the \\"mouse is moving to the right\\" action into \\"right analog stick is being pushed to the right.\\"  This, in theory, works well. However, on the PS3, the speed of your character's turn depends not on the speed that the mouse moves, nor the distance, but on a fixed in game sensitivity.  For example, if you set your sensitivity to 2 in Black Ops, your character can only turn at a certain max speed.  If you try to swipe your mouse to the right quickly, the PS3 only understands that the right analog stick is being pushed breifly, and your character will barely move.  If you move the mouse relatively slowly, the character will turn farther, because the PS3 thinks the right analog stick has been pushed right for a longer period of time.  This is the opposite of how it works on PC, and is very disconcerting.  This is no fault of Penguin United, it is simply the way the game undertands inputs, and it cannot be changed unless the game has an option to undestand inputs in a linear way, such as the native mous/kb option in UT3.  Ultimately, This was very frustrating/confusing, and I wound up losing more firefights trying to fight this effect and my own inutition than I would have if I had simply used the controller.    C/N You get to use a mouse and keyboard, but the REASON a mouse and keyboard is better in the first place doesn't really translate.

1439177783|5.0|I read this book in 2 days, unable to put it down.  If you have suffered from emotional eating, self-image issues, dieting, anorexia, bulemia, etc, this book is a great and revealing mirror.  This book is also for you if you are curious about the pressures women in the modeling and entertainment industry face. Her innocent and genuine writing about her family and their dynamics, namely with her mom, is touching, painful in many places.  It's heart-wrenching to take that journey with her as she shows us how calculated and unhealthy a life of strict dieting and self-loathing can be and in the end, almost deadly.  I found myself exhausted when reading about her running, jumping up and down, shaking arms, whatever, just to continue burning calories.  It's a very honest book written by a beautiful woman recovering from something that I'm not sure one ever fully recovers from.  Thankfully she is on a new course. It can be frustrating in places as you can't help but love her and wish that the people who were around her daily would do something other than compliment her! You want to reach in and slap some of them, and also, hug her. This books makes no promises of being a self-help book, or of having expert advice, or anything of that nature.  It's a sad and crazy true story about a woman suffering from a sad problem so many women worldwide suffer from. I admire her courage to not only put her story on paper, but to actually publish it!

B002ZG983M|5.0|Parents, this movie is not for young kids!<br /><br />Now that we have that out of the way, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a mix of great action and comedy,  bordering on fantasy.  Supposedly normal people without super powers take on super hero personas and well,...Kick Ass!  The casting was excellent.  The script and the music flowed throughout.  If you don't mind violence and swearing and like to root for an underdog and action heroes then you should not let this film pass you bye.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I started watching Spartacus to fill the void left after completing HBO's Rome series.  Just needed a bit more Roman action.  Little did I know that this series would alter my entire entertainment threshold.  It's just so good.  Yes, there's a lot of violence and sex.  After a while though, it all just blends in to the very compelling and engrossing story.  In fact, one night it occured to me as the screen was awash in naked breasts, that I really wasn't even paying attention to the nudity anymore because the story is so good, it outshines even the eye candy.  The twelve year old boy in me was shocked!  If you're like me, you find yourself relating to and caring for just about every character on some level, even the jerks.  They're all very human and flawed... weak and strong all at once.  Whitfield conveys a stunning depth and complexity in his role as Spartacus, and as an action hero, I can think of few if any in this day and age that can hold a candle to him.  I'm deeply saddened he won't be returning, and somehow I can't imagine the series ever attaining this level of greatness without him, but so long as season 1 is available, we'll always be able to relish in thirteen episodes worth of pure sword and sandal perfection.  Enjoy!

030746363X|5.0|I'm so exited right now. About a week and a half ago I received my advanced copy of \\"The 4 Hour Body\\" and immediately devoured the rapid weight loss chapters. I've been at a plateau bouncing between 260lbs and 270lbs since Mid July. My goal at the time was to get to 250. One week after reading and following the prescribed nutritional program from the book (The Slow Carb Diet) I've broken through that plateau dramatically. In one week I lost 2 inches around my waist and dropped almost 8 pounds. I did this w/out modifying my exercise routine and I was not the least bit hungry while following this diet. It works. Check out my detailed weight loss chart that shows my progress from the beginning of the year. I use a Withings Scale and DailyBurn.com to record these results and they are verifiable, my profile is public. I'm so excited about the results I can't stop thinking about where I will be in 2 months with respect to my goals and the way I will look and feel!<br /><br />Not sure how to post the chart here but you can find it on this same review on my own site or at [...].<br />my site is located here: [...].

Goldacre does a great job not only of denouncing anti-science propagandists but of explaining how to distinguish legitimate science from pseudo-science.

0312370849|3.0|This book hooked me in early and fast.  There are two parallel storylines.  In 1942, a Jewish family living in Paris are rounded up by the police.  Ten year old Sarah locks her four year old brother in a cupboard to keep him safe, promising to return for him.  This part of the story centers on a real event: the round up of 10,000 Jews in Paris in July 1942.  Meanwhile in 2002, Julia (an American journalist living in Paris) is researching the events of July 1942.  She quickly discovers a personal connection between her family and Sarah's family and this gives her the impetus to keep investigating to find out what happened to Sarah.<br /><br />The first half of the book alternates between Sarah's story and Julia's story, but then Sarah \\"goes silent\\" and it's up to Julia to find out for us what happened after that.<br /><br />I was riveted to this book for the first two thirds, but then it lost momentum for me.  The most interesting thing about Julia's story is the hunt for Sarah and yet in the end finding out through her what happened is simply not as satisfying as it would have been to find out through Sarah's perspective.  Julia's family is also a collection of one dimensional characters so never takes on much depth.  The ending was also highly anticlimatic: you could see it coming a mile off but it seemed to take forever to get there.<br /><br />Nevertheless there is a lot to like here.  Sarah's story is memorable and really got to me.  I learned about a period in history that I didn't know about.  The writing style and short chapters also make this a quick and easy read. (In many ways it reads more like a young adult book.)  And the first two thirds are genuinely compelling.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this you may also like [[ASIN:0547423187 The Hand That First Held Mine]] which employs a similar plot structure.
B002VPE1YS|4.0|This \\"AmazonBasics\\" protective bag takes a while to make its virtues known.<br /><br />When I first unpacked and examined it, my initial feeling was that it was one of those things that looked more useful than it would actually be.  It is way too big for a mobile phone or digital camera, way too small for a video camera or tom-tom, being essentially flat in construction rather than bag- or box-shaped.<br /><br />The material is satiny, and thinly quilted--reminiscent of the lining material in some brands of outdoor jackets--or of the not-very-warm and not-very-waterproof quilted coats sold more as fashion accessories than as protectors from the weather.  But it has a nice draw-string closure with a grip-toggle, and a cute little karabiner for attaching it to... well whatever you might want to attach it to.<br /><br />But don't be misled by its odd size.  Don't reject this little carry bag; after all, you've probably already got a case for your camera, and who keeps their phone in anything other than their jeans pocket or a custom, colour-coordinated knitted sock?<br /><br />Look further.  Look into your outdoor bags for the expensive devices that really need a neat quilted cover but are, instead, rattling around in the bottom of a rucksack or the glove locker of the car.<br /><br />And if you already own a [[ASIN:B000HI0IL6 Mio P550 DigiWalker]] and a [[ASIN:B000VLP1CK Magenta Bat 4 Bat Detector]], you may find that you want to buy another of these little bags, as they are a perfect fit and you'll forever be swapping them around -- and cursing that the one not in the bag is back in the rucksack getting scratched again.<br /><br />Although, of course, a sock would probably do the job nearly as well, whether colour-coordinated or not!

0812973992|4.0|McCann review<br /><br />This winner of the National Book Award is worthy of our attention, both on its own merits and as an indication of the kind of book selected to receive such an award.<br /><br />Set in 1974 the book recounts the experiences of a dozen or so figures.  This is a time of pain and struggle, with Watergate, Vietnam and other events and issues dominating the news.  Into this world steps Philippe Petit, a French wirewalker who stretches a line between the nearly-completed twin towers of the World Trade Center and walks back and forth, a quarter of a mile above the ground, without a net, for approximately 45 minutes.  This is harrowing for more than the obvious reasons.  Since the towers could sway approximately three feet in a high wind there remained the possibility of Petit being whipped off of the wire.  The wire was stretched at considerable force (3 tons or so), so that if part of the wrapped wire came loose it could snap off his head or one of his limbs.  Hence, the act was one of physical skill, courage, foolhardiness and grand performance art.<br /><br />Petit's historic act is noticed by the fictional characters in the book.  It serves as a point of learning, hope, amusement and surprise.  It also underlines the ways in which individuals live their circumscribed lives, blind to what is around them until something stark and amazing impinges on their experience.<br /><br />The lives of McCann's characters (hookers, a liberation-theology street priest, mothers who have lost sons in Vietnam . . . ) are not unrelievedly bleak, but neither are they particularly uplifting or encouraging.  We are offered slight glimmers of hope in a world that weighs heavily on its occupants.  It is, in short, a very `Irish' and very `New York' book.  It's Joyce without the learning, the dark humor and the raw energy.<br /><br />It is a very well-written book, with deep awareness of the culture of 1974 and a cast of interesting characters, all of whom hold our attention, but none of whom are likely to enjoy literary immortality.<br /><br />Some readers have found it slow.  It is somewhat slow at the beginning.  The reader must begin with the awareness that s/he will have to persevere.  It picks up the pace in succeeding acts and ends on a nice note.  Part of its narrative logic concerns its thematic point that our lives are ultimately intertwined.<br /><br />Critics and commentators are always telling writers `how they would have done it' or `what they would have preferred'.  I would have preferred a book about Petit himself, who is far and away the most interesting character in the book.  I could imagine a historical novel by a writer such as the Glen David Gold of CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL giving an interesting take on Petit, whose challenges are here represented with dizzying effectiveness but for a very brief time.<br /><br />While LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN is a fine book, I can't imagine wanting to read it twice, though I might like to read a book that focused on one of its characters in greater depth and at greater length.  It is a somber, momentarily hopeful statement, asserting that `this is the way the world is'.  And so it is, to some.enjoy literary immortality.    Some readers have found it slow.

B00192IV9U|1.0|I had taken the liberty of sampling each track off of iTunes and sadly I must declare that this album (with the exception of the last three tracks) is a bunch of nonsense. The only aspect remotely \\"Michael\\" is the cover art.    Michael was a perfectionist and the tracks are totally sub-par.    Without the opportunity of listening to all of His existing songs I would have been mislead into believing that this album is legit - however, you can clearly determine which songs have synthetic vocals and which are sincere. Newer followers of the King of Pop will have a good time being entertained. For the people who appreciate the classic Michael, be warned: This will be like listening to Backstreet Boys for about 7 of the first songs in.    Gone too soon all the way . . perhaps this album was released FAR too soon.     Michael, I'm sorry that they've done THIS to you - but we ALL miss you and you will continue to live on.

014241543X|2.0|It's a cold February day and Mia is in the car with her mom and dad and her little brother, Teddy. One minute they're enjoying each other's company, and the next Mia's spirit is eyeing her body in a ditch.<br /><br />I buy most of my books from Amazon, but I saw this one in a Target store and remembered seeing the cover on a blog or somewhere. If I would have noticed the \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight\\" blurb I wouldn't have purchased it, because I'm not into anything that has to do with vampires. But this was not that type of story. If I Stay is about a girl who is in a coma after a car accident and her spirit is trying to decide whether to stay or leave. In Mia's words: If I stay.  If I live. It's up to me.<br /><br />I didn't agree with Mia's words at all; it wasn't up to just her. She - or her spirit - spoke as if her staying alive wasn't also up to the doctors; the professionals with the knowledge and equipment to  keep her heart pumping and to help her body heal while her spirit was roaming around the hospital. And Mia's view on God: In a flashback, she saw her brother in a devil suit for Halloween and heard her boyfriend, Adam, make a remark about eternal damnation. She didn't question if Satan or hell was real or not, yet she thought angels and God were non-existent. That was disappointing along with a few other things: Too much profanity - the F word was overused, not that it was necessary at all. The way Kim disrespected her mother. And the choice Mia's mother made when she found out her daughter had a boyfriend.<br /><br />The way it was written, I had no problem visualizing the automobile accident that claimed lives, but as tragic as it was I wasn't moved. The family is in the car, and then all of a sudden Mia is viewing the aftermath of the accident. If the characters reactions while the accident was taking place would have been included, I could have really felt something. And then there was Mia- or her spirit- who watched as a sheet was being placed over her dad and her mom was being zipped up in a plastic bag, but didn't react. She should have responded in a way that brought tears to her eyes and I'm sure I would have felt her pain. I could feel the love she had for her parents and brother in the beginning, but when she lost them she lacked emotion. I could understand her being concerned about what was going on with her body, but she dismissed her family's deaths so easily. Why? Because she couldn't think about it? She lost her parents and her little brother. How could she not think about it? The passersby showed more emotion than she did.<br /><br />I thought I'd have a good reading experience with this book because of so many five star reviews, but I didn't. A story where a teenage girl's spirit is hanging around in the hospital listening to the conversations of family and friends didn't grab me at all. Mia was in a coma, I know, and I sympathized, but, I'm sorry to say, the story bored me. Even with the flashbacks there was nothing riveting. I put the book down a few times, but I kept coming back to it because I was hoping something would happen to make me change my opinion. It didn't.<br /><br />This was just an okay read. On the cover it looks like Mia is lying on the ground and that reminded me of the movie The Invisible, starring Justin Chatwin.

B0026IUXO2|3.0|No one likes a pedantic putz, and I hope I don't come across as one. But after watching Elizabeth R, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and reading a number of historical books authored by reputable authors like Alison Weir, I found this film to be more along the lines of historical fiction. But some dialogue and details are so egregious they could not be overlooked. For example, Elizabeth saying 'This small issue of religion.' Even the atheists of the age wouldn't have dared say this more less a princess of the crown jewel of Christendom, whose father was at one time regarded as 'Defender of the Faith'(being Catholicism). Next, in the same scene, Norfolk says in response that it was religion that killed her mother. No, adultery was the charge, not heresy. The dots are not even in near proximity for such a claim. A little later, Walsingham makes a four inch slice on some kids neck and he dies? Who was he? Why did he want to kill Walsingham, why would a superficial 'flesh wound'no where near an artery kill him? Anyway, this is just my opinion and my desire is to help someone make a decision regarding the expenditure of time and money. If you are not a history buff, this movie may be entertaining. But I highly recommend Elizabeth R for supremely intelligent dialogue, better acting, truer history.  [[ASIN:B00005LC1D Elizabeth R]]

Plus the writing is incredible, nothing beats Deans off-the-cuff comebacks!  There is something for everyone in this series and no doubt it will appeal to both men and women. The men get the gore and action while the women can enjoy not only watching two hot actors but the struggles and emotions both of them continue to battle with. This is a win-win for all!! You will not be disappointed!! I strongly recommend that you start at the beginning to get the full effect of the story line.  Happy Watching!!
B00192IV9U|5.0|Everybody knows where they were on November 22, 1963 when President John Kennedy was assassinated. Everybody knows where they were on December 8, 1980 when John Lennon was gunned down in New York. June 25, 2009 has also gone down in history as another day that will be forever remembered as the day Michael Jackson suddenly passed away from cardiac arrest due to an overdose of medications, and everybody knows the exact spot they were in when the heard the shocking news.    18 months later, and with the memory still fresh in people's minds, Sony, the longtime distributor of everything Michael Jackson, has released the first of 10 albums that they've promised to release from now until 2017.    One cannot help listen to the songs on Michael without feeling upset over the loss of pop culture's most entertaining and versatile artist the world has ever known. However, with the sense of loss there is the urge to sing along, rock out, stomp, and clap along to this awesome collection of songs, something the King of Pop never failed to deliver on his past albums.     Michael opens up with the first single, the Akon duet Hold My Hand, which ironically opens with Michael singing \\"This life don't last forever...\\". The song is an uplifting anthem about friendship and love. This is followed by the fantastic Hollywood Tonight, which features Michael's signature mouth instrumentations, a song about broken dreams of making it big in Hollywood, a topic rarely covered by Michael in the past. Keep Your Head Up is a gorgeous midtempo song about believing in yourself. It's a song that brings out the best of Michael's memorable voice. The Way You Love Me starts with what sounds like Michael during a phonecall instructing how this song goes, another beautiful ballad. Monster, which sounds a bit like Ghosts, is an uptempo paparazzi-bashing song and features a rap by 50 Cent. Best of Joy is another sweet ballad. It's obvious after 3 ballads on this album that Michael was best when he sang his heart out about love. Breaking News had me dancing in my seat once the beat kicks in. It's another tabloid-bashing song, but this one is distinctive in that Michael mentions his own name. This is definitely one of the highlights on Michael. (I Can't Make It) Another Day is a lot of fun! It's the rock song on the album, featuring Lenny Kravitz on guitar and backing vocals, and former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl on drums. Behind the Mask is reminiscent of Black or White in it's energy. It's an uptempo song with hints of electronic noise, and just an overall infectious tune. The album closer, Much Too Soon is a sweet song, and one that landed on the cutting room floor during the Thriller recording sessions. It's a Michael Jackson gem that I am glad we got to hear after all these years.    Despite the tragedy that Michael is linked to, it should be a celebration of Michael Jackson's enduring talent and status as the undisputed King of Pop.    A

With decent resolution. Now that I overclocked this puppy I run that game on the absolute maximum settings and in 1080p. Not only that but I have better FPS in high settings now, than I had in low settings in the past.<br /><br />Another thing. My playstation 2 emulator used to experience some slow down while rendering certain scenes. Now that I've overclocked that slow down has completely disappeared.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.
B00192IV9U|3.0|When I first heard of this album being released, my first thoughts were how great this could be.  After all, Michael Jackson was all about his fans. Surely he had material he was working on before his death.  We all knew about Hold My Hand (it was leaked in 2008).  We also knew about Will.I.Am working in the studio with him (2006 Access Hollywood tv show).  So I figured the Estate and Sony were going to drop this incredible album on us.  Well, they could have.  But they missed out.      There were 3 COMPLETED songs with Will.I.Am; The Future, I'm Dreamin', and I Miss You.  But for some reason, these songs were NOT put on this album.  Ashame since these tracks are surely greatness.  So what is on the album?  Monster, Breaking News, and Keep Your Head Up.  All 3 songs with questionable authenticity of vocals. While to some degree, these songs MAY have Michael Jackson's vocals, it's clearly evident that the songs were not finished and in most parts, don't sound like the Michael Jackson we have come to love.  These 3 tracks just sound off when compared to the rest of the album.  Another reason to question to authenticity of these 3 tracks, besides the \\"ear test\\", is that these songs were registered by Eddie Cascio as a songbook.  Each song was not registered individually, something rather unusual.  They could infact have been registered as lyrics, but not music.  After hearing the vocals to these tracks, this action by Mr. Cascio certainly raises a red flag.        Album positives:  Hold My Hand is classic MJ. Should not have been the album opener though.  That should've been Hollywood Tonight (which I believe should be the next single).  Best Of Joy will be an under-rated tune that has MJ in his falsetto - One of my favorites on here.  Behind The Mask was meant for Thriller and has stellar vocals - most likely from 1982.  Much Too Soon is a simple song, yet moving.  Michael's vocals sound superb.  Overall, 7 songs that I really enjoy.      What the Estate should have done:  The Will.I.Am tracks should have been on here.  The questionable Cascio tracks (Keep Your Head Up, Monster, Breaking News) should have been left off.  There also should have been work by producer Rodney Jerkins on here (Jerkins worked on the Invincible album).  Another Day should not have been as over-worked as it sounds (a leak of the song back in 2009 sounded much better).  Behind The Mask should have been released like it was, not reworked to try to sound more current. - Hopefully one day the Estate releases the original recorded version by Michael.    Conclusion:  It's hard to rate this album because it's not really a Michael Jackson album.  While I believe this album and future projects should be released (because Michael was all about giving to his fans and this album supports Michael's children), it doesn't have his final blessing.  So one must look at this as more of a gift to fans.      Will.I.Am songs should be on here.  The 3 Cascio tracks should've been left off.  Another Day and Behind The Mask should not have been re-worked to sound more current.  Another couple tracks would've been nice.  - 3 Stars.
B002ZG98PA|3.0|Locked up in a tower under false pretenses due to the magical qualities of her hair, 18-year-old Rapunzel longs to see the colored lights that appear every year on her birthday.  When a fugitive thief blunders into her life, opportunity presents itself and adventure and romance follow.    Disney's 50th animated film features beautiful animation, wonderful character design, excellent voice talent, and some terrific songs, but the script lets it down.  It lacks wit, relying too much on the other aspects of production to do the heavy lifting.  As a result, the familiar tropes of a Disney Princess film, such as the young woman with animal friends waiting for her life to begin, seem mechanical and unimaginative, as do the thugs with hearts of gold.  There are also too many moments when the screenwriter seems to have written himself into a corner and must rely on coincidence and unlikely meetings to get out of it.  However, the film's other strengths make it enjoyable and it does have some great moments.

Hoping to take the fight to Luke and diminish his forces before the imminent attack on Camp Half Blood, Percy and Beckendorf attempt to incapacitate the Princess Andromeda. Things go seriously wrong from the start, and Percy ends up dueling Kronos himself before turning tail and diving into the ocean. Percy awakens in Poseidon's underwater palace to find a full-scale war waging outside. Once he has recovered, Poseidon tells Percy to return to Camp Half Blood and hear the rest of his prophecy.<br /><br />Camp has changed since Percy's first summer. There are fewer campers, and those who remain have seen their fair share of battle. Everyone is preparing for the coming battle, and Grover has gone missing during his efforts to prepare the nature spirits. With things looking bad for the Olympians and half bloods, it's Nico who develops a plan that might save the camp and Olympus. Taking a page from Greek history, Nico and Percy go on a journey that leads them back to the Underworld in order to find the means to defeat Kronos. Then the battle to save the world begins!<br /><br />Unlike the preceding books, there is a strong sense of sadness in this book. There is a large amount of death in this book, and after four books' worth of becoming attached to the characters, it's hard to see so many of them die. The action in the second half is ceaseless- as soon as the heroes seem to be gaining ground, the battle begins anew and they are overwhelmed by Kronos' forces. Both sides have some impressive tricks up their sleeves which I feel kept the story line from becoming too predictable.<br /><br />As with the previous books, Riordan continues to introduce new characters. I'm impressed by the depth of his research and the number of unfamiliar but powerful individuals he has found to add to the story. Everyone has their role in this story, playing to their strengths (e.g. Athena's Cabin is in charge of battle logistics, as Athena is the Goddess of Military Strategy). Riordan weaves together all of the character's skills in a logical and impressive manner which I think really illustrates his skill as a writer.<br /><br />The battle for Olympus is in full swing, and it's down to the half bloods to defend Olympus while the Olympians try to stop Typhon from reaching New York. New monsters will awaken, the heroes will gain some unexpected support, and characters will be faced with their most difficult challenges yet. If the Titans win, the world as we know it will end. If the Olympians win, Percy has a few new demands for the Gods. The writing is first-rate, the information is interesting, and the content is exciting!

030746363X|5.0|The book is probably one of the most important books of this time.  Tim reveals things that would normally be reserved for World Class athletes and Movie stars.  The information in this book come to us years in advanced if we would have to wait for University experimentors it would have been another 7 years or so if ever.  Anyone interested in health, fitness and just plain bettering yourself should be reading this book.  This will be the benchmark for future books on fitness, health and self awarness.  The book is well written and very easy to understand.  Tim had a great idea of sectioning off parts thta go into the \\"how things work\\" and lets you know that this section is optional and it is only for us geeks who must understand how things work.  I can't say enough about this book, Just go get it.  You will not be dissapointed.<br />Hope
1423101464|5.0|Even with the protection of Thalia's tree, the campers at Camp Half Blood know it's only a matter of time before Kronos finds a way to breach the protective barriers and an attack is imminent. By chance, Percy discovers how they might achieve this, and the campers quickly develop a plan to try and defend the camp. Meanwhile, Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson head off on yet another quest- this time to head off Luke and his minions. The heroes must find a mythological item called the string of Daedelus, which can guide Luke to the camp. If they can get it first, perhaps they can foil his plan.<br /><br />Traversing the fabled Labyrinth to find Daedelus is dangerous work. The characters have only a few days to succeed and face the extreme likelihood that they will get lost. While in the Labyrinth, they will have to face new monsters, make difficult decisions, and discover new allies. Some friends will be made and some will be lost. A glimpse of the true extent of Percy's power will be seen, and the Olympians worst fear will be realized. What secrets will the campers find hidden in the Labyrinth? Will they foil Luke's plan?<br /><br />This book is a turning point in the series- the two sides have built their armies and the final pieces have fallen into place as they prepare for battle. Large amounts of time pass quickly in this book, so the pace is quick. There's certainly no boring points in this book! There's much to be done before the big battle, so the characters are completing many tasks while on their quest. Many cases that have been left open ended in the previous books are finally dealt with in this book, such as Nico wandering off and Grover's continuing search for Pan. I like that Riordan chose to wrap up many of the loose ends now, rather than holding everything until the end of the series.<br /><br />As with each of the previous books, the mythology in this book is well researched. I liked that rather than simply dictating the story behind Daedelus and the Labyrinth, Riordan told it through Percy in a series of dreams. All of the characters had a role, and the plot twists kept the book from becoming too predictable. Riordan's books have a bit of a cookie-cutter outline to them, but he manages to keep his books engaging nonetheless!<br /><br />One of the major themes in this book is making decisions. The primary focus of the series is the rise of Kronos, but throughout the series he has slowly and thoroughly developed each character so that now, as the end is on the horizon, each of the characters is faced with a tough decision- Percy will be given a chance to escape it all. Nico will have to choose which side to fight on. Annabeth will have to face her indecision between Percy and Luke. As tensions run high, the reader can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters' decisions and their repercussions.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is another excellent part in the Percy Jackson series. For any reader who enjoys mythology and fantasy, this is an enjoyable and easy read! I'm definitely looking forward to reading the final book and finding out how it all ends!it through Percy in a series of dreams.

142311339X|5.0|Jason wakes up one day to find himself on a school bus with no idea who or where he is or how he got there. His friends swear they know him and he must have amnesia. As if the day didn't have a weird enough start, the group Jason is with is attacked by storm spirits and kids show up claiming to be \\"demigods\\". They bring Jason and his friends back to Camp Half Blood where they quickly learn that they are more than just some delinquent kids with trouble reading. Following a promise to Percy Jackson the summer before, the new demigods are quickly claimed by their Olympian parents. Unfortunately, something seems a little off about Jason, and the only person who seems to understand why is Chiron. Jason seems like just another demigod, but for some reason he calls the Gods by other names, and has fragments of odd memories.<br /><br />Jason and his friends learn that they are the first of seven demigods who will partake in the worst prophecy yet. They are sent on a rescue mission and in the process meet many monsters and beings who are older than the Olympians and much, much worse. The three new demigods battle it out with some of the most ferocious monsters in mythology, winning some battles and barely surviving others. A power is awakening that has even the Olympians hiding in hopes that it will simply go away. What odds do a bunch of half mortal kids have against such power? And who will the four remaining demigods of the prophesized seven be? Only time will tell!<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, one of the things I had wondered about was how much time had passed since the end of the Percy Jackson series to the beginning of this new series. I was thrilled to see that instead of decades later, only a few months had passed! The characters from the Percy Jackson series are all still present, but now they've become secondary characters while a new set of main characters come onto the scene. I love that Rick Riordan did this because it allows us to occasionally find out what is happening in the lives of the characters we've grown attached to in the previous series!<br /><br />As always, the writing is excellent and the characters are incredibly interesting. Riordan brings in a variety of new characters and gives plenty of background on each of them so you can understand their actions a bit better. He also brings in some very interesting plot twists to the Olympian storyline! When I was initially reading the book, I wondered why Riordan would introduce such a huge plot element this late in the story line. I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say that it's of such enormous importance that you can't help but wonder how the characters in the Percy Jackson series hadn't noticed it before. Fortunately Riordan pulled together an explanation at the end that could reasonably explain the situation, thus making it seem less like an afterthought that was tossed in purely to create room for a sequel series.<br /><br />The only thing that occasionally bothers me about Riordan's writing style is that he's prone to vagueness. He's often deliberately vague in an effort to hook the reader (e.g. a character will have a revelation, but something occurs and they don't have a chance to share it, or he alludes to an item someone has, but doesn't reveal the meaning until much later in the book) but sometimes it's almost overkill. Throughout the book, these vague allusions occur, and sometimes they resurface a few times, until they are finally revealed towards the end of the book. I understand that he can't just give away everything up front, but he also doesn't have to hold out everything until the very end. After the first 5 or 6 times he's done this, you can't help but feel a sense of, \\"Would you at least let me in on the storyline a little bit?!\\".<br /><br />This book was an excellent start to a new series by Rick Riordan! He's mastered the art of the cliff-hanger (I mean seriously, after leaving us where he did, he's making us wait until next Fall for the sequel?!) and I can't wait to read what happens next! I love the twist that Riordan has worked into the storyline, and I am thrilled that my favorite characters from the Percy Jackson series are still a part of the story! If you love mythology and the Percy Jackson series, you absolutely must continue on with the story!it to read what happens next!

B0001W1BXC|4.0|I bought this movie because I remember it being scary when I was a kid. While the stories in this movie seemed much different than I remember, it was great to get a blast from the past. Funny to see the things I did and didn't notice when I was younger.
0954510364|4.0|I bought a used copy but it is still in great shape.    The illustrations are wonderful although the text does't really need them.

B003NL5JE0|5.0|I had to write a review after seeing the vast number of one-star reviews.    I've been a fan of Pain of Salvation since \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\" after which I snapped up \\"Entropia\\". I started waning in my fandom by \\"BE\\" and was lukewarm on \\"Scarsick\\". Yes, if you have read any other reviews, \\"Road Salt\\" is very different from those. If it is any wonder why some bands make the same record over and over again (like Dream Theater who I love but has been admittedly stuck in a rut for about seven years), look no farther than the harsh criticisms here.    Road Salt doesn't have the heavy prog-shredding of Idioglossia anywhere on it. But it does have catchy hooks, powerful lyrics (anyone who thinks \\"Sisters\\" is insipid needs their taste checked) and even some prog quirkiness in \\"Sleeping Under the Stars\\". It is tough to categorize and that's exactly what makes me admire their deviation from what they have done before. Not only is it different, but it is different AND good. Some get very hung up on the former.    It's being spun more than any other CD I picked up this year. It's not just something that you admire from afar but a CD that grows and grows on you.
0393337170|4.0|I was pleased to find the package on my doorstep today. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. The book's front cover was slightly bent, but not enough to be an annoyance. I would definitely buy from this retailer again.

C'mon, it's beach reading! It serves that purpose well!
030746363X|5.0|I found the 4-Hour Body to be incredibly interesting and informative. It gave me clear, simple guidelines for diet and exercise which are incredibly easy to live by. Plus, the depth of research  that Tim Ferriss has done gives me great confidence in the recommendations. I've read a lot of health and wellness books and found this one to be particularly smart, easy to use, and comprehensive.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Im not sure what to say about this album - other than I love it. Pretty much every song makes me tap my feet, and sometimes it makes me want to stomp them during the more \\"intense, heated\\" parts of the music. I never thought id be into this type of music. I come from listening to bands like AFI, Thrice, Underoath - all the way to Taylor Swift and composers like Hans Zimmer and John Powell. While I appreciate the sounds of the earlier bands, I really appreciate the sound that Mumford & Sons have created; and not just with their instruments but the melodies and lyrics. Each song has its own individual story to them that some of us can even relate to. I recommend this band to anyone looking for some great, unique music that you'll not only love, you'll feel good listening to it!
B000055Y0X|5.0|This movie is a philosophical tour-de-force with an all star cast of characters. Reportedly, when Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a movie about nuclear war, he interviewed numerous \\"experts\\" to try and delvelop a \\"philosphy of nuclear war\\".  Ultimately he was directed to Harvard University and Dr. Henry Kissinger, then in residence.  He is reported to hahve begun his interview with a simple request (but intended more and more directed questions), \\"Dr. Kissinger, please tell me about nuclear war\\".  Kissinger didn't stop talking for 3 hours and Kubrick never got another question in.  What came out of Kubrick's take on the three hour lecture was \\"Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\", a commentary on the total insanity of nuclear war and the delicate, if necessary theory of insane deterrents.     This is an essential film for anyone that even tarrys with the thought of the use of nuclear weapons for serious international relations.  It's also loads of fun!
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is quite possibly - no, most DEFINITELY, the best soundtrack I have ever owned. Now I know youre probably like - really? Everyone has their own tastes, so you might disagree...this is ok. But in my opinion an album that already surpasses the number of plays per song on all my other albums (according to my iTunes) within 5 weeks says something. But I digress.<br /><br />A quick history of my experience with \\"How to Train Your Dragon:\\" For some ridiculous reason, I did not want to see this film. I refused to spend the money in theaters to see it and waited about 7 months to actually see it. I think because I was sick and tired of seeing so many Shrek films come out and other films like Monsters vs Aliens, and Madagascar that sort of lacked in story and characters that I actually cared about that its kind of cheapened the value of Dreamworks Animation for me. One day I decided to buy it on Bluray, after my parents kept raving about it... Half way through the film I couldn't believe I didn't see this movie earlier and regretted not seeing it in theaters. Not only is the film visually appealing, but the story was great, and the characters were expressive and motivated and you had that \\"i care about this guy\\" feeling. It is a very uplifting film to watch.<br /><br />The soundtrack to this film, I believe, takes this film to the next level of awesomeness. It did extremely well in enhancing the tone of the film and heightened the feelings of certain scenes. I knew half way through the movie that I NEEDED to get this soundtrack. Most soundtracks come with about half the songs in the movie, which I think is pretty darn lame - this soundtrack comes with pretty much everything! 25 songs!!! And a really good thing is that the songs arent shortened like most other soundtrack albums - they are full length. This is a great soundtrack to just sit back, relax, and listen to.
0789204096|3.0|So, lets start with the good things about this book: It's thorough.  You get a great review of Rockwell's styles as they change through the years.  You can almost see exactly when he began using a camera to set up his illustrations.  It's a great reference catalogue.     Then there are the bad things: Most notably, while the description talks about \\"full size format\\" I actually bought the 'Tiny Folio' edition.  Which has 4\\" square pages - so any real use of the book is thwarted.  I bought the small size because Amazon's website confusingly led me to it through the used Marketplace FROM the page of the original sized book!  Here I thought I was getting a great deal on a good book...instead I got a novelty item.    That being said, even a full sized book would leave the viewer wanting to see better reproductions (or best of all - the actual painting).  Seeing Rockwell's paintings in person is no match for even the best reproductions.    I'm not going to return the book because the error was mine (albeit on a thoroughy confusing website).
B00192IV9U|1.0|As a fan who has listened to Michael Jackson's voice almost every day for the last 20 years, I feel like I know the mans voice pretty well.     Lets get real here, there are only seven tracks with authentic MJ vocals on this album (and one of them is a remix of an already released song). The other three songs (all coincidentally written and produced by the same person) sound like somebody trying to imitate his vocal style. These three tracks (Breaking News, Monster and Keep Your Head Up) should never have been included on this album. Even if they are genuinely Michael Jackson (which is highly doubtful) the estate should only have included songs they were 100% certain of. It is a huge disrespect to Michael's legacy to release three songs which could very well be somebody else singing. His estate are clearly only motivated by money and are not at all concerned about respecting Michael's artistic integrity.     The real tragedy here is that amidst the controversy over the fake vocals some rather good genuine Michael Jackson songs have been robbed of the attention they deserve. Hollywood Tonight has some amazing beatboxing from Michael and is his catchiest uptempo since the 90s. Another Day is his best rock song since Give Into Me and Behind The Mask is a real hidden gem.     But I do not believe that it is Michael Jackson singing on the three Eddie Cascio produced songs. It does not sound like Michael's voice, the tone, the power, his trademark growl.... it's not there.     His estate should be ashamed of themselves. Michael's unreleased material deserved better than this.
1442337966|5.0|I have enjoyed this CD VERY much and listen to it everytime I drive anywhere.  It is the actual way LIFE works and I am very appreciative to have found it.
B00192IV9U|4.0|Please know that seven of these ten songs DEFINITELY feature Michael Jackson, and they are some gems. \\"Much Too Soon\\" is a classic Michael ballad that features his lovely, powerful voice. \\"Another Day\\" is a rocking track, perhaps his best rock track since \\"Black & White.\\" Other authentic MJ songs include \\"Hold My Hand,\\" a duet with Akon, \\"Hollywood Tonight,\\" \\"Best of Joy\\", \\"Behind the Mask\\" and I LIke the Way You Love Me.\\"          The three Cascio-produced tracks are the questionable tracks, \\"Keep Your Head Up,\\" \\"Monster,\\" and \\"Breaking News.\\" Many fans and others do not believe that Michael is the singer on these tracks. There is debate over this issue, though I do not hear Michael in these tracks, particularly \\"Breaking News.\\"           But I'm going to support the seven tracks that DO feature Michael. I'm glad to hear his voice in these seven. Hmmm. Seven was his favorite number.....
1400052173|2.0|Maybe it's because I just finished a horribly boring book that was unexpectedly ALL about the characters family, or maybe this book just isn't my cup of tea.  I learned all I needed/wanted to know in the first few chapters and had to quit reading about a third of the way through the book.  The information feels scattered and there is no real story structure to keep me interested.  I am very grateful for her cells and the scientific advances they have given us, but it's just not enough for an entire book.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie; it was much funnier and less \\"hipster\\" than I thought it would be.  I'd heard quite a few other good reviews about this movie from friends, so I decided to check it out for myself, and, in my opinion, it's worth at least renting, if not owning.    The plot of the movie is relatively simple: Scott Pilgrim, the protagonist, is awe-struck by a girl he sees briefly when she's delivering a package.  Infatuated, he finds out how to contact her, attempts to court her, and ends up finding out that she has a slew of exes, seven deadly exes, to be precise.  The rest of the movie from this point onward is him attempting to, literally, fight his way through these exes to win the heart of the girl.    In style, the plot plays out exactly like an old school video-game, reflecting very well the audience that it aims to appeal to (my generation, the children of Nintendo and Sega).  While the concept sounds a bit cheesy, the editing, CGI, style, pacing, and plot elements tie together to perfectly create a fairly original concept comedy that isn't too dry, isn't too fast, isn't too serious, and isn't too ridiculous.  While it's unlikely that many people outside of my age bracket and generation will  find the movie all that entertaining (or even understand a lot of the references or visual styles), the movie is well worth a purchase and a view.  You will not be disappointed by any measure.

This one is for my granddaughter who is in her second year of college.  This book is good for any occasion.  It shows the paths you can take as you grow up. Some are good and some are not. This is truly a book for all ages.  Indeed from Pre-School to Graduate School and Beyond.
B0029XIWCY|5.0|I've never heard these recordings sound better! And I guess I don't need to discuss them. Everyone knows how great they are. No matter how they sound.     I've been listening to fake stereo versions of these that I folded down into mono but they never sounded like this. I also had a few of Columbia's Quintessiantal albums but they don't sound like this either. And I have a lot of this music on vinyl but these discs are really bringing this music to life for me.    These disc are a revelation. Highly recommended. Jazz at it's finest! Plus Teddy Wilson and Lester Young really shine on these discs. If you're interested in them these discs are a must.
B002G7CZTO|5.0|This is a fascinating book that is thought provoking and challenges our assumptions about this life.  It's a quick read about a woman's eperience of that which is greater than all that we know.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother and she LOVED it.  He has such an amazing voice.  We love the Big Band/Frank Sinatra feel to his music, although he really is unique in some ways.  I definitely recommend his CDs, including this one.  BTW, purchasing on Amazon was so much cheaper than even iTunes or the stores.  Enjoy!
B00192IV9U|5.0|Great CD, that I believe any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy.  Each song is extrememly good. I especially liked \\"Monster\\" and \\"Much too Soon.\\"  I'd say everyone who loves or enjoys Michael's music should give this CD a try.  I am extremely glad to hear new Michael Jackson material.

B001QW79DC|5.0|The violent chaos and brutality of this revealing recording is energizing and in some ways necessary, and it's nice to know that some people like Nick can see the world this way. My favourite track is probably \\"Well Of Misery\\", with it's heave-ho rhythm and call-and-response vocals.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|When I saw the mock trailer for 'Machete\\", I said to myself: \\"This would be a cool- ass movie!\\" I was right. If you like old fashioned Grindhouse-type movies, pop some popcorn, grab a soda, kick back and enjoy! It reminds me of all the movies we saw at the Drive-Inn on the weekends.
B003HC8I5M|4.0|I think the special edition, with the all the tracks from the sessions on MP3 on the DVD disc, is the one to get. I find this a little bit tricky to listen to all in one go, though there are a lot of discoveries to be had in the song choices, plus some fantastic old favourites that Phil's voice goes really well. \\"Standing In The Shadows Of Love\\" is probably my favourite track on it. The production is a tribute to the sound of the 1960s without being overstudied. Quite a few of the songs on here would make it up there with his greatest hits, if one asks me.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Strange that the description of the dvd does not mention Gerard Butler, who is the star!  I had also seen the other version of Beowulf, that is part animation, and thought it was wonderful, and since I love Gerard I wanted to see this one.  I was disappointed.  Then, I bought Wrath of gods, the story of the filming of Beowulf and Grendel.  I watched Gerard's hour long interview talking about the back story of Beowulf and Grendel, and then it made more sense, and I understood it when I watched it again!  Recommended, especially if you have a chance to see Gerard talk about his interest in the movie, and Beowulf, and the story of Beowulf, which is more familiar in Europe than it is in the US.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti captures something alive, or to put it another way Patti is something alive captured here. Enthusiasm, joy naked or otherwise, energy, passion, and a love for music and the written and spoken word. She's not afraid to be who she is, not at all. She is, as she says in the Babelogue on Easter (two albums after this) \\"an American artist, and I have no guilt. I seek pleasure, I seek the nerves under your skin...\\" What one sees is what you get with Patti, and I admire that about her, to be frank.
030746363X|5.0|Not being a health nut, I had a bit of trepidation reading my first<br />fitness/wellness book (literally, I failed Health Ed and have two<br />kids. I still don't know where they came from). To start from the<br />beginning; the way Tim set up the reading chronology is epic. I've<br />never seen someone say, \\"Don't read this all right away.\\". He lays out<br />a plan of information that is tailored to how you want to change your<br />life; whether it be simple fat loss, better sex, or making yourself<br />into the physical specimen you ways knew you could be. So it puts you<br />into a state where you just naturally read slower, take notes, look<br />stuff up (have not found one mis-quote or non-verifiable source yet),<br />and just digest what you're dropping in your brain bucket. The highly<br />technical stuff he keeps in a separate format so you don't get bogged<br />down if you do not wish to, and the style of his writing just carries<br />you away like an actual story of someone's life experimentation,<br />because in essence that's what it is.<br /><br />I'm probably going to have to read it three more times and fill up a<br />journal size Moleskine as I did with the Four Hour Work Week (on<br />natural stacked steroids; pardon the double entandre), but it is, as a<br />book, a joy to read.<br /><br />Why? Because, if it has done anything for me, it's given me hope. Hope<br />that I can be more than I am, more than I thought possible, more than<br />some non-athletic geek would dream of being. Without stopping my<br />normal existence, or joining an expensive gym, or feeling intimidated<br />by what's ahead. By knowing that the best teacher I've ever had is<br />putting a way to improve myself out there for no more than the price<br />of ONE SINGLE MEAL!<br /><br />...and that's my review of The Four Hour Body in one succinct,<br />understandable and powerful phrase. It's all about Hope.<br /><br />Read it. Enjoy your journey. Pass it on to the people you care about.<br />I can't wait for tomorrow. It's going to kick today's ass.
0545123283|2.0|I read shiver in just 1 day and it left me wanting to know more. I was so excited to purchase the next book, shiver, then I recieved it. hmm..I read about 5 chapters and it became boring. I got bored I ended up picking another book and finishing that book. I really don't have any idea why this book has that effect though. I was expecting so much more, but I ended up being disappointed. I hope I can finish this book.
B00192IV9U|2.0|To say I am bitterly disappointed with this CD, is an understatement.    10 haphazardly thrown together tracks and only 7 of them contain genuine, real Michael Jackson vocals.     Unfortunately, The Estate/Sony are still trying to pass those 3 Cascio tracks (Breaking News, Keep Your Head Up and Monster) off as Michael Jackson songs. It's obvious that they are motivated by money and don't care about Michael's legacy at all.    It's a shame because, there are some beautiful tracks on this album like Hollywood Tonight, Behind The Mask, Best Of Joy or Much Too Soon. They don't get the attention they deserve because of the controversy the fake songs created.     My advice: Don't buy it. Buy the 7 real songs individually, if possible. That's what I'm gonna do.

0756405890|5.0|The only downside to this book is the fact that I have to wait until May to fnd out what happens next! I am an avid Fantasy reader (I call them my nerd books) and this one is up there with the best of them (so far). It is well written, smart, and the characters are wonderful. I've already pre-ordered the next one and I can't wait! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is probably the most realistic War Drama/Documentary my husband and I have ever watched. I bought it for him for Christmas, and I don't usually watch war documentaries, but this one, kept me in my seat, watched every episode. The quality, clarity, realistic portrayal, and effects was amazingly accurate. It deals with the personal issues, as well as the battle in the Pacific and touches on the battle in Germany also. Both sides. It's just amazing, highly recommend it. You will not be dissapointed. A joy to have, my husband has already watched it twice, and keeps learning different things he missed the first time.

0312330537|1.0|There are loads of reviews about this book already, so i'll be brief. This book would have had a potential (the story is intriguing and parts about Bombay are interesting) had it been written by someone else. The author and his self-love have killed it! It was so bad that i feel i have to voice my awe and warn others!  The acknowledgment section of the book actually contains words \\"this novel is written in blood and tears\\" and \\"many pages of this manuscript ... are stained and streaked with my blood\\"?!  The 900 pages prior to that are filled with megalomaniacal and self-grandiose rubbish and only maybe about 50 pages were worth reading... What happened to quality control and editors?
B00192IV9U|2.0|*SIGH* Well, I'm not going to say too much because my fellow MJ lovers who are disappointed have already spoken and covered the basis. It breaks my heart to give any MJ album TWO stars, but I must keep it real.  MJ cannot be resting peacefully right now... I know he's gatta have a permanent frown on his face after hearing this farce.  I smell a RAT for real, y'all!!     I wholeheartedly agree with Justin from London... what is going on with the, \\"sheep\\" voice on those \\"MJ\\" tracks?? Tell this, \\"MJ\\" to try again.  Those vocals are not sexy at all. He mind as well come out and expose himself... we all need to know who to give proper \\"credit\\" to.    I'm still stuck like a deer in headlights over, \\"Breaking News\\".. and that was released a month ago.  That one extra star is for... \\"Behind the Mask\\".      MJ, we miss you terribly:(
030746363X|5.0|Tim did ask us all to review his book, but he didn't tell us to rate 5 stars.  I am doing that because the book is great.  It's great for normal people who want to make progress and not make a lot of the same silly mistakes that most people make when dieting/training/etc.      It's really cheap for how much information is in there, and there are no lies or gimmicks - just him doing lots of research and distilling it into information you can understand right away - and then a pointer in the right direction if you want to know more.
0882709194|5.0|It's very unfortunate that Ray Comfort commits blasphemy to Charles Darwin's masterpiece through his agenda set forth in his so called special introduction in this edition of, The Origin of the Species. I was caught off guard, expecting an intro that will summarize Darwin's theory. Comfort infected Darwin's book with the gawd virus. He is a deceiver, a spammer, violating one of his commandments about lying, for which he preaches, therefore a hypocrite.<br /><br />Comfort is an opportunist, a christian fundamentalist (fanatic), and a fear monger. Comfort sets out to target the likely readers of The Origin of the Species, with christian dogma in the hopes of sabotaging the reader's potential acceptance of Darwin's theory. This is much in the same manner as if an atheist were to write an introduction to some bible edition.<br /><br />Comfort starts out the introduction with some reasonable and possible refutations of Darwin, such as a shortage of missing links in the fossil records (I don't know the facts of that statement, but it could be true), and slowly proceeds to christian dogma to explain why people should accept christianity, which has nothing to do with Darwin's book.<br /><br />Comfort ASSsumes (makes an ASS of himself) the existence of that supposedly all powerful ghost (does not provide proof for ITS existence), gives poor explanations as to why christianity is better than Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, and tries to scare the reader into accepting christianity by working up in the reader emotions of fear, by having the reader imagine jumping out of a plane without a parachute. It would be nice if Comfort would jump out of a plane without a parachute to see for himself how that ghost will prevent his certain death. Actually, if I had to chose a religion based on his descriptions, Islam sounds more attractive, Buddhism would be second, Hinduism third, and christianity would be the worst.<br /><br />Comfort, you don't fool me. You preach a lot of religious rubbish. You have no facts that support your stupid backward views. I urinate on your introduction. I took a black magic marker and voided all your pages in which the religion began to reek like chicken crap. You suck Comfort!<br /><br />Now, to pay Comfort for his scam, I will take a page from his book, by making an excellent book recommendation in my review of Darwin's book, of the book: Atheism: The Case Against God, by author George H. Smith. This is a superb book. It's easy to read. The wise author demonstrates how the theist's arguments collapse under the weight of reason. If you are an atheist, but just didn't know how to answer the theist's dogmatic claims, this good book will arm you well.upport your stupid backward views. I urinate on your introduction.

B000059Z8M|5.0|Toy Story 2 is one hour and thirty-two minutes and was released in theaters on November 34, 1999. The story picks up somewhere around summer time as Andy and Woody gets ready for cowboy camp. Right before the two are set to go, Andy accidently rips Woody's arm and Woody is left home. Andy's mom put Woody on the top shelf where he discovers Wheezy, a rubber squeeze penguin whose squeaker is broken. While Andy is away, Ms. Davis is having a yard sale and grabs Wheezy from the shelf and put him up for sale for .25¢. Woody rescues Wheezy but Woody is stolen by Al McWhiggin; the owner of Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Hamm set out to rescue Woody. It is at Al's apartment that we learn the truth about why Woody is stolen; Woody is a character from the 1950's era television show Woody's Roundup. Woody is the last part of Al's collection needed to sell to a museum in Japan so Al can make millions off of Woody. The collection is useless without Woody. Jessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector, and Bullseye (a horse) are all exciting to have Woody back and tell them that he is going to Japan with them to be part of a permanent display. Woody at first refuses to go with them but, as he learns more about his past and Stinky Pete smooth talks him Woody has a change of heart and decides to stay. When Buzz, Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Hamm arrive to rescue Woody he tells them that he is not going the gang slowly leaves. Woody watches an episode of Woody's Roundup and sees a boy playing with and that reminds him of the times he spent with Andy and misses that. Woody changes his mind and tells Buzz and the gang to wait for him. Woody invites Jessie and Bullseye to come with and they agree; when he starts to invite Stinky Pete, it is then that Stinky Pete true colors are shown. Stinky Pete locks the air vent and forces Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye all go to Japan with him; Stinky Pete is resentful for all those years he spent on aDime Store's shelf while other toys were being sold around him. Buzz, Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Hamm go after Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye and wind up at the Tri County Airport. In the end Woody saves Jessie and all the toys make it back to Andy's house. This movie is a great follow up to the original Toy Story and we learn more about Buzz and Woody's past.

0763650420|5.0|My little brother and I LOVED this book when we were growing up.  We loved the character of Bill, who is the littlest and has a hard time understanding it all : )  My dad used to change the names of the little owls to our names when he was telling the story.  I can see how some kids might be scared of the mother being gone, but when I was little I was really reassured by the fact that the mom always comes home.    I bought this recently for the one year-old girl I nanny for.  I was happy to see it is now out in board book format.  I think it's especially good for kids who have nannies or are in daycare-- they sometimes have a hard time saying goodbye to parents, nannies or teachers and I think it's good for them to know it's not forever!
B00192IV9U|5.0|First of all, I have to say I love the album's cover very much. It is such a beautiful picture which almost sums up all important people and milestone events in MJ's longtime career. (just almost, okay! :))  About the songs, I personally think they were very well produced, for the fact that they made them out of MJ's demos. Of course, one may argue that if MJ himself had made the album, it would have been much much better. However, they made a good job so far. Everybody already knows about the controlversy going on around the album. People are free to hold on to their own thinking. However, just make sure you dont let other people shape your opinion... To me, the more I listen to those song, the more I hear MJ's voice, especially listening to them loudly or with headphones on.  Overall, I love the album, have listened to it all the from since the time I had it.    Rating: *******

Go get on a treadmill. One cookbook doesn't need to please everyone - just a select few that enjoy the sensual taste of freshly made, classic good food.<br /><br />The end.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|If you are reading this, you are already a fan of Andrea Bocelli's marvelous voice. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across this DVD--I purchased the \\"My Christmas\\" CD when it first came out in 2009 (and have played it dozens of times during the past year), but since I do not watch television, I did not realize that Bocelli's excellent selection of Christmas-themed music was broadcast on PBS as a concert presentation (similar in content to his CD, but includes more music than the CD), produced by the incomparable David Foster.     The same outstanding level of musicianship, staging, video, and audio that went into the two previous Bocelli/Foster PBS-broadcast concerts (one at Lake Las Vegas (\\"Under the Desert Sky\\") and the other in Italy (\\"Live in Tuscany\\"), and both released on DVD--the Tuscany concert is also available on Blu-ray Disc) are evident in this wonderful Christmas concert.  Again, Bocelli performs duets with some of the greatest names in the music world, including Natalie Cole, Reba McEntire, and even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Bocelli sings effortlessly in Italian ,English, French, and even German. There is even a surprisingly entertaining \\"Jingle Bells\\" segement with the Muppets--very amusing (it successfully avoids being overly cute)! The accompanying orchestra is simply breathtaking, simply a joy to see and hear. There are also several excellent choral groups that further enhance and add variety to the concert. There are numerous set/costume changes to keep things interesting.     But the video and the audio--WOW!  I almost did not purchase this concert, because it was only a DVD--I have been spoiled by the excellent video/audio that one comes to expect from high definition transfers.  Since there is no current Blu-ray release planned for this concert (as of Dec. 15 2010),  I decided to take a risk and buy it.  Yes--it is somewhat pricey for a DVD--but it is worth every penny. I have a 55-inch Samsung 3-D ready, LED (240 Hz) high definition television (and played on a higher-end Samsung Blu-ray Disc player) and I am very picky about the video quality of what I view.      I could not believe that I was viewing \\"only a DVD\\"--the transfer and the \\"up-conversion\\" offered by my Blu-ray player are absolutely flawless! The level of detail was surprising--I could see every whisker on Bocelli's face and the textures of the Christmas trees and the musical instuments were razor sharp. The whites in the snow (in the \\"White Christmas\\" scence) and the black levels were perfect. My surround-sound system also got a good workout. If you are balking at purchasing this concert (like I was) because you are uncertain of the video/audio quality--you have nothing to worry about.  A future Blu-ray version of this concert will likely sharpen things up a bit--but not by much, since the DVD already looks and sounds so good. You will not be disappointed. I bought this concert two weeks ago and my family and I have already watched it three times. It is already a classic at my house.    Also, there is a 30-minute (or so) \\"making of\\" bonus extra that is quite interesting. Included are interviews with all of the performers (including David Foster and the various choral groups), and some of the fun that the performers had with each other and the audience (the concert took place at the beautiful and cavernous Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles) during the production/staging of the concert. The concert was not broadcast live due to the numerous set & costume changes. Highly recommended concert!

0062020897|3.0|I read this book after reading Pillars of the Earth, with the idea that I would like Ken Follet's stuff.  This book was a let down for me and I did not even finish the last 20 pages (believe it) as I could just see the ending coming....ho hum.  I think it is probably exciting for most readers (as evidenced by a high average rating) but I found it to be too formulaic and not well developed.  I did like the historical aspects of the novel.  Just not for me I guess.
B001U88814|4.0|I can only review on the packaging and shipping, considering this is a gift for my father. It arrived about a week after I purchased. Came in a large CROCS labeled plastic bag. Everything looks great, the shoe looks nice an comfy. the only thing was that it looked as though the shoes had been kept in storage for a while. Bag was a bit dusty but no biggy. The shoe itself looks as described. Would recommend.

This out of the 50 or so Blu ray movies sets apart from every other movie; makes me wonder why other Blu Ray's are not as good!  Even Avatar has nothing on sharpness, color and detail; absolutly awesome on a 55\\" Pano Plasma.     The story line / script and charachters will defintely be timeless, in terms of value.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|I purchased this movie after someone recommended it to me. They made their recommendation based on the amazing digital effects.  However, the story is basically a propaganda film, trying to make children believe that capitalism is ruining earth and that pollution could become such a problem that earth is uninhabitable. It's too bad that Disney has decided to buy into the liberal idea that companies don't care about people or the enviroment.     Besides that I found the movie rather boring, since the robots don't really talk to each other, and most of the scenes are brown or grey. Spend your money on something else.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie -- cinematograpy is excellent. It is about 3 hours long and as Lyndon's life is going down hill, the pace of the film slows. I loved the accurachy of the music as he arrives in Prussia -- the piece had already been written in the 18th century.
B004BSIJ9Q|2.0|Okay...to all those who believe that the music is whack...it's not, at least not entirely.  \\"Power\\", \\"Lost In A World\\", \\"All of the Lights\\", and \\"Dark Fantasy\\" had pretty amazing music.  The thing is Kanye fell under par for the music in some cases, or stayed on par with the other 10 whack tracks on the CD.  I had high hopes for this album.  I thought he might come out of the slum he was in and really give back to the people who loved the old Kanye.  What did he do instead?  He changed into a \\"monster\\"...one that follows the rest of the commercial b.s. and continues to buy into his own hype.  He;s not the person he used to be and it highly reflects in his music.  He's gotten so confident that it feels like he thinks he doesn't need to try on his music to impress people and still be a force in this industry.  The sad part is he doesn't need to because he definitely didn't try to deliver here and yet...4 and a half stars.  Don't buy it unless you find it for a $1 or $2.  Even then...you might as well upload it to your ipod and delete most of the songs.

But my Little sis never saw part one. We decided to go to a DVD rental, only they want a 200 $ Deposit even with membership. The Movie is good but not worth 200 $, It is a piece of Plastic with a production cost of less than 5 cent, so they do not have to wonder when people get copies.

I read through the first 100 pages or so including the section on fat-loss and have been following the program pretty strictly for 5 days. And I've lost 3-4 pounds already. This was one of those weight plateaus that I was having trouble breaking through, too.    I've also been following Tim and his blog for 3.5 years and I am amazed by the meticulous way he tests everything and/or brings in awesome experts to verify his findings/theories.     Highly recommended.    PS I also skipped to the orgasm chapters out of curiousity - very interesting :-) Have fun!

B003VBVQKS|5.0|Talk about your \\"sleepers\\"! It's almost taken 35 years for this Deep Purple release to find it's share of mass acceptance, however the 35th Anniversary Edition of \\"Come Taste The Band\\" shows that Purple was indeed alive and well following Ritchie Blackmore's 1975 departure. Replacement guitarist, the talented yet tragic Tommy Bolin, pretty much established a \\"Ritchie WHO?\\" attitude from the opening Echoplex blast on \\"Comin' Home\\", to the last fading solo notes of \\"You Keep On Moving\\".    Bolin's whiplash lasso funk chops on \\"Getting' Tighter\\" create an infectious swagger, but his lead guitar improvisations that conclude the song are flat out mind boggling. Obviously this release is a must-have for Bolin fanatics, but really it needs a second chance for long time steadfast Deep Purple and Whitesnake fans as well. Vocalist David Coverdale and drummer Ian Paice are at the top of their game, and even while Glenn Hughes and Bolin were both in a pattern of serious drug usage, the recorded tracks on \\"Come Taste The Band\\" are all unquestionably brilliant.    Of particular note here is the second CD featuring the entire album remixed and re-sequenced by Kevin Shirley, who also recently worked with Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa on their Black Country Communion project. Shirley's new mix brings every last detail and nuance of the \\"Come Taste The Band\\" sessions to the surface, and the presence of additional and alternate tracks, especially of Bolin's guitar, are a delight. It's fun to hear some songs run to the end of the tape also! It's like the train runs right off the track! Completely off the rails is the bonus song titled \\"Bolin/Paice Jam\\"... it's too bad MORE studio moments like this weren't captured on tape!    Keyboardist Jon Lord is also pulled into the new mix, which was a common criticism upon the original album's release. Lord's honky tonk piano solo on \\"Comin' Home\\" and Hammond B3 on \\"Love Child\\" pour right out of the speakers, indeed enticing the listener to cometaste the band!

B003UESJHY|5.0|THE FIGHTER<br /><br />STARRING: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo, Jack McGee and Mickey O'Keefe<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson and Keith Dorrington<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: David O. Russell<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 17 December 2010<br />Review Date: 11 December 2010<br /><br />I wonder if Christian Bale knows he's going to win the Oscar for best supporting actor. I sure do. His portrayal in The Fighter, of a crack-head who still knows the art of boxing in and out regardless of how messed up he is, was flawless and groundbreaking. There's no doubt in my mind he'll win, let alone be nominated. He lost an impressive amount of weight for the role and he steals the movie every bit as much as Heath Ledger stole The Dark Knight from him.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg stars as a Rocky-type underdog boxer from the Boston area, named Micky Ward. He doesn't have quite the loveable presence that Rocky had, but it's the supporting characters in his life that make this film amazing.<br /><br />Micky's crack-head brother Dicky is his trainer, and his chain smoking foul mouthed mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), is his manager. Picture the family in the other great boxing flick Million Dollar Baby, who only cared about Hilary Swank's character's money. Micky's mother and brother are kind of similar, only they know he can box, and they hold interests in his career primarily because he's their cash machine.<br /><br />The poor schmuck that Micky is, he's too nice to stand up to them and seek a new management team. When he meets Charlene (Amy Adams) however, she ignites something in him that drives him. She shows him what it is to have someone care for him regardless of his profession. This is perhaps the missing element that was holding him in place as a good fighter, rather than a great one.<br /><br />We've seen a lot of the things in this film before, but they are handled with artistic originality and The Fighter isn't just another boxing movie. It's about family, relationships, dreams and life choices. And don't get me wrong, it's got a lot of boxing in the mix too.<br /><br />Let's just talk about boxing for a minute. There's something very cinematic about it, isn't there? I don't even like boxing all that much, but I love boxing movies. It's easily my favorite genre of sports movie. Maybe it's the notion of one guy that we care about, taking brutal punches to the face. When we match-cut that with the obstacles he faces outside the ring - now we have two very dramatically entertaining elements streaming together throughout the course of the film. So naturally when our hero kicks butt and tackles all his demons outside the ring - we enjoy seeing him physically smash the last one to pieces inside the ring, in the climactic match that all boxing films must have.<br /><br />The Fighter's version of this is one of the best I've seen. Right up there with Rocky, Rocky II and Million Dollar Baby.  Micky moves in the ring like we've never seen a fighter do before, and he dishes out some awesome combination jabs that shatter our ribs. As cool as that was, the boxing scenes aren't even the film's strongest moments.<br /><br />The dialogue is so well tailored to the Boston crowd, that we feel like we grew up there, even if we didn't. I saw this with a good pal of mine from Boston, and he told me \\"this is exactly how it is.\\" While it's rough around the edges, and more vulgar than a battleship full of sailors, it's entertaining. Watching these characters interact with one another didn't just showcase some of the best acting of the year; they were some of the year's best SCENES period. And it's just people talking!<br /><br />Exactly how much of this is tied directly to the true story of which it's based, I'm not sure. And I don't care. Director David O. Russell, who also gave us Three Kings, has made a perfect film that will do well at the Oscars, to include possible nominations by Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. The Fighter is a film that no one really saw coming and just like a good boxer; it will knock moviegoers off their feet.just like a good boxer; it will knock moviegoers off their feet.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|As I was trying to enlarge my Beatles collection I had forgotten that their earlier stuff really rocked and this album is a prime example of that!
B00192IV9U|5.0|Excellent album.  Critics need to stop comparing this to Thriller and Off the Wall.  Nothing can compare to those albums.  Out of all of the releases out, this album is solid and deserves a listen.
B004132HZS|5.0|Dragging Sherlock Holmes into the 21st Century? A big risk, but they succeed beyond belief, and the Great Detective is more fun and relevant than ever in this mini-series of three 90-minute films. Aficionados will love all the subtle nods to Doyle and the original stories, but it's startling how easily the canon slides into 2010 settings and technology. Jeremy Brett? Basil Rathbone? Debates over the best Sherlock ever now must include Benedict Cumberbatch, whose chemistry with the new Dr. Watson (Martin Freeman) is spot-on. I own the complete Granada TV series with Jeremy Brett and considered it the best-ever dramatization of Doyle's stories, but now that this Masterpiece Mystery BBC series has been renewed for a 2011 season, I believe Cumberbatch and Freeman will surpass their prececessors, if they haven't already. The premiere \\"Study in Pink\\" is the best of the 3 initial films, acting is superb and the injection of humor delicious.
0060589469|5.0|I wanted to quit reading it but couldn't stop reading it at the same time. Pirsig has lots of opinions. He presents his lofty ideas in a fictional story format, thus avoiding the criticism that normally comes when presenting ideas in a peer-reviewed format.  However, ultimately, his book profoundly changed the way I think and see the world, or whatever. I recommend giving it a gander.  One huge take-away that I can remember was his distinction between classical (intellectual) and romantic (non-intellectual) modes of thinking. I'm not sure what I make of that idea anymore, but it affected me deeply. But I really had to just force through some of the less agreeable, more arguable of his ideas.
B00192IV9U|5.0|There are some awesome songs on this LP! The song with Kravitz is my favourite. This LP is well produced! I see some grammys on the horizon!
B0048IMZMG|1.0|This album is just more of the same teenage angst from the queen of Autotone. Perhaps the 10 pounds of make-up she wears hampers her ability to actually hit a note without computer assistance. Maybe she'll learn more than three cords in 2011 and actually write an interesting song. Nahhhh.

0385342047|2.0|I normally LOVE Sophie Kinsella, Twenties Girl was great, and I love the Shopaholic Series, but this turn was just.....UGH. The child is a monstrous brat, there is nothing cute or funny about her over the top, spoiled, grasping and just plain old bad behavior.  The most revolting thing is that her mother refuses to reign her in and even encourages her bad behavior.  The ridiculous cheapness of Becky's half sister is a bit too much also. Normally, I tear through her books in about a day, I couldn't even finish this one it was so off putting.  Please, either make Becky grow up and get some sense or just let it go.

B003WTE886|5.0|I'll tell you how good this CD is. When I listened through, I said to myself \\"Self, this is going to win a lot of Grammies\\". The last time I said that to myself was when I first listened to Tina Turner's \\"Private Dancer\\" ,which, by the way, DID win a lot of Grammies. The bottom line is the girl can write and rock. She may not have the ultimate vocal chops among all the current divas and wannabees, but she sounds damn good and delivers her material impeccably - you might call her an overachiever. The production is top-notch throughout. I have a lot of favorites on this CD, but my tops are \\"Back to December\\", \\"Revenge\\", \\"The Story of Us\\", and the title track. Keep up the good work, Taylor.
044654146X|5.0|The Economist once compared Japan to Argentina (then in the middle of a financial crisis) to figure out why Argentina was in a mess. They came to the conclusion that while Japan had technology corporations, Argentina relied on mining, industry, cattle, and state-owned enterprises. That meant Japan had more flexibility, while Argentina had no room to maneuver. Japan, famous for having zero natural resources, was rich, while Argentina, with good its natural resources, was poor!    When your country's enterprises are state-owned, there isn't much initiative to improve anything (why invent something if the patent isn't going to be yours?) But In Israel, everything is privatised, so it was easier to raise capital and make quick changes. For instance, Israel's combat aircraft are all made by an independent corporation, free from government interference. You don't have to wait for the government to debate the details in a committee!

0786955570|1.0|I really have to disagree with most of these reviews on this game. Its a very difficult game to play with 2 players and even with 5 it still is. My family and I sat down and played this for 4 hours. The game was poorly written, loop holes everywhere and vague rules. Your always trying to stay alive every time you move and even when you don't move you are at risk of losing points. Its just really frustrating and you don't even get to enjoy the game. We had fun though at making jokes about how we were going to die each round. But that's about it, when we won the game we were just glad it was over. I wouldn't buy this.
031603438X|5.0|Have been listning to the Stones since I was a kid in my basement. \\"Life\\" has brought my many thoughts and feelings about the Stones into a much clearer perspective.

B001S33D1G|4.0|Remember that old TLC song \\"Waterfalls\\"?  Oh, poor Coraline; had she only listened. . .     Coraline is the only child of parents probably not unlike yours and mine.  They are busy, working people who sometimes forget that a child needs to be engaged and interacted with.  Coraline has a touch of loneliness and is gobsmacked with boredom.  She is sick and tired of the grown-up people around her talking around her and not with her, of them telling her to go and occupy herself.  Like any child (and more than a few grown-ups), Coraline goes in search of an adventure, of something new in her life, and so she sneaks an old key from her mother that belongs to an old door that leads to nowhere in her new home.  Except that one day, it does.  Coraline is delighted at first, but just like Alice and Dorothy before her, realizes that there is no place like home, for that is truly where the heart is.    This was my first Gaiman, and after reading Coraline, I certainly will be back for more.  The book was a creepy tale of adventure and hard lessons learned.  The fright factor is such that it is completely appropriate for children, but I think adults will gain just as much from it.  The most wonderful thing about Gaiman's writing style is that every word is truly used - there are no superfluous adages in his storytelling.  Consequently, the story never drags and keeps a brisk pace.     Central to the book is the development of Coraline's sense of family and the importance of her parents in her life, and hers in theirs.  Coraline also learns about the importance of courage, commitment to others, understanding and tolerance of others, that appearances can be deceiving, and that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  This is a simple book, but a grand adventure - it's a perfect story to make a part of your family's Halloween tradition.

030746363X|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I'm not going to claim that the book is perfect or earth-shattering or anything like that. I did find it entertaining to read all the stuff Tim Ferriss put himself through. I've also benefited from some of his recommendations (though not all). Here's what's in the book so you can make your own decision. I've read all 571 pages and tried most of the strategies (I had my copy for a while because I got my hands on an advanced copy).    Ferriss spent more than a decade researching, monitoring, and noting the progress of his own mind and body. He served as his own laboratory genea pig and also played the role of a doctor, physical therapist, and coach to prepare for this book. Like a school boy, Ferris teaches you how to get your classwork done fast so you can go out and play. He asks you to be skeptical of the book and try only that which you think will help you.    Here's what's in it:    Chapter 1: Fundamentals--First And Foremost    * Ferriss describes the \\"Mininum Effective Dose\\" (doing the bare minimum to gain the most desired outcome).     Chapter 2: Ground Zero--Getting Started and Swaraj    * Uses Mahatma Gandhi reference to make the case that only we can govern our body and destiny by what we purposely choose to do.    Chapter 3: Subtracting Fat    Five rules for cutting body fat:  1. Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates  2. Eat the same few meals over and over again  3. Don't drink calories  4. Don't eat fruit  5. Take one day off per week    * The Lost Art of Bingeing: Specific steps to minimize fat gain while splurging     Chapter 4: Adding Muscle    * Building the Perfect Posterior  * Ferriss turns the table for readers who wish to gain weight by offering strategies on how to gain 34 pounds in 28 days with exercises like the Occam's Protocoli, the Bike-Shed Effect, and GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day).    Chapter 5: Improving Sex    * Ferriss tells a story about a promise he made to a female yoga instructor who have never experienced an orgasm in herlife that he \\"would fix her inability to orgasm\\"  * the women has to bring herself \\"there.\\"  * men need to change the angle and pressure during penetration.    * The 15-min Female Orgasm  1. Explain to partner that you will touch her  2. Get into position  3. Find the Upper-Quadrant Point of the Clitoris, and Stroke Lightly--for 15 minutes.    Chapter 6: Perfecting Sleep    How to Fall Asleep Faster:  * Focus on getting to sleep  * 67ºF to 70ºF is the best room temperature to fall asleep  * Eat a large fat-and protein-dominated meal 3 hours before bedtime  * Use low light in the bedroom  * Take a cold bath an hour before bed  * Use a humidifier to generate cool mist  * Try to sleep in the half-military crawl position    How to Sleep Less and Feel Great  * Learn how to manipulate the sleep cycle to stay in REM sleep longer   * Take frequent 20-min naps throughout the day    Chapter 7: Reversing Injuries    * The $10,000 Fix: Ferriss cured his \\"permanent\\" injuries by receiving a concoction of chemicals (i.e. Platelet-rich plasma, Stem cell factor, Bone morphogenic proteint-7, Insulin-like growth factor 1) via injection.      The Cheaper Fix in Stages:  * Stage 1: Movement  * Stage 2: Manipulaiton  * Stage 3: Medication  * Stage 4: Surgery    Chapter 8: Running Faster and Farther    * Jumping Higher: Joe DeFranco, a renowned trainer of the NFL Scouting Combine, worked with Ferriss on his shoulder drive, arm position before the jump, squat stance and hip flexors that allowed Ferriss to jump vertically three inches higher in 48 hours.  * Running Faster: Joe DeFranco also coached Ferriss on how to run the 40-yard dash faster by correcting Ferriss's line-and-arm position at the start line. Ferriss was advised to keep his head down, his knee head of his toes, chin tucked and upper body head of lower body, and to take few steps. Ferriss improved his 40-yard dash by .33 seconds in 48 hours.  * Running Further: Ferriss trains by running 400-meter repeatedly (over and over again) while monitoring quantity of repeats, maximum effort percentage, and rest time. Ken Mierke, a world-champion triathlete helped Ferriss with his stride rate, lean position, and arm movement. With preparation, biomechanics, and training, Ferriss was able to increase his running distance of 5K to 50K in 12 weeks.     Chapter 9: Getting Stronger  The gems in this chapter to become stronger as experimented by Ferriss include:  * Dynamic stretching  * Bench press, push-ups, deadlift to knees  * Static Stretching  * Keep \\"time under tension\\" while lifting under 10 seconds to avoid muscle burn.  * \\"Lift heavy but not hard\\"  * Keep training times (day or night) consistent.     Chapter 10: From Swimming to Swinging  * Ferriss learned how to swim effortlessly within 10 days  * How to swing a bat like Babe Ruth  * How to hold breath longer Houdini, and David Blaine    Chapter 11: On Longer and Better Life  * Take 5-10 grams of Creatine Monohydrate per day  * Fasting and Protein Cycling  * Donate blood    My biggest criticism is the book didn't do enough with the mind part. For that, you might want to read [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]. That book did a great deal for my mind.
B004498KPU|1.0|Music videos we have all seen already; The one dvd has \\"Hold My Hand.\\" In my opinion, Sony has disrespected MJ's memory, BIG TIME! That music video doesn't have anything new with MJ, just clips from old concerts.  If you want to see anything new with MJ, forget this one.  MJ didn't do any music videos for several years.  This mess will prove that.  Keep your money!  You'll get more entertainment from the \\"Gone Too Soon,\\" documentary on dvd right now.  It's a Region 4 dvd. You can't play it on dvd players in the U.S., but you can play it on your computer. Purchased from a dvd store in Austrailia.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I think this is his best album yet.  I have read other reviews on here and I have to say that to be a true artist you must be willing to take risks and spread your wings and fly and he has.  He has grown with each album.  A true artist is willing to experiment.  If you stay the same, then the music will sound alike and be boring to the listener.  I fell in love with this album the first time I heard it.  The lyrics especially I can relate to.  I really appreciate his music because it has gotten me through some tough times in my life.  I cannot say there is one bad song on this album.  I think it is truly great.  He will only grow as an artist.  Way to go Josh :)
B000MKXEME|5.0|This is mentioned in the product details, but bears repeating: this is the same NOT RATED version 2 DVD set with extras as the special release that comes with the  glowing green \\"hypodermic\\" highlighter.<br /><br />If you really don't need the highlighter, you can save a few bux with this version.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|The first copy of the special edition of Avatar would not advance past the first 43 minutes of the second disc. An examination of the disc show no flaws in the read side of the disc. I was afraid that my DVD player had lost it's \\"mind\\". But after playing a different DVD, I determined that the disc was the problem. I obtained a return order from the Amazon web site and returned the entire 3 disc set for a replacement. The replacement arrived within 5 days. Amazon was quite gracious in sending me a replacement before they received the bad set of DVD discs.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|Total disappointment. No plot, no redeeming characters, no ending. A bunch of not so nice characters mysteriously land on a planet and are hunted by some ugly creatures seemingly for the fun of it. Ends with 2 left and looks like no way out. Stayed to the end but really wasn't one. Skip it - not worth even sending back and forth to Netflix.
1582701709|1.0|The name was \\"The Secret\\". It was supposed to be a motivational book, movie and then a CD of the soundtrack. I had heard many, many people talk about \\"The Secret\\". I just had to get a copy of this thing to see if it was all it was cracked up to be. After I read the book and watched the movie, it was clear to me that the person who wrote this did not have a clue about what they were talking about. Secret? It is no secret that your attitude can play a big role in what happens to you in your life. That is a given. What she failed to take into consideration was things like other people, special situations, locality and just plain old dumb luck.    No matter how much you want something and believe it, it won't happen without motivation. Have you ever heard the saying \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" Well, that is one of the major things this person failed to take into consideration; Helping yourself. If you sit on the couch and simply believe that things will happen, you will probably die there, and nothing else will have happened. Hard work and dedication can help to make thing happen.     There are places in these two publications that say something to the affect that if it did not happen for you and you did not get what you wanted, you didn't want it enough. Bull, if you want it enough you will get up off your duff and do something about it.    There is a certain amount of luck, education and other considerations that will also help. For instance, let's suppose that you would like to own a major pizza place such as Dominos or Pizza Hut. Sit down on the couch and start thinking about owning one of them. I mean really think hard and long about it. Guess what? Nothing will happen. You might go out and apply at one of the pizza places and get a job delivering pizza, or, if you have enough education and experience you may get on as a supervisor or manager. But let's be realistic here. Wishing won't do it.     Anyone who believes any of the information in the book or the movie has got to have a screw loose or something. If wishing would have gotten it, I would have owned Microsoft years ago. We all know who the person is who owns that and he didn't get it by wishing.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is one of my top-5 films of ALL TIME!  This movie makes you think and pay close attention, all the while being blown away by truly amazing special effects.  I highly recomend this film to everyone.
B00192IV9U|4.0|First, let me state that I have proudly been a fan of Michael Jackson since Dec. 14, 1969 when he and his brothers made their very first TV appearance on the \\"Ed Sullivan Show\\".  So, being a veteran fan for that many years, I know his voice when I hear it.  So those buffoons out there saying that the Cascio recordings are not his voice, had best clean out their ears, or go get their hearing checked.      With my having been exposed to certain posthumous releases in my lifetime before, surprisingly I find \\"Michael\\" a refreshing change of pace.  Controversy over the Cascio recordings aside, I enjoy the music contained on this release.  Many noteworthy recordings on this CD are:  \\"Hold My Hand\\" the stunning and beautiful duet w/ Akon, \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" which is brings back some memories of the song \\"Heal the World\\", \\"The Way You Love Me\\" in my opinion is a wonderful \\"sequel\\" to \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Another Day\\" another duet featuring Lenny Kravitz, \\"Monster\\" w/ 50 Cent, the lovely heartwrenching ballad \\"Much Too Soon\\", and the outright (pardon my witchy self here but...) WICKEDLY AWESOME \\"Behind the Mask\\".    In my honest opinion, I feel that \\"Monster\\" in many ways is a viable and understandable \\"sequel\\" to Michael's undeniably eternal fan favorite, \\"Thriller.\\"  As for the controversial \\"Breaking News\\", well... I for one, LOVE it!!!  And yes... it IS Michael's voice.  Let me say this although... the reason I adore \\"Breaking News\\" is because whenever I think of Michael Jackson, this song reflects it all!  The hysteria... the madness... the highs and lows... the ultimate price he had paid for his fame.  This song as much as Michael wrote it to take a jab at the press who stalked him throughout his life, and often wrote some horrid things about him, was equally written with his veteran fans in mind who did the unthinkable by remaining loyal to him in spite of it all.  After all... we veterans remember and most importantly, we KNOW!  We experienced it all right with him.  We lived it.  For the younger/newer Michael fans, it's a crash course and history lesson into all things Michael Jackson.  I'll leave it at that.  The only song, I sadly think that falls a tad flat is \\"Best of Joy\\".  I'm sorry, but I just am not crazy about this song, and I'm likely to skip over it.    Now, for my rating system.  Are you ready?  I'm giving \\"Michael\\" 4 stars.  It's not \\"Thriller\\" for sure, but it's certainly the best release in my opinion that MJ has had since \\"Dangerous.\\"
0553381687|3.0|This book is like eating a triple chocolate cake with fudge frosting - dense, delicious, and a little goes a long way.  I ate my way through ½ the book, savoring the interwoven story lines, but the last half was a little hard to swallow.  The dearth of humor was like not having any milk to wash down the over-large piece of cake.<br /><br />G.R.R. Martin creates a world rich with history and families so real that it feels as if you're coming in half way through the story. The grittiness of medieval life is dusted with a sheen of the magical and mystical.  For the most part the magic blends in well but there are a few jarring notes.  While A Game of Thrones is an amazing world, G.R.R. Martin keeps the glass between you and the characters - you're allowed a peek into their lives but you can't really laugh or cry with them.<br /><br />Fundamentally I think AGOT is a good book but I will not be reading the rest of the series.  After 800 pages I don't feel emotionally vested in any of the characters and in the end it felt more like reading an interesting but humorless history book.

0765326353|5.0|I'm a fan of Robert Jordan, George RR Martin, Tolkien, Lewis, etc. But out of ALL of them, let me just say that Sanderson has got a TRUE gift. I was completely engrossed in this book and the characters. I could NOT put it down. I read for 2 complete days...minimal food, sunlight and hygiene, but oh my lord it was worth it. As with Mistborn, I found this novel to be a complete breath of fresh air. New cultures, creatures, races are introduced that I have never seen before. The characters are always dynamic and for the most part, sympathetic. There are no clear black and whites and his book leaves you thinking. Also, he's the only author which I've read that consistently keeps me guessing. I cannot WAIT for the next installment and I'm sure he'll release at least 3 more of this series before Martin comes out with A Dance with Dragons. :)

030746363X|5.0|The is a bold step for Tim Ferris and a great way for him to showcase another passion that was not fully explored in his 'The Four Hour Workweek.\\" - And while the title holds a \\"Life-Hacker\\" guide to a fit body, this book is far from that. The brand was so strong there could be no other name. Heck it will take a lot more than 4 hours just to read the book. And that is something that must be said about this book. It is not meant to be read from cover to cover. It is really a recipe book on fitness. And the diet world is a commodity of books telling us the same thing in effect. Eat less / Move More wrapped up in new formulas with cool words.     This is NOT what we see here with The For Hour Body. You can see after a few reads Tim Ferris is a man obsessed probably more with perfect health than he was with the perfect  lifestyle in the first book. This is not a book that was Tim's opportunity to \\"crush\\" it in another niche because he was hounded by his publisher. It is clear to me that when Tim sets out to do something he says \\"If I can not put my life into this I will not do it.\\" And he also says \\"If I can not be the best in the world at something I have no reason to be in the game.\\" Anyone following Tim on his blog the last few years as well as Youtube so a man that to his own body to the test. Not so much to prove fads to be fads or expose diet scams, but rather the constant pursuit of perfect health with an open mind. Sometimes finding out things that did not work and putting others to the test and finding some results of things that seemed odd at first look. And it did not stop with just him Tim worked with doctors, scientists a nutritionists, and trainers and logged and documented results.     Many of the things would work but may not be for everyone's life style. And that is what is interesting about this book. It is, as Tim says, more like a COOK-BOOK. Like a cookbook, you find recipes that you like, some you don't some you hate, and some you love. You combinethat with Tim's natural writing style and you come across with a very good book. Many may find some of the things controversial but get any 2 personal trainers in the same room and one will call the other a quack. We have all seen it.    Here is why you should by this book. We all know health matters so it is not for me to sell that point. But, moving beyond eat less / move more... you get (as the book says) an uncommon guide to a healthier you. If you are looking for the same old same old. This is not for you. If you are looking for part 2 to the Four hour work week this is not it. But, if you are like me and have an open mind and like to be able to open a book at any point, start reading and say, \\"Wow, that seems cool let me try that for a week and see if it works for me, and if it does I will keep doing it.\\", then this book is definitely for you.    It is a great book for me. I started working out recently with a personal trainer. And I think what I like most about this book is it makes me an expert is silly stuff that I can run by my trainer and have him tell me I am nuts and say 'What did you read that in some book?\\" - Those make for some funny conversations but guess what. I think I may just prove him wrong and let him take all the credit.
B000JQUKKU|1.0|This review is of the free version of the story.    Overall, a very disappointing read. The story is superb, probably the best Christmas story other than the story of Christmas itself, but the formatting is outright horrible. No effort was put into proper conversion from print to ebook. It was literally scanned with text recognition and exported to HTML. There are characters that display incorrectly because they are just 'typed' and are not the correct code. The page numbers from the print version are randomly scattered through the text, making it very hard to read. There are no page breaks, no table of contents, and absolutely no formatting whatsoever. Some text is in caps, other text in bold, you know where I'm going. Download it and see for yourself.    You are better off spending $.99 on a decently formatted version of this story. I have tried a sample of several versions and this one has left me fairly happy [[ASIN:B004G08Z5M A Christmas Carol]], as it looks to be very professionally done(Embedded cover, active table of contents, page-breaks, appropriate 'stave' headings, etc. I imagine it will be the same way throughout the book). Will buy it soon.
0321704452|5.0|This is an excellent book with deeper content than the book I've been supplying with my presentation classes: Presentation Zen. This book gets more to the matter of presenting than simply making a nice set of slides. In fact, as indicated in the title, it's about making a great presentation with or WITHOUT slides. I wish more people would understand that point! Perhaps this book will be the turning point in a world of death by bullets.<br /><br />Again, the focus is on PRESENTATION, not slides. So if you're looking for a \\"how to make a pretty presentation\\" book, this is not it. If you want to learn presentation from an expert, this is the book.<br /><br />Here's the punchline. There's nothing revolutionary in this book. In fact, you've heard much of the material before. However, the material is presented in a clear, readable, even relaxing format that will remind and reinforce what you already know but need to practice. And that's what I like most about this book: it reminds us of what we need to practice! Too often presenters slip back to graphs and bullet lists. LET GO OF WORDS AND MAKE A POWERFUL POINT.<br /><br />Wow, glad to get that off my chest!  Buy the book. 200 pages makes it less than 10 cents a page!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and you can keep your clothes on.<br /><br />Chris Reich<br />Presentation Instructor

If you have been in a confusiuon about the state of the US and the world this is the movie for you.     If you want to see well and faithfully portrayed white collar criminals in action and under investigation on the Public Media this movie is for you.    There may be many other byways in this story not covered in this brilliant movie, but if you pay close attention (or better yet, buy it'S DVD and watch it many times), you may gain considerable relief in understanding how you may have been in similar company in your life and exactly how certain criminal speech sounds when being committed and thus overcome the bait to avoid becoming a victim or to be able to prove to others the nature of the scam and thus protect them from harm.

B003OF3R0S|4.0|I ended up buying Nightmare the first week of its release and was both thrilled and disappointed with it at the same time.<br />My expectations for Nightmare were very high, despite not really enjoying the title track and lead-off single all that much when I first heard it on the radio. Even after spinning this album dozens of times, I still do not have much appreciation for the title track. I feel like its riffs are all pretty boring, and while it's obviously a fun song for the band (watch them perform it live, you'll know what I mean), I can't help but feel like it exceeds \\"fun\\" and ends up being more cheesy than intended. On a more positive note, though, the chorus is absolutely infectious.<br /><br />Following the subpar title track is \\"Welcome to the Family,\\" a swift-paced rocker with its own ultra-catchy chorus. \\"Danger Line\\" enters next with Portnoy's snares. The guitars on this song are top-notch, but I don't feel like Shadows sounds very inspired until the last section of vocals. Once the piano kicks in and Shadows slows things down you can really hear the emotion in his voice. Gates follows this part of the song with a very simple yet very effective solo. \\"Buried Alive\\" continues this slower pace with a cool guitar harmony and some calmer verses. While this song contains a lot of elements I really enjoy, I feel like it is pretty average overall. There's just too much going on with it, plus a number of the riffs are fairly boring.<br /><br />The fifth track, \\"Natural Born Killer,\\" is one of the fastest and heaviest songs on the album. It leads off with a blistering riff and goes straight into headbang-mode from there. Shadows sounds especially good on this one. Next up is \\"So Far Away,\\" a haunting ballad about the Rev which is filled with emotion. Gates lets loose another simple solo near the end that works perfectly underneath Shadows's vocals. For all you City of Evil fans, get this: \\"So Far Away\\" blows \\"Seize the Day\\" out of the water.<br /><br />Enter \\"God Hates Us.\\" This one starts off with an eerie intro that erupts into an absolute slaughter of riffage and sick, screeching guitars. Shadows reverts to screaming for much of the song, which is a definite plus in my book, and the rest of the band pound away on their respective instruments long enough for me to wreck my neck. Another ballad, \\"Victim,\\" succeeds \\"God Hates Us.\\" This is easily my least favorite track on the album. There's nothing too exciting going on with \\"Victim,\\" and I don't feel like it is nearly as emotional as the other ballads on the album. On top of that, it's seven and a half minutes long.<br /><br />\\"Tonight the World Dies\\" is a step up from \\"Victim\\" but is also similar in style. It, too, is a ballad with lyrical content presumably about the Rev, yet Shadows sounds much more sincere here and sings to his full potential. While not one of my favorites on the album, \\"Tonight the World Dies\\" is still a very solid track.<br /><br />Now we get to the sweet part of the album. \\"Fiction,\\" the last song written for the album and the last song written by the Rev, is unique in that the music is made up almost entirely of keyboards. Shadows sounds decent on this track, but its real value is that it contains the Rev himself on vocals. The section he sings right in the middle is enough to bring me to tears no matter how many times I listen to it. After the keyboards conclude eerily in funeral-hym fashion, we are launched into the eleven minute epic, \\"Save Me.\\" To quote a friend, \\"Save Me\\" is a menace. The guitars are simultaneously demented and melodic, and forty-five seconds into this masterpiece the Rev gives us his send-off, growling the word \\"skull\\" before allowing Gates and Zachy to continue assaulting our ears. \\"Save Me\\" is not only one of the hardest hitting tracks on the album, but it is also the darkest and most sincere. There is no filler in this track; the entire song is captivating. To further the rest of the band's efforts, Portnoy lays down some absolutely brutal drumming. \\"Save Me\\" may just be the best song Avenged have recorded thus far in its existence.<br /><br />As a whole, I really enjoyed this album, though certain elements of it were a bit boring. My biggest problem with it was the arrangement of tracks. \\"Natural Born Killer\\" and \\"God Hates Us,\\" the two fastest, heaviest hitters on the album, are separated by a ballad. This confuses me, especially when two more ballads follow \\"God Hates Us.\\" Also confusing is the lack of screaming on every track besides \\"God Hates Us.\\" I feel as though there are spots throughout the album where a couple of screams could have added a lot both to the songs individually and the album as a whole. It would have helped it flow better, and specific sections of songs just seemed to beg for screaming, namely during the whispered section of \\"Welcome to the Family\\" and pretty much anywhere in \\"Save Me\\" for effect. While I don't feel Avenged gave us a five star effort with Nightmare, I've been able to listen to this album repeatedly and find enjoyment in it every time. Perhaps most importantly, they did the Rev justice.me absolutely brutal drumming. \\"Save Me\\" may just be the best song Avenged have recorded thus far in its existence.<br /><br />As a whole, I really enjoyed this album, though certain elements of it were a bit boring.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|While I enjoyed the whole concept of Avatar and Pandora and this version is done very well, any respect I had for John Cameron as person I totally lost when I found out the only way to get the blu ray 3-D version is to buy a Panasonic 3-D starter kit.  I guess he thinks he's not rich enough yet. I'm sure Panasonic gave him a deal he could not refuse. Recommend the movie, but as for Cameron, what a disappointment.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|This is a product let me down, because the other two discs this product actually is not very good subtitles, for this reason, I think the loss of the meaning of a Collector's Edition
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Product doesn't appear to be the remastered version like I ordered. It arrived broken. It was not sealed and had been opened but not closed properly which led to the breakage.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I already had the special edition DVD of the original version but I had to buy this. It is amazing. The blu-ray combined with the extra half an hour of video footage was great. I've watched this movie multiple times by now and can't wait to watch it again.
B003WTE886|4.0|Taylor Swift has really achieved new highs with this album.  It is a pleasure to see that a young women can achieve such success and greatness and not get skanky in the process.  This album will not disappoint you if you are a taylor fan.  C. West is not fit to carry her shoes!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I own the original series and movies and thought this would be a good addition to my collection. I love it. It is amazing. Watching this in blu-ray was just mind blowing. The visuals were stunning. I can't wait for the second one to come out. I will be buying it as soon as it does.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I just bought this album today..and it's been playing all day long.  Really, it's hard to believe Michael Jackson has been sitting on gems like \\"Much to soon\\", \\"Behind the mask\\" for 30 years.  Also it amazes me to see after 40+ years in the business he still had plenty to offer.  Songs like \\"Hollywood tonight\\", \\"Best of Jow\\", \\"Breaking news\\" \\"I like the way you love me\\" are great addition to his already impressive catalogue.     To new artists, the secret is in the melodies.  It is always good to hum along your favourite song.    I HIGHLY recommend this CD.  I love it so much I bought 4 more as stoking stuffers for my friends & family.      Take a listen to \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" or \\"Behind the mask\\"...or \\"Monster\\" and i dare you not to hum along or tap your feet after the first verse.
B0046JLTCE|5.0|I already owned the original CD but I had to get this. Let me tell you, it was well worth it. The extra CD and DVD are awesome. The documentary is very fun to watch. Also, the poster that comes with it is awesome.
B004132I20|5.0|SHERLOCK is an intelligent, inventive and witty update of the classic stories.  It utilizes modern technology, but doesn't depend upon it to carry the well written adaptations.  The actors are first rate, as is usual with British productions.  A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF THE GREAT DETECTIVE!!!
B001LF347E|5.0|Admittedly, the show does start out slow, but the character development of the story, the quality of the performances, the realistic sets, and the interesting (and non-traditional) relationship between Merlin and Arthur make this series one of the BEST we've ever watched.  Our entire family LOVES it.  And we wait eagerly for the next installment!
1931788340|2.0|I'm not sure why the other reviewers called this a great quality book?  For an art book the printing is terrible. The two copies that I received both came with warped/bent pages throughout. The images are treated with a weak spot varnish that makes the photos look washed out lacking contrast and density. No fault of Amazon. Their service is great. They took back both copies. Maybe the publisher needs to do some QC with the printer. Too bad. Shores photographs are wonderful. Much too good for the mediocre printing.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I bought this album on the first day of release and I am so happy I did! I think this is a great album and the Michael Jackson Estate and all the producers did a wonderful job compiling it. My favorite song of the album is Best of Joy, which was recorded in 2009 and Michael was going to perform it during his This Is It shows in London. It is such a jewel of a song, it may seem quite simple, but it's so uplifting and warm, and you can actually hear Michael smiling when he's singing it. The whole album is classic Michael. I really love all the songs and can't stop listening to this wonderful album.     Thank you for your music, Michael!
B00192IV9U|5.0|Although Michael is not here to polish the tracks with his magic, this is the best we can get, and it's awesome! Much Too Soon & Best of Joy are my favorites! Such an amazing voice.
030746363X|4.0|First, don't be swayed, well how could you if you actually read the other reviews, but don't be swayed by the few giving low ratings because they think these reviews are somehow fake. Yes it's odd that over 100 positive reviews showed up so quickly, and on the day the book was released, but that attests to Tim's master marketing skills. Simply put, he sent out a ton of review copies, for free, as you couldn't buy them yet. I got one because I bought a bunch of his previous book more catered to productivity, outsourcing, time management and business. He then sent an e-mail to all those previewers and e-mailed them approximately one week after they got the preview copy and said, hey the book launched, here's the Amazon page if you'd like to leave a review...real people, who've really read the book with real breakdowns...most people I'm sure haven't even met Tim.<br /><br />Having said that, the book has a ton of practical advice you haven't applied in your life for everything physical you would want to do in an incredibly short time. If you have %9 of bodyfat already and are incredibly athletic with no injuries and are looking for a workout plan, you probably aren't going to get much out of this book. Okay, now that %3 of the population is out, the tips and tricks, and mental approach of this book is incredibly refreshing. Tim isn't an amazing writer, but he's an amazing experimenter and conveys measurable data very well. He's upfront that these tests haven't been mass tested over 10 years and thousands of people...and thats the point, this is the stuff we'll be hearing about 10 years from now. I'm on my second read through, adding notations in the large margins and seeing where I can improve my adherence to some of the methods for fat loss and muscle gain. That's not the only thing this book is about though, it's a hodge podge of actionable advice you get to mix and match for a better physical life. He's appropriately labeled is as finding what %2 change will make the biggest impacts on your life for the better. Sometimes its ridiculously simple, like don't eat X anymore, or drink cold water in the morning, other times it's spend $2000 so you can monitor this and change appropriately.<br /><br />Think about The 4 Hour Body more like a field manual than a new \\"do this regimen, it's the right one\\"...as I'm sure some of this stuff will have no effect on some people, and other things will change people's lives.<br /><br />I'm loving it.t impacts on your life for the better.

B00008ADPF|5.0|I listened to the radio the other day and oh lucky me it was satellite so they showed the artist.I immediately ordered the CD to see what this band was all about.My girlfriend actually had a couple of Nickelback songs downloaded so I got an early taste.I must say these boys write quality music great lyrics and they have tremendous power and energy.Being an old Metalhead I did not quite get into the grunge phase and bands after that even though these guys  do not belong in that era.Guess I missed out on a couple of good ones.Highly recommended.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Must have video documentary on the 2010 Crossroads Guitar festival.  Four hours of video and music recording many of the unique and wonderful performances and collaborations that took place during the 2010 festival.
1423101499|5.0|This book is the best in the 5 book series. The threat of Kronos gets nearer, and Percy, Annabeth, Grover get immersed into the Labyrynth. It seems Luke has come up with a way to attack Camp Half Blood, and it is through the intricate Labyrynth designed by daedalus. Riordan weaves a nice adventure, using points in Greek mythology expertly to tell the tale once again. The thing that makes this book a little better than the others is that it incorporates relationships more, there is a little more drama, and of course, there is a lot of action as well. You also get the real introduction to Kronos and how he plans to destroy the Gods.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|So I ended up reading the entire book and it was by far the best diet/self help book I have ever read. The points are all good and I feel like I am already healthier just doing a few of the things that he has recommended. I do wish that the perfect weightloss/muscle gain workout was on one page so that I could have it all but at that point im just nit picking.    Thanks Tim Great book!
0740797719|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moACR3NQKNS85H]]Color and Light is the latest book from James Gurney and it's fantastic. It is a very accessible guide that's filled with interesting and useful information on color and light. It's fortunate we have so many colors today at our disposable, and now with this book, something to help make sense of them.<br /><br />The book talks about color in a very practical sense, as you would see them in life. The lessons are observations of light and colors from James Gurney's years of painting experience. He brings his points across with his own beautiful paintings as examples, clearly explaining why and how he uses colors. It amazes me the amount of work James Gurney has created over the years, and this book is filled with them, from his plein-air to Dinopedia paintings.<br /><br />There are lessons on sources of light, light and form, understanding the color wheel, how light reacts with surfaces and other elements, and visual perception. You'll learn interesting things like why the moon looks blue, when happens to light when it travels through green canopy, tips on mixing colors, and a whole lot more. There are lots of tips and techniques included. The book is also well researched and I enjoy reading the history of color as they were used in the past by other artists.<br /><br />It's really a no-brainer to pick this up if you're into creating art, or even if you just want to check out the beautiful paintings in the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended reference. And you should also check out his other book [[ASIN:0740785508 Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist]].<br /><br />(There are some pictures of the book on my blog, just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B003INBNXO|5.0|I came across Ip Man while searching for new martial arts movies on the web.  I saw part two and thought it was okay.  I then looked for part one and thought it was the greatest!  the fight scenes and moves in this movie are amazing.  If you like the fighting in Iron Monkey, then you're gonna go 100X crazier over this movie.      Its slow relax movie, but shifts into a Jet Li \\"Unleashed\\" frenzy!  Where Ip Man truly shows just how much more he is the best to those who challenge him and shows how he has the best heart to those who challenge others.    GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!   OWN IT!!!!!!!

B0037KMHRY|4.0|Simply put, Daft Punk's music for 'Tron: Legacy' sets exactly the tone it should: vast, dark, dramatic, rhythmic, cinematic, and best of all, original.<br /><br />Daft Punk is known for experiments in electronic music, which might make you think that their score here is solely electronic noise in nature. This might fit the themes of the movie in its own way, but there's a lot more to it. The real surprise here is the level of symphonic music that is used, often fused with the electronic instruments, to create waves and rhythms at dramatic moments. I've heard this done before - most notably by Hybrid on their landmark album \\"Wide Angle\\" - but I've never heard it done quite like this.<br /><br />In terms of film music, we're on somewhat more familiar ground. The music for 'Tron: Legacy' is deep and rhythmic and pervasive. There is no simple, catchy hero's theme or menacing villain's cue here, which works to the benefit of the music (and, I expect, the film). Daft Punk instead follows the cue of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard in their Batman music. The pulsing waves of \\"Recognizer\\" sound much like something we might have heard in 'The Dark Knight,' but with just enough of a twist to keep it interesting. While listening to 'Tron: Legacy' for the first time, I also thought about the music of Cliff Martinez ('Solaris') or Clint Mansell ('Moon'), but again struck more by contrasts than by similarities. The music of 'Tron: Legacy' may have borrowed from the idea of other composers, but in Daft Punk's able hands those ideas went in different directions and the result is mostly original and stands up nicely on its own.<br /><br />The album is best listened to from beginning to end, but there are a few tracks that stand out from the pack. I have to admit to a little geeky thrill running up my spine when I heard Jeff Bridges' wonderfully rich voice narrating a few choice lines about \\"The Grid.\\" You can get your blood pumping to \\"The Game Has Changed,\\" feel the oppressive danger of the \\"Recognizer\\" and bring it to a fever pitch of panic with \\"Rectifier.\\" The steady, rising notes of \\"Solar Sailer\\" set a majestic tone while \\"Adagio for Tron\\" brings the emotional crescendo home.<br /><br />The truth is that the whole album is good, from the first track to the last. Daft Punk's score is a worthy successor to Wendy Carlos' music for the original 'Tron' for this simple reason: it's original. It fuses the electronic and the symphonic, uses what works and breaks some new ground - it excites the senses and flows naturally from the idea of the film.<br /><br />I only hope the movie is this good!

B00192IV9U|5.0|I'm from the U.K. Left a review there....but just had to say how ridiculous these so called fans are, that doubt the authenticity of these vocals. It's insane ! It's like sheep following sheep ! It all boils down to one thing...JEALOUSY !...towards the Cascio family. I've always followed EVERY Jackson member, but if it's true they started these rumours, then i lose a little respect for them, sadly.  Ignore the silly unfounded comments, and just enjoy what is an amazing album !
0316078913|1.0|This book is very dark humor. Not a light holiday read.  I have a rather extensive book collection and this book went straight to the recycle bin.  Not a keeper for me.
1439102813|5.0|This book was Excellent! I was so engrossed with the story I could not put the book down. You could almost identify with what Alice was experiencing. I embraced the characters, felt the husbands frustrations, the children's compassion for their mother especially when John wanted to take Alice to NY. The speech Alice gave at the convention was so moving it made you proud of her accomplishment. I didn't think she was capable of completing the talk but she did and it was amazing.  This book was by far outstanding!! Compliments to the author, can't wait to read her next book Left Neglected
B003EV6DBM|4.0|Let me start out by saying I'm a life-long Doctor Who fan.  Growing up in the 80s, Tom Baker was invariably my Doctor.  Then David Tenant came along and I changed my Doctors.      Enter Matt Smith.  I wouldn't call him a \\"great\\" (but probably better than Colin Baker or Sylvester McCoy) but he's holding his own.  And honestly, the writing on the show this season isn't great.  But having said that, this is still a fun show to watch and definitely worth the time.  For those new to the DW universe, start with season 1 but hold out judgement until season 2...probably the best season of the whole series.    Get season 5 if you're a Who fan and just can't get enough or if you just want a goofy scifi to kick back and enjoy.  Don't get this season if you're expecting the charisma/likability of David Tenant's Doctor or if you're expecting the really good storytelling of the previous 4 seasons.
0060254920|5.0|One night Max was up to no good: he wore his wolf costume, did mischief of all kinds, and, therefore, was sent to his room without any supper. \\"That very night in Max's room a forest grew and grew...\\" until it turned into a thick jungle of trees and vines hanging everywhere. There even was an ocean tumbling,  and \\"a private boat for Max\\" that took him into the world where the wild things are. The roaring, fierce creatures with yellow eyes, sharp teeth, and claws filled the land of this world. But Max wasn't frightened - he tamed them \\"with a magic trick\\", and they made him the king of all wild things.<br /><br />But soon Max realized that having everything your way wasn't that much fun anymore: \\"And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.\\" So, Max sailed back to \\"his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him and it was still hot.\\"<br /><br />The illustrations are very artistic and helpful to envision the story. The wild things are fierce and untamed, but they are not drawn to be graphically scary. Some of the pages have just drawings without any words, making it a great opportunity for the kids to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Maurice Sendak creates a magical world of imagination where children can escape to, the place where the wild things are. The heart of the story is that kids have different ways of dealing with frustrations, but they all have one thing in common - they want to be loved unconditionally, and accepted for who they are. After all, there is no place like home!<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

B003616M3O|4.0|This is a fantastic jazz album, different from most other ECM releases because of its up-tempo beat and very accessible tunes. As such, it should appeal to a wide range of music lovers, not just fans of Katche's understated drumming.    However, in a day and age when it's possible to cram around 75 minutes onto a CD, this one at 44 minutes is way too short. Yes I know 44 great minutes is much more preferable to 75 mins of crap and yes, it's all about quality not quantity, but that's me. I like to think I'm getting value for money when I fork out my hard-earned $$ for CDs in today's downloadable age and to me, 44 mins doesn't quite cut it.    That's why I've taken one star off my review.

There just wasn't enough conflict in the story to make this interesting and the other supposed assets (style, prose) weren't enough to overcome the plot and pacing deficiencies.  Are we supposed to be impressed that the narrative uses cultural and ideological memes that I use in political tinted conversations I have in real life?  Well maybe some are but after a while that novelty wears off and I was just waiting for something to happen that made me care and it didn't.    S
B00192IV9U|4.0|Let's be honest...how can you review an album that was put together by so many people?! This review isn't going to be a page long because realisticly, it's not that serious people. LOL Overall, I am pleasantly surprised. I, like MANY other people were on the fence about buying this album. Is Sony just trying to make $, is this really Michael, would he want his unfinished work want to be released? All that went out the window when I heard this album. If anything, I was GRATEFUL that I even had the chance to get to listen to these songs! There's some great stuff here. Of course it can't all be good, it just doesn't have the \\"Michael touch\\". I am SO SO SO glad I decided to purchase this album. I think we need to stop taking it so seriously and just enjoy it with the thought that 'A little bit of Michael is better than no Michael.' Buy the album, I highly doubt you'll regret it!
030746363X|4.0|I'm a huge Tim Feriss fan, but from what I've read so far, I haven't quite seen the \\"hacking\\" we've come to know from him.  The first few chapters haven't offered anything new thus far - it seems like bits of information repackaged in Tim's trademark writing style.  And some of his (much older) blog posts with Q & A's added.<br /><br />For those who are new to fitness, or looking to get started, I think this book is a great start.  I admit, I haven't completed the book, and I intend to place a final rating after completing the book.  I think if the hype hadn't been built so strongly so as to assert that brand new, left field underground science was about to reveal itself, I may have been more forgiving in this review.<br /><br />Update #1: The 15 minute female orgasm<br /><br />Since I already read a lot of fitness articles online, and I've gone through a close to 50 lb body weight change in the past year and a half (and maintained it), I figured I may be more immersed than the average reader, so I skipped ahead to the 15 minute female orgasm.  I mean, getting a woman to climax for 15 minutes, that's crazy, right?<br /><br />As it turns out, it is crazy.  The title and hype were, again, misleading, as it was all about getting a woman to climax in 15 minute sessions of clitoral stimulation (there's more to it than this, this is just the final outcome).  To be fair, the stories are great, and there is some interesting hacking of the system of bringing women who struggle to climax to do just that (moving from 0% to 100% is nothing short of spectacular), but this again is another chapter with great info from different sources brought together (and very well) with misleading hype.  So far, I'm not let down by the quality of the info or writing, I'm disappointed by what I was expecting to receive.<br /><br />I began skimming the testosterone chapters, those look promising, will update again when done.<br /><br />Update #2:  Upping Your Testosterone<br /><br />Good read, nothing really deceptive here, though not sure how much I believe upping testosterone turns you into a pheromone emitting machine, and if so, if it's even ethical.  Some food for thought, a few riveting stories - I can't comment on this chapter's efficacy until I try it out, so will give it a shot and comment later about how well it went.<br /><br />Update #3:  Injured my back a few months ago doing either deadlifts or squats (did both in the workout, wasn't sure which) and could not bend over to tie my laces without a great deal of pain.  Read the chapter on dealing with injuries, checked in with an ART specialist, and within the first session I was mobile again, and a few months later, my back is fine and no problems, no surgery.  I originally rated this book 3 stars, and I'm upping it now to four.g testosterone turns you into a pheromone emitting machine, and if so, if it's even ethical.

B00002E233|4.0|I expected this to be pretty stupid, but someone had lent me the DVD so I watched it.  What fun!  From LL Cool J as the laugh-out-loud funny cook to giant intelligent roaring (!) sharks, it's a festival of glorious schlocky action. Shakespeare it ain't, but it's quite a lot of fun nonetheless.
B0049P1ZZQ|2.0|I really enjoyed following the story, but can't help but feel a little ripped off being charged so much money for only 6 episodes.  If anything, AMC should include some fun stuff with the series. Maybe a map of everywhere the story as taken place thus far? Fake blood? A working crossbow would be awesome and totally worth it but for now I'll wait til Season 2 comes out (unfortunately it is slated to come out Oct 2011...).
B00192IV9U|5.0|I listened to the whole album last week and I fell in love. Yes the songs may not have been finished or up to Michael's standards but the songs were very good. Michael is the only artist where I can listen to the whole album without skipping one track, which is the same with this album all the tracks are BEAUTIUFL. Here is how I would rate them   1. Hold My Hand- would have loved more MJ in it but him and Akon sing really well together it is a very uplifting beautiful song 10/10  2. Hollywood Tonight- Love it! the beat is amazing and should be a hit if they release it as a single 10/10  3 Keep your head up- Classic Michael with the choir singing. His voice is very beautiful on this track 10/10  4. I like the way you love me- I loved the demo version, but this one is much better, and I love the message at the beginning 10/10  5. Monster- very good track with 50 cent, this could also be a next single. Makes me wanna dance everytime i hear it 9/10  6. Best of Joy- My favorite track on the album. His voice is like an angel on this track very peaceful 10/10  7. Breaking News- I actually liked this song before all the controversy started, it's different for MJ but really good 9/10  8. Another Day- Great Song! Michael's voice is powerful and moving definatley a classic 10/10  9. Behind the mask- Brilliant!! Michael should have relased this years ago, man he was a genius 10/10  10.Much too soon= Another classic MJ, very touching song and his voice is very soothing liked it alot 10/10    Every Michael fan should buy this it is a great tribute to the Greatest whoever did it
B00005ATQI|5.0|My favorite movie of all time! No question. I especially like the part where Jack is in the Gold Room the second time- imagining the 4th of July Ball that is going on around him. He is flashing back to a past life, when he was the homicidal caretaker of the hotel. It is so creepy! And surreal, at the same time. And the part in the restroom. Amazing acting- Jack at his all-time best.
B00192IV9U|5.0|At first, after all that I heard on the radio, TV, TMZ, and other Social Networks.; I thought it will be an \\"OK\\" album and some songs that you dont even know if MJ sang it.... but let me be quite frank and honest here... THIS WAS MORE THAN I EXPECTED... VERY GOOD, 5 STAR... I LOVE track 9 and 5 (Monster, with 50Cent)....     I think this is just the beginning to many more great songs to be released soon.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|After having grown up on the classic cartoon (mainly due to my older brothers) I was very surprised to find that I liked this move immensely.  It's not Lawrence of Arabia, to be sure, but it really has the spirit of Speed Racer and the visuals to match.  Visually, this movie will knock you on your duff in no time flat.  I just wish a re-release would tender a Dolby TrueHD audio track.  Even with the Dolby Digital mix that is used, though, you might not even notice.  Definitely a worthy flick if you are a fan of the old series!
B000002KIT|5.0|As many of the above reviewers agree; this one blows most (Song Remains as Boring, Frampton Comes Dead, etc.) other \\"Live\\" albums away.  With that cliche said, it is as good as the 1st KISS Alive.  So much, pardon the expression, sonic power, that the ears can't get enuff...I remember seeing the Gin Blossoms in Tempe at some little meth bar on Mill Avenue; Doug Hopkins had told me earlier they were going to do \\"The Cowboy Song\\".  They tore into it and kicked it every which way but down.  That's the kind of material this band wrote after the famous 2 guitar lineup was in order.  There are some live bootlegs out there of Lizzy that are good, but still, not as good as this CD.  All the hits are here as previously mentioned by fellow reviewers.  Hard to believe this band is gone when so much genius was present...
0756405890|5.0|I'll make it quick, since they're plenty of reviews here already. This is my absolute favorite book right now. I almost never go back and reread books frequently, even with my favorite books I only break them out every five years or so, once the memories aren't so fresh in my mind. This book is different. I've reread it three times so far since I found it last year (which for me is unheard of).     Definitely worth your time and money. The next book is coming out in March, so make sure to pick up this one up and read it before then. You won't regret it, and if against all likelihood you don't like it, well, there's not much we can do for you, you strange sad person.  ;)
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I had been renting all the season's at a local video store only to find out they did not have the last season. The final season was consistent with this show and had an ending that made sense. I love this show. It would be great to see it come back, years later. I would love to see what happens to Sean, and Christian.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE Eclipse! I am a fan of the Twilight books and have the other 2 movies in the Saga. This is the best made of the series in my opinion. Even my husband likes this one. There is action and romance and Awesome effects! This is a definate add to the collection of you like the books and if you've watched the other 2 movies. It follows nicely from the books and I'm not at all left explaining any scenes to my husband since they explain it all instead of taking bits from the book that seem randomly added or leaving it unexplained. I would love all the movies to be 4hrs long so the whole book is played out infront of me, but they don't do that. This movie does the best job keeping true to the book without leaving parts out that would explain the scenes or characters actions & knowledge like New Moon did. Now I am even more excited to see Breaking Dawn!!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|OMG I can watch this over and over on a big wide screen with 6 channels audio total cost $25, but try to see in concert for less than $150!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout video is very kicks butt. It is a very intense workout...I was sored for 3days it must be working good. To get good results just stick to the workouts. The steps are not too hard if you are a pretty strong person.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|Seeing all the amazing reviews here I decided to buy this movie, but it was very disappointing. I loved the style of the movie, but I thought that the action was mellowed down. There was so much potential to make this a hardcore action flick, but they decided to make it funny, and is not good funny. The comedy that is thrown at you is pathetic, sometimes funny, but mostly baaad.     Again, the style of the movie is quite refreshing and I really liked that. But by the end of it, I was wondering why I bought this movie at all.
B00192IV9U|2.0|I'm a major Michael Jackson fan, so of course I was excited for this album. However, once I heard the song \\"Breaking News\\", I was worried. Not because it didn't sound like him, but because the song wasn't near MJ standards.    My worries were take away when the dong \\"Hold My Hand\\" was released. Not only was it up to MJ standards, but the song was amazing.    So now I was highly skeptical about this album. I ultimately decided that no matter what, I will buy the album for my love of MJ.....big mistake.    The booklet was terrible and bland. Remember how Michael's albums were full of pictures? Yeah, good luck finding that in this album. There is one picture, which is just the extended version of the cover. The rest are just scans of note, that to be honest look completely fake and are extremely hard to read. As for the disc itself, it is just a bland dark blue with \\"Michael\\" in small white letters on the bottom that you could honestly miss.     Now then, the music. When I first saw the track listing, I was kinda disappointed that there was only ten songs. However after hearing these ten songs, I wish there was less.    It begins with the best song on the album, \\"Hold my hand\\". This song sounds great, and Akon does a great job on the vocals. I am not a fan of Akon, but this song made me curious. This is one of the few song that I can get really sucked into. A true MJ song.    Then it goes to a song called \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", this song was honestly bad. Just like \\"Breaking News\\", I doubt Michael even sang this song. I hear bits and pieces of him, but not much. Even if it is actually Michael singing(I highly doubt it)this song would still be bad and in no way close to a quality Michael Jackson song.    Third up is a song called \\"Keep Your Head Up\\". This song has nice music in the background. On top of that, Michael gives us great vocals that sound somewhat like \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Break of Dawn\\" more or less. It has a really smooth and simple sound to it, that soothes yoin the way that only Michael Jackson could do. In all, this song was ok. It wasn't the best song, but it's definitely a good breather after what they just threw at us.    Next up is a song called \\"(I like) The Way You Love Me\\". This one has a different intro. It begins with a piece of the original demo to the song, complete with Michael making notes. The only problem I have with this song is that is sounds almost exactly the same as the previous song. Michael uses the same pitch and style. Even the music is similar. Still both songs are good, but the similarity is what makes this song just ok. If I had to choose, I would pick this over the previous song. I love Michael's slow songs, but not when they come one after another. They need to be mixed with fast songs so I can get back into the slow song mood. Still, this song is definitely not monstrously bad, but not monstrously good either.    Speaking of monsters, are next song is \\"Monster\\". Oh god, where do I start with this one. Again this song is questionable when it comes to Michael's voice, however this one is close enough to maybe be him. To be honest, the song just isn't good. It has lyrics to be a song like \\"Ghost\\" or \\"Thriller\\", but this song is just too slow. Three slow songs in a row just don't work. Also, who thought it would be good to pair Michael Jackson with 50 Cent? I think there is a reason why Michael didn't release this song.....if he even recorded it, because there are moments of doubt in this song. This one is just bad, some may like it, but not many. If you liked \\"Money\\" then this is a song for you.    Next is \\"Best Of Joy\\". This song doesn't give you any warning and just starts with lyrics right away. This one is definitely faster in pace, but still considerably slow.(funny how it's faster than a song called Monster). My biggest problem with this song is that 80% of the lyrics are  just repeats  of \\"I am forever\\" and \\"we are forever\\". This song feels way too short, given that it's 3:03 long. Most of the time yo hear the same words over and over. They even play that over Michael when he sings other lyrics. It honestly feels like Michael only recorded one minute of this song and the producers just looped it a bunch of times and called it a complete song. The song would have been good if it were actually finished, but instead we get a poorly made song that consists of the same words being repeated over and over. Not cool. It's good if you just want a simple song, but trust me. You will just get a feeling like there was supposed to be more to the song. This song shouldn't have been on this album only because it didn't have enough material to be completed. This is song is ruined.    Oh boy.....next is \\"Breaking News\\". Do you really need to know about this song? Ok. First off, it sounds absolutely nothing like Michael(I know his voice extremely well). Second, it doesn't even seem like a song he would singing. Te only time you can actually hear Michael's voice is in the chorus, which sounds like it was supposed to be part of a different song. Third, when have you ever heard Michael ever say \\"Michael Jackson\\"? Never, he never once said his name. Other people have said his name, but never him. To be honest the song may be bad, but it's reputation makes it worse. If you took Michael Jackson's name off of it, the song would be decent.    Now that that's over, let us look at \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\". First off, the title is confusing, but that's not a major point. This song sounds similar to \\"Give In To Me\\". The song is t a decent pace. Now, to go over it's flaws. It sounds like Michael is just yelling. Seriously, it goes from a contained voice to yelling, and he yells for no reason at all.  It has a boring guitar solo in the middle of it that just adds to the already boring background music. This one is just plain boring in general, definitely not a good one.    Our next one on the list is \\"Behind The Mask\\". It starts off by giving us a nice saxophone to listen to. Then we hear the vocals....again, it's questionable to if Michael actually sang it. It's possible for it to be a \\"Triumph\\" era Michael who's making his voice deeper, so this is pretty close to being him. Out of all the questionable ones, this is most definitely the most likely to be him singing. The lyrics are ok, but the music isn't all that good. Other than the occasional saxophone, it's kinda bland. This one is more like a mediocre from the first few The Jackson's albums, and definitely not a good Michael(or The Jackson's) song. It's ok, if not terrible mediocre. Then again, there is a reason to why Michael never finished it, and that was probably it.    And last up is \\"Much Too Soon\\". As it starts up, we are greeted with nice and soothing music. Then we hear Michael singing the lyrics absolutely beautiful. Not only are the vocals and music wonderful, so are the lyrics. This song tells us a sad tale about a girl leaving and Michael learning what he did wrong, but he learned his lesson too soon and is unable to get her back. The song could honestly bring tears to some with it's sad, yet beautiful lyrics. This song is wonderful, and it certainly was a great way to end the album. Another thing to note is that, like \\"Hold My Hand\\", this song actually sounds like it's finished and was finished mostly by Michael's input.     In all, there are two great, Michael Jackson quality songs in this album. \\"Hold My Hand\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\". The rest were either too simple, mediocre, or just plain bad. As a die hard MJ fan, I was really hoping the best for this album. Sadly it doesn't have nearly enough kick in it as all of his other works going straight back to the Jackson 5 did. Most of the songs are just forgettable or unlikable. The two songs are wonderful, but only two songs is not nearly enough to make for a good Michael Jackson album. I really am a major fan of his, and it's because I am such a big fan that I got so let down by this album's final result and I cancriticize it the way I did. I honestly hate to say this, but they should have left these demos alone. Not because of Michael's death(a sad day I will never forget), but because they just weren't good enough to be released.    Of course, I bought this album just because I'm as big a fan as I am. So I'm sure all the real MJ fans will buy this like I did, because it's something that can never be overlooked. I am more worried that fans will be clouded from how bad this album really is and promote it to all hell.     So, take this from a real fan. It's an interesting thing to listen to, but don't buy it. This is definitely by far the worst thing ever to be released with Michael Jackson's name on it. And I am very sad to have to say that.    I give it two out of five because, out of ten songs, only two are actually good and memorable, the presentation is just awful, and the price is way to high for it. It is really a rip off to buy the full album.    I wrote this review because I knew that there would be too many people in denial that want nothing more than to believe that this album is wonderful, and several bias people who want noting more than to believe that this album is nothing more than trash. In truth, it's not good, but it certainly isn't trash. Let it be known that this is a 100% unbiased review that I gain absolutely nothing for.  Because lets face it, you can't trust every official review, especially ones from companies that made deals to promote this semi rip off album.
B00192IV9U|4.0|In the midst of all the controversy, Michael Jackson continues to reign as GOD of Music. Many spectators claim that some vocals on this album are not Michaels, but aside from \\"Breaking News\\" (Which contains James Porte's voice singing along with Michael Jackson's Voice} all songs contain Michael Jackson's vocals and this further proves exactly how talented he was as a vocalist. His musical talents know no boundaries. From the soothing and melodic opening track \\"Hold My Hand\\" to the heavenly and tear jerking closing number \\"Much Too Soon\\", \\"MICHAEL\\" is definately worth the buy. While the order of the tracklisting doesn't flow, it still doesnt change the fact that this album contains wonderful music and great harmonies.<br /><br />  Some Highlights: (I Like) The Way You Love, was originally released in 2004 with \\"The Ultimate Collection Boxset\\" in a demo form which was beautiful. The simplicity of the song is what makes it great, and Michaels vocals are infectious as he swoons the listener with metaphors and melodic harmonies. Here, on \\"Michael\\" is a reworked version, and at the start of the song you hear Michael speaking over the phone explaining the tone and instrumentation of the song, whch immediately follows the start of the track. That was a very special and unique touch, and although I prefer the original version from 2004 the song is still a delightful touch to the album. \\"Best Of Joy\\" One of my favorites from the album is one of those types of songs that makes you smile and cry at the same time. In it, Michael sings \\"I am forever, We are forever.\\" Its almost like hes singing about his relationship with his fans as he also states \\"we'll never part, our love is from the heart\\", and its been said he was going to reveal this song at his \\"This is It\\" residency in London, and was also the last song he recorded. \\"Monster\\" which features 50cent, is a tune that gets stuck in your mind. From that scream at the start of the song, to the gritty production, down to 50cents rap verse, the song is definately a hit. I was distant to the song at first but after listening to it i fell in love with it. It tells a story about peoples desire for fame and warns those about the creatures aka \\"Monsters\\" that come with the fame. Another highlight is \\"Behind The Mask\\", the albums best number(IMO). This song is sheer Michael Jackson, the vocals, the instrumentation, the adlibs, and the story about a woman torn between two men that she can't seem to choose between. Michael sternly sings \\"Who do you love, is it me\\" throughout the prechorus and you can feel his desire to have this woman,as he tells her to remove her mask of lies and stop hiding behind the truth.<br /><br />  Whether or not you're a Michael Jackson fan, this album is a MUST have, although it is not up to par with Michael's previously released material, it still contains some gems, rough, but gems nonetheless. I recommend it for any MUSIC lover and any Michael Jackson fan who just has to have his work. The man is a genius and although this record was finished without his creative blessing, he still found a way to shine his way through.p verse, the song is definately a hit.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|TRON: Legacy has been one of the most promoted films of the year. With a monstrous budget (around $200 million) and reports saying that Disney is worried that the film isn't tracking as well as they'd hoped, the initial thought process from these rumors is that the TRON sequel will open to a disappointing first place weekend much like the most recent Chronicles of Narnia film. As of this writing, I haven't gotten around to seeing the original film. I wanted to, but thanks to Disney it was pretty much pulled from every retail store imaginable whether you wanted to rent or purchase the film at least until next year. The urge to see TRON: Legacy didn't really sink in until around the time the third trailer was released. While the Daft Punk score has interested me from the beginning, TRON: Legacy just seemed like another overrated piece of eye candy that fanboys were getting excited about. The thing about first impressions though is that they always have the opportunity to be wrong.<br /><br />It's been twenty years since Kevin Flynn (Bridges) had made some miraculous breakthrough on what he only referred to as The Grid and mysteriously disappeared. Over the years without his father around, Sam (Hedlund) became reckless and spends his time sabotaging ENCOM, the company he inherited. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner), a friend of Kevin's who still works for ENCOM, pays a visit to Sam telling him that he's received a page from his father from a number that's been disconnected since his father's disappearance. Feeling doubtful and skeptical, Sam goes to investigate where the page originated from; Flynn's Arcade, his father's original workspace. It's here that Sam is transported to the digital world his father always talked about, The Grid. Sam is captured upon arrival and forced to compete in the games of the mysterious world. Sam crosses paths with a program named Clu, who looks exactly like his father did 20 years ago and wants nothing more than to prevent Kevin's escape from The Grid. Once the light cycles enter the equation and Sam's life seems to be in danger, Quorra (Wilde) makes her presence known. After saving Sam, Quorra takes him to meet his father. After the Flynn's reunite, they must come up with a plan that'll help get them all home without running into Clu along the way; a feat that is much more difficult and dangerous than it seems.<br /><br />The glorified TRON sequel is getting a lot of mixed reviews from most movie critics. The problem seems to lie within the way the film is written and its screenplay. To tell the truth, you don't see a movie like this for a great story alone. The special effects are the main attraction and boy, do they deliver. The way programs disintegrate when they're disposed of, the light cycle battles, airborne chases, and the many fight sequences in the film are just a small example of the dazzling display of some of the most exceptional and impressive special effects ever seen in a cinematic feature. As with most films that have been presented in 3D lately, the 3D effect probably isn't necessary to enjoy a film of this magnitude. It'll be just as entertaining if you save yourself the extra $4 and see it in a conventional theater.<br /><br />The writing didn't seem as bothersome as much as other reports say. It certainly wasn't the best, but it seemed like enough to add just the right amount of depth to TRON: Legacy and give it more of a background than most films revolving around spectacular special effects. There were a few lines that bothered me. The main one being when Alan first visits Sam and Sam says something about his father probably either being dead or chilling in Costa Rica...or both. Wait, what? It just gives you this Weekend at Bernie's flashback with Bernie being replaced with Kevin Flynn's limp carcass. Some of the lines Jeff Bridges muttered just made him seem way too much like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, which seems awesome but really has no place in the TRON universe. Saying things like, \\"Check this out,\\" or, \\"Radical, man,\\" followed by that stoner laugh of his really didn't help matters much. The weak points of the way the film is written are rectified with the way the film never lets your attention out of its chokehold. You'll be drawn to the screen the entire film; that's practically a guarantee. The right mindset for a film like this can make or break your opinion of the film. If you don't have inflated expectations and don't expect much more than impressive special effects, then you'll probably walk away pleasantly surprised. I actually had a similar mindset during Avatar, which seemed to also suffer/take advantage of groundbreaking special effects being more consuming than the story and had a similar result.<br /><br />The cast is about as developed as can be expected. The real star of the film is Garrett Hedlund, who does a pretty decent job of carrying the film and being generally astonished that not only was his father alive but the extraordinary world he always talked about actually existed. Jeff Bridges' performance isn't nearly as strong as his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, but he does have his moments. He seems to shine during his reunion with Hedlund and his strongest scenes are with Hedlund alone while being rather flat the rest of the time. Olivia Wilde's Quorra is interesting, as well.

Michael Sheen did seem a bit too over the top at times as Castor, but that may have been the point. The biggest surprise was seeing Cillian Murphy cameo.

As far as eye candy goes, TRON: Legacy is an incredible and all around awesome experience.ut,\\" or, \\"Radical, man,\\" followed by that stoner laugh of his really didn't help matters much. The weak points of the way the film is written are rectified with the way the film never lets your attention out of its chokehold. You'll be drawn to the screen the entire film; that's practically a guarantee. The right mindset for a film like this can make or break your opinion of the film. If you don't have inflated expectations and don't expect much more than impressive special effects, then you'll probably walk away pleasantly surprised. I actually had a similar mindset during Avatar, which seemed to also suffer/take advantage of groundbreaking special effects being more consuming than the story and had a similar result.    The cast is about as developed as can be expected. The real star of the film is Garrett Hedlund, who does a pretty decent job of carrying the film and being generally astonished that not only was his father alive but the extraordinary world he always talked about actually existed. Jeff Bridges' performance isn't nearly as strong as his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, but he does have his moments. He seems to shine during his reunion with Hedlund and his strongest scenes are with Hedlund alone while being rather flat the rest of the time. Olivia Wilde's Quorra is interesting, as well.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|To be clear- I am NOT a reviewer who got the book in advance. I just read it that fast, which is probably the case of many people out there, as there are quite a few of us excited about this book!<br /><br />To the people complaining it is not earth shattering: No, it is not if you are familiar with the blog. It does however give good information in a concise way while still including enough info and resources to be useful.<br /><br />The book is a great mix of simple and complex- seriously people, stop complaing that you have to get tested or the food is complex. Those suggestions for food and testing are helpful but not totally necessary (most of the advanced diets that people are complaining about being complex are for specific tweaks, the actual basic suggestions for everything in the book are actually very simple.)<br /><br />For the kindle version- unlike many books on the kindle, the ebook version is formatted so you can actually follow the links easily to webpages for pictures that are mentioned (and the pictures actually show up that are in the book, also unlike many books on kindle). I didn't miss the book not being in color/print at all, and zooming in on the smaller charts makes them much easier to read.
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter has been a must-see film of mine ever since at least the end of October. Not only did the cast look to function as one strong, cohesive unit, Christian Bale looked to transform himself yet again and had gotten completely absorbed in his role as Dicky Eklund. From just viewing the trailer, Bale seemed to give a performance that reminded his fans just how talented he can actually be. The Fighter also seemed to have a lot of emotion and heart; two key ingredients that go on to making movies like this legendary. The real test would be if The Fighter could hold up to other great boxing films like Rocky or Raging Bull and in this critic's humble opinion, it does just that.<br /><br />Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) is following in his brother Dicky's (Bale) footsteps and is trying to make a name for himself as a boxer. Dicky has been giving Mickey advice and helping Mickey train for as long as they can both remember while their mother Alice (Leo) has been acting as his manager the entire time. Mickey knows it's time for a change if he expects to make a serious impact in the boxing world, but a crack addicted brother and a mom who thinks she's helping his career when she's really hurting it have both been holding him back for far too long. So when Charlene (Adams) and Mickey become an item and Dicky winds up in prison, Mickey makes the hardest decision of his life and keeps fighting with new management in tow and seemingly pushes his family out. As Mickey's mother tries to wrap her head around her son replacing her as manager, all hell breaks loose once Dicky gets out of prison. As the date for the most important fight in Mickey's career fast approaches, will he have the support of his family or has everything already fallen apart past the point of being repaired?<br /><br />The cast is the driving force behind this film. The relationships and arguments that take place between Mickey, Dicky, their mother, her seven daughters, George Ward (Jack McGee), Charlene, and Mickey O'Keefe (as himself) are really the heart behind all the boxing that takes place. Melissa Leo turns in an emotionally powerful performance as you can tell she only wants the best for her family, does everything within her power to do just that, and still seems to wind up hurting them in the long run. Amy Adams character, Charlene, seems to want nothing more than to be with Mickey but is also relying on his success to be the ticket to her bettering her life. Then there's Mark Wahlberg who always seems to play the same role with the same thick Boston accent. The thing about Mickey though is that Wahlberg fits the part very well. The extensive training Wahlberg went through and his experience made him a shoe-in for this role. The real gem of the film is Christian Bale though. Bale has been rather disappointing performance-wise since The Dark Knight and it's nice to see him back in top form here. He surely looks the part as his awkward body language, sick, clammy skin tone, and the way he seems to be chewing on something when he's not eating anything really makes him come off as a genuine crack addict. I was beginning to think that success had gotten to his head, but even if it has it's great to know that he can still turn in engaging performances like this when he feels like it.<br /><br />What's interesting is the song, \\"How You Like Me Now?\\" by The Heavy that was also used in the trailers for Faster is used several times in The Fighter. It seems to be utilized more efficiently in The Fighter though. It felt like the song was used in Faster just because it sounded cool, but the song seems to have a stronger impact in a film about a boxer trying to turn his life around better than a film about a guy trying to gain revenge for his brother's death. It was a very welcome addition to the soundtrack and makes the opening segment to The Fighter even more memorable than it already was.<br /><br />The film also wastes little time taking full control of your attention. You don't lose interest until that screen turns black. With the little bits of humor thrown in for good measure amongst all of the family brawling and knockout punches being thrown around, it was just really easy to get lost in the film. It was almost as if you were part of the documentary crew filming Dicky watching this all take place in person. The one complaint I have is that it all seems to end rather prematurely. While everything does come together nicely, the ending just doesn't feel fully gratifying. It felt like the film ended right in the middle of the climax, but consider it a nitpick. It's still an excellent film.<br /><br />The Fighter is an engrossing and emotionally powerful drama that features an incredibly strong cast and the best performance from Christian Bale in a long, long time. I honestly haven't liked a boxing film this much since Raging Bull. With all of the end of the year awards talk and so many movies being released recently and in the coming weeks that'll be potential award winners, it is well worth every effort to see The Fighter in theaters. It has one of the most well-rounded and well put-together casts of any film to be released in theaters this year and deserves to be seen on the big screen.reen turns black.

B00192IV9U|5.0|fantastic album, every song means something, not like new artists, 2-3 good ones and the rest fillers,don`t judge it with MJ standarts, cause he didn`t put the final touch, but with now-a-days criteria, clearly WINNER
B003EYVXTG|1.0|A movie with very little to offer than one note. Scratch that, two notes: the root and minor third. By the time the buzzards make their debut, you don't have to be an art house baret-wearing clown from New York to see what this is all about: poor white folk. Toothless, gray, American Gothic meets the Joads meets Boys Don't Cry, etc.  If it wasn't presented with such ham-fisted drudgery, perhaps with a tinge of humor or a sense of salvation (not the cheap kind that just comes at the end), it would have done the photography justice.     In short, white poverty, meth, bad teeth, poor, banjo, squirrel gets skinned and eaten, bad teeth ad infinitum. Almost a parody of itself.

B001E45XT4|3.0|I thought this was going to be the perfect headset, and it almost was.  The problem is I can't wear it for more than 20-30 minutes without getting a headache; despite all the foam padding, the curvature of the headset itself applies direct pressure to the sides of my head (I don't have a wide head) and causes a headache very quickly.  I've had to resort to putting the headset around my neck so that the mic still sticks out in front, and then use my speakers for game audio, which kinda defeats the purpose of a headset.  So, I'm shopping for a different headset now.
037571412X|3.0|Ugh, yuk.  I know that this review is going to earn me some negative votes.  But I have to be honest, so that other readers (some of whom are certain to feel the same way I did) can make an informed decision.    I must admit that this is an insightful and extremely well-written book.  The parts about the emotional pain of aging and illness are brilliant and intensely poignant.  Those passages are worth 5 stars.    But in terms of personal enjoyment, the book was two stars at best. Thus my rating is a compromise, an overall average.    The \\"ick\\" factor was way, way, over the top for me.  Such as the young girl with the lecherous old man. And some passages read like pornography.  I'm not religious, not at all conservative, and decidedly not prudish.  I enjoy explicit descriptions of sex as much as anyone when they are tastefully done.  But this book just made sex appear ugly.   Basically, it vomits out far more information about the thought processes of male sexuality than this female ever wanted to know.  I'd SO prefer to hang on to my delusions that sex includes components of romance and tenderness for men too.      If any male readers want to take issue with this, please feel free.  I'd be very glad to learn that Roth's way of thinking about sex is the exception, not the rule.    But I suspect it is the rule.  So I guess I have to give the book some credit for honesty and authenticity.  That doesn't alleviate any of the disgust I felt while reading it.
031603438X|5.0|I was always a big Stones fan and Mick Jagger was always my favorite, but now I'm as big of a fan of Keith's too. Some of his lingo is hard to figure out, but you get the general idea. It would be fun if there was a small dictionary of Keef slang, then I could go back and re-read it and go \\"OHH that's what he meant!\\" Truly a fun book.
B0044E9LW6|4.0|Let me say I'm a big fan of R.J.D. all the way back to Rainbow. If you've ever heard any live Dio or seen him live you know he likes medleys. The track list is a bit inaccurate in that some of the titles aren't complete as they are part of a longer medley, that being said this is a cool set to have. These shows where recorded by pros so they sound great & don't sound like bootlegs at all. The booklet could have had more to it, it was described as \\"deluxe\\" in the ad I read but I wouldn't say that(6 or 8 pages)& I was disappointed in that regard. If your a fan this would be a cool addition to your DIO collection.
B003TML0VO|5.0|I am not  a conasiure of music by any stretch of the imagination.  I love this CD.  Nice mix of different styles and Santana makes them all work.  The tunes are recognizable from my youth on up which makes it easy to follow along. Santana's cover kicks it all up a notch to a level that makes the music sound new again.  I hope he does another album like this soon!
0385342047|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is the pseudonym of Madeleine Wickham, and author of the ridiculously popular `Shopaholic' series. So popular in fact, that the first book `Confessions of a Shopaholic' (`The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic') was turned into a movie in 2009.<br /><br />In `Mini Shopaholic' Becky Bloomwood is learning about the curveballs and pitfalls of motherhood amidst the recession; she's trying to pinch pennies but still determined to throw her husband, Luke, a birthday-bash he'll never forget. Between celebrity super-nannies and getting booted out of Santa's Grotto, Becky and co have their work cut out for them. And Becky's own little terror is not making life any easier - Becky's going to have to learn how to pry the Balenciaga bag out of Minnie's sticky little hands. . .<br /><br />`Mini Shopaholic' is the sixth book in the series. I was reading `Mini' as a stand-alone, having never read Kinsella's previous instalments. I didn't feel like I was missing anything from previous books, because I got the impression that the addition of Minnie to Becky's life has been like a door opening in the series. I felt that motherhood was one task Becky had never handled, nor been prepared to handle. Kinsella is writing about motherhood from the perspective of a woman who is still growing and learning herself.<br /><br />Becky's penny-pinching is both hilarious and cringe-worthy. She barters with her husband and tries to justify shopping for Baby Dior. Becky certainly lives up to the series title - she is a shopaholic of epic proportions and a seemingly bottomless pit of sales and `two-for-ones'. Her shopping frenzy could have made Becky come across as vain and flighty, but Kinsella writes the double-edged sword and shows how much stress Becky puts herself under with her lying and secret stash of purchases. In the end you feel just a little bit sorry for Becky and her habit.<br /><br />But above all else Becky is likable. Underneath the shopping frenzy and frazzled mummy she is an endearing bosom buddy to read. Becky is very relatable on a number of levels - as a first time mother drowning in toddler tantrums, a wife eager to please her hubby and a career-driven woman afraid of the big C-B (cut back) in the GFC (global financial crisis).<br /><br />I was suspiciously endeared to Becky's little darling, Minnie. Yes, she has a catch-call of \\"MIIIIIINE!\\" that will make you cringe, and she makes a scene at Santa's Grotto that will have you considering tying your tubes. . . but I actually think that Kinsella could have pushed Minnie to be a little more awful. As it was, I found myself chortling through so many of Minnie's tantrums and Becky's mortified-mummy scenes that I liked Minnie for her comedic timing more than I hated her bratty ways.<br /><br />I was very impressed with my most foray into the zany world of Shopaholics. Becky is an endearing and ludicrous heroine who is learning to live with life's imperfections. . . an hilariously uplifting summer-read.read.

B002ZG994U|3.0|I loved the original A-team, so I was very excited about watching this movie.  The A-team is very action packed right out of the gate and keeps it pretty much the entire way.  Bradley Cooper is fantastic as Face, and Liam Neeson makes a great Hannibal Smith.  However the movie led me to wonder what the heck was going on right out of the gate.  They tried to cram a lot of back story in at the beginning.  I'm guessing they expect us all to know the characters so the need for character development wasn't necessary.  If you have never seen the original A-Team, you will absolutely be lost.  But for those of us who are fans of the original, it's not difficult to get back on track if the storyline becomes confusing.<br /><br />I gave it a 3 because of the confusion of the movie, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching it.  The A-Team was a very entertaining movie, and will be to you also if you like car chases, helicopter craziness, and explosions.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|GASLAND will forever change they way you think about Natural Gas Drilling. The Natural Gas Industry wants you to believe that Natural Gas is the \\"Clean Burning Fuel\\" but what you don't know is that the horrible chemicals they  use in fracking are contaminating people's water all over the country.  No one should ever be able to light their water on fire, but they can. No one should have to breath chemicals in the air right outside their own homes, but they do.   This excellent documentary takes you across the US to show just a hand full of people whom are being affected by the gas industry.  You won't believe your eyes or your ears to what Josh Fox uncovers, jaw dropping facts and the cover up taking place every single day.
B00364K6YW|5.0|given reviews of different editions of this superb bbc p&p including of obviously  substandard colors etc, in one version, and many comments about wasting money  and similar comments incl one as to 'cant return it after its opened',  my response as to returns of dvds to amazon for various reasons, is that  the amazon attitude to returns has been exemplary and pro customer..    i had a problem with one scratched dvd from  an outside supplier,  purchased thru, amazon, but all dvds from amazon.com which for one reason  or another were not acceptable to my equipment etc, were returned  without any fuss..  including where the fault was mine,  in not checking on the area code of the dvd, info part of  amazons general product information page..  [i simply ticked the box for general incompatibility etc]    may i suggest that if you purchase any dvd from amazon and its not up to  your expectations that you avail yourself of the well thought out  returns process..  they even refunded the cost of return postage..    [unrelated ps; to the person who sold their original p&p VHS set; SHAME! ]
B00111YM5G|5.0|i have reviewed movies many times - even for joe bob briggs for several years in the '90s.  this was an excellent movie.  i liked it so much i rented (on tv) twice. having been raised a baptist, i love reading abt angels and the end of the world. this film goes into enough detail to let someone who doesn't know abt angels, etc., know who is who, which angel they are, and what their \\"jobs\\" are. lots of suspense. the end was worth the wait. for once, it was something i didn't expect! i say \\"see this film\\"!
1582701709|4.0|I read \\"The Power\\" before reading The Secret and The Secret is a great book but not much different from the movie. The book does keep you focused on the importance of knowing yourself and getting more intuned with your inner being. Learning to understand how your thoughts and feelings work which manifest into reality. I enjoyed reading this book when I was going through a difficult time it was always at arms reach just incase I needed to be brought back down to reality and be aware of my thoughts which believe it or not worked because it changed my way of thinking immediately.
0395389496|2.0|Much to my chagrin, my 4 year old son has this book and the movie practically memorized thanks to my husband and his mother. Why is it ok to teach children that getting out of their beds, leaving the house, and getting on a train with a stranger in the middle of the night is a grand, desirable, adventure?  I threw out a similar story about leaving the house and flying through the air with a snowman last year.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is another example.  I have been searching for a copy of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales to counter-effect  the message.  My goal in teaching my children about the world is to instill a healthy dose of caution at least, about going off with strangers, forget political correctness.
B003L20IHO|5.0|i admire this movie.  it was a very thoughful movie and it is a greatly put together movie.  The story was put together nicely and it didnt jump from one thing to another.  You could actually follow wat was happening.  Zac Efron was amazing!!!!!!! in this movie and when i say that i mean it.  alot of people bashed this movie as soon has they saw the \\"High School Musical Guy\\" was in it (air quotes)  that turned alot of people off from this movie!!! but im telling you put that aside and watch this movie!!!! it will be worht your time!! it was a sad but happy movie at the same time.  it teaches you that if you are giving a second chance don't dwell, live your life and you will find happiness

B002VPE1X4|4.0|It may not be leather or anything snappy looking, but by golly it works well and protects my camera, which is just about all I need.  This small camera case is padded and holds a few extras, such as camera cards. My husband likes the velcro loop that allows you to slide the case onto your belt without undoing your belt.  Unfortunately, the case doesn't \\"clip\\" on so if you don't have a belt or backback strap to run the velcro loop around, you will have to carry it in a pocket or by the strap. (I rarely wear belts and don't like carrying a camera by its strap, so I prefer a case that clips on. Between this case's looks and the lack of a clip, I give it four stars.)<br /><br />This case is far more protective than our leather-type hard case of the same size - this case is padded and the nylon is rain resistant. When traveling, I don't hesitate to throw our tiny Canon PowerShot into this case, then toss the case into our luggage or backpack.  We've used this case nonstop for about four months, I think, and it still looks new and works great.

B00377V6J2|5.0|Albert King conducts a master class for Stevie Ray Vaughan, and you are there. The DVD is an enthralling, intimate 88-minute set with classic songs, awesome licks, and delightful banter from the celebrated master and his young pupil, who shows great respect and an eagerness to learn. Despite the high caliber of the playing, this is the opposite of a cutting session. Each man takes his turn to shine while his partner plays with perfect sympathy and utter admiration.<br /><br />Albert sings on all tracks except for two songs, &#34;Texas Flood&#34; and &#34;Pride and Joy,&#34; on which Stevie sings (and well he should, since they're his songs). There are extended jams of more than 20 minutes on both &#34;Texas Flood&#34; and &#34;I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town.&#34; The legendary musicians recall their first meeting ten years before and the elder statesman admonishes the up-and-coming prodigy never to stop honing his craft.<br /><br />The 11-track CD contains four cuts not in the video program -- a conversation and three musical numbers, including the terrific 15-minute jam &#34;Blues at Sunrise.&#34; I've played both the CD and DVD again and again, yet they never get old or lose their magic. The rapport Albert and Stevie felt for each other and the deep feeling they had for the music were truly special. The bargain-priced combination of CD and DVD makes a great gift for the blues lover in your life.
0553381687|2.0|I'd read a few of Martin's short stories. He was hit and miss, but was interesting enough that I decided to try this famous series. What a mistake that turned out to be.<br /><br />I struggled to finish the book. The characters are pure cardboard and could be taken from a junior high school kid's first concept of what good and evil should be. There was no surprise in any of their actions, the plotting was plodding and standard, and it just wasn't interesting.<br /><br />Ok, no quite uninteresting. The two stories of Jon Snow and Dany, with the Wall and the mongol clones were passably interesting, which is what kept the book from being completely useless.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I would have to say this is the best season of since the started up with the Series again.  The storylines are solid and even though I love Rose, it is nice to get away from a love interest type companion to a companion that seems more on his level with attitude in Donna.    If you love Doctor Who you have already seen this I am sure, if you are new to him this is a solid season to start with, but you do have flashbacks to earlier seasons and may want to start with season 1.      So far there has not been a bad season of the latest Doctor Who series, but like ice cream you will like some more than others depending on your tastes.
0553381695|1.0|I'm unemployed and bored, otherwise I don't think I would have tried to read the second book in the series. I gave the first book two stars and thought I was done. Still, with the second having been nominated for some important awards, I figured that maybe, just maybe, Martin had improved. Nope.    I couldn't get far into this book without realizing that it was the same old drivel, only this time it was slower and less interesting. It just wasn't worth finishing.    Instead, I went to Wikipedia and read the plot summary of this and the next couple of books. The summary, as brief as it was, still couldn't make Martin's world sound interesting. What's happened to the reading audience that this series is considered award worth? A pity.

I've worn out every peice of media this came out on: LP, 8-track, cassette, and two CD's (actually, somebody swiped my CD - that's why I had to buy another one at Amazon). This album is way better than all their later stuff, despite the fact that it's a little \\"rough around the edges\\".  The fact is, it's pure, raw, unadulterated musical genious I tell you!!!  Go out and buy it today!!!
B0026IBY72|4.0|Several friends have read and enjoyed Austenland by Shannon Hale and I was in the mood for some seriously light reading. My brain seems to have turned off this holiday season. Austenland turned out to be exactly what I was looking for this week.<br /><br />I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the story of Jane Hayes, obsesssed with Mr. Darcy (aka Colin Firth), goes on vacation to Pembrook Park, Kent, England. I'm sure there aren't many women who haven't dreamed at least for a second that they were back in Jane Austen's England. I'm not even a super-Austen fan (I've only read four of her novels) and yet . . .<br /><br />Jane Hayes soon becomes Miss Erstwhile and is immersed into the world of Pembrook Park and the stuffy, politeness and gentility of the handsome actors that inhabit it.

B00006CXSS|3.0|The BoB miniseries are great to watch but misleading. The stories are not accurate, and contain much exaggeration and dramatization.    The reason that Easy Company has become famous is because Stephen Ambrose's book and Spielberg and Hank's miniseries. It is NOT because Easy is an exceptional unit. Ambrose wrote a book about Easy Company because one of his neighbors was an E Company member.    If you read the citations of Medal of Honor recipients in World War II, you will know that actually Easy Company is an AVERAGE unit in the US military. NOT the exceptional one. There are more than 450 Medal of Honor given in WW2. None of Easy Company members received Medal of Honor. None of Major Winters' battalion members received Medal of Honor. None of Sink's 506th PIR members received Medal of Honor.    Winters said in one interview that \\"only 1 person in 1 Division can receive Medal of Honor\\" (he said that's one of the reasons he did not get it). Again, this is NOT true. There are other Division that have more that 1 members received Medal of Honor in WW2. [...]  On the other hand, The Pacific miniseries may not be so great to watch as BoB. But after seeing The Pacific, you may know that many other units (other than Easy Company) may be facing much tougher situation than Easy Company during WW2. I am glad that the Pacific includes the stories of at least 1 Medal of Honor recipient in the movie. I wish Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks included more stories of individuals that receive Medal of Honor during WW2.

Although I enjoy twists and turns this book took a few too many and did not flow.  It felt disjointed throughout most of the book.  As a Camel Club fan I had a hard time buying into this plot.  The real action was slow to start and the too much of the story was far-fetched.  Come on...the president calls on Oliver Stone who has been out of the game for years to stop the Russian government...then we don't know if the president is really trying to get this done or just finish Oliver off.  I'm all for a good conspiracy but this gets downright crazy!  I paid more than I should have for the kindle book but I would not have liked it even if it was free!  I would not recommend this to anyone.

These decisions determine our success and happiness.  The Four Agreements, advocates personal freedom from unhealthy agreements and beliefs that we have made with ourselves, unknowingly creating obstacles that limit us from achieving our goals. This small guidebook outlines the agreements we must make with ourselves to transform our lives from limiting to limitless, scarcity to abundance, and mediocrity to excellence.<br />The Four Agreements:<br /><br />Be impeccable with your word:<br />Recognize the power of your words and use them in the direction of truth and love.  When interacting with others or your team, speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.<br /><br />Don't take anything personally:<br />Understand that other people's behaviors are a reflection of themselves.  When giving feedback or advice, it's important to remember that no opinions are truly objective.  We all have our own biases that are reflected in our statements.  There is no such thing as true objectivity, by never taking anything personally, people can really limit their ability to see their own negative patterns and biased thinking, and work on developing more healthy patterns and clear-sighted thinking.<br />When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.<br /><br />Don't make assumptions:<br />Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Stress is created when people assume they know what other people are thinking without checking with them. Understanding that other people might have different motivations for their actions, even drastically varying worldviews, and remembering to really try to understand others and discuss these motivations before jumping to conclusions about their behavior, can go a long way toward preventing interpersonal conflict.

B00192IV9U|4.0|If you are reading this review and expect me to comment on pseudo-intelligent topics such thematic cohesion, pristine production, etc covered by 'expert reviewers' (most of whom by the way probably never liked MJ) I'm sorry but you will have to look elsewhere :)    I'm an MJ fan who grew up with his music and followed him ever since Thriller was released. So let me be very clear from the start; after taking into account everything that's gone on in the artist's life (and after) I think this new album is simply superb.     Even the multi million selling albums \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" included tracks that would be considered by many less than great but I must admit this one manages to keep a very high overall standard.    \\"Hollywood tonight\\", \\"Monsters\\" and \\"Breaking News\\" are pure floor fillers whilst the ballads on the album are not as mushy or sentimental as previous efforts. \\"Best of Joy\\" is rather pleasant on the ear while \\"Much too soon\\" is short (2:49 mins) and sweet.     \\"Hollywood tonight\\" reminds me of a cross between \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"Jam\\" while \\"Monsters\\" is a worthy \\"Thriller\\" part 2. 50 cent (who am not a huge fan of) does a decent job on this track.  \\"Breaking News\\" reminds me concept-wise \\"Leave me alone\\" but is much, much better in every way.    I'm not a huge fan of Akon so I can't really comment on \\"Hold my hand\\" as am negatively biased. But will it be a hit? Undoubtedly!    \\"Behind the mask\\" may remind some tempo-wise \\"Black or white\\" in some parts but the similarities stop there. It's a superbly put together track with a great Saxo intro and the screaming fans.    Now, I wanna talk about this whole of issue of whether some of the tracks are fake. I find that very hard to believe. I find it hard to believe that a corporation like Sony would even open itself up to potentially thousands of lawsuits (in case you don't know you can sue for 'misrepresentation'). I find it hard to believe that from over 200 unreleased songs Sony would risk including even half a song that is not sung by MJ himself. True, his voice sounds different on some tracks - particularly \\"Hollywood tonight\\" which incidentally doesn't rank high enough on the \\"Disputed tracks\\" list - but I can show you a dozen of older tracks where the texture, pitch, etc of his voice is different. I think it's just a matter of time before 'previously unreleased video footage' from recording sessions prove that all 10 tracks are genuine MJ. I think most of the conspiracy theorists are those who will probably not be buying the album anyway.    I'll be interested to see how many singles are released from this new album. If it was released in the pre-internet era I'd say at least 6 singles would go straight to the top.    Enjoy!
0439023521|5.0|If the person you love most is given a death sentence, would you take their place? Sixteen year-old Katniss does in the novel, The Hunger Games (Scholastic, 2008), by Suzanne Collins. Every year, twenty-four children between the ages of twelve and eighteen are chosen to compete in The Hunger Games. There is only one winner--the rest are dead. So when Katniss' little sister Prim gets chosen, she volunteers to take her place in the Games. Fortunately for Katniss, she is used to fighting for her survival, and she soon realizes she may stand a chance. But now she must face the thought of killing or being killed--can she kill the boy who once saved her life? Can she survive all the other contestants and worse, the arena itself, which seems out to get her? This book is thrilling and almost impossible to put down. The suspense is exquisitely torturous, and is complemented by scenes of such heart-rending emotion that readers will be biting their nails one moment and sobbing the next. The ending is satisfying, leaving readers with a feeling of conclusion, but still aching for more. Thankfully, there is a sequel, so readers who can't get enough of Hunger Games can have another taste of the thrilling life or death adventure. Who will try to kill Katniss next?

0061730335|5.0|When William Kamkwamba responded to a disaster in his community, he began down a path of processes so thoroughly traveled that they were put in words and diagrams in the middle of textbook chapters, stuck in page margins, buried in appendixes.  Students elsewhere in the world also read those chapters and noticed the diagrams.  While these students may have been completing comprehension questions or filling in answer bubbles, William tested his comprehension by trying to generate electricity from objects around him.  This is not a story about progressive methods of instruction, nor is it a light-hearted story about a statistical outlier to whom we cannot relate.  It is a story about a boy who could not be harnessed by low expectations or the threat of future of struggle.    While aspects at William's schooling may have distracted him from achieving the goal that is the feature of this book, it was after William's family could not afford school fees that he began his experiments with mechanics.  However, as his windmill increasingly drew attention, an ominous message was given to him by a local professor - despite the amazing achievement and its dramatic benefits for his local community, the world will not long tolerate an innovator without proper titles and certificates.  In his time without access to schooling William had received an education, but he had missed the course credits and exam scores that in many ways kept his classmates ahead of him.  In the epilogue, we learn that through the help of donor funding, William has been able to return to schooling that promises to be more challenging and better-suited for his vision.  With the added encouragement, perhaps he will be able to continue to direct his education and harness schooling to work for him.  May we continue to be inspired by William's contributions, and become less attached to the acronyms added to our names.

B0037KMHRY|4.0|I've been a Daft Punk fan for about two months now. I reviewed \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" by Deadmau5 and an interesting discussion followed. Amazon reviewer P. Harper said: \\"Gary! Gotta go with Daft Punk!!\\" Well, OK. That seemed like a good suggestion. I ordered a packet of two live recordings, mainly because I've never been to an electronica concert and have little prospect of doing so. To put it simply, the \\"Alive 2007\\" disc is one of the best live concert recordings I've ever heard. Hence, my recent interest in Daft Punk. In looking over their other available selections, I noticed a \\"Tron Legacy\\" soundtrack album was due out on December 7. If you haven't heard, the music is by Daft Punk backed by a 90-piece orchestra. Hmmmm, that might be interesting! I was reminded of the Metallica \\"S&M\\" album where Metallica was backed by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. It's  a very interesting piece of music, I might indicate. Anyway, the \\"Tron\\" series of movies is not something I'm familiar with. I bought the CD for the Daft Punk music.<br /><br />I'm not totally satisfied with the disc. The music is well done, the recording is excellent and it's a very interesting piece of work. I think there's no doubt that it will get an Academy Award nomination and may well win. It's just that kind of a production. I guess my feeling was that it's too much sound-track orchestra and not enough Daft Punk. Even when Daft Punk comes in to play, the orchestra comes in so intrusively that it almost obscures the underlying Daft Punk music. Well, I'm sure they intended it that way and it's just a minor personal preference of mine to note. Overall, it's a dramatic and quite excellent album, but I just don't care for it nearly as much as I do for the \\"Alive 2007\\" disc. In any case, I'm definitely planning on seeing the movie and enjoying the music on a theater sound system in a cavernous auditorium. It should be awesome!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I very much enjoyed this series.  The basic premise is that of a dystopian Western in Space, where a totalitarian government has an iron grip on the most developed planets, and the less developed are left to fend for themselves.  These outer worlds are relatively undeveloped and most of the technology seems like a mix of 19th-20th century, and near future technology.  This is a series where horse-riding cowboys with assault rifles and space ships are found in close proximity.  One eventually gets a sense that the disparity of wealth is what's responsible for this.<br /><br />On the outer fringes, however, you see the dreaded Reavers, insane former humans who mutilate themselves and feast on human flesh, chasing anything that runs from them.<br /><br />So, caught between these forces is the crew from the Firefly, captained by a former resistance officer in a previous war against the totalitarian Alliance, and manned with a colorful bunch.  Several of the characters are enigmas slowly being unravelled.<br /><br />The series of course takes some getting used to.  This is not like other great Sci-Fi series.  It's easy to see a couple of episodes and give up on the whole thing.  Moreover the level of sex and violence in the movie is much higher than it is in other series I typically watch (B5, etc), and the violence is often more brutal.  I would not recommend this for family viewing.<br /><br />Unfortunately this series was cancelled after its first season, so the viewer is left with a sense that the author was just showing the pieces.  One wonders what would have been shown about River, Book, the \\"hands of blue\\" folks or the like.  This is really too bad.

0061730335|5.0|\\"I try, and I made it.\\"  These words, spoken by William Kamkwamba, a young man from Kasungu, Malawi, Africa, should be an inspiration to all.  Told in broken English as he stood onstage at a TED conference, William relayed his tale of perseverance.   His story is one of hope, initiative, and love for learning.  For fourteen-year-old William, inspiration came from a junk yard and a library book. Despite the jests and jeers of others, he began collecting remnants from old cars, discarded machines, buried PVC pipe, and his father's bicycle.  He put the windmill together one small piece at a time.  With the help of his friend, Geoffrey, he hoisted the blades up the wooden structure and attached it to the top.  The excitement and rush he must have felt when he finally connected the wires!  His invention worked!  He had harnessed the wind and made electricity for his family's home.    The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, written by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer, could be beneficial in many ways within a classroom setting. This book is careful to not only show the successes achieved by William, but also his failures.  His persistence and unwillingness to give up led to his dream of creating electric wind.  High school and middle grades could read this book as a literature set, while upper elementary students could read excerpts in order to understand the hard work, determination, and positive attitude displayed by this inspiring young man.  It could be used to explore the African culture while comparing and contrasting the American school system with that of Africa.  Providing a free and public education in the United States is one of the greatest advantages that our country can give to our children.  Unfortunately, many students have become immune to its benefits.  Too many see school as a hassle that they are forced to endure.  Kids in William's country see school as a privilege.  They seek knowledge and realize that having an education is a gift that not everyone can have.  The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is an excellent book and should be a used to teach goal setting, hard work, diligence, and ultimately--triumph.
B00192IV9U|4.0|LONG LIVE THE KING!!!...Ive been waiting for some real new MJ music for 9 years now and i finally get it in 2010...I want to start this review by stating a fact...MJ is easily, by far the worlds greatest musical artist to walk this earth ever...there is no one that even comes close (besides MAYBE The Beatles, and thats a pretty big maybe. I mean MJ owned them, literally). And when MJ died on what turned out to be one of the saddest days (if not THE saddest day) in musical history, not only did we loose one hell of a musician, and probably the greatest we will ever see, we also lost one of the greatest human being in the world. To say there is a void in the music industry now is a large understatement, mostly because that void is impossible to fill, and never will be filled. No matter how good of artists Usher, Chris Brown, and Ne-Yo turn out to be, none of them will ever be able to even come remotely close to what MJ was able to achieve musically. Don't get me wrong, Usher, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo and all the other possible new MJ's are all talented, but the music Michael Jackson made was one of a kind, and no one on this earth has anywhere near the ability MJ had when it came to making the best Pop/Soul/R&B music this world has ever heard.     The thing that I think people may sometimes underestimate about MJ's talent was that not only was he SHATTERING records and setting trends in the US, but he was also that big in every other part of the world. I mean, he is probably one of the very very very few people to exist on this planet that I feel like 99.9% world knew who he was. Like can you think of the last time you heard someone say \\"Who is Michael Jackson?\\"...Ive never ever heard someone utter those words, and if I ever did hear someone say them, id have a strong urge to slap the hell out of them(Not trying to promote violence lol), though I wouldnt. Who's the last artist you can think of that sold approximately 100 million records of one album? I can't think of anyonebesides MJ when he release the groundbreaking greatest album of all time in the epic, Thriller. There's never been an artist so influential as MJ, that when he would release even just a single (Let alone when he'd release an album) the entire world would go nuts...There's absolutely no competition when it comes to the who's the best artist of all time question, because without a single doubt in my mind its Michael Jackson, which is why June 25th 2009 will always be remembered as one of the saddest days period, in this worlds history...AMEN!!!lol     Sorry about that but it had to be said...Now onto this new album...First off, ever since this albums first press release in the form of the promo single \\"Breaking News\\", there has been a lot of controversy about the album. Even dating back to when the King first passed away, people were speculating whether or not we would even see another new MJ album, and even if we did get to see it would it be the same? And would it be right for unreleased music of his to be released without his blessing? Everyone knew that he had been secretly working on new music for a while even before he passed but no one knew when it would be released or what it would sound like. So when the first official release of a new MJ song appeared in November in the form of \\"Breaking News\\", needless to say expectations and demand was high. But when the promo single was released it was met with a lot more skepticism than fans and critics would have liked. The biggest thing that was causing a stir about the song, was that some of MJ's close family came out and questioned weather or not the song really featured true MJ vocals. And then after that happened before you knew a ton of people (fans and critics alike) were questioning the songs authenticity, specifically the vocals. And because of that, the album from the start kind of caught a little bit of a bad rap. Now I don't want to say for sure weather or not that is indeed Michael on the song because there are parts in the song where im almost 100% sure its Michael, but then there are some parts that im not so sure, like with the voice vibrato. And I will be the first to admit that the vocals do sound a bit questionable, but with that said, there are a lot of things that need to be taken into consideration when judging this song, and the album in general. One of them being that, yeah his voice on \\"Breaking News\\" and a couple of other songs on the album may sound different than we are used to, but you also have to remember we havent heard new MJ music in almost 10 years, so it is to be expected that his vocals could have changed/worsened a little bit. Especially considering he was almost 50 years old when recording some of these songs in the 2007 Cascio recording sessions, which produced three of this albums tracks including the latter, \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" and \\"Monster\\", all of which are under speculation. Another thing that needs to be remembered about this controversy is that even though Sony/Epic Records is notoriously know for being a very shady and sly record label, even they wouldnt risk releasing a supposed Michael Jackson record if it wasnt truly him on some of the songs. Let alone release a single if it wasnt him on the vocals because if they were really trying to get away with releasing a Michael Jackson album that wasnt truly a MJ album, wouldnt you think they would try to hide the songs that featured an impersonator's vocals instead of releasing it as promo single? Thats just asking for a huge lawsuit, and possibly get the label shut down, if not it would for sure tarnish the labels reputation. And even though Sony is very shady, they arent that stupid to risk that...Honestly I do truly believe that all the songs on this album are in fact Michaels songs, and feature his vocals. I can see where there could be some speculation, but i truly believe its Michael Jackson singing on all these songs. There might be some background singers added in here and there,and like I stated earlier, his vocals may have taken a bit of a slide as well due to him aging. It's a shame to because this album has caught a lot of flack for this controversy and honestly the Michael album isn't bad at all.     The thing that people have to try to realize and stop doing, is comparing his newer albums (Invincible and Michael) to his older classics (Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad). It's not fair to do, and if thats the way people are going to look at all of his future and newer albums, than every new album that gets released is going to be looked at as a disappointment. His newer albums are going to be a lot different than those past classic records, and you can't expect any artist, not even MJ to duplicate those three masterpieces. It's impossible, and we are lucky to have gotten those three amazing albums back to back. The style of music has changed sooooooo much since then it wouldnt even be fair to have those records in mind while listening to his newer stuff because it's a completely different style of R&B/Pop. It's still R&B/Pop, but it more modern which is to be expected, because hey, he's releasing an album in 2001 and 2010, not in 1979 or 1983. Music evolves, just like everything else in life, thats why its not fair for us to expect it to stay the same as back then. But if people can get past that like i tried to do, than Invincible and Michael a like, are pretty enjoyable albums... Michael isn't a classic by any means, but the fact that it's new Michael Jackson music is good enough in itself. And there are still some great, if not classic songs on this album. Although the album as a whole, does kind of have a thrown together feel to it as each song is completely different from the last one, and there doesnt seem to be any sort of theme to the album. The artwork for the album also is kind of lacking, except for the cover. With that said though, there are still quite a few gems on this album. Like the funky Dangerous like \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", and the uplifting anthem \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" produced by Tricky Stewart complete  with a choir. The remake of \\"I Like The Way You Love Me\\" is also another standout track, and while there was lots a controversy surrounding the track, \\"Breaking News\\" is another MJ classic as it too, similar to \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", reminds me a lot of his Dangerous days. And on \\"I Can't Make It\\", he channels a vibe very similar too the rock feel he had on \\"Scream\\". And the first official radio single released \\"Hold  My Hand\\" is also another signature Michael Jackson track with its inspirational feel, even though it sounds more like Akon featuring Michael Jackson. But my favorite track on the entire album would have to be the jazzy uptempo track \\"Behind The Mask\\", which is the most vintage MJ track on the album, which is also probably why its the brightest song on the album...Overall, Michael is a lot better than I was expecting it be. And I think a lot of other people are feeling the same way. Coming into the album, people (Including myself) were expecting the worst, but in the end the albums does deliver. Even though its nowhere close to Off The Wall or Thriller, its still a very strong addition to the greatest artist of all time's already bolstering discography. If there was a 3.5 star option that is what I'd rate it, but i gave him the extra half just cause it's MJ!....R.I.P. Michael...            Grade:  B-
0441009425|4.0|Revelation Space is a great, ripping read (or listen -- I listened to the Audible version). If you want complex characters dealing with bigger-than-life alien entities and ideas, this is a book for you.<br /><br />Excavating the 900,000-year-old Amarantin civilization on its home world, Resurgam, archaeologist Dan Sylveste discovers evidence of a group of Amarantins that discovered spaceflight. This happened at the same time that the Amarantin sun flared strongly enough to wipe out life on Resurgam. Could the two be connected? Sylveste, who built his career on intuitive flashes of brilliance, thinks so, and his monomaniacal obsession becomes the backbone of the book.<br /><br />However, the book introduces two other groups of characters -- a group of (mostly) cybernetic space travelers on the spaceship Nostalgia for Infinity, and a woman who is a combat veteran-turned-assassin on a world where the idle rich arrange to have themselves hunted as a form of amusement. These groups are all interconnected, and their paths converge.<br /><br />The ending is brilliant. However, there are some shortcomings ...<br /><br />1) Reynolds follows one of the increasingly common conceits of modern fiction ... introducing characters and plot drivers long before he gives you the background and context to understand them properly. Many of today's authors do this, but I'm not a fan.<br /><br />2) The reader of the audible version, John Lee, sometimes (not always) drops the volume on the last word of a sentence. That was really annoying<br /><br />3) These are complex characters,and all flawed ... in fact, so flawed that I had problems finding someone to root for and identify with. The most sympathetic character (to me) is the dead, electronic copy of Sylveste's father. Some people will want to empathize with Khouri -- but she's a ruthless assassin for cripes' sake. This novel would be improved by more likeable characters. Still, it's a great book. You'll be hooked.

B00005ATQD|4.0|This is a most confusing and puzzling film by a major director.  I saw it on the big screen in first release (with the black figures inserted to avoid seeing the sex directly) and again yesterday in the unrated home DVD square version.  The unrated version shows naked intercourse between several couples but the action has such exaggerated gyrations as to remind one that these are actors trying to look like they are doing an orgy.<br />There are many problems with the film and hardly worth seeing except as a historical addition to your Kubrick knowledge.  The sex scenes are not worth the effort to obtain them because free Internet amateur porn is much better if that is what you want.<br /><br />Characterizations:  Problem number one is the Doctor Bill character (Cruise)acts like he never had a human psychology course and has only a teenager's idea of adult sexuality.  Thus, he shows no insight into himself nor his wife's fantasies, frustrations, or the natural limits of any marriage.  The wife (Kidman)almost rises above the bored rich housewife role from Sex + City shows, but only whines her way along, again showing no self insight nor even the beginnings of knowledge about human psychology.<br /><br />Plot:  Cloying and toying with viewers titliation of seeing Kidman's great (and total) skin, an \\"orgy scene,\\" and a blue colored fantasy intercourse scene does not make a great movie.  The orgy scene is a teenager's idea of same and shockingly embarrassing to Kubrick mentality.  The \\"forget it\\" scene around the pool table really exposes the stupidity of two mature adults...New Yorkers no less... agonizing over what any man of the world would have dismissed.  This is just what some deluded guy thinks the rich do with their spare time.  The \\"suspense\\" such as it is, subplot... did the girl get killed?... calls for either the police or a confrontation of the stupid emptiness of Dr. Bill's morality.  The plot, in sum, is unbelievable, contrived, and of a teen mentality.<br /><br />This film does not add anything worthy to the issues of upper middle class (and rich) emptiness, sexual boredom/fantasies, or other things falsely claimed for it.  My take is that an old man director wanted to be in charge of a room full of fully naked beautiful women before he took The Big Sleep.  And, they are amazing bodies!add anything worthy to the issues of upper middle class (and rich) emptiness, sexual boredom/fantasies, or other things falsely claimed for it.

B00192IV9U|5.0|For the people saying that this album isnt MJ it is. I did research on it and Epic which was MJ's Record Label when he was alive is owned by Sony so Technically its got to be his voice on the music even if it was tweaked just alittle bit. Nothing is perfect but its still his Legacy and I will support it till i die.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!  Not that long ago, I was in great shape, but have been finding it hard to find the time over the past two years or so.  I researched workout videos and saw that this got rave reviews and figured I could at least spare 20 minutes a day for it.  Originally I thought that it couldn't be that great of a workout if its only 20 minutes, but still it was better than nothing.  Well, I haven't been able to move for 2 days after doing it for the first time!  And I'm only on level 1!  Once I can move again, I can't wait to do it again!  jillian is motivating without being annoying, and the fact that it is chunked into 3, 2 and 1 minute chunks makes it possible to get through the video even when it feels like its impossible.

0545123275|2.0|A truely horrendously bad teen paranormal romance.<br /><br />As child, Grace was attacked by the wolves who live in the woods behind her house, but saved just in time by a yellow-eyed wolf. Even years later Grace watches for the yellow-eyed wolf, and it seems that he is watching her, too. But after a local boy is attacked and apparently killed, the town turns against their local wolf pack. Anxious for her wolves, Grace interrupts an impromptu hunt on her way home from school and unexpectedly runs into an injured naked guy. When she looks into his yellow eyes, she's sure he's her wolf.<br /><br />Grace and her wolf, Sam, fall instantly and easily in love. Trouble is, these werewolves aren't subject to the moon; they're human in summer, animal in winter. And, eventually, they just stay wolves. Equally troubling, the boy everyone thought was dead has actually become a werewolf, and his reckless behavior is threatening to expose them all.<br /><br />Among the most amusing atrocities in this terrible book are: (1) Sam's completely awful teenage poetry sprinkled indiscriminately throughout, (2) The absolutely unapologetic sickeningly sentimental relationship between the lovers, and (3) the fact that no one in this small town seems to have noticed the huge group of dudes who all spend the summer together in a giant house outside town (as someone who grew up in a town about this size, can I just say, this is not the kind of thing that would go unremarked).<br /><br />That said, it's fun as well as stupid. I'll probably read the sequel.

1936594293|5.0|\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"<br /><br />With that incredible sentence Jane Austen draws the reader into her story. Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"<br /><br />How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?<br /><br />Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?<br /><br />The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"<br /><br />Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.<br /><br />Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.<br /><br />When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'<br /><br />[...]d.'<br /><br />[...]
B0043RT8JU|5.0|John Green has done it again! I was captivated by page three and could not put this book down. The tale of Margo Roth-Spiegelman and her neighbor \\"Q\\" is one of woe and mystery. You follow the pair on a night of shenanigans and wake up to a mysterious disappearance.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy read. It was quite a nice break from my normal fair of epic trilogies and romances.
0460110241|5.0|Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.<br /><br />But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but naïve! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"<br /><br />From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.<br /><br />Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.<br /><br />Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's `beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.<br /><br />For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.<br /><br />Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.<br /><br />The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.<br /><br />When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.<br /><br />And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.<br /><br />Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.<br /><br />The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way.testable.

0240816250|5.0|Mammoth of a book, this is almost beyond coffee table size but it's a treasure trove for people who are passionate about photography. Definitively not for beginners, this dives right in and deals with developing black and white film with various methods. It's also full of gorgeous photographs, many of them racy nudes. I will be lending this to my boyfriend as he's the photographer in the family to see if he can use this to expand his knowledge on the subject.    This is also perfect for people who are good with chemistry and developing their own film. A+

B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|I really like this music. The Black-Eyes Peas are a real and up-coming group. They are immensely popular as shown by their standing-room only concerts. I downloaded the MP3 song and listen to this song on my computer. Very enjoyable!!
B003NFM3JU|1.0|We rented \\"Disney's A Christmas Carol\\" with plans for a family movie night but soon realized it was way too creepy and scary for our kids to watch. They didn't even argue about having to leave the room since they had lost interest in watching it from what they had seen in the very beginning. The ghosts were extra creepy and Scrooge was more unlikeable than ever with no redeeming qualities at all. The voices were so over-done and heavily accented that the dialogue was difficult to understand. Very, very disappointed in this movie. I didn't even care how great the animation looked, I just wanted it to end. I'll have my kids watch the Muppet's Christmas Carol instead.
B001NXDSLQ|3.0|The myth is so powerful about Woodstock that I was struck by the difference between memory and reality.  Woodstock is mythic as being a music concert, of which music the \\"Woodstock\\" film is ostensibly a record.  And that is how I remembered it: as near-non-stop music.<br /><br />The concert was 24/7 for three days and nights.  That's a huge amount of music.  Turns out that most of this film is about the event -- there is actually very little music in it.  The end credits name only such as Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Canned Heat, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, and perhaps Santana.  And that is accurate: there really is very little music in it; most of the film is visuals of the event, and interviews with some there, and others reactions to it.

The main characters, music business mogul Bernie and his one-time assistant Sasha, are totally believable and offer a mirror on a generation that came of age in the 80s. The structure of the book, jumping back then forward, serves to highlight the character elements of the stories of interconnected lives.  A really fun read.

B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie tanked at the box office which is a true shame, I imagine the name didn't really inspire anyone and doesn't really carry the impact that is the atom bomb locked in this amazing film. The music is great the fight scenes are like anime/video games/comic books with real fighters and amazing visuals. The film has a deeply visceral quality but keeps it clean with the video game influence. Anyone who loved the era of fight games, is a gamer, likes anime, or graphic novels and heroes should definitely check this move out.

0375703764|5.0|This book is within my five favorite novels that I've read so far.  It's a very unique concept and it is executed beautifully.    I highly reccomend that the reader pay attention to the details scattered throughout the book, they complete the story.
B000YJ85BI|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Old Man's War and mostly enjoyed The Ghost Brigades (I thought it was weaker than Old Man, but enjoyable in its own right), but The Last Colony was just okay.    * Small spoilers *    The story revolves around Zoe, now a teenager, who is just too perfect to be believable (at least as an adult reader).  That a teenage girl saves the entire universe from civil war when no one else can (not to mention, makes friends with the werewolves that have been eating the other colonists) stretches the bounds of credulity.  The book reminded me of the Eclipse series in tone and depth of character (which is to say, pretty much none), especially for the characters from the previous books.    Jane was reduced to June Cleaver in her calm, reasoned interactions with Zoe (come on, what kind of mother of a teenage girl never raises her voice?)--an emotional capability you have to question given that she's not much older, chronologically and emotionally, than Zoe herself.  She's still, apparently, the super-soldier, but all of that action takes place off-stage.    Overall, I'd say the book is nominally worth reading, but I'm annoyed that I paid the same amount for this one as I did for the previous two.
030746363X|5.0|UPS dropped off my copies (1 for me and several for gifts) of The 4 Hour Body and I sat down with it in the dimming afternoon light and my afternoon cup of tea. Well, despite an advanced reading of the table of contents before I ordered-this book is not what I thought it was going to be.  Not at all.<br /><br />Usually, when I get a fitness book, I digest it in a day and exclude what won't work from my experience as a certified fitness trainer (NSCA) and as a long-time athlete and then shelve it or whatever. Tim's new book is surprisingly different and frankly, it's really going to take me awhile to soak it all in and prepare a worthy review.<br /><br />But so far, I can say that this book will not gather dust on my bookshelves. The 4 Hour Body is a fitness tome for students of maximizing life. No hyperbole. Once again, Tim Ferriss has presented a revolutionary method to efficiently improve our lives in a significant way. The only two things I can add here are: Congratulations on an extraordinary job, Tim! And thank you.<br /><br />P.S., You will not be sorry to buy and read and re-read this substantial book.  I have several hundred fitness books and this book, The 4 Hour Body, and a select few others like The Purposeful Primitive and Kenneth Jay's Viking Warrior Conditioning will remain on my desk for continual reference and review.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|As good an album as the Beatles ever made.  Revolver, Pepper, the White Album and Abbey Road probably get discussed more than this one.  The Beatles song writing kept getting more sophisticated w/ each album and this one has aged rather well.  Their earlier material is still enjoyable to listen to, but the target audience for many of those songs were 13 year old girls.  This album is for adults, w/ more refined instrumentation and substantially heavier lyrics.      One of the great albums ever made.  Highly recommended.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Before I started this book I read some of the reviews.  One gentleman suggested that the word \\"shrugged\\" was way over used.  I forgot all about it and dove in.  I'm only 25% of the way through and while this is a good book the shrugging was getting to me too so I did a count using the search feature on my Kindle and OMGosh that word is used 132 times! (Give or take) Otherwise the book is quite good. Welp, back to shrugging oops I meant reading. : o )      ************************    I originally stated that this book has the word shrugged in it 132 time but boy did I do that search wrong.  Its actually used 300 times.  I was counting the number of pages it showed up on.  Some pages are a shrug fest but its still a good book.  Its a slow read and I admit I'm reading another book when I get shrugged out and then I find my way back.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this series.  It's when my daughter and I sit down and watch tv together.  It's funny and creepy at the same time.  Sam and Dean make us laugh with every episode!  It's different form the same ole same ole out there.  Season one builds up all the back story you need to fully enjoy the later seasons.  It starts out after two years, Sam Winchester is suddenly visited by his big brother Dean, who insists he helps look for their father John who disappeared on his latest 'hunt' for poltergeists.  We never miss a show!

B00009W0U4|3.0|I can't really give a review,as I have yet to find the time to watch this movie. I have only seen a few previews from it, but looks to be very graphic in nature,and from other reviews not for faint at heart.
B003INBNXO|3.0|There has been quite sometime since I watched a great fight film, for my tastes the genre had ceased to be appealing. After watching Ipman, I think I will give it another lease.<br /> Set in 1930's China, Ipman is about the life of the Wing Chun master (Donnie Yen) who is only known to us because of his famous pupil Bruce Lee but let me tell you the teachers life was no less exciting. Ipman is a wealthy but kind and a generous man and one of the best martial art experts in his town. The invading Japanese army reduces the town to rubble and confiscates his house. He is forced to work in the mines. The commanding Japanese general is a martial art lover but also a pervert. He invites mine workers to come and fight him or his troops in return for a bag of rice. An incident happens and Ipman with great reluctance has to defend himself by fighting the general.<br />Ipman is a great film and along with the fights which are awesome there is a storyline. Some portions are silly in the script such as the uprising of the factory workers against the bandits but I have seen many Asian films and such story props are commonplace. I enjoyed this movie. 3 stars. 12/1/10
030746363X|5.0|Let me start with the most obvious concern people have when they see the kind of promotions and claims Tim Ferriss makes. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. I can relate to the concern because that's what had held me back from exploring the ideas in Tim Ferriss' first book '4-Hour Workweek' until early 2010.<br /><br />When I realized the truly profound consequences of Ferriss' ideas in the 4-hour workweek, I slammed my head several times for having missed the simple logic behind his marketing. If at least one idea, among the many ideas in his book, works for you partially, you will easily make back 5 times the amount you paid for the book. And your body, like your time in the 4-Hour Workweek, should be worth at least that much to you.<br /><br />Ferriss is not proposing a miracle pill nor is any particular aspect of his proposals 'novel'. You need to put in the work to achieve the results he promotes, much like you need to put in work to get to the 4 hour workweek. What then is different with the 4-hour body? The 80/20 rule and the guidance Ferriss provides to help you get there much faster rather than possibly not at all.<br /><br />Ferriss claims that 2.5% of the total effort provides 95% of the results and his job is to identify the critical 2.5%. Why the new book appealed to me a lot is<br />a) the methodology Tim adopts (very smart personal experimentation galore)<br />b) synthesis of the results of his experimentation.<br />I can tell you right away that neither step is obvious and requires plenty of creative insights.<br /><br />I have benefitted from the posts on Ferriss' blog on diet and rapid muscle gain. It works. I put on 15 lbs of muscle in ten thirty minute workouts. Not quite what Tim achieved, but it's by far better than what most fitness experts suggest is possible. Now please don't write back to me telling me I was on steroids. :) I believed there was plenty of room for improvement over the results I achieved and the material in the bookhelped me identify it.<br /><br />Here're a few other standout contributions of the book:<br /><br />1. The behavioral side of a body transformation or performance.<br />2. Slow Carb Diet-Five rules for cutting body fat with a lot more detail in the book-Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates,  eat the same few meals over and over again, don't drink calories, don't eat fruit, take one day off per week<br />3. Specific steps to minimize fat gain while bingeing<br />4. 15 minute female orgasm-find the Upper-Quadrant Point of the Clitoris, and Stroke Lightly--for 15 minutes<br />5. Improving time to sleep, mood on waking up using tracking and simple hacks.<br />6. Introduction to polyphasic sleep (2 hours a night) and how it works.<br />7. Reversing injuries-supremely handy but a commonly ignored area by a lot of fitness professionals.<br />8. Hacks to extend life without compromising quality of life.<br /><br />I haven't yet paid attention to the other parts of the book on running faster and further, swimming, etc. As Ferriss writes, the book is big enough to club a baby seal with. :)<br /><br />About the inconsistencies raised by some people, I see their point but I do not consider the book perfect, nothing in the real word probably is. Many of the alleged inconsistencies arise in the form of case studies and guest writings. Ferriss makes the point quite often in the book and elsewhere, quite accurately so, that we do not know everything about the human body (making the book doubly hard to write) and there are multiple paths of achieve similar looking results. Additionally, there is no harm in learning a valuable lesson from a case study even if the case study as a whole is not worth emulating (because he was on steroids, growth hormone or whatever).<br /><br />The book itself can help you rediscover all the facts for yourself or prove Tim Ferriss wrong if you choose to. It's all out in the open and you will not find a single instance where Tim tells you it's true because he told you so. Would I recommend that someone check out this book? If there's even an ounce of dissatisfaction with your current state of the body, this book might be just what you need.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|The Prince does a very good job acting.  The sands of time is basically like back to the future with old sand desert fighting in Persia.  There are a couple very cool scenese like the knife throwing scene and the rooftop scenes I really enjoyed.  If your a fan of action and suspense, I would recommend this movie, it's worthy of 5 stars.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|this was a great deal! got it as a gift for somone and was like brand new! was soooo happy with it.
B0035V35P8|5.0|This movie has a lot of blood in it, but as a Ninja movie this is a given.  Some pretty gruesome parts, but nothing that any other horror movie hasn't already shown.  Not a movie for kids though, for Mature audiences only.  Now that's out of the way, this movie was fantastic.  Superb and I mean superb Ninja fighting action.  Moving in the dark, stealthy, and fast action paced moves.  Very good movie.  Most of it was Ninja action and the end was just fantastic.  A great movie for any Mature adult who likes Ninja's or Street Fighter.
1934137197|5.0|Tinkers was a surprise read for me - a library checkout that turned into multiple purchases - for my library at home and for other book worm pals.  By far THE BEST read for me in a long time - SUPERB writing!  Simple yet GREAT story.  Easily secured a spot in my TOP FIVE all time (and I'm OLD) favorite reads!
1433502410|5.0|Biblical studies is far from an exact science.  One reason is because many issues simply cannot be resolved.  For example, which of the four gospels was written first?  Most scholars would say Mark.  But, for those of us who have looked into the question, it's apparent that the traditional answer, Matthew, has a good deal of support as well.      In the end, though, we can't say for sure.  Underlying each position is a foundation of assumptions that may or may not be correct.    The same difficulty extends to questions of historical and textual reliability.  A complicating factor is how one's view of the Bible colors their opinions on specific matters.  Those who regard it as the inspired, infallible word of God go to great lengths to explain, or in some cases explain away, apparent contradictions and tensions between the scriptures and insights from archaeology and science.    On the other hand, \\"liberal\\" scholars often go to the opposite extreme.  They jump on anything that looks inconsistent and say it's just another example of the text getting things wrong.      As someone who likes to know all points of view, I recommend this study Bible as an outstanding work of conservative scholarship.  The professors and researchers who put the ESV together are legitimate academicians, not televangelists or popular writers.  The reader will get sound, substantative commentaries on passages, insightful articles on the world the Bible was written in, and rational attempts to resolve textual and historical problems.    In my personal studies I make a point of using it along with more \\"liberal\\" works.  For those interested in pursuing the same course, I suggest The New Interpreter's Study Bible as a left leaning counter-balance.  The Harper-Collins Study Bible as well as the Oxford Bible Commentary are fine choices as well.  The combined use of the ESV with with one of these other works can make Bible study a fruitful endeavor for those willing to challenge their own preconceptions, whatever those may be.
0307473473|5.0|I am not the typical detective type reader, I read mostly science fiction, but this book was great! The twists and turns will leave you wanting to read the next book. I highly recommend!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love everything about this series! I'm a woman, so can you say EYE CANDY? Plus, the plot twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for the next season!
0812550757|4.0|The second book of the series was definitely a little more mind-bending than the first. This book was good but a bit slow at times and the lengthy descriptions of seemingly non-essential items were off putting. Overall, a good book, but no where near as entertaining as the first.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|this heat sink is a must have! I used arctic silver 5 with this monster on my i7 920 and MAN what a diffrence. my idle temps went from 63c to 35c  !!!  Under load during long hauls of game play (COH, crysis, NFS HP 2010, 3dmark van, prime95) my 920 use to reach 95c now it doesnt go above 65c  !!!  With that kind of breathing room i can finally overclock my processor.  I have a DFI lanparty X58 jr and had no issue mounting this beast although it was a tight squeeze getting my banana hands into the case to plug in connectors and drop in screws but over all the entire install took less than an hour to remove my mobo and reinstall it.  I have a LIAN LI PC-A05NB Black Aluminum case which mounts the mobo upside down and pushes the air flow from back to front which is perfect with this monster....  I also have a zotac gtx470 amped and a zotac amped 8800gt for physics and those are also running between 5c and 10c cooler than before.  buy this heat sink if you think you can fit it in your case, you wont regret it!!    use with this case, its awesome!!!    http://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-PC-A05N-B-PC-A05NB-Black/dp/B0029KWUIO    just wanted to update with my latest overclocking, iv been able to push my i7-920 to 3.92ghz(187x21) default voltages (pcie 107mhz) with this cooler. processor runs fairly warm under 100percent load now but is blazing fast and stable.  when i run the intel burn test bench with \\"maximum ram used\\" setting... my processor gets up to 83c (thought about lapping) and at idle it hovers at around 46c however under intense gaming for hours at a time it doesn't get above 68c (dead space 2).  Im happy with these temps and might lap the proc and heat sink if i can find a successful how to for this particular heat sink.  might be neccsary by the time summer gets here, dont think the living room will stay at 68f even with the ac running 24/7.
030726999X|5.0|I typically find that series typically have a book that is a filler and does not advance the story. With this series I am greatly impressed with the way the author managed to have a different objective for the characters within every book while maintaining each character's quirks and attributes. Overall a great series and a fun and exciting read.
0307276902|1.0|Frey is an example of everything wrong with America. He's a movie educated jacka$$ who uses stigma inducing stereotypes about people with addiction issues to make money. He presents them in a cartoonish fashion and the Oprah loving public swallows it whole with no critical thinking or reasoning whatsoever.
030745455X|5.0|The book starts off with a bang and leaves you on the edge of your seat for the duration. I found myself more involved in this book than the first and it continues the story seamlessly, though it does take some interesting turns.
B001QWBM62|1.0|UPDATE:  Reader Steve pointed out that one of the problems I had with this piece of junk can be solved by recording at 48khz instead of 44. I tested and he was helpful. So Amazon product reviews gives better tech support than Zoom. So thanks to Steve I'm not 5 seconds out of sync at 52 minutes... but I'm still six tenths of a second off. This is unacceptable for use with video. I still hate this piece of junk, but it does a good job of recording audio using the mic inputs. So I might give it three stars if it was more reliable and had useful tech support. I still give it zero stars.    ORIGINAL POST:I bought the Zoom H4 to record audio for some videography gigs. Go to find out that the audio plays back faster than the video... that is, all my video cameras play back at the same rate, and mpgs I get from other cameras play back at the same rate, but the zoom plays back about 1% too fast, which means the sound is about 1 second off every 2 minutes. This is documented and can be found on the web, but Zoom tech support somehow isn't aware of this, nor does \\"they guy who should know\\" return calls.   Major downgrade to rating because of dismal tech support.    Also, the thing needs new batteries every two hours and the dc converter quit working after a year. Moderate downgrade to rating because of poor reliability.    Stay away from this company. Far away.
1589795474|4.0|I read this book with a good bit of apprehension as I thought it would be the typical motivational blah blah blah. It was surprisingly good and well supported by the facts and figures present within. I come from a middle class family, but was raised in a predominantly \\"upper class\\" community. This book is dead on with the differences in wealthy people and those that are stuck in the rat race. I see with many of my friends that this book could have been written about their family and contrasted with my upbringing. Overall, a very enjoyable read and I would recommend to all walks of society, millionaires and broke people alike.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|The case shows a little bit of damage, but all the content is in perfect shape, this is a movie that u should have in ur library!
B000002J5K|5.0|being a teenager in a school surrounded by teens that listen to lady gaga, justin bieber, the saturdays etc (dont get me wrong, a little bit of gaga at the right time is brilliant but still) this is a haven from the terriable music being crammed into mine ears against the stomach of my sense. this is the greatest movie soundtrack ever created and likley ever to be created, these many artists, and when i say artists i mean that they actually sang meaningful music that they made themselves, not like today with the people portreying an immage and just sponging off of someone elses song writing 'talent'. anyway where was i, these artitists are the best of their time and alongside others opitimise this type of music and it makes me wonder why anyone would listen to anything else.    i cannot convert the whole world to this kind of music, hell, i can't even convince my friends that they should listen to it, but you dear reader are possibly on the edge of a life changing decision, to buy or not to buy? (i have just been writing a shakespeare essay, can you tell?) please make the correct one and listen to this instead of what you might have done.    amazing. 5 billion starrs!
1401224253|5.0|In every sense of the word, masterpiece describes this novel. A completely engrossing and exlporative way to engage with classic heroes and villains, Red Son is simply incredible. Buy it. Put it on a mantle. Tell your friends to do the same.
B0046IGOIO|5.0|I was waiting a couple of years for that fanatstic release, which was already partly available in lousy quality on various european bootleg CDs.

1416595546|4.0|When in the future, historians and pundits start to analyze, compartmentalize, dissect, dismember, remember, codify, speculate, formulate and emasculate the Soviet Union, they will find that the book has already been written.  Simon Montefiore has endeavored to put all of the major milestones into this tightly packed book.      Already the danger of 'romanticizing' the Soviet Union and especially the period during the rule of Stalin, has begun.  Sure he killed millions of people, and he originally wasted over 5 million soldiers at the beginning of World War 2, but hey nobody's perfect. But to understand what it was like to hear the sound of the 'black maria' driving around, and the knock on the door in the middle of the night;the 'disappearance' of all the \\"Old Bolsheviks\\" this is to know Stalinist Russia.  To those who grew up in the West it's unimaginable unless you grew up in Nazi Germany or Franco's Spain.  All of these feelings are well expressed by Sashenka and her family.    Probably the most important part of the book is the part written at the end, where the truth of what happened to Sashenka is 'dug' up.  Already in 1994, five years after the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, the NEW Russia was beginning to sanitize what the \\"Party\\" did.  For those who know and lived the truth, it was a Party that you didn't want to be invited to.  Events will fade and memories will compact and fail.      Few people write about what it was like to live in Europe during the Napoleonic Wars.  We read some about France but no one writes about how the 'regular people' were constantly having their lives turned upside down every time a 'peace' was made after a major battle.  Poland came and went more than once, the Rhineland was compacted, divided, shared, conscripted, raped and pillaged, more times than during the 'Thirty Years War', but that's look at as a sideshow.      The suffering of the Baltic Republics, Ukraine, Belorus, Rumania (Bessarabia and Moldavia) are easily forgotten and overwhelmed by events like WW2 and the Cold War.  Books like this preserve some of the memories.    Zeb Kantrowitz
0307455874|5.0|Everyone who thought the president would govern somehow differently than he has, did not read, or did not understand, Chapter One of this book. All the answers to how he is a caring, hopeful man are found within these pages. Some say he's the most liberal president, or even a socialist. They are simply projecting their own frustration with the economy and the changes in our nation's fabric and moral role the last 10 years or so. Because just as many think he is too centrist and too willing to compromise. However, the man never claimed to be a radical, here especially, as he lays out so eloquently that change also has to come from within. His story should resonate with anyone who needs hope in finding their way in unclear times.  It's very refreshing to read such optimism in a book about one's life. There's certainly enough negativity in print these days. He calls for us to put down cynicism and heal our old wounds. More politicians need to quit picking at old scabs and find what unites us. That alone will make us stronger and able to find middle ground. He certainly has a way with words and knows how to lift spirits. Isn't that what a good book should do?
B001ILHY1I|4.0|Mix one part Mad Max with one part Running Man, throw in a dash of The Longest Yard and just a hint of The Fast and the Furious - and voila - you've got a great popcorn flick called Death Race.  This is not Shakespeare.  But if you like fast cars, big explosions, and some eye candy thrown in for good measure, there are worse ways you could kill two hours.  The future is a grim place with unemployment at an all time high and prisons run for profit by corporate entities.      One of the ways they pay for these super-max facilities are pay-per view races that pit prisoners against one another in souped-up, heavily armored battle machines.  If a prisoner can win five races, he wins his freedom.  Our hero is a man wrongly accused of a murder he didn't commit.  But he takes on the challenge to win his freedom and reunite with his daughter.  This new incarnation is loosely based on Roger Corman's B-movie classic, Death Race 2000.  The DVD is packed with testosterone and includes both the theatrical release and an `unrated' version of the film that includes a couple of extra minutes of footage that provide an extra minute or two of thrills.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|I know I'm in the minority here. I turned this movie off part way because it was incredibly annoying. I didn't like the comic book-like sequences because they were incredibly strange and bizarre. I've seen other movies turned comic book ala Superman, Spiderman, etc. At least those movies had characters who had noble causes (out to save the world, e.g.) and made you root for them.   I have no idea what to make of this little nerd who is doing 64 punch combinations on his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. The plot of the movie by the way, is for this little nerd to fight off 7 of his girlfriend's ex's.  The only redeeming value this movie has lies in it's action, music, and entertainment. None of the characters are inherently funny so don't expect laughs galore. This movie is not unlike Jackie Chan's movies whose entertainment value come more from onscreen theatrics than a good solid plot.  One interesting tidbit about this Blu Ray: you have the option of watching a storyboard in one of the pop up menus. So you have an idea of what the director looked at before filming. It's not the official storyboard because it doesn't have a lot of the instructions included in the pictures like camera angle, pans, zooms, etc. which is what you would find in the real storyboard.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great Movie!!  I saw it 3 times in the theatres.  Each time I pick up something new. No it is not The Dark Knight or Memento and it is slow in some spots but the acting and the direction are excellent. I think this is way different than anything that Hollywood has put out in a long time. It is not a \\"check you brain at the door\\" movie!  Nolan was trying to make people think about what was being presented and not simply spoon feeding the audience.  Can wait to get it on Blu-Ray!!
B0044XV3R8|3.0|First off, I didn't buy this on Amazon, but felt the need to review.  I purchased Avatar on Bluray from Amazon when it came out, loved it, but wanted to get a copy with all the extras, and yesterday walking through the store on my way out I saw a display for the Avatar 3 Disc Extended Collectors Edition. I was in a hurry, so I grabbed one and was on my way.   After getting it home and opening it to watch, I realized I grabbed the DVD version. Oh well, I would watch it and give it away when I got the Bluray version......  Now I don't know if this is standard practice or not, but it really frost's my ...... well I am very un-happy that in order to watch any of the three versions you must switch discs half way through the movie. Seriously??   I don't generally buy \\"Fantastic 3 Disc Super Collector Mega Re-release\\" sets, and if this is common practice, I won't be doing it agian.    But.....  I was suprised how much I personally enjoyed Disc 3 though, seeing everything that went into Avatar from the first thoughts about doing it to the the completed film was fantastic.   So it wasn't all bad ...... Disc three is great in my opinion, I just watched all the extra scenes, and the deleted/un-finished scenes straight from Disc 3.
6305781427|5.0|Used DVD was in perfect condition!  Anyone buying from this seller should feel very confident.  The DVD is great to watch because you get the feeling of the musicians and it makes it that much better.  A definate MUST HAVE for Yanni fans!!

B002BU0DPE|5.0|Bought it for 63.99 about 14 dollars cheaper then from the store. Im an amazon prime member so no shipping cost and there is no tax so i saved over $20. Product works perfect, and packaging was great.
0060936223|4.0|I enjoyed this biography/autobiography for the perspective of the times, the New York scene, and depth of Patti and Robert. I spent plenty of time on the internet looking up people mentioned, listening to various music, and enjoying Robert's photography. A life of fame doesn't come easy to everyone and this book underlines that theme.

030746363X|5.0|I walked into a bookstore and didn't leave until the sun went down.  This book definitely is not to be cover to cover.  Choosing the right chapters that apply to your tastes or needs will make this book a permanent fixture in your library.  The many case studies and the pacing make 4HB readable.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Would have been better if, instead of doing a cameo, Iron Mike Tyson played the role of himself in the movie and went against the Italian Stallion.  NOW That would have been a movie!!    This was surprisingly a decent movie.  It was done like the first rocky, not over the top.  the ending credits were cute showing a bunch of people fans running up the stairs in rocky fashion.  was funny as hell.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|All of the discs were in good condition, however, I didn't like how they were in the toy box.  There was nothing protecting them except for a little foam on each side.  I have put them in cases to avoid scratches.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I'm so excited about everything that came in this set.  I don't know if I can wait until Christmas to give this to my mom.  Growing up, I can remember always listening to \\"The Boss\\".  My mom would never buy this for herself because she would not want to spend the money on herself.  This is the first time in a long time that I have bought her a gift that I know she will absolutely love.
B001FB55H6|2.0|While the effects are great...it gets bogged down. It maybe somewhat faithfull to the comic but it just lacks. It had all the makings to be a great movie..budget..the dark feel. Yet as for myself I really do not care for the sex scene..okay so he went to pound town on her? Do I really need to see...no.    It is visually stunning but other than that...it is best as a rental. Due to the fact that it drags itself forward it has little replay value to me.     Yet if you can get it for 8 dollars it's a solid deal.
0316098337|5.0|I don't care what anyone says--this was an astounding book. It is disturbing, partly because the subject matter is disturbing, but also because the narrator is 5 years old. By that same token, some of the blow of the material is softened by being seen through the lens of a child. The book is simultaneously heartbreaking and heartwarming. You feel every frustration and fear of both mother and child. You truly care what happens to them, root for them, and are awed by them. In short, Donoghue is a gifted writer.    I do not understand criticisms about the story being ripped off of true events. Yes, there have been women kept as sex slaves for years. Yes, some of them have had children. That doesn't mean that the author used those women's specific experiences for novel fodder. At least, no more so than ANY author uses any real life experiences/news stories to base books on. What else would they be based on?? Such a ludicrous claim.
1439152780|5.0|I'm a huge Kate Morton fan, and her new book \\"The Distant Hours\\" does not disappoint. Great characters: great women characters that are so well described that you can see them in front of you. A good mystery...well, several good mysteries...that get pieced together going back and forth from the mid-1990s to the english countryside during WW2. And finally, like in her other books, Morton explores family dynamics and really what it means to be a family, and what are our roles in and obligations to our families? This book is so hard to put down. Highly recommend.
0316069485|4.0|Connelly writes an entertaining book that includes investigator Harry Bosch and his step-brother attorney Michael Haller.  Haller and Bosch work together to prove a man who has been behind bars for 24 years is in fact guilty, as DNA evidence requires a new trial.  FBI profiler Rachel Walling also makes a brief appearance.<br /><br />This book is a typical novel by Connelly but it falls short of his best.  It is definitely interesting but lacks the substance and depth of some of his better novels. I don't think any readers will be disappointed at all, and I recommend it.

Its not easy for cartoons to catch an adults attention without being perverted and I am glad Toy Story is a clean fun family movie. With a niece and nephew running around this is a great movie for them to watch while i sleep.
B004D82B70|5.0|I have been in LOVE with this show since the Pilot in 2005. I don't think you can find another show anywhere like it. It has all the elements that make a show Great. You have the big dysfunctional family fall out after the boys lose Mary and John goes absolutely bats*** crazy Hunting for the \\"Yellow Eyed Demon\\". It amazes me that Dean is still the strong one, even after everything he has had to do and put up with all for Sam. When they switched things up and added in the Angels, especially Castiel (Misha Collins) I was blown away!  He still keeps us all guessing, especially about himself and Dean, plus that \\"special\\" relationship, The link that still ties them together ever since he yanked Dean out of Hell. I cried when Dean died, I cried when he came back and I totally lost it at the end of Season 5 \\"Swan Song\\". I was so upset when Lucifer snapped Bobby's neck and that assshat snapped his fingers to kill OUR Castiel.<br /><br />When Chuck is seen at the beginning of that Episode writing about the Impala, Dean's one true Love, we all grabbed tissue boxes and settled in for what we knew was going to be one Amazing episode. The final shot of Sam and Adam falling into that swirling vortex to hold Lucifer and Michael, Dean's broken and shattered heart as he kneels staring at the spot where he lost HIS Sammy. Chuck all clean and leaving us ALL wondering when he just disappeared, Was he really God?<br /><br />Season 6 has been strange to say the least. As a community, us Fans have been reserving judgment until we see the whole package. It's all about the whole package. We will keep watching even if (God forbid) this is the last Season, and hold out hope that we see more of Castiel as he fights Raphael for Heaven , I want to know more about the \\"Missing\\" Heavenly objects. Maybe then I'll be happy, until the Season ends I WILL keep watching.<br /><br />This episode was so great and different, especially the opening sequence. The fact that UFO's and Fairies were involved had me hooked regardless of how they did it. If you are a \\"True\\" fan, then this one is some necessary comedy relief. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it to watch. I will now be waiting (NOT so patiently for the Show to come back on Jan.28th) and I know they will NOT disappoint.of how they did it.

B00005LOUP|3.0|I am a huge fan of Jim Carreys work. This is the first film Ive seen of a Grinch of any kind and Im sure the Grinch was a bit meaner than this. Anyways its an ok Holiday film. Ill be keeping it because of Jim, but honestly its too much \\"fantasy\\" for my taste.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Sem sombra de duvidas, é o melhor seriado de comédia dos ultimos anos ! Em Blu-Ray então... perfeito !   Recomendo !
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie rocks!! i love Woody Harrelson, hes always been one of my favorite actors so i was so glad to see him in this role.<br /><br />Jesse Engleberg (i know im spelling it wrong) was ok<br /><br />Emma Stone was HOT AS HELL, oh my god<br /><br />Abiligail Breslin, whatever, she was ok.<br /><br />I just wish they would have concentrated more on zombie killing and maybe alittle more gore, but thats ok...it wasn't meant to be a horror flick and less focus on the attraction between Jesse and Emmas characters. Oh yeah and the cameo with....maybe i shouldnt tell...oh god, it was BILL MURRAY (like everyone doesnt know already know) was okay but it kinda dragged out while they were in his house.<br /><br />All in all, it was a fun movie and i really love the \\"RULE #1\\" thing going on in the movie....AWESOME!!<br /><br />The intro scenes and the blaring of Metllica make the intro one of the coolest intros to a movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />Part 2 is suppossed to be coming out in 2011 sometime, so i really pray to god they don't mess up the original with a stupid sequel.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|An outstanding movie, Kate Winslet confirms her acting reputation, her portrayal of Hanna as a young woman in early 30s and later as an aging lady is quite remarkable. The scene where she asks the Judge in her way of a simple person, quite impertinently \\"What would you've done?\\" is unforgetable. The erotic sex scenes on the beginning of the film are delicate and quite explicite to give a realistic impression. Her phenomenal peformance is complimented by Ralph Fiennes. The film follows the book by Helmut Schling closely and the characters are so well chosen that memories of the fiction become alive while you watch it. This is a must for your collection.  Joe Neustatl
0440178002|5.0|The book was published in 1975, I must have read it around that time the first time. Now I have read it again and it has lost nothing of its fascination for me. Maybe I enjoyed different parts than the ones I did at first reading it. And I really do not know enough Japan and its history to be able to judge on its authentity. I admire most its skilful way of treating the cultural differences, at the time, or still existing?!
B003F3NDWG|2.0|The first season was cool.  During the second season, I realized I was losing interest, all the plots were the same.  Sorry, but I guess others feel this was a really good series.  And I do too, but simply lost interest in Season 2 and won't see the rest.  I guess this is why it never went on like other series for 6-10 years.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|This by far is their most popular mainstream album, but it is by no means there \\"Best\\" album.  They have a whole other world of music behind this album.  Still an OK album, just because its the KEYS.
B000005J56|5.0|This collection of musicians from another era in Cuba were brought together by Ry Cooder -- some of them in their 80's and 90's, very nearly lost to us.  THANK YOU RY COODER!!!  Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo and the great pianist Ruben Gonzalez were essentially found and brought out of retirement for this recording; Omara Portuando, wonderful in her own right, adds her own flavor and color to the revival of the lively music scene in pre-communist Cuba.  The musicians are unforgetable.  Cooder's recording inspired Wim Wenders' film of the same name, luckily for us;  the above-mentioned musicians (except Portuando) had passed away a few years later.  This cd is totally inspired.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|Am I the first to say \\"If it Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It?\\"  Josh, Josh, no, no.  Your fans love you for the music that is clearly from your heart.  A thousand singers can do what you are branching out to try, but there is only one and will always be ONLY ONE -JOSH GROBAN.    Save (most of) the songs here for the shower and please don't wander from your truth.    You are SO LOVED.
0425166805|2.0|This book reads like an old science fiction book - at least until you get to all the Pyramid conspiracy theories.  Read as fiction this book is not good in any sense, but it is enjoyably entertaining.  But the author does not intend his book as fiction; he expects you to believe all of his absurd claims.  He takes a few minor but interesting archaeological anomolies and then proceeds to create an entire alternate history for the world with zero evidence.  If there was any evidence for his claims, then Von Daniken could publish his hypothesis in peer reviewed scientific journals, but there is no evidence.  Just a crackpot who made a lot of money by writing a series of crackpot (but mildly entertaining) books.<br /><br />To read a skeptic's debunking of this book check out [[ASIN:0879751983 Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions]] by James Randi.  There are logical solutions to the historical problems Von Daniken presents us with.  Many of these \\"mysteries\\" already have naturalistic answers without resorting to extraterrestrials.  Others of these anomalies we may never understand, but that doesn't make Von Daniken's wild theories correct.
030758660X|5.0|VAMPIRE KNITS: PROJECTS TO KEEP YOU KNITTING FROM TWILIGHT TO DAWN capitalizes on the vampire frenzy sparked by Twilight and other books to present projects inspired by vampire settings. From black scarves and 'bloody socks' in red to a truly innovative scarf tinged with rivulets of red 'blood', this packs in a wealth of innovative projects perfect for needlework knitters seeking something different.
1577314808|5.0|Mr. Tolle spent two years sitting on park benches and simply \\"living in the moment\\" prior to writing this book. I doubt whether I will ever take the time in my life to do such a thing, however the suggestion he offers that we all spend a ridiculous amount of time either worrying about the future, or dwelling on the past has impacted me in a huge way. Until I read this book, I never noticed how in sane my mind can make me if I choose to let it. Tolle implores the reader to take the reigns of his own mind, focus on the beauty and love around him, just like we all did when we were children and the world was full of wonder. We are still in that same world, but our vision has been clouded by meetings, appointments, paperwork, debt, clocks ticking, deadlines approaching, past frustrations and disappointments, the list goes on and on and on if you let it. Tolle suggest that we have the power to focus on this very moment, as it is the only one we really have. The past is past and the future is not here, and may not ever come. A very enlightening book. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to improve the quality of this moment of their life.
B0002O06N0|4.0|This is just another great album from The Black Keys.  This album has some more addictive beats and style.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|I am so glad this album got a proper 35th Anniversary release. I first got this one on vinyl in the late 80's while discovering the magic of Tommy Bolin and I actually think this version of Deep Purple was the most interesting. The line-up, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Ian Paice, Jon Lord along with new guitar hero Tommy Bolin are so talented its scary and the material is very strong and definitely holds up after 35 years. The first disc is a remaster of the original album but the second disc is the reason to buy this version as the songs dont fade out and you get to hear the tracks all the way to the recorded end which is amazing on songs like 'Gettin Tighter' where you get another 50 seconds of Bolin and Co. shredding. There are also 2 bonus tracks with one being a complete song minus lead vocals and a almost 6 minute jam between Tommy Bolin and Ian Paice which smokes! I heard that when this was first released a lot of Purple fans did not give it a proper chance because Richie Blackmore was gone, but I do love this album and believe it to be one of the best from this time.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|My family and I absolutely love this movie. The Minions, IMO, are the stars of this film. But the 3 little girls are quite adorable. My only real issue is i purchased the \\"Despicable Me (Minion Madness DVD Double Pack + Digital Copy) (DVD)\\". Per all the instructions, no Digital copy transfer comes from either of the 2 DVDs. This package did not come with the actual \\"Digital Copy DVD\\", but the packaging states \\"Digital Copy\\". I emailed Universal support but after 2 days, no response.
B00453YBE4|5.0|Life-time Judas Priest fan!  I have not been as crazy about \\"some\\" of Rob's solo stuff but this album is unbelievable!!! My, oh my!  An incredible mix of everything he has done in his career.  I hear a different Rob Halford album in every song.  Not too hard and not too soft!!  If you love the older works then this is sooo worth it!
159562015X|4.0|This book gave me a very detailed look into who I am in the sense of indentifying and then explaining some of my strengths, and helped me to focus more on those strengths to accomplish more in my professional life.
B002GU605G|5.0|Excellent cd. GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT. Very informative and interesting. It was a very pleasant surprise. Glad I bought it.
B000063WDH|4.0|This is some of my favorite Black Keys material.  Great take on Blues Garage Rock.  Just another album in their big list of great albums.
B00006JMQG|1.0|This film is unwatchable due to flickering and the interludes are difficult to read. Don't bother unless you are a true diehard silet, German noir fan and have to say you've seen every one out there.
B001LF347E|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  DVD's are excellent and the bonus DVD has tons of great behind the scenes information for any Merlin fan.  Gotta have them all!
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|read the first two in paperback and the last on my kindle.  Loved hearing all the Swedish words that I had fumbled with and the story was good to
0312370849|5.0|really interesting book about a very dark history in france. it is a work of fiction, but it is apparent that there is a lot of research for accuracy. i believe books like this are important reminders of a very dark and twisted time in the human race, and as we loose more of the survivors of such events, we must continue to discuss and highlight the tragedies and destruction that the human race is capable of. great read, two stories intertwined. i wasn't able to put the book down.
B00275EHJG|3.0|It's not that the movie isn't good, it's just that I bought it for my (just under) 2 yr old who LOOOOVES toy story 1 and 2. However, the 3rd one is way too dark, evil and scary for such a young kid. I guess they wanted to make this one \\"older\\" or something, but not sure why it had to be so evil. We stopped it and wouldn't let him watch it anymore. Will save it for when he's older. Just be advised for the wee little ones!
B00008O31H|4.0|In this album, \\"The Keys\\" might have went too far with their quest to sound scuzzy and old school.  I found that the recording was distracting from the music.  Sounds like they recorded it in an old bathroom walled with subway tile.  Still really great music as usual.
B0040QYROA|5.0|This is the one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Amazing to see pre-WWII German filmaking at it's finest. This is a wonderful restoration. No blinking. Amazing soundtrack. A must see for any Sci-Fi,Classic film or history buff. Really, a movie that everyone should see.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|I bought this product for my brother's 18th birthday. It was all he had been asking for all year. Not being able to find it anywhere and get it for a reasonable price I bought it on here. It was still in the packaging and was in good condition. My brother was speechless when he recieved it and has been watching every since. The product shipped and came at a fair time also.
0545128285|1.0|I love Harry Potter, but this book was just not worth the money. I finished it only because I felt a need to complete it before getting rid of it, not because it was worth reading. You're better off just checking the book out from the library, and if you just happen to love it then purchase it. It's a short read. And it's a creative concept, but I got nothing from these stories. I guess they're not meant for internal reflection, which is what I expected with the marketing as a type of Grimm's Tales for wizards. I wanted a creative book that coordinated with Harry Potter but would impact me in some way other than the passing of time. I guess I should have never expected that from a teen's book (though I've read other teen/children's books that have impacted me emotionally/morally/mentally). I'm annoyed at myself for thinking this book would be more than a marketing ploy to make money off the Harry Potter name. This is just a novelty book to have in your Harry Potter collection, not a book that can be appreciated alone without reading the Harry Potter series.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Definitely not for young kids. I like the characters, the setting, and the suspense. Each episode ends with you wanting more.
B000JIHP88|4.0|We originally bought this mobile in 2007 for our now 3yr old daughter, she LOVED it so much that we left it up until she could unscrew it from the crib (about 15mths).  The music is perfect for soothing very soft & slow and the motion is engaging enough to grab their attention but subtle enough to lull them to sleep.  Also the battery life is decent, in use every night & 2 naps a set of batteries would last 4-6 months.  Even after being in use that long it was still in great condition so we took it out for our son (2 months old) but he does not appear to be a fan.  Possibly he'll like it as he gets older but for now even the soft music & motion is too stimulating for him and gets him worked up rather then soothed.  A simple heartbeat generator w/ no motion or light soothes him best, so I would say no matter how great the product is know your child & what works for them. [BTW the 3yr old still loves it & doesn't understand why it upsets her brother!]
B000F2C87Q|4.0|This short album was a tribute to one of Dan Auerbach's biggest influences, which is Junior Kimbrough.  These songs are covers of Junior's originals.  Great Album.
0525951652|1.0|I read both his most recent books, Pillars and World without end and could hardly wait until this book came out.  I struggled through it.  The first chapter was good but from there it went downhill.  In fact, I didn't even finish the book.  I was about 97% finished and said, why?  Put the book down and walked away.  Very disappointing.  Will not buy the next two books.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|This is a great Poison album. They came back and showed everyone that the success of Look What the Cat Dragged In was not a fluke. They have real talent. This is the album that has their iconic ballad \\"Every Rose Has It's Thorn\\" on it as well. It is a hard rocking party album. It's great from start to finish and the definition of glam rock all the way.
1593272774|4.0|This is a nice book. The photography is fantastic in showing how to build various models. I purchased it for my son. However, we did return it after looking through it. We do not have a lot of the technic bricks that were required for the models. Also, I was hoping for more of an explanation of how the gears work together, it is all pictures but really nice ones! If you have a load of technic legos this would be a great book for you.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is a must see for a person who loves to see brilliant photography, the techniques used in this video are unique and very high end. I have so far not seen any such crystal clear macro photography mounted on a revolving stand, it's very dramatic and moving !<br /><br />However I would recommend you to buy the blu-ray format. One final line: It cannot be done any better than this !
B004132HZS|4.0|First saw it on PBS in masterpieces - AMAZING adaptation! Perfect bland of modern without losing the essence of Sherlock Holmes! An absolute success!~ Cant wait to see more episodes!
B0013K6WLM|4.0|This is probably the album where people actually started knowing the name The Black Keys.  It is getting more on their newer style of play, but still a great album.  Look to the Past for better stuff.
0393072231|5.0|This is a great story about the creation of the countless bad loans, the incentives that drove the bubble, and the inside story on those that saw it coming and figured out a way to make a fortune when realization hit.  What a fantastic book, you won't put it down and its an easy read.  Enjoy!
B001G9F9IW|3.0|While I think this movie is great and the video on the blu ray is also great, but the blu ray disk itself leaves a lot to be desired. First of all, there are absolutely no extras on the blu ray --- only the movie itself. And the audio is only available in 3.0 format, no 5.1 or 7.1. I have never seen either of these issues on a blu ray disc before. It is a disappointment in these two respects. Neither of these \\"deficiencies\\" are pointed out. The video and the movie itself are 5 stars.
B0043GXYBO|2.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed Twilight and thought maybe it would be similar.  It reads like a bad fanfiction, or maybe the author is a 13 year old girl.  Within the first 5 chapters I already had no motivation to keep going.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think teenagers would love it, given the vampire craze right now.<br /><br />If you respect literature or anything resembling well-written novels, just stay away from this one.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This album is a slow building Masterpiece.<br />By the time I got to the song named RINZLER I was bopping my head like it was a Hip Hop album.<br />A perfect Soundscape for the Visuals of TRON that Ive been seeing online.<br />I had my headphones on while on the bowl and expected the world be be blown up when I left the bathroom. lol<br />I gotta hear some more Daft Punk !!
B000GPIPD8|5.0|This is the Black Keys best blend of their newer techniques and style with their old school blues riffs from albums such as The Big Come Up.  A must have for Black Keys fans.
B000HIVOI2|3.0|The origins of the great pyramids of Egypt, indeed the great pyramids of the world's remain one of mankind's enduring mysteries.  How did the Egyptians sans modern building equipment and engineering tools build such enduring stone monuments?  How did the Mayan's, or the Cambodians for that matter?  The 1994 movie \\"Stargate\\", staring Kurt Russell (Backdraft, Forrest Gump, Vanilla Sky) sort of offers up a semi-plausible explanation.<br /><br />Story-Line<br /><br />Written and directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, 2012), \\"Stargate\\" open is mankind's distant past in 3000 BCE to be exact when I spacecraft in the shape of a pyramid visits Earth and stays a spell.  Fast forward to mid-1930's Egyptian desert wherein a stone tablet and huge round disc are found, then fast forward again to the mid-1990's wherein, said stone tablet is being transcribed and applied to the now semi-functioning disc.<br /><br />But help is needed in the form of one Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader ~ Sex, Lies, & Videotape, 2 Days in the Valley, Secretary) who uses an unorthodox method to transcribe the last of the ancient symbols and effectively kick-start the disc, now called a stargate. As it turns out the stargate is a trans-warp portal to other galaxy's and worlds.  Enter Air Force Colonial Jonathan `Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) who takes over the project, you know, just in case the scientist succeed.<br /><br />And succeed they do and off they go to another world where they find the Egyptian sun god Ra (Jayne Davidson ~ The Crying Game), holding sway over a planet not unlike pre-modern earth.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Even when it was originally released \\"Stargate\\" was great fun to watch.  No, it was no Star Wars, but then it did not pretend to want to be.  The story, while plausible, was not nearly deep enough to explain what was really going on in the story.

B00192IV9U|2.0|70% Michael. Three of the songs are obviously not Michael singing (other than added ad libs and bits from other genuine songs). I can't believe so many people are willing to believe it is him on &#34;Keep Your Head Up&#34; , &#34;Monster&#34; and &#34;Breaking News&#34;. Go listen to this Jason Malachi character on you tube and compare the vocals. OBVIOUS.<br /><br />There are some nice tracks on this album though (&#34;Much Too Soon&#34;, &#34; Best Of Joy&#34;, even &#34; Hollywood Tonight&#34;) but overall it's ruined by the scam.
159562015X|4.0|I decided to buy the book based on the recommendation of a colleague, who used the book and took the test in conjunction with a leadership training seminar.  The book proved to be very encouraging, and when I took the test and received my results, it was encouraging to know what my primary strengths are and also how they are ranked.    The more detailed descriptions of each of the 34 strengths were helpful.  I have yet to really begin to use the other on-line resources available.  However, as far as I can tell there are no descriptions of how the 34 individual strengths combine, and it would be nice to see something like this provided in the future.
030746363X|4.0|Tim is a good writer and the book is entertaining to read. It reads more like a good story than a boring diet/exercise book, which I like. However, it doesn't matter what Tim says or what the title of the book is, one thing that I learned is that there is no easy/quick way for anything. If you are looking to get muscular or loose weight, there is no magic pill, no magic book, no magic diet. Even if you follow all of the advice in the book to the letter, it still requires enormous amounts of dedication, planning and hard work. Sorry, but if you are fat and want to loose weight, you will have work your ass off, whether you follow the book or not. The title is obviously a marketing scheme. You are not going to get a perfect body in 4 hours eating pizza. Just don't be fooled by marketing. Otherwise, I think there is some solid advice in the book. Simply put, if you follow his diet for instance, you will loose the weight, simple as that. The diet doesn't sound that bad and you get to binge 1 out of 7 days. But you will also loose weight following hundreds of other diet regiments out there. Also, there is a lot of obvious advice but it is good to read and ponder on, because even though things might seem obvious to us, it doesn't mean that we actually do them. For instance, tracking our progress by recording numbers and measurements is not ground breaking by any means, but Tim explains how doing so can make you actually stick to your plan for good vs. quitting in few days. Seems obvious, but most of us don't do it and end up failing. Read the book, have fun, but don't expect miracle fixes because there aren't any.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I can't remember how quickly the product was shipped, but the case and all the DVDs were in perfect condition. I bought them new, so of course this is to be expected but doesn't always happen. I absolutely love the Star Trek series for the dynamic and comical trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy; the cheesy but often inspired story lines; and the endearingly low-budget set and costumes. I don't really love some of the \\"upgrades\\" made to the show in recent times (such as the redone graphics to make the various planets look like actual planets rather than rubber bouncy balls; and the addition of the occasional shuttle craft landing in the landing dock which were never present in the show as it was when it was first airing, etc., dinting the cheesy quality a little), but they don't bother me so much as to make me not spend money on the series. I basically just think they were totally unnecessary.    Anyway, I am totally satisfied. Great product!
0061730335|5.0|Everyone has an imagination, but most of us do not let our imaginations inspire and motivate us. William Kamkwamba did just that and The Boy who Harnessed the Wind is an excellent book that tells his motivational story. William has overcome hardships in his small Malawian village that most of us could never even fathom, but these hardships are what helped his imagination to go wild.     As a teacher, this book has reminded me how much imagination and enthusiasm children have, even without it being \\"forced\\" upon them at school, and it is my job to foster their knowledge to make this imagination become reality. This is an easy to read book, and would make a great read-aloud book, I think, for 5th grade and up. I hope to see William and his windmill become an inspiration for many others!
B001CD6MA6|2.0|For the first 20 minutes, there's a ton of flashbacks and the movie is slightly hard to follow. Flashbacks of Speed as a dark haired kid watching his brother race, then present day of Speed's dark haired kid brother watching Speed race. After that it mellows out with a plot. The Racer family racing team (that's their name) is bought out or hired by a giant multi-billion dollar company to race for them. Speed grew up idolizing his racer brother and is haunted by his brother's death in a race. There are a slew of rivals sponsored by \\"the Cartel\\" and a mysterious Racer X that fights against them.    Once the plot gets going an hour into the movie it gets much better with a lot more action. One fight in a hotel against a ninja is straight out of the Matrix especially with the musical score.    Everything looks futuristic but the Racer family home that is still retro 60s. The cars, buildings and planes are very sci-fi, but the cars still drive on wheels. The racetracks are a feat of computer generated imagery as they twist, turn, divide, swoop up when they curve and hover high in the air. It would make for a nice video game.    If you weren't a fan of the cartoon series, you or most likely your kids will watch this movie to see crazy car action. All of the action is cartoonish and not realistic. Cars jump, shoot, leap with robot legs and twirl in circles before regaining their composure. This will clearly miss the Nascar crowd and get the Dr. Seuss crowd despite cursing & violence.    The movie is so colorful that it becomes the star. In every frame I keep thinking \\"wow that's bright & colorful.\\" They could be speaking Shakespeare, but the color just gets in the way.    Every character is color coordinated like Scooby Doo, but maybe that's the mold of the cartoon. Instead of solving crimes, this is a family of racers and instead of having a dog, they have a monkey. The monkey is never explained, and is pretty much a partner in crime for Speed's kid brother. Even with John Goodman in the movie, everything remotely funny that happens involves the monkey & the kid brother.    The movie wraps up nicely after almost 2 hours. Sadly it goes on for an extra 30 minutes, making this movie feel anticlimactic. The bottom line is that you can skip this movie, unless you're entertained by bright & shinny colors.
1848568509|5.0|This title just come out in Sept 2010.  Is it really already out-of-print or just temporarily sold out on Amazon.com?  Borders and Barnes & Noble still have it listed, but at the regularly \\"inflated\\" price.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I love this series. I have read books 1-4 over and over again. When I saw HBO was shooting Game of Thrones, I wanted to read it once more before that series begins next year, so I grabbed the Kindle version.<br /><br />The amount of typos in this version is completely unacceptable. It was obviously transcribed and never even perused before being uploaded. It makes Bantam look bad, makes Martin look bad, and makes me so mad that I am having a hard time enjoying the book.<br /><br />The types of mistakes range from the most basic: a completely wrong word such as \\"he\\" instead of \\"had\\" or a basic typo such as \\"sex\\" instead of \\"ser\\" to the unexplainable: italicizing a word and splitting it into hyphenated syllables for no apparent reason. It is averaging an error each page near the end, as if the transcriber had checked out completely by this point.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, especially if this is your first time reading this amazing book. DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|This NOT a Killers album!  Once you accept the fact that this is an entirely separate project for Brandon Flowers, you're able to appreciate these songs and realize how great the album is.  Like all Killers fans, I'm ready for the \\"break\\" to be over, but if all we have to tide us over is awesome solo work from Brandon, then that's fine with me.  Now, I'm torn between waiting for the next solo album - and waiting for the rest of the band (Killers) to catch their breath.
0061730335|5.0|This book is the inspirational story of a young boy growing up in Africa.  William Kamkwamba overcomes all odds to make a difference for himself, his family and his people by building a windmill.  No one teaches him how to build the windmill, he simply experiments and uses whatever trash he can find to make it.  His only instruction comes from a few books that he can barely read from the local three-shelf library.  His efforts eventually gain him the recognition of reporters and technology buffs all over the world, and his story has a happy ending.    In addition to being a nice story of triumph, there are many powerful lessons taught in this well-written book.  I found the first-hand account of William's childhood to be very interesting - witch doctors, curses, the ignorance of HIV and the fight against malaria, hunger and the government.  William never gave up.  He has taught me to persevere and not only to be resourceful with the things that I have, but also to be so thankful for them.  William has helped many people to see a way out and a way to a better quality of life, no matter how little you start out with. Education, no matter how informal, is the one thing that can open doors for people around the world.     In order for education to be a possibility, we must continue to work on making sure that the people in our world have their basic needs met first.  I also think this book doubles as a call to action to continue providing assistance to others who need food, clean water, and shelter in Africa and other developing countries.
0439023513|5.0|To be short and sweet, I really loved this book, except the ending.  You'll realize why when you read it.    A bit too...rushed? cliched? But the rest of the writing, the story, phenomenal.   SPOILERS!!!:::    I cried when Katniss was remembering her father, (I miss mine too)...two words, PRESIDENT SNOW! one word, PRIM :(    All in all, a great ending to a great story. A must read!
0440422973|5.0|Love Skipping Christmas. I re-read this book every few years to help prepare the way for the Christmas spirit. I have passed this book on to parents, grandma, and the bookclub.
0307346617|5.0|I really enjoyed the raw, \\"realistic\\" feel of each story. Would not have minded if the book was twice as long.
B000025TI2|5.0|well this band was not known by me, Until a random search of music shows it,  but if you like tunes from tears for fears or camouflage, this guys sound pretty similar and perhaps better, somebody wrote here that this one, is on the top of his personal play list, I agree with that.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Basically a good CD.  Josh Groban's voice is SO fabulous, no release could stink but I really like the two Josh Groban CDs more.  WHY there are 2 cds - simply named Josh Groban, I don't know but they're better.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's \\"Black Swan\\" ingeniously merges the spectacle of dance with the base emotions of melodrama, two schools of theatricality that, if done right, are equally demanding. The result is a lurid, daring, and mesmerizing psychological thriller, one that's founded on the idea that the pursuit of perfection is not a matter of time or effort but of sanity. The line between reality and fantasy is at times easily distinguishable, but at other times is blurred to the point of sheer confusion. It challenges perceptions with questionable events and unreliable characterizations - which, I have no doubt whatsoever, were intentionally written that way. It continuously frightens us, and yet it lures us in with disturbing but beautiful imagery. This is the kind of film you don't simply watch. You experience it.    This could not have been an easy ride for star Natalie Portman. She and Aronofsky must have known that the film's success would depend entirely on her, for her character doesn't merely drive the plot but is in fact the plot itself. Not only would she have to be believable, she would also have to be willing to tax herself physically and emotionally - and numerically, assuming you choose to interpret her work as a duel role. She would have to endure six months of ballet training and body toning. It would be a commitment, not an acting job. She was clearly more than qualified to meet these demands; her performance is brave, complex, stirring, and nothing short of extraordinary.    Portman plays Nina Sayers, a New York ballet dancer driven by the need to be perfect. She practices rigorously. She rarely eats, and what little she does eat, she throws up. She auditions for the role of the Swan Queen in Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake,\\" which would require her to give a duel performance. The director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has already told her that he would be featuring her more this season. Still, there seems to be room for improvement; while he sees nothing wrongwith her interpretation of the innocent and elegant White Swan, he sees all technique and no passion with the devious and sensual Black Swan. More suited for the latter is Lily (Mila Kunis) a new dancer from San Francisco. She's everything Nina is not: Relaxed, outgoing, a little bawdy, and embracing of her imperfections.    Leroy, lecherous and creepy, tells Nina that she must be seductive as the Black Swan. She must lose herself in the role. She must be in touch with her own body. Nina would know nothing about this. She's cared for and encouraged by her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer whose expressions of love mask an alarming psychological fixation, one that fuels her artistic abilities and gives no latitude for privacy or trust. Into Nina's life enters Lily, who seems friendly enough but may actually be plotting to take over the duel role in \\"Swan Lake.\\" She eventually understands the plight of Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging ballerina who was once a great star but has now been replaced.    Nina, her rivalry with Lily doubling as a strange friendship, is ultimately consumed with revenge fantasies, ones that get increasingly shocking as the opening night of \\"Swan Lake\\" approaches. Little by little, her grasp on reality slips. For no apparent reason, a rash on her shoulder turns into a wound. Does she deal with the stress of attaining perfection by mutilating herself? Her reflection isn't quite in sync with her body - or perhaps it's the other way around. Events that seem to have taken place may not have. People who appear may not actually be there, and vice versa. The more Nina's world unravels, the more we can't stop watching; reality fades into a hypnotic dreamscape of primal urges. Some are deeply unsettling. Others include a lesbian love scene that would be frightening were it not so sexy.    Aronofsky visualizes Nina's descent in two distinct ways. One is through the use of computer-generated imagery, and while that may be expectedin this day and age (perhaps even required), it allows for the inclusion of specific symbols that are necessary to advance the story. The other is through the handheld camera work, giving the film an unsteady look. Close up shots are naturally jerky. He follows characters as they walk from one room to another. He circles dancers in broad, dramatic sweeps during major dance sequences. The images literally move along with the plot. This is what makes \\"Black Swan\\" some kind of bizarre masterpiece. It's a dark and shocking drama that stimulates the senses and plays on emotions.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|Got this case to hold my Nikon S3000. The case is great. It has a very modern look which most camera cases lack. Inside padding isn't thick but I definitely feel like the camera is well-protected. Haven't used the belt clip but that is a nice feature. My one gripe is with the snap closure. It is magnetized, which is great. But for that reason (I assume), the made the actual snap very shallow expecting that the magnet would hold it. Sometimes I feel like it isn't closed securely and would have preferred a standard snap. That said, I still love it because the streamlined design makes up for the closure issue.
B003GEDLW6|5.0|Simply put, out of all the CD's I've purchased this year (and that's a lot) this is my favorite.  Give it a try, these guys are good and this is their best.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Don't buy it for the digital download. The feature irritated me to no end. Better to have left it off completely than turn off buyers. It did not load the necessary program on a Window 7 computer. It did load the program on an XP Laptop, but then after entering the serial number it did not download the movie and did not let me try again. Worst program I have seen in a long time. Warner Bros need to dump that feature pronto. And word of advice to Amazon: Do not advertise the feature.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I love this movie and am happy to own it. It was just as funny the second time as when I saw it the theaters. For those who love the British sensibility, this is a winner.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|by far the best ps3 controller I've used.  Which is no surprise since I regard the xbox 360 controller the best console controller I've ever used.  Makes all of the ps3 games much more playable for me, especially first person shooters.
030746363X|2.0|I purchased this book on kindle and I'm not sure what all the 5-star raters were reading, but it must have been a different book. I gave in to the marketing hype and now am left disappointed. For the most part this book is just a collection of what many other EXPERTS have been discussing for years. Tim just put all the info into one location. Nothing is either new or revolutionary. Most of the information  can be found out there for free(paleo diet, stregth and conditioning info, prehab)with better detail. His diet was just him putting his own name on Paleo(only the billionth person to do this). If you want to follow paleo, you would be better off reading robb wolf. If you want to get leaner, stronger, or bigger go straight to the experts(dan john, elitefts, mark rippetoe, defranco, lyle mcdonald, pavel, bret contreras, christian thibadeau, etc, etc) not Tim. Think you are going to learn how to add an amazing 100lbs to your bench? well, just know that he is assuming a very beginner starting point on your behalf(200lb bench). This may be great if you're a beginner, but if you have been in the iron game for a bit, good luck following the program and putting 100 on our bench. If you are a beginner, don't buy a book go into the gym, work hard, eat like its your job, and read from the experts. Suddenly, the claimed 100lbs wont be so impressive. There were some interesting protocols that I want to try out( how to raise t-levels and sperm levels). Since I have yet to try them, I can't comment on their validity. ALl of the information on how to sleep better and polyphasic sleep can be found free online. Really I am not sure what is new information in this book. YOu are basically being charged for hearing stories of Tim testing these methods and some new ones on himself. It seems to me that this is Tim's last  book. That he was banking on hyping it big time, collecting money, and then riding into the sunset laughing at how dumb people were to give in. If this wasn't his intention and he plans to keep writing, then he is going to have to find a way to bring his followers back in because many many people are going to be disappointed with this book.
0439023521|5.0|Novels with dystopian themes have been popular for generations, and one of the newest, The Hunger Games, is worthy enough to merit a place among the classics. Written for teens, with adolescent main characters, the story will snag and rivet the attention of an older readership as well. The plot is straightforward: the American democratic experiment has failed, leaving the surviving population distributed among a dozen rigidly separated settlements, each region assigned to produce a specific commodity by the elitist, totalitarian government. To discourage rebellion, those in power sponsor the annual \\"Hunger Games\\", in which two teens from each settlement, selected by lottery, must compete in a diabolical, controlled wilderness, to be the last one alive. Every moment is televised, broadcasted to the populace, which is required to watch. Katniss Everdeen is one of the \\"tributes\\" from the impoverished District 12. A fierce hunter dedicated to keeping herself and her family fed, Katniss has never had the luxury of considering the feelings of others. While she is deeply afraid and reluctant to kill other humans, she vows to fight to the bitter end in the Games.<br /><br />Author Collins writes powerfully, so vividly that in violence and strategy sequences one finds one's own mind merging with that of Katniss, who is a strong, nearly archetypal female figure. Although only one other character is as completely delineated as she, the reality of the supporting cast members is nevertheless compelling. Collins ramps up the tension early, and never allows it to flag, even at the very end. But be forewarned: The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy, and the conclusion serves as a introduction to the second rather than a resolution.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0060558121|4.0|I've recently become a fan of Neil Gamon's work, and this is the 4th of his novels I have read. I must admit, it is not my favorite (Anansi Boys currently holds that position for me, which is actually a sequel of sorts to American Gods). What I'm discovering with Neil Gamon is that the first 100 pages or so are setting the stage for the things to come. With Gamon spinning his tales, it can sometimes take a while to \\"catch on\\" to the world he is creating. So that leaves you pondering who exactly these characters are, why a god's story is told when the character is not in the story (yet), and where is this all going? I found that after reading the first quarter of the book, suddenly things were starting to click, I was now understanding and deeply lost in this world, and then I was hooked. Pay attention to the details - Neil Gamon rarely mentions them without purpose, and the end of every Gamon book is a exciting reward.<br />I won't go into the plot here - other reviews have done so.  But I will caution readers that there is some language and some sex (1 very graphic, 1 fairly graphic - this coming from someone who does not read romance novels, so take \\"graphic\\" for what is merely my opinion - not overly seductive in his words, Gamon tells it like it is but he depicts it all).  The number of F-words was too much for my liking.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I first discovered Shinedown after hearing the song \\"Second Chance\\" somewhere along the line and I remember the first time I heard it, the song really stuck with me.  I decided to check out the album and have been pleasantly surprised that the whole disc is chock full of good material.  \\"Second Chance\\" remains my favorite song on the album and in fact I think it is one of the best songs by anyone in the past decade.  I rarely listen to the radio these days, but this is one song that deserves its popularity.  The rest of the album is all solid as well with a great mix of harder and softer material.  I see these guys sometimes get criticized for playing it too safe, but I think the fact that  they are able to walk that fine line between melodic and metal provides a nice amount of versatility while also keeping a signature sound.  This diversity undoubtedly turns some people off as they may not be heavy enough for hard core metal heads, but probably too heavy for fans of more radio friendly rock.  To my ears the diversity is a good thing with the band branching in several different directions.  This is my first Shinedown album, so I don't have any comparisons to their previous material, but \\"Madness\\" is one of my favorite straight ahead rock albums of 2009.
0439023513|5.0|My son loved this series & gobbled up all three books. They even pulled him away from his video games &computer
B00005OCMR|1.0|Wanted to buy this movie for my kids to see before heading off to the movies to see the new one. Yeah right! I will just wait till the price comes down or when Disney starts releasing more copies of the original. These sellers got to be out of their freaking mind to be charging hundreds of dollars for a DVD!! Just went to the seller Movie For Miles and read something they posted and by they way are charging a whopping 449.99 PLUS TAX.. Ridiculous!   Here is what they said about them.  \\"I believe in providing excellent products at reasonable prices with customer service equal to or better then buying direct on Amazon.\\"  Reasonable prices, yeah right! I got your reasonable!!
030746363X|2.0|I started reading this book and was enjoying it.  Nice writing style, interesting theories and things to try.  But this is not a novel where interesting and enjoyment count.  This is a \\"self-help\\" body transformation guide where results count.    I went in with an open mind and started reading the chapters on diet and fat loss, which I liked.  Nutritional science is not my specialty.    I then moved into the weight lifting sections.  Now I am no Arnold but I know a bit about iron.  I started noticing a lot of things.    Tim will mention powerlifters who bench 800 pounds.  He will fail to mention they wear bench shirts which add 100's of pounds to the total.  He will mention past powerlifting champions coached by Marty Gallagher who used linear periodization to build strength.  He will fail to mention the enormous amounts of steroids these specific powerlifters used.  One was even busted and ratted out fellow lifters.  Tim is not telling the whole story.  Just parts.      Little inconsistencies stood out.  You do not need to add mass to gain strength because strength is a skill.  Then some sections later the only way to get stronger is to add mass???  Huh?  Which is it?    He relates a story how he gained a lot of weight working out with High Intensity Training.  He mentions that he was detrained at the time.  It is pretty common to be able to gain weight quickly after being de-trained.  Very common and one trick that is often used in \\"before/after shots.\\"  Again - this is well known.  It looks dramatic but is just that, looks, smoke and mirrors.    It made me think - if he is leaving stuff out of the strength sections, the area which I know and am familiar with, what is he leaving out of the other sections? If he is not telling the whole story in the strength department, why should I believe he is in the diet part?    I started to notice other little inconsistencies there as well.  Calories in/Calories out is a flawed model.  Eat as much as you want as long as you dont eat A B and C.  Type of calories count.  Be careful with nuts because the calories in them really add up.  Do calories count or not?  Why do nut calories count?  Calories in calories out does not work.  Person A lost lots of weight counting calories.  Is he telling the whole story here or is he not?    His dad lost a lot of weight using the \\"slow carb diet.\\"  Is that the whole story?  He did not tell the whole story with other sections.  How do I know this is the whole story?  Another guy lost a lot of weight using cold water.  Lot's of fat people in Minnesota.  Why does cold work for his guy but not Minnesota?    I just get the sense that this guy is willing to bend things to make it look like the way he wants.
0880796863|5.0|I don't see anything wrong with this deck. It is my first deck and I chose Rider Waite because I read it is a good beginners deck. It comes in a nice box with a booklet. The cards are wrapped in plastic. Everything looked nice, no complaints.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|It's refreshing to hear an original band with an album that sounds as if each song is different!  Each song has a uniqueness that is refreshing and listening over and over never gets tedious.  This is a great album for people who like mellow rock, with a blues and folk influence.  Pretty magical music.<br /><br />I would actually even buy this as a gift for someone despite not knowing their individual music preferences. (Except that they aren't into rap or country).<br /><br />Good stuff!
B002ZG974M|5.0|This is a very interesting documentary where the camera follows four babies from four different corners of the world as they grow from being a baby to a toddler.  It was fascinating to see how each culture nurture their infants.  Watching this film is like watching your home video, however.  In fact, my husband fell asleep, just as he does whenever he watches our children's videos!  I suppose I enjoyed it more because I went through what those mothers did and it brought back a lot of wonderful memory!  It's a great film to watch with your children, unless you find bare breasts and breastfeeding as something dirty and unnatural.  I hope the filmmaker will continue to follow these four children.  I like to see how they turn out when they become teenagers.
1401300529|4.0|Born in 1948 I was too young to know what the Korean war was all about and the Korean war to too new to be covered in my history classes.  With the importance of the Korean peninsula to today's political scene I wanted to find out more.  This book is not a page turned by any means nor is it short.  But it is readable and informative.  I am glad that I worked my through it.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The book is insanely priced. $19.99 is more than the Hardcover book!  This is nothing but pure greed on the part of the publisher in my opinion.
0399215921|1.0|I am by no means giving the story a poor review.  I love the book and so do my kids.  I highly recommend it.  But, get the Board Book version instead.  This particular hardcover book is so small it would be terrible to read to a child.  I returned it and plan to use my refund to get the board book version.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Most likely this movie will work for true fans of film from the 1950's and 1960's.  The Tourist harkens back to a time when stories were presented as a sophisticated genre.  What?  No instant answers?  No blood and flames and explosions?  You have to be engaged with not only the senses but also the brain to fully enjoy this hat tip to an earlier era of film-making.      To set some information straight about the characters, Jolie's character is named Elise - not Elsie.  Depp plays his role of bumbling traveler to a T and Rufus Sewell adds a thread of mystery that has you guessing.    If you haven't watched many foreign or Hitchcock suspense films set in the jet-set locals of Europe or been enamored by the slow pace of The Day of the Jackal, then you may find this film out of synch with your typical expectations.  This film is rich with scenery, fashion, wealth, and low key twisty intrigue.  What it lacks compared to today's heavy handedness of a Borne Identity type film is exactly what makes this refreshing.  The cinematography is stellar.    The best:  Lush backgrounds and lean, well dressed characters with a higher level of vocabulary than the typical language du jour of most recent films.  The worst:  Probably too slow paced for the run of the mill viewer.  The in-between:  Drop the expectations of a Hollywood cookie cutter film adrenaline high and be entertained by the locale, the language, and the intrigue.    This is worth seeing if you are a serious film buff.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I have read several Jodi Picoult books and normally consider them worth the read but not page turners. This book was an exception.  While the subject matter of bullying and school shootings did not have me approach this selection of my book club with a lot of enthusiasm I was suprised with how quickly I was captivated by the book.  Her technqiue of switching back and forth from timer periods before and after the shootings enriches understanding of all of the characters in the book.  Picoult helps us to understand the multiple dimensions of a tragedy like Columbine that only a good writer can provide.  Don't let the issues of book pricing keep you from reading a great book.  this is a great selection for a book club discussion
B001OQCV2E|5.0|After reading some reviews prior to ordering this movie I did not know if I wanted to spend my money on it.  For some reason I finally decided to buy it.  I was pleased that I did.  If you are a sci-fi fan this is great.  It gave me what I look for.  It had action, suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It supprised me and showed me the good and the bad part of human beings. The folks that did not like this movie would rather watch Old Yeller instead of sci-fi and that was also a good movie, just not sci-fi.
B003EYVY04|4.0|I was very excited to get this special edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, however, was very disappointed with the extra features.  All along, they've advertised these Ultimate Editions as having never before seen extras and of course the coveted third disc with Part 3 of the special look at the world of Harry Potter.    In both of the first 2 Ultimate Editions, they had the extended version of the film, with deleted scenes or extended scenes placed back into the film.  With this movie, they did not do that.      At first I thought it was because they just didn't have scenes to fit into the film.  However, as any Harry Potter fan knows, ABC Family plays extended versions everytime they have a Harry Potter Weekend.  It just so happened that a week after I received my Ultimate Edition, ABC Family had a marathon and Prisoner of Azkaban was on the lineup.  They showed scenes not in the Ultimate Edition and this just upset me further.      If you're going to advertise it as the Ultimate Edition, it better really be the Ultimate Edition!    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better have the extended and extra scenes added in or someone is getting a strongly worded email!!!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I will make only one comment on the show, as this review is for the product, not the show itself. Ever wonder how many times in this show that people resort to hitting somebody? I know that Sawyer pointed out that it's Lord of the Flies on the Island, but still. Somebody annoys you, does something you don't like, won't do something you want? Just hit them. Anyway, onto the review of the Blu-Ray.So far, I've watched the first 3 seasons. I will update the review when I've watched everything.     Starting from when you first load a Blu-Ray: very long load times! I have a quick loading player, and it still takes forever. There is so much crap to go through before the menu pops up. Also, the first disc of every season has a bunch of promo previews, mostly for other Lost DVD's. Very annoying. Most collections only do that on the first DVD, not the first DVD of every season.     Phenomenal picture and sound quality from the HD Master Audio, tho there isn't much of a LFE(low-frequency effect or subwoofer) channel. There are cool menu backgrounds, typically of a figure in an Island scene.     There is no Play All episodes option on season 1&2, but there is on 3. Pressing stop wipes out where you were. My OPPO BDP83 has a memory system, wherein even if I turn off the player, and remove the disc, it remembers where I was when I put the disc back in. Not this DVD. That positively necessitates using Season Play, which is great. Season Play functions like a Play All option. You can select a pre-set profile, mine is Man of Faith. This will remember your spot if you press stop, turn off the player, or remove the disc. It will also remind you if you forget what disc you were on. Very cool. What's annoying is, if you change discs, without turning the player off, it will start the next episode automatically. However, if you turn off the player, you will still have to wait for all the promos, and other crap, before the menu pops up when turning it back on. Once it does finally get to the menu, you have to select Season Play, and it will(finally) take you to where you left off.    This is probably the coolest packaging I've ever seen. There are so many things printed on the box etc. Plus, the included blacklight can be used on the packaging to reveal the hand-drawn map of the hatches that were seen on the blast door inside the Swan station. The Ankh has a message from Jacob, which is basically a set of instructions for using your remote to unlock the easter egg of how to play the included Senet game that Jacob and Smoky play in the show. There is a Black Rock journal entry that reveals the answer to a minor question, that it was the BR that Jacob and Smoky were discussing on the beach as they looked at it on the water, and a couple other small revelations about the BR's journey.    Special features are awesome. Each season has similar things. They include Flashbacks, On Location, Deleted Scenes, Audition Tapes, Making of, Anatomy of a scene,bloopers, etc.    Season 2 is awesome. The menu is set up like a Dharma Orientation film, featuring our favorite scientist. Special features include a 6 Degrees of Separation type of Lost Connections, showing how the characters are related. I had no idea that one of Sawyers \\"cons\\" was the TV woman Hurley was watching when she announced his winning lottery numbers. There's a World According to Sawyer featurette, deleted scenes etc.    There are hours of extras in this collection, including something I almost didn't find until I read about it. That would be the hidden dvd in the packaging! The videos telling where it's located are gone due to copyright, but I will tell you here. Spoiler alert! I tried finding it by gently tugging the box, searching thru all the various pieces. Finally, I realized that the box top, w/a representation of the Island on the back, can be turned. It's set up as a \\"lock and key\\" type deal. Rotate the Island 90 degrees to \\"unlock\\" it. Pull it off. There's a flap, and under the flap, there's the dvd! Sweet!    While there are some definite annoyances, mainly the long load times, even when using Season Play, this is by far the coolest, most comprehensive box set I've ever seen. With clues to be found within the DVD's, and even within the packaging itself, this is a must for Lost fans.
0545123267|3.0|It required four attempts to actually finish reading 'Shiver'. Although the synopsis made it sound intriguing and the prose itself was, in some segments, absolutely beautiful (if a bit florid), the pace was almost agonizingly slow. It was more like watching a teenage girl going about her usual business--and not particularly exciting business at that--than watching an actual story unfold. But, eventually, a story did begin to emerge and around the halfway/quarter mark the pace picked up.<br /><br />A wolf attacked Grace when she was a child, but a golden-eyed wolf saved her. In a way she adopted that wolf as her own, watching him from her home for years. Little did she know that the wolf was really a boy named Sam who also nursed a crush on her for years. As fate would have it, Grace gets the opportunity to repay her debt to Sam when he's injured while in his wolf form and she learns his secret, at which point romance ensues. However, the ensuring romance felt unnatural.<br /><br />Each chapter alternates in first person perspectives between Grace and Sam. The voice change, however, in some cases was almost unnoticeable. Attached to those chapters is the temperature, which was a nice touch, and I tried to suspend my disbelief surrounding the mythos of temperatures affecting Sam's (and other werewolves') change, but it became difficult; it opened up too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />While I don't consider this one of my favorite reads, I did enjoy it and I intend to read the second installment (Linger) which I already have in my to-be-read stack. Just be forewarned that there is florid language and a sluggish pace, which means this books requires some measure of patience to complete.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock has done it once again. Her endless talent is amazing. Betty White was her normal wonderful self, Mary Steenburgen was a surprise when she lays down the law to her husband. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect person to play this part. All the important elements were in this film. I just watched it for the second time and was Fully entertained. This film causes you to go through all the emotions and the ending was written and acted perfectly. What else can I say but Watch it, Watch it, Watch it. You will be glad you did.
B001992NW4|3.0|The extended version is to the original what Jonestown was to Kool-aid. Some Hollywood moron decided \\"Hey, let's take the scariest movie of all time and ADD GORE - it will have much more appeal for the torture porn crew!\\" And that's exactly what they did. Mercifully, Disc 2 has the original version, which is WAY better than the extended one. Don't believe me? Ok, go ahead and queue it up; get to the scene where the lights flicker and freeze. See it? They put the scary face on the kitchen cabinets. Ooh, scary cabinets! Then move a bit ahead to where Chris hears that Burke dies; freeze again when Regan does her infamous spider walk - except when you freeze, you'll see it's NOT Linda Blair. It's some nobody with red colored corn syrup oozing out of her mouth. This was clearly added by some idiot to up that old cash-in factor. Disgraceful! However, the original documentary on Disc 2 is still excellent and worth watching. Given the cost for the set, I'll give it three stars because someone had the wisdom to included the un-modified, un-corrupted version - which still holds up after all this time. File Disc 1 with all your Eli Roth movies and keep the original version handy for a good scare!
0439023521|5.0|I am an avid reader who recently discovered books on Audible.com (a division of Amazon). My vision is not as good as it used to be and I started listening to books on DVD's.

B00428CPUY|5.0|The DVD was what I expected, a tour de feast for guitar lovers.  The quality of the talent here is word-class.  I defy anyone to submit anything of recent note that is even in the same ball park, or soccer stadium in this case.  From Sonny Landreths opening salvos though Robert Randolfs high energy romp and Derek Trucks more than ample fill-in for the Allmans, to Jeff Becks other-worldly sonics and the rousing finales, this is the finest accumulation of musical talent you may ever see & hear.  Turn it up loud!<br /><br />As for the experience itself, I was there, and while the music was great the experience was less so.  Not because of the people or the event staff or even the inflated concession prices, be because of Toyota Parks irresponsible decision to run only hot water in the bathrooms just so they could sell more water.  To me that is not only negligent but boarder line criminal.  It was a blistering hot eleven hour day for most of us.  To do that at the expense of peoples health and safety is extremely dangerous.  I live downstate and don't follow Chicago news that much but I sure hope someone is suing there asses.  Although Clapton had said weeks earlier that this would be his last Crossroads, that evening he said he might have to do one more.  Do us all a favor EC and have it anywhere but there.  The event is too once-in-a-lifetime precious to have it ruined by greedy ass-jerks like those running Toyota Park.
0061730335|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Boy Who Harnessed The Wind and was fascinated by the stories of the Malawians and their mixed beliefs of witchcraft, superstitions, God, Folklore, and Science and how a genius boy,William Kamkwamba,built a windmill from scrap materials. To read the details of the average Malawian's life surprised me frankly, and made me humble and thankful. I found this story to be an amazing account of determination and triumph over adversity. I came away with a different thinking and mindset of what the most important things in life are: God, food, shelter, water, clothing, and an education, which are often taken for granted.     The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind serves as an excellent inspiration for both teachers and students about the importance of having a vision for educational attainment, setting and achieving realistic goals, dreaming big, and never giving up, even if the odds are stacked against them. William's story further illustrates a powerful lesson of what students and teachers can accomplish and overcome if they just have faith in their abilities, possess courage, determination, perseverance, ingenuity, and have a belief in their own ideas and imagination enough to accomplish the most impossible school and life tasks.

B0007LXPBI|4.0|Lindsay Lohan might not be the best role model anymore, but she was adorable in her movie debut, the Parent Trap. This 1998 version is a remake of another movie, and so the overall plot is pretty predictable. There is a couple, they break up after their twin daughters are born, and the twin daughters don't find out about each other until they meet at summer camp. The pranks they pull on each other and eventually other characters are pretty funny, and the overall romance between the parents (and another pair in the movie!) is sweet.<br /><br />Again, the plot isn't new or anything, but at the time, I guess the technology they used was. Lindsay Lohan obviously doesn't have a twin, but I was convinced she did, because the graphics were good and Lohan played the double roles well. The two daughters she played aren't as unique towards the end of the movie as they were in the beginning, but it's not that bad. I'd still love to watch this movie again, even though I already have about 10 times.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I just saw it a few days ago and I plan to see it a few more --or maybe a few more than \\"a few\\" times-- before it leaves the theaters.  And I know I'll buy the DVD when that comes out and watch it more times with the luxury of being able to study why it worked so well by virtue of my DVD player's pause, rewind, and slow-motion buttons.<br /><br />In this review I will explain why the movie had such an impact on me and then in a section below the word \\"spoilers\\" I will make a few comments about the plot and particularly the ending.<br /><br />Why was it so compelling a film?  Because it was a powerful story, brilliantly executed, and with incredible performances by four of the lead cast.<br /><br />The story line is quite gripping.  We watch someone who is beautiful, talented, driven to perfection and incredibly fragile take on a performance that quite literally pushes her into a psychotic break.  We cheer for Nina Sayers; we pity her; and we fear for her as the twisty plot unfolds springing surprises on the viewer along the way.<br /><br />The film is beautifully staged.  It made ballet accessible for me and I imagine a lot of other people who were not into it.  I found both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis's dancing to be very convincing and moving.  The film deftly presents us with moments of beauty (especially Nina's ultimate performance as the Black Swan) and moments of horror when the film plays its little tricks to convince us she is losing her mind.<br /><br />The performances were what sold it in the end.  Natalie Portman's portrayal of Nina was utterly convincing as someone teetering on the edge of madness.  And I suspect I'm not alone among guys who would find themselves wishing they could rescue her from her plight.<br /><br />Mila Kunis, Vincent Kassel, and Barhara Hershey also did tremendous work.  Mila made a wonderful foil to Nina as Lily, the embodiment of what the Black Swan should have been...a carefree, beautiful, sexy woman.  Vincent Kassel in the role of Thomas Leroy gave a performance that ensured a character that could have amounted to a hateful cliche was believable and one could easily understand why Nina would find him so captivating and overwhelming.<br /><br />Finally, Barbara Hershey turned in a fine performance as Nina's damaged mother, someone who loved her daughter but in a way that was twisted and malign and profoundly unnerving.<br /><br />&lt;SPOILERS><br /><br />You'll notice I left out Winona Ryder from my list above.  It's not that she did a bad job in the part she played of Beth, the former prima ballerina.  It's just that the character was such a small part...it could have been done by anyone.  I find myself wondering if there were scenes involving her that wound up on the cutting room floor since a draft of the shooting script I saw had more scenes with her in it.  It's not a flaw to the movie but I do wonder why an actress of Ryder's caliber was willing to do such a small role.<br /><br />A lot has been made of \\"anger and ecstasy fueled lesbian hate sex\\" between the characters of Nina and Lily.  I actually thought there were other scenes that were sexier (Nina \\"touching herself\\" and a scene where Thomas shows Nina what it's like to be seduced).  It's also important to remember that Nina and Lily's encounter was just a figment of Nina's burgeoning psychosis and also an indicator of how repressed she was (it was pretty clear she was a virgin).<br /><br />I also think that critics who describe the relationship between Lily and Nina as a \\"twisted friendship\\" are missing the boat on that.  The friendship is only twisted as seen through Nina's distorted view.  I think that Nina's psychosis assigned Lily, the role of nemesis and rival that she really did not play in reality.<br /><br />Finally, here are my thoughts about the ending.  It's been the subject of a lot of debate on the Internet Movie Database.  Some people are convinced that Ninadied in the end after giving a phenomenal performance as the Black Swan...that when she thought she killed her \\"rival\\" Lily, she only managed to wound herself with a shard from the mirror she broke.<br /><br />I think the movie is deliberately ambiguous about what really happened.  My interpretation of what did was that Nina did manage to hurt herself but not all that badly...which would explain why she was able to to perform as the Black Swan and the White Swan instead of being found in a pool of her own blood in her dressing room.  I flatly reject the idea that she could have danced the way she did if she was as badly hurt as she was.  I think it's more believable to conclude that Nina may have been convinced she had mortally wounded herself but was simply overcome by her psychosis and the fact that in the end she really had pulled it off and become perfect.she killed her \\"rival\\" Lily, she only managed to wound herself with a shard from the mirror she broke.

B00192IV9U|3.0|Despite the doubts and controversy surrounding this album, I still like it. Most of the songs are very good, though I agree with most people that had MJ had a hand in its final production it would've been awesome. Don't know if he would have chosen these same songs, most likely not. The track \\"The Way You Love Me\\" was previously released in the Ultimate Collection compilation and it sounded better so I went and bought that one instead. That was not a demo by the way as claimed by another reviewer. Don't agree with the \\"fake\\" claims. I think he did sing all these songs. It could be that they were not completed before he passed away and  back-up fillers were used but you do hear MJ in there so I don't get what all the fuss is about. Obviously his best work is still from his classics from Thriller, BAd, Dangerous, etc etc. Just goes to cement his tremendous genius and talent when you hear the difference in quality that no one can replicate.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Having read the Pacific and seen all of this series. I believe Stephen Ambrose's novel was ruined by this production.<br /><br />They truly only tell the story of a few characters from the book both are \\"Grunts.\\" While important this production takes their stories and fictionalizes it for HBO's purposes. I mean it is a tradgedy and i can only imagine what Eugene and Robert would say about this misrepresentation of their stories of war.<br /><br />Also the complete lacking stories of both the other main characters from the novel inscenes me that they would use the same title. To spare giving away their involvement and stories they are to say the least two insightful and interesting characters that give insight far surpassing that of the characters portrayed here. Also there are a few NCOs in the novel that do not play as major a role but provide insightful counterpoints to some of the negative views of the men protrayed in the series.<br /><br />To only speak of the island campaign is not what the pacific(novel) was about. The pacific was a tremendous novel that was much MUCH more encompassing.<br /><br />This miniseries should have been titled \\"The Pacific: Light\\" cuz it was light about five different stories and truly heavy on three. i suppose the individuals who wrote this were \\"semper fi\\" (as explained in the final chapter of the novel.<br /><br />Semper Fidelis To the Memory of all the Veterans past and current.

1589946634|2.0|Well, this game is based on most popular game warhammer 40K, which I played in pervious 15 years and I also have space hulk since 2nd edition.  I like the art work on this card game, and wish this game to be portable space hulk.  Sadly, no...... This game is soso.  You do need 13+ for this game as it listed on the box due to the complicated setting, and there isn't any armor save, special weapon, and combat experience as warhammer 40K.  Most likely, it's a game with 2 monsters \\"broodlord & genestealer\\".  Rolling 4+ to kill gensteraler and 5+ to kill broodlord per a 6 sides dice.  Each space marines has different attacking range from 0 to 3.  If you get stormbolter mark as supplement, you get a chance to reroll.  The game end when space marines all died, or run out of location card with having done the assignment of last location card. It's very simple, but there are location and event cards, not easy for players to image the whole area as space hulk board game.      After trying couple runs with friends, we gave up this game.  It's not fun as we expected.  Not with the experience as warhammer 40K and the space hulk board game.  It a card game without the spirit of warhammer 40k, but art work.....
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I saw this show when it was on Starz in the beginning of 2010. It starts a bit slow, I agree but after the 1st 2 or 3 episodes it keeps getting better and better untill the climax in the last episode. I loved all the Actors, they played their parts great and I really felt bad for all the crap Sparticus had to go through in the first half of the series. Ancient Rome is gritty and brutal and hedonistic, its displayed very realistically.     This series is different from the HBO \\"Rome\\" in that its not as historically accurate in terms of the story and characters. Its more of a fiction of what Sparticus may have been like since, from what I understand we dont know too much about the real Sparticus other than that he did lead a slave revolt in Rome that was surprisingly successful. All in all though if you liked Rome and you liked 300 and gladiator and you love Action and Drama you will probably like this. Id advise renting out and seeing a few episodes first before you decide to buy the whole series.

193659434X|5.0|Once again I find it a bit daunting to write a review of what  is arguably one of the most well-known classic stories.  I, like most people I know, grew up with Scrooge (although the form has changed).  From Donald Duck to Jim Carrey, I've listened to the story of the grumpy, old, miserly man and his miraculous change of heart on one fateful Christmas Eve.<br /><br />My aunt actually ordered A Christmas Carol for her kindle and I saw the email and thought - oh, that would make a great read-along book for December.  Perfect season, I've never read it.. but oh.. it's DICKENS.  I don't know about you, but just the name  Dickens is enough to strike fear deep into my heart.  I struggled so much with A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield back in the day that, although interested to see  how the book was, I approached this story with not a little bit of trepidation.<br /><br />It also helped to know it was short.  I'll admit it.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't read the book, let me just say - put aside everything you know about Dickens from his other works and give this one a shot.  It's remarkably easy to understand and, although he can go on, due to the shortness of the book as a whole, the descriptions don't get too much out of  hand.<br /><br />There were quite a few things in the book that surprised me - details that really rounded out the story much more than the movies ever have.  I regret that I've let all these years go by without establishing the reading of this story as atradition for myself, but it is something I intend to change in the upcoming years.
030746363X|2.0|This book was mostly a waste of money, and definitely doesn't live up to the hype.    The 4-Hour Body is an exercise, health and nutrition book that details a number of approaches to a few very specific goals - losing fat and keeping it off, gaining muscle mass, improving your running speed, improving your running distance, etc - all in the shortest amount of time reasonable for anyone who is not an Olympic-level athlete.  It has some good information, and most of the advice is sound within the parameters of the goals that Tim defines, but there is really just not that much new that justified being republished, and there is a haphazard quality to the book that I found annoying.  I bought it at Borders with a 50% coupon, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it than that.    Most of the value in this book for most people - the sections on losing fat and gaining muscle - are already covered in his other book and in his blog articles online.  I had already purchased that previous book, so to pay for a rehash of these ideas was pretty much a waste of time and money.    The other things - improving your running speed, increasing your distance up to 50k (30 miles) etc. - are all interesting, and useful to a point, but how many people are really going to follow these training protocols who don't already have access to a gym and personal trainer that could have taught them the same things?    Meanwhile - where is the information on stretching???  A book that purports to be about health, especially for someone like Tim who supposedly has longevity as an underlying goal, should absolutely have more information about warming up and stretching.  This would have been a logical topic for the \\"Pre-hab\\" chapter.    Also - the exploration of vegetarianism and non-animal-product dietary restrictions is laughable.  As someone with a genetic predisposition towards insanely high cholesterol and triglycerides, eating all the beef, chicken and eggs he talks about is just not an option for me.  I know I'm not the only one out there, so it would have been nice if he had discussed alternatives beyond a perfunctory level to justify putting it in the advertising, since heart disease is one of the biggest causes of death in the US.    Finally - Tim claims to be up on research, but he doesn't mention alkalinity/acidity at all in talking about diet.  This is a major area of research for long-term health that is gaining more and more attention, but it doesn't fit within his narrowly defined short-term goals (fat loss, muscle gain in shortest amount of time humanly possible), so apparently he either didn't bother to do his research or didn't feel it was worth mentioning.  I found that to be a major blind spot in the book.    And all that stuff about the female anatomy and \\"15-minute orgasms\\"... I'm sorry, but I learned all that when I was 17 from reading women's magazines.  Ironically, those women's magazines use the same deceptive headlines and titles to bait and switch their readers.

It's an excellent romp and far more \\"believable\\" in its characters and presentation.

B0000DCGT0|3.0|I found this movie over long and rather disappointing, especially the racing scenes. They were not very well done.  First of all, with all the pounding hooves of the horses, their labored breathing under heavy stress, crowd noise, the wind, etc. you cannot carry on a conversation with the jockey beside you as though you were sitting side by side in armchairs in someone's living room.   Secondly, if you are actually astride a galloping horse, the riders motions would be different. It almost seemed as though they were projecting scenes flashing by behind the actor and he was pretending to be riding a horse. (Sorry but it just wasn't realistic.)  I thought it was a decent movie except for the above.  I just wish they had paid more attention to the racing scenes and tried to generate some excitement. I did like the documentary style they were using.  Guess seeing the movie Secretariat before getting this DVD spoiled it for me. That movie was everything this one was not. I LOVED Hillenbrand's book and the PBS documentary on Seabiscuit was excellent. Seabiscuit was one tough, gutsy horse.

I recommend them to anyone who is an avid gamer, likes to watch movies, or listen to music on their pc. They are also a LOT more affordable than your other name brand company headsets.

0374290024|5.0|I read Why the West Rules for Now with great interest and have recommended it to many.  The book is a major achievement.  Morris erudition is impressive.  His inclusion of Gunder Frank's ReOrient among others such as Jared Diamond, Pommeranz and Landes among the scholars that have addressed the significance of the patterns of history is noteworthy.  I was disappointed by the concluding chapter of the book pointing to a seeming end-point in the Singularity as defined by Kurzweil.  Apparently there is progress achieved not in some linear progression but rather in fits and starts as the species reaches a hard ceiling to further social advancement with collapse to lower states of social development more likely than success in surmounting the barriers through innovation.  Howard Bloom presents a similar mechanism in his The Genius of the Beast where booms and busts drive evolution.<br /><br />I am not convinced that near term future, i.e., before the end of this century, is a choice between between the Singularity and Nightfall as presented in the concluding chapter.  There are other paths.  The clearest alternative is space development, first a solar system civilization then possibly steps beyond to the stars.  I taught a course Space Industrialization and National Priorities in 1977 that addressed this issue.  At the time it seemed like the US would not turn its back on space much as the Ming emperors turned their back on Zheng He in the 1400s.  Werner Von Braun envisioned a substantial Moon Base by the early 1990s.  Boeing was working on space - based solar power satellites to provide the Earth with power and Gerard K. O'Neill envisions massive space colonies in his book The High Frontier.  Yet manned spaceflight became a minor activity until the recent revival with people like Branson, Musk and others now promoting space tourism and rapidly growing interest in space in China, India, Europe, Brazil, among others.<br />At this point we (globally speaking) are bumping against the hard ceiling in the ways that Morris outlines - resources, energy, food, water, global weirding - but also in terms of jobs for educated people.  In many fields a PhD leads at best to a long career as a post doc with the risk of having to drive a cab or work in fast food or construction to make a living.  And the number of educated people is multiplying.  Humanity needs to expand its environment to be able to create the jobs needed by the ever increasing numbers of educated people being churned out by universities around the globe.<br /><br />Recent developments suggest that space-based solar power (SSP) can address all of the concerns.  The sun shines 24/7 in orbit with an intensity about 9 fold of most points on the Earth.  Technical feasibility of large-scale SSP powerplants in orbit is accepted.  SSP can be directed to deliver power to almost any point on Earth.  Lunar and asteroid resources can be used to construct SSP facilities in space after initial bootstrapping.  Hundreds of documents discussing this are available at […]<br /><br />With perhaps a one trillion dollar investment the global energy future could be assured that is carbon free and imposes much less stress on the environment.  Having made that investment humankind would have also created the infrastructure to make the solar system its broadened environment.  Think of the SSP as the steam engine that got the industrial revolution started.  Yes, the SSP will deliver many gigawatts of power dwarfing what was done in the industrial revolution.  But, that is the difference between a social development index of 1,000 and say 10,000.<br /><br />The past President of India A.P.J. Kalam has called for making SSP a project of the G20.  It would be a fantastic opportunity for US-China-India-Russia and EU partnership.  See for recent commentary -[…] .<br /><br />With space development for the next few centuries geography will again matter with the hard constraints of development on multiple planets human groups can again become isolatd from each other creating conditions where civilizations again can collapse as they struggle for supremacy.  We are not yet near the end of history.atd from each other creating conditions where civilizations again can collapse as they struggle for supremacy.  We are not yet near the end of history.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I have listened to this since the early 90's each Christmas season-- for me, it  is simply is part of my celebration of the  season.....I believe it is a  FABulous buy!
0143038583|4.0|I sit at a table in a McDonald's staring at my Dollar Menu Double Cheeseburger, it stares back at me. Deep within me I feel a problem, a twitch in my conscience asking me should I really be eating this? Then I ask my conscience, If not this than what is it I am supposed to be eating? I have the ability to eat almost any type of food their is, I am not faced with the strict diet of grass grazing or having to stalk my prey and feast of their raw flesh. I have the option of choice, the omnivore's choice of diversity in my diet, but what should I pick? This dilemma stirs all of us deep inside our psyche's, this dilemma is our dilemma, the omnivore's dilemma. In Michael Pollan's New York Times Bestseller, \\"The Omnivore's Dillema\\", you are confronted with many challenges as he deconstructs the industrial food web that we are all a part of and exposes the passe morals of the massive industry and how it affects out diets.         Commodity corn is the first subject Pollan covers in the first section titled, \\"Industrial: Corn\\". To do research for the topic Michael travels to Farnhamville, Iowa where he learns the ins and outs of the business of industrial farming with George Naylor. He learns what a massive impact corn has on agriculture and the food industry. Did you know that corn is in almost a fourth of everything in the grocery store? The massive amounts of byproducts that are made from corn come at a cheaper price than traditional goods and have grown to be integrated into a large sum of what we eat. Life in America would not be nearly as prosperous if corn had not been created through a \\"catastrophic sexual transmutation\\" from the teosinte grass variety. At one point in the book it even goes as far as including a quote that reads \\"Maize is the greatest gift god gave to man.\\" While this is a very tall statement many would find it odd it still does have some merit especially in the massive business of commodity corn we have raised to be today. How do we escape these pressure's? Some believe that organic farming process are the answer.          Organic thinking and morals is the subject matter that Michael details in the second section of the book titled \\"Pastoral: Grass.\\" The section begins with the look into the organic movement of such stores such as Whole Foods. With out having to look very deep he finds most of the major organic stores to be as much of a moral blending as he discovered in industrial corn farming. What it comes down to in any major industry is making money, and the true insight can easily be lost in our capitalist society. He moves his research to Polyface Farms in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley which is owned by Joel Salatin. Here he learns about the methods of what Joel calls \\"beyond organic\\" farming. These practices do in fact reach out far beyond the reaches or conventional organic farming and branch out to helping on a local and sustainable level. His farming methods are almost completely self contained except for the few outside products he must buy such as chicken feed, other than that all of his animals are used to do their natural processes in a manner that complete the necessary cycle to have a successful farm. In Joel's words, \\"The animals do all the work.\\" This is the part of the book that caught my attention the most. I liked it because it wasn't about the perils of an industry, such as the section breaking down the corn business, but instead it detailed the methods of a wholesome and logical method of living and creating life for others as well. This section really opened my eyes to ethics that farmers in our local area use and how they could be changed to create a more positive influence on the land they are utilizing to make profit.         My usual reading selections are normally very similar. I frequently go for books that will make me think on a worldly level outside of my own and focus on the philosophies behind things I have never personally experienced. This was not the case when I chose \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\", because the problems faced are happening in my own place in time. The moral issues are ones that most people face daily in our society because we all eat. But what are we really eating and what does it say about us? Michael Pollan would agree with the old saying, \\"You are what you eat.\\" I think these are questions we can all over look at times in out busy lives, but they apply to us all. I have a strong connection to the book and every other person in the world, especially in America, does too. This is why I recommend this book to anyone who eats. Which is all of you. Beyond the subject matters directness it is also simply a good and interesting book that will surprise you with its many quirky facts Pollan discovers as he travels deep into the heart of the food industry.         As that cheeseburger will stare at most of us, we will stare back, think, yet still eat it. Is it too late for the Omnivore? Will our practices one day burn themselves out? Our patterns we have created in the world are very heavily set into our culture and are very hard to change. We base our lives around these ways and practice them everyday. This is the way it has been and will remain for sometime until we the people make an effort to change it. Do we need to change our ways though? Who knows. I don't, you don't and neither does Michael Pollan. No one does. The way we live is just the way things are, someday it might have disastrous effects but at this point opinions on both sides can be written off as radical soapbox propaganda. For now, we do live in a place of little movement, but someday if that change comes it will be a vast departure from our living now.
B003Q6D282|5.0|This movie did not end with any \\"finality.\\" There are too many open issues. I can't say more without spoiling the movie but i was sorely disappointed. I was expecting something really earth-shattering in this movie but didn't get it. I didn't think the traps were as good either. Even though Saw VI didn't make much money at the box office, i think its the best one. The story was great, the traps were all great, and I couldn't wait to see Saw 3D, but was disappointed. They didn't even let us keep our 3D glasses. We had to turn them back in after the movie (just imagine how much head-grease was built up on them after hundreds of people wearing them week after week!) We went opening night and didn't have sanitary problems to worry about.     Are we going to have to have a 3DTV and a 3d Blu-ray Player in order to view this disc in 3D?
B001UV4XFG|2.0|Another teen movie. Wolves still need work, they still look bad. Why dont they pick up the phone and call George Lucas and ask for some advice. As for the love scenes with Bella and Edward...I still have a hard time believing they actually like each other in real life. She is just a bad actress!!  I am only buying these so I can see what the big deal is all about. I cant be seen going into a theater to see a teen movie as I am an adult. GEEZ..... I dont think I will be buying anymore after this.  I dont care to see the evil baby spawn. Gross.
B003Y8YXH6|3.0|True confession: I owned \\"Double Fantasy\\" (on cassette) back when it came out, and the world was still in mourning. It was something of a guilty pleasure, even the Yoko stuff, to a certain extent.  And while I can see that there is some vague historical value to this set of  semi-demoish, stripped-down remixes, I think most folks would agree that the old album greatly benefited from the original lavish, wall-of-sound production.  This is particularly true of the tracks spotlighting Yoko's vocals: they are far more painful to listen to without the extra layers of gloss and playful bombast; the same is true to a lesser extent with the John Lennon tracks. To keep things brief, \\"Double Fantasy\\" was clearly conceived as an album that would rely on lavish, state-of-the-art overproduction, and pretending otherwise is an exercise in willful self-deception.  Also, John and Yoko, although they had their quirky humor and charm, did not work their musical ideas in the same sort of creative wellspring as the Beatles: I could listen to Fab Four outtakes 'til the end of the universe and still be captivated by their rich creative process - these sessions simply don't have that sort of multi-dimensional depth. I don't really see the point of this rather self-indulgent release: there's no \\"there\\" there. That being said, rest in peace, John. You're still my fave. (Axton)

030746363X|5.0|I rarely read non fiction but the hype around Tim's new book made it a must read. The more I read, the more I related. I have a pretty advanced workout regimen and yet with every page that I read I learned something new.     Tim's writing style turns what could have been a dry subject into a page turner for living. I have focused on the chapters that are most relevant to me: perfecting sleep, reversing injuries, subtracting fat, running faster and further and of course the sex chapter.     This book is accessible by all whether you are out of shape or a prime athlete. Tim has done all the experimentation so you dont have to. I started a web site called FYI Living devoted to using science to expose the myths behind what much of what are told about health. The 4 hour body speaks our language: real science not marketing on how we can improve our lives.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|Really great record from start to finish. Not only is it musically great but it is also one of the better sounding records that I've listened to in recent history. This record begs to be listened to loud and with headphones.
B002N5N4M6|2.0|I just had a dream that they could release an alternative version of this season without that obnoxious, agressive, intrusive laughing track. Never, I mean never, I's seen a sitcom use a laughing track in this way. But, by judging the great reviews and ratings, the producers coul not care less with my opinion.<br /><br />I mean, the jokes are great by themselves. You don't need to add a histerically high laughing track each time Sheldon says \\"Hello\\", or when he knocks on the door repeating the name of the occupant. There's simple no need for it, other than the old psychological cliche that people tend be more open to laughter when people around them are laughing.
0765326353|3.0|After reading the Wheel of Time saga which Sanderson is finishing for Robert Jordan, I was expecting a similar style of writing and story-telling. The Way Of Kings was really hard for me to understand in the beginning - it jumps around a lot without any reference point. I hung in there out of loyalty, and by the middle of the book (and it's a BIG one) I was starting to get it. I thought he was over-doing the \\"strange planet flora and fauna thing\\". I probably won't buy the next one until I see it at the Dollar Store...
B003L20IHE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and Zac Efron as an actor. He did an amazing job in capturing the essence of the character and letting the audience feel the pain, love and happiness.<br />The cinematography was so beautiful and inspiring, it blew me away. The little details in this movie, ie the tear drop on the statue after the rain or the color of Efron's eyes that matched the color of the water(his eyes told a story on their own)gave the movie a nice dynamic.<br />The story itself was intriguing and thought provoking.<br />I would recommended it to anyone.
0307408833|1.0|As a baker and a chef, I expect a certain level of quality control from bakery cookbooks. I have to agree with the other reviewers here, this book is misleading (it is wheat free not gluten free) and the recipes are terrible and inaccurate. Bob's Red Mill GF all purpose flour is pretty gross unless you like sandy bitter cupcakes and cookies. In the book, Ms. McKenna talks about how Bob's flour is \\"... so superior to other mixes that we would collapse in a tear-drenched tantrum if they ever stopped making it\\", I wonder if she uses premixed flour in her bakery. Additionally, please don't use dry measuring cups for liquid ingredients as advised in this book. The reason liquid measuring cups are used for liquids is a little thing called accuracy.   However, the biggest problem with the book is Ms. McKenna's apparently enormous ego. Take the title 'New York's Most Talked About Bakery'. She is constantly saying things that let the reader know she is apparently the greatest baker of all times and this would be fine if her recipes delivered the results she promises. They do not.   New York City is a place where celebrities live, sometimes they eat baked goods. why do I care what such and such actor thinks about your cupcake? This does not make the cupcakes baked  with your recipes taste better. Ms. McKenna could have easily included more useful information about gluten free baking on these celebrity pages (5 more pages to be exact).   One of the pitfalls of glamour is thinking you are more important than you actually are and letting your Art suffer as a result. Not only has the potential craftsmanship of this book suffered, it inspires failure in people with the desire to bake healthier treats. It is sloppy, inconsiderate, misleading and arrogant.   ALTERNATIVES TO THIS BOOK: The Allergen-Free Baker's Handbook by Cybele Pascal (now there is a baking genius) and Gluten-Free Classics by Annalise G. Roberts

B001UV4XFG|4.0|As a devout Twilight series fan, and a great grandmother not a teenager, I waited impatiently for this movie. This book is one of my favorites in the series second only to Breaking Dawn. Having read Eclipse 3 times I can quote passages by heart. The movie was good and would have been better if I was not so acutely aware of the cuts and changes made to the story. The most irritating of all the changes was the mountain setting where Victoria and Riley attack Edward, Bella and Seth. This was so poorly represented that I was actually angry. It portrayed Bella as heroic and injuring herself in an attempt to distract Victoria and Riley from attacking Edward who according to the movie was in serious danger. This simply did not happen. Bella did NOT cut herself with the rock. Edward killed Riley in short order when he realized that Bella had picked up the rock and then he dispatched Victoria with ease. Bella's motivation in picking up the rock was not to save Edward but Seth. The other change came earlier and again irritated me when it was made to appear that it was Edward's idea to sit out the battle instead of the petty manipulation performed by Bella to get what she wanted. I didn't like the obvious efforts to make Bella the heroine in the movie. The only one worth their salt in the story is EDWARD. Only an immortal/non human being could continue to put up with Bella's childish behavior. Oh, and the battle that the producer/director insisted on presenting to the viewers was only briefly mentioned in the book. I fervently hope that they don't mess up Breaking Dawn by trying to change the ending and having them actually fight the Volturi, that would just be too much. Stephanie Meyer is a talented author, but once these movie people get hold of a story they simply butcher it. Now I have to read Eclipse one more time just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Gasland is an artistic masterpiece! This tour de force dismantles the argument that natural gas is the new bridge fuel and in fact cleaner than coal.  Josh Fox's chilling revelations of the impact of natural gas drilling and fracking includes a decidedly frightening look at ordinary citizens who have water that can be literally set on fire. Gasland features a well written narration as well as a beautifully sequenced pace which creates a work of art as well as a meaningful revelation of a very complex subject.  Gasland could be as significant as \\"Silent Spring.\\"
030746363X|1.0|I read 4 hour week week in about 60 minutes (glad I bought it used!) and 4 hour body is pretty much the same deal...Lots of little \\"tidbits\\" that are basically useless and not applicable to most people. They're also unrealistic, and the author doesn't even follow this stuff. Mr. Ferris is a master at promoting himself. That is his real gift. He should write a book called \\"The 4 Hour Self Promotion.\\" Frankly, that's the only thing I think I could learn from him....Everything else is just a repackage of info already out there....    Don't fall for the 2,000 \\"5 star\\" ratings. He self-promotoes these through his network of blogging buddies....

0316098337|4.0|The premise of this book is so horrifying but I think what's great is how Donoghue decided to tell it through the eyes of Jack. By seeing everything through the eyes of a five year old who only knows the world to be an 11'x11' room, somehow the book can allow moments of humor and charm. It actually took me about two dozen pages to get used to reading the dialogue through his eyes but then it became easy.    The only issue I have with the book (and what keeps me from giving it five stars) is that it hits its climax a little after midway through - thus the last 100 or so pages never really matches the suspense/intrigue of the previous ones. If Donoghue could have structured it a bit differently so that it would have hit its crescendo closer to the end, I would have enjoyed it more.    But with that said, this book is still great and is such a compelling subject that I can easily recommend it.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I don't remember how I found Janelle Monae, but I'm sure glad I did! Her voice (actually her voice, not autotune) is AmAzInG, and the way it compliments the actual music is just wonderful and soothing.<br /><br />Granted, I don't like every song on this album, but the ones I do, I love & sometimes can't get enough of. If you're looking for something different & new (kinda like Kelis on Kaleidoscope in 1999) then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECORD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My top 5 favorites (listen to them on YouTube for proof):<br />Say You'll Go (amaaaaaazing everything)<br />Faster<br />Locked Inside<br />Oh, Maker<br />Neon Valley Street
B0037KMHRY|5.0|If you are a fan of Daft Punk you may need to temper your expectations a bit.  This is not a stand alone DP album.  This is a film score.  And a brilliant one at that.  Hats off to the electronic duo as they have crafted a moving and haunting narrative to TRON:  Legacy.  This body of work speaks to the amazing and unique talents that Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter possess.  Let's hope that they continue to branch out into new artistic avenues.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|Like my title indicates, this is not a very comprehensive book.  The ideas are basically just rehashed ideas from other websites and books and put together here.  I am not entirely familiar with the author, but from some of the posts I have read it seems that many of them confirm what I suspected.  Ferriss is a egomaniac just trying to make some money off of poor saps looking for something to throw money at to make all their self-hatred and problems go away.  This book is not the answer, the ideas are old and basic, though none of them seem outright wrong, a lot of them are needless, to say the least.  Without going into specific detail, save yourself some money, read the book at the bookstore, jot down notes on a small pad and try a few of the useful ideas.
B00447G2T8|4.0|I didn't know what to expect & wasn't thrilled on the first 2 listens but then it started to all fall into place.  I confess to not being a big Helloween fan so I cannot compare this to all their earlier albums.  I can say this is heavier than Gambling w/ the Devil ( which I love), with fewer melancholy moments (which I miss a little) & a little less melody overall.  The songs really have a lot of explosive energy, great guitar work & some damned catchy chorus'.  In the end this just rocks.
1423113381|4.0|The Red Pyramid, by Rick Riordan, starts readers off on another series intermingling ancient mythology, today's world, and snappy young teens. In this case, though, the mythology is Egyptian, not Greek as in his Percy Jackson series (or Roman, as in the newest addition to that series) and the young teens aren't the sons/daughters of gods but are possessed by them (if that doesn't seem like much of a difference, it's  because it really isn't as the story plays out). This may seem overly familiar, but why mess with a good thing is probably Riordan's thinking, and my guess is his fans' as well.    And truth be told, there's a lot to like in Riordan's writing, especially for a YA audience. The books are fast-paced (admittedly sometimes too much so); the dialogue mostly smacks of real pre-teen and teen-speak, rather than that painfully obvious how an out-of-touch adults \\"thinks\\" teens speak; the characters are accessible and likable (even some of the \\"bad\\" guys); they tend to be funny (though this one's  humor is a bit forced at times); the lessons are solid; and hey, kids might actually learn something (but don't tell them that).    All of those pretty much hold true for The Red Pyramid as well. The novel pretty much opens (nearly so) with a bang. Literally, as the Rosetta Stone gets blown up in the British Museum by Carter and Sadie Kane's father, in what appears to be an attempt to bring their mother back to life. Instead, several Egyptian gods are freed, some take possession of various humans (or \\"host\\" in them), including Sadie and Carter, and the kids' father is taken. Soon, we're off to Brooklyn (having picked up the cat-goddess Bast, an old uncle, and a baboon), then to Washington D.C., then to Phoenix (with stops in several other locales, including the Land of the Dead) having encountered and/or picked up some magicians, various other gods and monsters, and a possible traitor or two, to stop the entombment of their father in a great red pyramid being built by the bad guy Set who wants to destroy the world, though he isn't really the \\"big bad.\\"  And that isn't close to all. And of course, it leaves room for the sequel.    The ride is pretty much nonstop and breathless. I wouldn't have minded some time to rest, but my guess is his audience will eat up the thrill ride. The plot lines are suspenseful: will they stop Set in time, will they find out who the traitor is, will they learn their powers, how will they deal w/ the gods inside of them, do they like or LikeLike their clear matches (well, the last one isn't really all that suspenseful). To be honest, I do tire a bit of the heroes' magic arriving or not arriving at opportune moments, and the way in which they can morph into power so easily is a bit thin (in Percy Jackson it's because they're demi-gods, here it's because they host gods and have the blood of pharoahs); what happened to learning and working for power?  But I'm the grumpy old man telling these kids to get off my lawn; again, I'm pretty sure the YA audience won't mind a bit.    The first-person narration switches between Carter and Sadie and both are winning voices, though they could have been a bit more distinctive. They have the trademark Riordan light patter down, but here Riordan has upped the emotional ante a bit, adding some depth to the characters (though he cheats a bit at the end I'd say. Did I mention I walked to school uphill both ways? Through snow?). The side characters, save for an ancient magician, are a bit flat, but as the focus is pretty much on the two kids throughout, that doesn't detract too much.    Riordan is one of those YA authors I'd say who doesn't have quite the cross-over appeal of some YA authors, lacking that richness of background detail or depth of character that is more appealing to an older audience. But he knows how to hit his target audience and hit them he does, again and again and again. The Red Pyramid is recommended for Percy fans and for YA readers, especially younger ones. Adults and older YA could still enjoy the book, but will probably find it a bit wanting.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|I found this a very encouraging book.  First of all it confirms what I tell people all the time about my career - I just work harder than everyone else which is why I tend to do very well.  It also explains why others do even better, they had the opportunity of both circumstance and culture.  Especially the accounts of Chris Langan and Oppenheimer...I find that my background and culture have delt me some of the same attitudes as Langman, but that it is possible to recognize this and unlearn these traits.  Sadly, I see that I have already passed down some of these things to my children!    In any case, suffice it to say this is one of the best books I've read in a while, one to generate deep thinking and motivate change.  Well done.

030746363X|5.0|For me, the best section was \\"Reversing Permanent Injury\\". I've suffered from multiple injuries, one limiting my mobility. This book, and especially watching Tim go through therapies that I've read about but been scared of, gave me the confidence to know what might work and gave me a roadmap back to fully functional health!    And of course, the 15 minutes to orgasm caught my attention too! :)  The best holiday gift you can give. Because there IS something for everyone!
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Koyaanisqatsi and as others have said, this masterpiece deserves a Blu Ray release. There is no other way to view this. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release this on Blu Ray. There are legions of us who would snap this up before the ink was even dry on the disc.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|This was a great season, but I am disappointed by the lack of commentaries (other than Season One, this is the only season not to have any commentaries, which I always enjoyed). The extras that are there are decent, though (although the EXTRA Chloe arrest scene after the events of the last episode was puzzling and needed some sort of resolution to it).    The only comment I have about the quality of the season is that it starts out formulaic, but the final third of the season is outstanding....especially if you love to hate Charles Logan!
0375805613|2.0|first, I should make it clear that I love this book, it was one of my favorites growing up. I read it in a regular edition to my daughter and she seemed to like it almost as much as I do(she is 19 months so her sense of humor is still developing, she'll get there!).<br /><br />since she is still a young toddler I decided to get her the board book edition and I am sorry I did. it is tiny! in some board books this wouldn't matter, in this one it doesn't work. so much of the humor in this book lies in the page layout--you lose all of that since the book itself is so small.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The film started out solidly enough, but the hints at the main character using his EOD skills to go head to head against an IED maker never materialized.  The movie left me feeling like the last couple of hours I'd just spent were completely wasted.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|I chose to read this book because it looked like a quick and easy read. The beginning is fast-paced and fun, reminiscent of young infatuation. The middle builds up to the dramatics of Dexter and Emma's 30's.   After reading, I sat and thought about the book as a whole. I think Nicholls gives us a relatable book, not meant to provoke deep feelings, but to reflect on feelings we've had before. That's what I got out of it, at least.
0375422307|5.0|Persepolis is the story of I and many many other people who grew up during late 70s to late 80s in Iran. It is an entertaining story, yet a realistic and unbiased history lesson. For me it is like the story of my life and I can connect with it 100 percent. And from the comments by other readers, it seems that even those who are completely unrelated to the events and circumestances described in the story can connect with it easily.
0783225792|3.0|Being Italian myself there was something familiar about the rage between Sharon Stone's character (Ginger)  and Robert Deniro's, they loved each other deeply yet hated each other in the same depths.  Excellent acting.  Made me remember, we only hate the ones we love anyway, without love there can be no hate.  Think about it, people we don't care about, there are no feelings there, where as with those we LOVE, it can swing to both ends of the spectrum.    I think the F bomb was however dropped way too much in this movie, I mean honestly, it was overdone.  Good acting, good acters, a good 3 star 1995 movie.

B0045MRLCE|4.0|This is a really good debut for their first time out. I admit I was wary of them at first, but then I got to listening to the lyrics of their current single, \\"When I Die Young,\\" and I was honestly touched. After buying the album, none of them really live up to the amazing lyrical value of that song, but every one on here is enjoyable in its own right. Another big favorite of mine that's featured here is the song, \\"You Lie.\\" I definitely believe this group is gonna do amazing things with country music in the future; one of the reasons I say this is the lead singer, Kimberley Perry, wrote \\"When I Die Young\\" without additional songwriters. That shows a lot of promise, because that song is so strong just by itself. Another reason I say this is because her vocal stylings show a lot of promise. She's kind of got an old school bluegrass soul vibe to her sound, almost like a young Alison Krauss or Trisha Yearwood. Buy this one, especially if you're a fan of country music.

B002NXSRX4|2.0|And that's really not a good thing. The CGI in this movie is a joke. nearly every action scene features digitally rendered versions of the actors and it's not very high quality looking at all. The acting (or maybe it was the script?) was also equally laughable. Channing Tatum can't act to save his life! And that chick that played the Baroness? What the crap? She was pretty, but not pretty or exotic enough to convincingly play a character like that. When she first stepped off the enemy plane at the beginning of the movie, I almost laughed. She had on this low cut black top with these cheap looking sequins sewn around the neck line. I didn't really know what to make of that; it looked like some Kmart club outfit, certainly not something one would wear to kick butt. Dennis Quaid was equally horrific playing the big man in control of the GI Joe team. Nearly one handed, he really upped the cartoon quality on the movie. The role was completely ill suited for him. I sat all the way through it, but I would never do it again. And a sequel? Fuhgeddaboutit!! The Blu-ray quality is extremely nice with a robust soundtrack and perfectly pleasant picture, but it's hard to improve on what you're seeing and hearing when that's the way it was written and acted. I highly recommend giving this second rate action movie a rental before wasting hard earned money on it!
B00192IV9U|3.0|Every artist that departs `much too soon' always leaves a vault filled with unreleased materials.  If anyone could give Tupac Shakur a run for his money, it is none other than Michael Jackson.  A creative mind flowing with so many ideas, Jackson's artistry could be captured by only Michael Jackson himself.  [[ASIN:B00192IV9U MICHAEL]] is the first of several planned posthumously released albums from the late, great pop star and while it does not showcase Jackson at his most prodigious, it does not embarrass or compromise his greatness as an artist.  There are enough solid numbers to make Michael an enjoyable, though not revolutionary addition to Michael Jackson's discography.<br /><br />\\"Hold My Hand,\\" the true promo single off of Michael featuring Akon (which should probably be billed Akon featuring Michael Jackson), features solid production work, but feels more like an Akon song as opposed to an MJ one. The main problem is there is too much Akon, which takes away from Jackson's voice, making people wonder how much extra polish Akon (also the producer) had to add to make this track `a go.'  Despite this, the track is more than presentable and smartly ends with Jackson taking the lead.  \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" opens up with Gregorian Chant at the beginning, then erupts into fierce production work with infuses pop, rock and urban influences. The track is a bit clumsy in sound, proving quickly not to be `first-rate' Michael Jackson.  That said, the cut is catchy and quite enjoyable, but also overstuffed with too many layers of background vocals.<br /><br />\\"Keep Your Head Up\\" is a better cut than its predecessors, finding the late king of pop at his best - tender balladry. Here, Jackson's falsetto is immaculate as is his total vocal performance.  The track drives on a bit too long, clocking in just under five minutes, but none can deny the effectiveness and emotion of the gospel chorus supporting Jackson.  It doesn't rival \\"Will You Be There\\" or \\"Earth Song\\" (both featured Andrae Crouch and his gospel chorus as support), but that is the closest comparison that can be asserted.  \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\" opens with a recording of Jackson singing what he was looking for musically, which is a superb production touch by the producers.  Jackson sounds in top form here, and while the background vocals provide nice support, there are too many of them and they have too many added vocal effects.  The chorus is strong, finding Jackson singing: \\"I like the way how you love me/I like the way how you hold me/I like the way that you touch me/I like the way how you kiss me...\\" Overall, \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\" proves to be a standout, despite some minor flaws.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" featuring 50 Cent features unique and interesting production work, though it is not first-rate Jackson by any means. Some of the questions lie with what are explicit overdubs, when was this recorded, and how much did producers `ready' this cut for this release?  Questions aside, the hook (\\"Monster/he's a monster/ he's an animal\\") proves catchy, though 50 Cent's guest verse isn't particularly noteworthy or memorable, making you question if the MC has lost his spark given his most recent lackadaisical collaborations.  \\"Best Of Joy\\" is a bit undercooked, but enjoyable enough.  The length is appropriate at only 3:02, though the repetition makes the listener yearn for more substance and tighter songwriting.<br /><br />The controversial \\"Breaking News\\" begins with begins with the paparazzi/news media clips surrounding the controversies of Jackson; it reminds the listener of the material from HIStory or even Invincible. Again, the question is `when' were these gems recorded; what is their history? The production is nice, if dense, and the cut seems to be worthy of some spins.  The Lenny Kravitz feature \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\" is stronger, though not necessarily a hit.  The rock edge to Michael Jackson's voice is nice to hear and the production work certainlystands out amongst the rest.<br /><br />\\"Behind the Mask\\" is one of the signature tunes from this effort, with nice driving, if the slightest bit `manic' production work.  This performance is older than most and perhaps thats why it sounds more `natural' and `nuanced.'  Closing cut \\"Much Too Soon\\" is hands down the best performance with stripped production work that suits Jackson well.  The background vocals work best here as they are subtle.<br /><br />Essentially, Michael is better than expected, but not a victory lap for the late singer.  Jackson's best work lies in the material that his mega audiences have come and continue to love.  That said, Michael is no shameful addition to the singer discography, and no Jackson fan can deny their eagerness to continue to support one of the greatest artists of our time..      \\"Behind the Mask\\" is one of the signature tunes from this effort, with nice driving, if the slightest bit `manic' production work.

B00192IV9U|5.0|... and I've listened to it from start to finish everyday.  I highly recommend it.  \\"You'll like it. I guarantee it.\\"  All of the songs are quite good, and I bet everyone will find at least two personal favorites.<br /><br />The stand outs for me are HOLD MY HAND, HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, MONSTER, BREAKING NEWS, ANOTHER DAY, BEHIND THE MASK, and MUCH TOO SOON.  Wow! I guess that's all but two of the songs on the entire album.  I guess I really love it then.<br /><br />All of the songs have very creatively written and produced musical preludes that set the tone for the song seconds away.  I find it easy to visualize videos to most of the songs too.<br /><br />Michael possessed a gifted ability as a singer to adapt to a variety of musical styles by changing the way in which he used his voice.  He could growl with angst on songs like \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough or Leave Me Alone,\\" and he could ease into a smooth  R&B ballad like \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" or \\"You Are Not Alone.\\"  When he sang \\"Butterflies\\" on the under appreciated \\"Invincible\\"album he used a falsetto that was unrecognizable to me when I first heard it.  Michael had an amazing command of his chops, and I am looking forward to hearing more of the music he left behind for us to enjoy listening to and squabbling over.

B003XRZZFM|1.0|A general evolution continues into vastly overproduced hollywood soundtrack material with little resemblance to original DIMMU BORGIR.  In fact, as my son put it, \\"this sounds like a so-called black metal version of KAMELOT.\\"  Not too far off the mark.  There is little black metal about this but that is not the problem.  DIMMU is what DIMMU is; a theatrically based musical production group employing occasional elements of both old-school and neo-black metal.  \\"Kings of the Carnival Creation\\" anyone?  These days they use less metal influence and more over-the-top orchestral passages and gimmicks.  And losing the clean wailing bassist (ICS Vortex) was a HUGE mistake.  But hey, if you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy this.  But if you are looking for any sort of heavy metal (I use the term broadly) stick with the best DIMMU albums; 1. Enthrone Darkness Triumphant and 2. Puritanical Euphoric Misantropia.  I will say also that the opener on In Sorte Diaboli (\\"The Serpentine Offering\\") is an excellent track and video, worth purchase of that disc.

0399536108|5.0|These types of books have become all the rage-- 4 hour work week, vagabonding travel, etc-- and this one fits right in the same category. It is almost as if you put down the last one and pick up this one and it is the same author. However, whereas 4-hour work week is really, REALLY self-absorbed, Guillebeau is quite a bit more down to earth. He really wants to help. In summary, he doesn't want people dwelling on the past or wasting time doing busy work. And he drums home the message of no excuses. Just go out and do the things you dream about. There was one point about 1/3 in where the book drifted into a spot where I was like, 'come on, give us more details'. But half way through there were lots of good stuff and as the pages counted down-- and I finished this book fast, like 2 days-- I felt definitely as if the book was really good.

B0036EH3XE|3.0|I was certain we would see a SciFi, paranormal, Rod Serlingesque type of ending. Instead we got an emotional and spiritual ending that really didn't fit the mold the writers cast the prior five seasons. To be honest, I'm very disappointed with season 6 as a whole. The first five seasons are absolutely classic television masterpieces - has there ever been a more classic cliffhanger ending as the last episode of season 5?    The sixth season seems rushed out the door and not well thought out, from a creative angle. If I were to sum up S6 in one word, it would be mediocre, hence the three star rating. This ranks up there with Dallas as one of the worst conclusions to one of the best TV series ever made. There, I said it. I feel much better now.

These are some of the words that Nancy Horan ascribes to Mamah Borthwick in her novelization of the woman's life and love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright.<br /><br />This was the most recent selection for my book club.  As always we had a lively discussion about the book with varied view points and perceptions on the book itself as well as the behavior of the characters in it, particularly Mamah Borthwick.<br /><br />I thought the writing was excellent, it felt very realistic to me, reading this novel was effortless.  I never read a word out of place, I never wondered what the editor was thinking, I never thought about the editor.  Which is high praise in and of itself.  I thought the book was so well written that it was easy to forget that we were reading about Mamah's life through the eyes of Nancy Horan.<br /><br />How you perceive this novel has more to do with your personal views on fidelity,  motherhood and marriage than it has to do with how well this book is written. If you are able to empathize with Mamah and feel sympathy for her and the dissatisfaction she feels with her life and marriage then you will probably enjoy this book.<br /><br />I think nearly all of what we believe about fidelity, motherhood and marriage is based on our own early experiences with our parents and the choices they made and how those choices affected us as children.  Do we think they should have stayed married regardless of their own happiness?  Can we forgive them for their infidelities? Did they have the right to leave us in pursuit of some greater sense of satisfaction than we could offer by loving them as a child loves a parent?  Or do we think that staying in a marriage sacrificing themselves to a life they no longer want is no life at all? The answers will influence how you perceive the world and how you feel about this book.<br /><br />I continued to be curious about the life of Frank Lloyd Wright after reading this novel and found myself wanting to read more about him. I think this novel will spark some interesting discussion for a book club, I enjoyed it very much.Wright after reading this novel and found myself wanting to read more about him.

B00495XR8E|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is an absolutely amazing collection, at an astouding price ($.99). You simply can't go wrong at that price. The layout is perfect, as far as I've seen, and the the table of contents are linked, making it very easy to get to the stories you want.<br />My only complaint, and I've knocked a star off for it, is this: It clearly states that this is a fully illustrated edition.  I've read all of \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" and \\"The Sign of Four\\", and have gotten about halfway through \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", and I have yet to see an illustration.  I am pretty confident in saying that there are none. But, for $.99, I can live without them.

I would highly recommend this collection.
1400067936|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. A lot can be summarized as follows:  An astronomer looks out the window while riding in a train and after seeing a sheep says: Hey I didn't know all sheep in Ireland were black.  The physician next to him looks out and says: You cannot imply that, there are sheep in Ireland, and some of them are black.  They both look at the mathematician in front of them expecting a resolution. The mathematician briefly looks out and says: All I can say is that there is at least one sheep in Ireland and... half of it is black.    Taleb replaces the astronomer for traders, economists, politicians and, psychologists among others. And warns us about arriving to conclusions too fast. Randomness, he explains, should humble us and we should admit how little we know.  If you can get through the prickly arrogance of the author, you'll find a jewel in this book. If it had less of his personality and more of the thesis it'd be more enjoyable, but even as it is I fully recommend it. You may find the word \\"I\\" repeated constantly and would think it was written by your narcissist nephew, but if you can get over that, you'll discover serious thought experiments that don't require demonstration.    Taleb knows his subject, and he has the honesty that most traders and economists lack. We simply know very little, let's get over it. We act as if we knew what we were doing, but the results are more often than not random.  He illustrates how even basic elements of statistics such as expected value are ignored by \\"recognized\\" authorities in all fields.    A main thesis of the book, that risk, defined as the value of the outcome times its probability serves as a cautionary tale to all of us when evaluating possible courses of actions.  We warns us that even the more serious scientist, looking for confirmation of what we want to believe, fall into crass errors. All you need is enough scientists trying to prove something. Some of them will succeed. This reminds me of the physicist that wanted to prove that all odd numbers were prime as follows: 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... an experimental error, 11 is prime...    Bottom line: Buy this book, you won't regret it.

B0044CBMXE|4.0|The endearing character of Bones, and her singular adherence to the evidence, and denial of any intimate personal relationship is mimicing the legendary character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes.  Holmes could identify a person's profession by looking at them, splashes of mud on a person told him where they had been at a glance, and he could see facts in the most insignificant and mundane bits of evidence. Bones looks at tye bones and unerringly describes the details, much like Holmes.  Watson was the man of action, though most Americans wouldn't understand since over here we have traditionally shown Watson to be an oaf. But Conan Doyle made him a wounded veteran of war, very similar to FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, and Watson, not Holmes, carried the gun. Watson was a man of action, and not the fool hollywood made him in the many lame portrayals of the stories. Watson called Holmes a calculating machine, and like Temerance Brennan, Holmes had his own lab as well.      I find the whole series a recreation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but uniquely and competently modernized to our time, and near worship of science and the military man of action.  The characters are endearing, the relationships active and fluid, and the talent of everyone involved in this series first rate.  I am not being the least bit negative here.  The Sherlock Holmes stories in their day had the popularity of today's Harry Potter, they were a huge and entertaining success for the hords of people, and they remain that to this day for many of us.  It takes serious talent to recreate that, and in this series, they have come very close.    This particular episode is wonderful because it exposes the mutual attraction they all feel for each other, their work, and the need to do good and be good.  As Holmes would often say, \\"Come Watson, the game's afoot!\\"   In essence that is how the character of the irrascable District Attorney gets them all to return, she told them in similarfashion, \\"the Game's Afoot !\\" and they all responded unerringly as did Watson to the call.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|Despite what any purist or scholar may tell you Shakespeare's plays are blueprints for live stage performances. Reading a play is akin to reading a screenplay and if you have ever read either you will know they are the worst way to experience what is essentially an unfinished work of art. Films are the modern equivalent of classic stage plays and I'm sure Shakespeare himself would appreciate the power of film and what is possible with storytelling when using it as the medium.<br /><br />As someone who always struggled to stay interested in classics, despite the beautiful language used, I find a modern telling of a classic much more accessible than simple raw readings of his works which were meant to be seen as plays, not as words on a page. Reading a screenplay to a great film has it's place but usually if one has already seen the film. To me, the same holds true here. And I have already read this play and seen dry interpretations of it and was not moved until seeing this film. The words, give or take, are there fresh from the page but they come to life here.<br /><br />I don't subscribe to the point of view that the only interpretation is that of a classic interpretation. As time goes on the old language can get lost on the page, which does not have the luxury of a novels description. Once set alive and moving with flesh and blood actors the story leaps as it was meant to. Some may hate the setting and modern flashy style but I think it brings home a great classic and can only serve as a portal for many who would have otherwise cared less and might just be sparked to go see a play or rent another Shakespeare DVD, or even puck up some of his writing and read some and actually enjoy it. Because once having seen it interpreted, in any way, good or bad, other than just words on a page, one might care just that much more.<br /><br />Not every adaptation need get the finest actors and directors. Common folk too can pick it up to read and average actors can act it out too. I feel it was far above just average and I was pleasantly surprised at how moving and powerful it was. I think I enjoyed it most because I did not come at it expecting the same dry old stuffy stuff I've seen again and again.<br /><br />Shakespeare's work certainly does not need to rely on a film like this to stay popular, but it helps. Before ever putting a written play before a youngster I might show this first to wake up the possibility of what the words can do when given to an artist. After all, no film class would spend an entire semester just reading screenplays of classic films. While a play might be ideal, cinema is our master art of our time and this film is the perfect portal to that old master of language and poetic work.ve just average and I was pleasantly surprised at how moving and powerful it was.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Earlier in the year HBO came out with a 10 part epic mini-series about the Marines during the PTO of world war 2.  Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg whom brought you the classic Band of Brothers.  The Pacific however is not B.O.B.  In my opinion it is right on the level.  It brings the courageous story of three different Marines and they're fellow grunts.  They never intersect at all throughout but that doesn't mean you lose the story or the emotions of what these men felt.  Each of them have a different view of the war.  It is brutal, honest, emotionally heart wrenching.  You see the development begin with innocence to the loss of humanity with these men.  It isn't trying to be B.O.B.  It is it's own account of loss, love, salvation, and humanity.  As a 27 year old man, I've never been brought to more tears as I have with this.  Please view the Pacific as an appreciation for the veterans who gave their lives as well as the ones who came back scared from the physical and psychological effects of war.
0451196716|1.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan, but I only got about one third of the way into this book.  Once I realized the kids were all going to get shot dead (one by one, in the road, like dogs), the book kind of lost all appeal for me.  I just couldn't get past the premise, knowing they were pretty much all going to die.  The whole thing seemed ludicrous, that mothers would let their kids basically commit suicide or play some kind of slim-chances Russian Roulette.  This book is really disturbing, even for SK (Bachman).  There are only a few of SK's books I haven't been able to finish, this probably tops them all.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Great Product the best head phones I have owned, and I have owned them all. Amazon sold them to me at a price I couldn't find with any other company.
B0048ZJOP0|3.0|What happened to the Mariah of Dream Lover and Breakdown?  I heard a lot of nasally, breathless singing and not a lot of the beautiful range she is known for.  I was so distracted by the lack of actual emotion to depict what she was actually singing about that it just sounded like a lot of noise.  Good thing I didn't spend much on this album.
B0043HA1K0|4.0|I like the Roots way more than I like John Legend. But, J. Legend is cool in his own right. I really like what the roots band did with the instrumentation ... I think that one of the things that happens when you are doing covers is that you try to keep some of the original wonder and bring up to date with the modern steez. I feel like they were able to pull this off better than most ... keep it original, fresh and funky. The only thing that I don't like about this album is that John Legend is intelligible enough to write his own \\"wake up call\\". As a grammy winning artist with multi-platinum records, you should be able to write your own \\"freedom songs\\". The times we are living in are different and need a different message ... and if they wanted to take the time to really create a masterpiece they would have wrote their own messages. Or ... John would have, as the Roots just provided the music. But (!!) ... I like the album, just not an original piece of art.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|After seeing AB in concert early this week, I can officially say that Alter Bridge is probably my favorite hard rock band out today.  The mind blowing skill level of the entire band exceeded my expectations.  The shared feelings in Myles lyrics hit close to home.  It inspired me to break out Blackbird into my daily music rotation again.  I have been wearing out the new AB III which I love, but I still believe that Blackbird is still the diamond in the rough by AB.  The title track alone is worth the price of the album.

B002ZG994U|3.0|The A-Team was a very popular, albeit improbable, 80's television show about a group of disgraced special forces soldiers who ban together to fight crime as hired mercenaries. This movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of that show (even going so far as finding a clone of Mr. T, the original show's S.B.M.(Scary Black Man)) - which is the movie's biggest problem.    I always thought the TV Show was pretty ridiculous due to all the explosions and gunplay with automatic rifles that resulted in zero fatalities. The movie corrects this flaw somewhat. The plot of the movie is more like a prequel - the origin of the A-Team, centers around how they were set up to take the blame for the theft of some U.S. currency printing plates. They decide to steal them back to prove their innocence. There are plenty of big budget stunts, explosions and the disregard for the laws of physics, just like a multi-million dollar episode of the TV show.    If you liked the A-Team TV show, then you will probably like this movie. Yes, its dumb at times; but I don't think anyone is expecting an Oscar-worthy screenplay here.
B001LV5OOY|5.0|I really enjoy it.  Reminds me somewhat like a cross between the Killers (of whom I love) and Tears for Fears.  Good sounds.  Listening to it all the time.  ;)
B0042816YK|1.0|This is a classic \\"Men Bad, Women Good\\" movie that ultimately contradicts itself. Its a long, long, long boring movie about very little at all. The movie is like a very ornate and expensive vase filled with Spam - you rudh to look inside and then the reaction: \\"Yuck, that's awful\\".    The truth is, I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan. Heck I'd rather watch an Eric Roberts film (even Sharktopus is better than this) than sit through this again. The film's lame premise is a woman's voyage of discovery through different cultures that results in a revelation after she gets nailed by some Brazillian guy. I guess its true; that if you do it right, sex can be an epiphany generating experience...    Do yourself a favor - don't go near this dreck.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|The content wasn't that surprising as I expected, but it's a harmless reading. It's an invitation of give the best of you when interacting with others or accomplishing something. To give your gift is to be creative about it and doing art in everything you do. For that you must overcome your \\"inner resistance\\" to change and do better. If you haven't read anything about this kind of topics, the book will be gold, if you have, then this will be a just-another-more-book-in-the-list kind of thing...
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Despicable Me is an unlikely kids film about a super-villain named Gru who winds up with three adopted daughters as part of a scheme to steal a super-weapon.  This film is not fall-over-your-seat funny but there are many little funny moments. I think the three little girls in the film sort of keep it afloat more than the Gru character.    The main theme of how children can reach even the most hard-hearted of us is hammered home by Gru's transformation from a ruthless rogue to a caring but not overly sweet person. Children will be engaged by this picture and adults can watch Despicable Me without getting bored.
B0013NS6EU|3.0|It's a nice-to-have book. It has some cool concepts about visualization and graphic thinking. May be it should be cheaper and shorter, though.<br />If you're buying the kindle edition, be aware that the resolution of the drawings is really bad, way to bad... not cool!
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|Rather than me write a this review, I'm going to let my cousin, Tawny, winner of the Ms. Teenybop Consumer Award of 2010:  Tawny: \\"Like, wow, this is waay cool. Like, you got Edward, who is sooo cute and Jacob, he's uber-dreamy. I love his hair. hmmm.. Anyway, like these guys are soo hot and vampires, well one is a vampire and one is a werewolf. I've got both T-shirts, one says 'Team Jacob' for the werewolves and the other says 'Team Edward' for the vampires, soo hot. These guys fight other vampires and stuff to help Bella, she like loves them both, its so sad since she has to pick one. I'd like, pick Edward, he has prettier eyes. Anyway, there's this big fight at the end and - \\"  Me: \\"HOLD UP, Tawny. Let's not give away the ending of this exciting movie. Instead, tell everyone what kind of Eclipse product tie-ins you have..\\"    Tawny: \\"Well, like I got the Eclipse Jacob Hair Gel, the Edward Eye-Liner, the Bella Ante-Bellum Dress Kit, the Eclipse Mug set, the Twilight Team Edward earring and the Team Jacob earring, and like uh these way cool Eclipse sunglasses.\\"    Me: \\"Wow, that is quite a bit of merchandising. Tell me about the director and the screenplay.\\"    Tawny: \\"The what and the who?? I don't know any of that stuff. Do you mean the story? Its from the books, everybody knows that. Maybe someday I'll like, y'know, like read one..\\"    Me: \\"Great idea. Besides the hotness, are there any other comments that you would like to make?\\"    Tawny: \\"Bella has nice shoes, I wish I could get a pair like hers. Oh,yeah, like for the haters: You just don't know anything about love. Eclipse is soo romantic. *sigh* I wish I could find a vampire lover with pretty eyes like Edward *sigh*\\"    Me: I can't add anything to that. Goodnight folks!!
B002ZG981E|1.0|My husband really wanted to see this. So, we clicked the On Demand button on the dvr and voila, instant sominex. I was so bored I wanted to scream. I turned to say something about how bad this film was to my husband and saw that he was out like a light...no doubt \\"dreaming\\" of watching grass grow which would be much more entertaining than this piece of crap. Hollywood has gone beserk..they charge an awful lot of money to see a movie these days and then give you films like this? Bad!
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception is a Science Fiction film in the purest sense of the word. It does have some amazing special effects but the Inception has a unique way of sticking in your head due to the clever way it handles its subject matter.    Instead of dealing with the exploration of outer space, this film tackles the subject of the inner workings of the human mind. In the future, people have developed a way to tap into peoples dreams as a means of corporate espionage. That is the main character's, played by Leonardo Dicaprio, means of making a living. His special talent goes a step further by creating/controlling dreams within dreams to extract secrets from the dreamer. The movie is alot like a hiest film where the vault is someone's mind.    Leaonardo's character takes on \\"one last job\\" in order to free himself from the imposed exile from his home and family. The job is extremely dangerous since it involves creating one dream world inside another, inside another. The danger is that his emotional baggage could trap him in the dreamworld forever.    Inception is a very engrossing film that forces the viewer to pay close attention to what is happening on the screen; rewarding him/her to a great movie-going experience. This DVD is a \\"must have\\" for any fan of director Christopher Nolan and a \\"must see\\" for anyone else.
B0041T52S6|4.0|I loved this movie and agree with the previous reviewers' descriptions, \\"completely fresh\\" (I've never seen anything like it!), \\"fast-paced\\" (whoa,yes!), \\"fun\\" (great for an escapist viewing night), and \\"K.O.\\" (in more ways than one!) I'll add that there is some exploration of the dynamics of relationships and some romance here, too; nicely done. BUT: If you want the numerous bonus features you need to buy the DVD, not rent. The rental disc does not include the bonuses.
0740797719|5.0|James Gurney deserves high praise for this effort. He condenses the best tips from a century of art and illustration, balances them against current scientific knowledge, and drops it back in our lap in a process-oriented package. It is dense, it is specific and it will help you become a better illustrator. Gurney's effort makes so many other books (think \\"how to draw ______ for beginners\\") look like pedantic exercises for 4 year olds. James Gurney has crafted a serious book for serious illustrators, and I expect it will directly improve my working methods.
B000LT2IHI|2.0|The biggest disappointment is that the ball often got caught in the track, we had to install an additional screw to force the track to the right place so the balls would not get stuck.  It would be more fun if it played more songs.  For what the toy does I feel it is quite bulky.
030746363X|2.0|First let me say, I was a big fan of the 4 hour work week, so I was pretty excited to hear about the 4 hour body.  Many of the topics were right in line with my current passion, powerlifting. I voraciously read most of the medpub research and keep up to date on the latest methodologies for increasing strength and muscle mass.  So from the early promotions done by Tim, I thought perhaps he had stumbled upon some unique combinations that the lab coats haven't gotten around to studying.  Alas, it's not the case, just more of the same hype with little empirical backing.    In fact most of the book is just so random in its material:  from how to swing a bat to producing pheromones through brazil nuts.  In reality it seems more like six month's worth of Men's Health articles, complete with sensational headlines that have little substance.  Take for example the 15 minute female orgasm, an item that I admit peaked my interest.  Now it may be just me, but I read it as an orgasm that lasts 15 minutes, but in reality it is an orgasm \\"in\\" 15 minutes.  Subtle difference in wording that makes a world of difference in meaning.      The most disappointing, for me and my background of powerlifting, was the information of strength gains and muscle growth.  I could produce reams of data that contradict Tim's claims, but let's just suffice it to say gaining \\"34 pounds of muscle in 28 days\\" or adding \\"150+ pounds to your lifts in 6 months\\" is a pipe dream except in very specific circumstances (for example Tim basically having been starved prior to his weight gain or untrained individuals gaining strength which basically happens to anyone first starting to lift on a decent program).    Overall, my expectations fell far short of the promises. But why should I be surprised?  The fitness industry is plagued with snake oil salesmen, and when of the best self promoters out there (and I mean that with admiration; I wish I had the ability to do what Tim has done) comes out with a fitness book,why should I expect anything different than rehashed diets and workout routines with a dash of carnival barker?
1400079144|5.0|Interesting puzzles, some stunning plot twists and a whole new perspective on Washington and the founding fathers. Well new to me anyway. It kept me up till 2am when I could not stay awake any longer. Sure it somewhat petered out at the end but still a great read.
0061122416|5.0|My review is short because English is not my first language.    This book is one of the best for all ages. It is not just about a boy, desert battles, gold, omens, or a young love fair. All those things in this story are metaphors pointing to the ultimate reality: life, love, courage, personal journey, suffering, and humanity. \\"The most valuable things in life are often free\\" said in an old saying, thus the ultimate reality mostly lies in simple things. This \\"simple\\" story is not so simple. Every word is concise and precious. Simplicity doesn't mean simple.    After I read some negative ratings from other reviewers on Amazon, I sighed... because I am sure that most of them haven't tasted the flavor of life. Therefore, I suggest them to read this book again for their own well-being.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Sup brahooskies? Sittin here listening to my Sony cans. Ordered these close to a month ago, so my review is slightly limited. Thusfar, I gotta say these things are great and it didn't take long for me to fall in love with em. Literally opened up my music. First couple days having 'em I was unsure if they were worth the investment, but now that I've settled in with them I couldn't be happier. I usually do my home listening over a nice speaker system but now do my home listening almost exclusively with the 7506s.<br />Some key points:<br /><br />-Sound. Quality is flat, in the good sense, and reproduces a mix accurately. It doesn't boost the bass like many modern cans are made to, so these are probably not what you want if most of your music is rap or hip-hop, where extra heavy bass is favored. These are great for a polished Languedoc LP mix and especially good for those extra crunchy AUDs you're pulling from etree.<br /><br />-Comfort. The pads they come with are nice and soft although I found that my ears got hot and slightly sweaty after some time with them on. You'll see a lot of heads recommending that you get a pair of beyourdynamic velour pads to slap onto these puppies, and let me tell, they are right. Definitely do it. I was reluctant to spend an extra $20 on those pads since I was saving that money for some extra heady lot crystals and maybe a veggie burrito but the trade-off was worth it in the end.<br /><br />-Durability. I've only had these for a month, but when I was changing the earpads, I didn't realize the foam comes off by itself, and I attempted to pull off the entire cover of the earcup. That's what you get when changing earpads with a head full. ANYWAYS it had just finished raining outside and the lucky charms dude slid down a rainbow and told me I just have to roll off the old pads and than slip on the new ones. Then he rode off into the sunset with Ernie and Bert while they all raged a sick Reba jam. So I changed the pads, and even with my aggresive pulling, my cans are still in fine shape. I'm not worried about these suckers breaking on me anytime soon.<br /><br />Quick recap: Comfort is very good, I would reccomend upgrading the padding to beyerdynamic velour (make sure right model) if you're ears get sweaty.<br />Durability seems to be great.<br />Sound is great for those uber heady Phish AUDs, your Beatles Remasters, and more, but not so much for hip hop and rap. Sampled some classical music which also played through nicely. I did think my Airto Momeira sounded funny though (latin jazz)
B00061S0QE|5.0|How can you go wrong with Happy? There is a pretty girl, and singing... and SINGING in a STORE.... and even some stuff that held my 3 yr old's attention!
0307463745|5.0|I´ve heard about this book when it was released and at the time it did't catch my attention. I bought months later and just found out that it is up to the good reviews written about it. It's a great source of ideas and it inspires anyone to start and get some work done. That's more than a good reason to buy, but what I enjoy most about it is that it is the kind of book that you can read over and over and it will always be useful.
B00382X4XC|5.0|This is by far the best-sounding version of Heaven & Hell on CD. Andy Pearce did a great job remastering these (and most other Deluxe Editions), preserving the full dynamic range (resulting in a CD that is quieter by today's steroid-sound standards, so use your volume control if you want loud!!) and achieving nice, smooth sound. Excellent job!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The actress who played the part of Temple Grandin did an amazing job and really gave much information and was convincing in teaching the public about handling domesticated livestock.  I enjoyed the humor, sensitivity and scenes that this vidoe shared.  H film to be recommended to all meat-eaters, animal welfare concerned folks and livestock raisers.
B00192IV9U|3.0|I feel that this album was definitely not a bad album; however, this album isn't the usual MJ album. You can definitely tell a difference within the quality of sound and all. Don't get me wrong, I realize MJ isn't here anymore so the producers had to do what they had to do to make this happen, but if only these songs would have been more completed. It would be nice if Akon would release a few other songs he did with MJ, as well as Will.I.Am because I know the had great work. Nevertheless, this is a nice album you can't deny. Miss you MJ!!!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headphones are almost a NECESSITY! Thy are so comfprtable that you almost forget your wearing them. I do strongly suggest upgrading up to a better TOSlink wire because the one sent with the headphones is puny in comparison to others. The sound quality is 2nd to NONE. Ive had the A40s and they are definately good but too many wires and in my personal opinion, OVERPRICED. If i were to have to choose between the Astro A40s ,Trittons, Or Turtle Beaches x41s. Id go with x41s everytime.
B0040JHXT8|1.0|I cannot believe the incompetence of the record company and Amazon here.     The easy complaint first. There's supposed to be an MP3 voucher in with the LP. It's not there, so, the product is INCOMPLETE. Amazon FAIL.     Secondly, the record company has plastered a sticker over what is surely an iconic cover picture. Guess what? The sticker tells you you've bought an LP. Duh. It has taken me 30 minutes to super-carefully remove the sticker and I failed to do so without damaging the cover picture. EPIC FAIL.     The LP version of this release is a PREMIUM PRODUCT. That's why we fork out nearly £30/$70 for it. So they ruin it with the cheapest sticker on the planet. What a joke. It's not even a gatefold, but that's another story.     Don't pay the premium. Make do with the CD.
0812550757|5.0|It's a long read, but it's a complex story. Quite a contrast to Ender's Game, in that regard, but I like this book better. It delves into so many topics: religion, morality, politics, ethics. The sci-fi is really a minor aspect in this book, mostly setting up the time dilation that allows Ender's life to span the colonization of numerous planets and providing other forms of intelligent life that force the characters and the readers to rethink their concepts of morality.
0865479186|5.0|Goldacre's style is conversational but concise, and he leads you through the process of how to critically evaluate the claims made by people who are trying their damndest to get you to pay them huge sums of money often on the basis of manipulating your worst fears.    This book will tell you things you need to know but it will do it in a way that does not feel like you are being taught, which is always a bonus. By the end, you will be skeptical every drug ad you read, conventional or complementary - which is precisely as it should be.    Be empowered, be informed and be skeptical.
0393338959|5.0|Since there are already a number of good reviews of this book, I just wanted to emphasize a few points that really set it apart from much of the literature written on the financial crisis in the last few years:<br /><br />a)This is not a typical market and capitalism bashing book. Instead, Joe Stiglitz very much emphasizes that any viable system needs to have both market and government supplementing each other to provide a method of checks and balances<br /><br />b)This is not a an investigative journalism piece written by some random reporter who picked up an interest in finance and economics because it's a \\"hot topic\\" to rehash the popular \\"Main street vs. Wall street\\" talking points.  Instead, Stiglitz is a world renowned economist, who called the real estate bubble and the financial crisis long in advance and who won a Nobel Prize for his work in a relevant topic of market failures, particularly information asymmetries<br /><br />c)Although Stiglitz's analysis of what went wrong is by far the most interesting and thoughtful that I have read, the book doesn't just point out the obvious shortcomings and failures of our private and public sectors. It also offers a very sensible approach to re-structuring our society and our institutions in a way that provides the right incentives and improves our well being, while avoiding unethical and short-sighted behavior that gets us into trouble<br /><br />d)The book does an excellent job of explaining principles of finance and macroeconomics to a laymen audience without dumbing things down. If someone is interested in a more in-depth reading on a specific subject matter described in the book, there are plenty of good sources provided<br /><br />e)The general level of rational thought, analysis and critique in this book is really way beyond anything that you would hear in the media and other pop culture outlets. I think that regardless of your political leaning, if you are really interested in the subject, you owe it to yourself to get at least this expert's take on what happened with our country and how to fix iton what happened with our country and how to fix it
B0042RUMJG|4.0|My only complaint is the blue ray version doesnt include a cd...the concert itself is really well done...no fancy editing, no obligatory shots of people in the audience mouthing the lyrics...a very nicely paced, extremely professional job.

B0037KMHRY|1.0|This CD is one of those black-coated type. I ordered the CD so I could rip it to my hard drive and then put it in my car. But it will not play in my MacBook Pro. This is a case of form over function. And I'm sure it's not just a defective disc- I've had problems with all types of colored CDS, including the blue ones. I'm very disappointed. Now I have to pay extra to download the digital version.

0061122416|5.0|Paulo Coelho does a superb job with this book. I felt that I was with the main character every step of the way, cheering him on with all of his successes and chastising him for his mistakes. Santiago is an intelligent young man, but he goes on a journey throughout the book that helps him discover just how intelligent he is. That journey is very much a refining process for him, and just like life for us there are several times where he just wants to give up and go home, or go back to the way of life that he knows just because that life is easy for him. Coelho addresses that aspect of human nature very well, and uses two of his main characters to leave us a message that we've really always known but a lot of times forget. We want to accomplish great things and receive great honors in life, but many times we just want to get there without doing a whole lot of work or going through personal transformations that are necessary with each of life's journeys. The following dialogue portrays this tendency:    \\"Why are you called the Alchemist?\\"  \\"Because that's what I am.\\"   \\"And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so?\\"   \\"They were only looking for gold,\\" his companion answered.   \\"They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.\\"     The Alchemist discovered his own Personal Legend of discovering how to turn any metal into gold, and drinking from the elixir of life. Ultimately, the Alchemist passes the wisdom on to Santiago that each person must stick to their own Personal Legend, because that is their life's direction.   An introductory portion to the book mentioned a few celebrities like Julia Roberts had read this book, and were deeply moved by it. When a book is able to take you on a journey without leaving your seat, and you're a celebrity or even just a college student, then the author and the book are both worthy of renown. Any author that has the ability to influence a person's life just because of what they wrote, regardless of who the reader is, can move mountains without any real effort in the world of literature, and Coelho has easily accomplished this.  I would highly recommend this book to the reading level of teenagers and adults that wish to understand more about discovering how to find their own personal direction in life. I feel this is worthy of renown, because the author's use of plot and character development took me on the journey with Santiago. Its message will stir you in a way that you will never forget. You will know that you must do something about what you now know because of what you have read.

Second, I mainly just wanted to watch this because I loved how Luc and Ssgt. Scott fight each other. Plus I love Dolph!!   But Dolph is only in the movie for like 10min. Gets killed with barely a fight, There are no Quirky liners from SSgt. Scott  He's not as psychotic, just very sad and the fight between him and Van Damme was just as sad. Plus the slick back hair do, not a good look for Dolph   The storyline was okay. I see that the new Universal Soldiers that's coming out in 2011 is made by the same director. I hope he does better  especially since both Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are going to be in it.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|OK, I love the Twilight series.  However, if you havent read the books please do because they are so much better than the movies.  That being said, I think Rob and Kristen do a wonderful job as do all the other actors.  My only problem with Eclipse is where it differs from the book.  Other than that I think it was pretty well done.  I am still mad about Bella's speach at the end of the movie.    Now, regarding the extras, dont get your hopes up too high.  They are not all that great.  Actually, it looks like a lot of the comments are things that have been said before.  And the deleted and extended scenes are not that great.  Just enough to make you ask,\\"why didnt they put that in the movie?\\"     The commentary with Stephenie and the producer was not good and offered very little insite into the movie.  Most of the time they were just talking about other stuff that didnt really matter to me.  Not much about the movie.    The commentary with Rob and Kristen was pretty good.  I am glad that Kristen agrees with me regarding that speech in the end!    So all in all it is a good buy; one for the collection.
B00004T1C8|5.0|Our trains come out only at Christmas, so they are a BIG DEAL for about a month, with little boys' constant play.<br /><br />We got this tunnel for Christmas -- 4 or 5 years ago.  We have not had to change batteries yet -- it is loud and has \\"spooky\\" sounds -- mining, a hooting owl, a chugging train, a honking train horn.  It's very fun and it won't break, even under the onslaught of the most determined two-year-old.
0061997811|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3FUU7PA3JHPH7]]There still isn't any Harry Potter art books, but this movie companion is probably the best thing any fan could wish for.<br /><br />Harry Potter Wizardry is 160-page hardcover and designed like a scrapbook with little goodies -- booklets, stickers, maps, etc - attached to the pages. The cover is also nicely embossed. It's printed by publisher Collins Design.<br /><br />The book covers all the seven films, including a sneak at at Deathly Hallows Part 2. It's packed with all sorts of interesting things from the Harry Potter movies. There are chapters on characters, the schools, mythical creatures, strange locations and stories about the wizardry world. You can read about all the teachers Harry had, the different villains from each movies, Ministry of Magic or all the strange inventions created by Ron's twin brothers.<br /><br />There are plenty of photos shot behind the scenes showing the sets, the miniatures and models, actors and there are even some pieces of artwork and sketches.<br /><br />The commentary provided includes interviews with the actors and staff. They talk about everything from creating sets like the Hogwarts castle to how they film the movie with computer graphics elements. I'm impressed with how much content is included.<br /><br />This is the book Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. Grab it.<br /><br />(There are some pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B000V9D5LG|4.0|The Canon EF-S 55-250mm is a perfect choice if you shoot mostly wide angle shots and don't want to blow a ton of money on a telephoto zoom lens that you only use occasionally. This lens offers you reasonably sharp photos at a very, very good price. Here's a more in-depth evaluation of this lens.<br /><br />- Sharpness<br />The sharpness is on par with that of the 18-55mm kit lens. Although the lens is not quite pro-grade, it can, in the right conditions, impress even an avid pixel-peeper. For a budget lens, it's really about as sharp as they come. This lens will probably satisfy all but the most fastidious of prosumers.<br /><br />Hey, don't take my word for it; seek out professional review sites that show you a 100% crop of pictures taken with this lens and then decide for yourself.<br /><br />- Chromatic Aberration (CA)<br />In bright sunlight, where chromatic aberration is most pronounced, the chromatic aberration on this lens is barely noticeable and probably imperceptible to the untrained eye. In more even lighting, this lens shows no signs of CA.<br /><br />- Auto-Focus (AF)<br />The auto-focus is fast enough for still subjects, but for very fast-moving subjects, it's a hit-or-miss. I gave this lens a good workout shooting cheetahs running close to their top speeds at the Animal Ark, Reno, NV (OT: cheetahs can run at speeds in excess of 70 mph). Most of my shots came out blurry (and that's not due to motion blur, mind you) because the auto-focus wasn't fast enough.<br /><br />Like the kit lens, the auto-focus has trouble in lowlight conditions. It also has trouble with surfaces that lack texture. The motor whirs back and forth trying to lock on to a focus. It can be a little annoying at times!<br /><br />- Image Stabilization (IS)<br />The image stabilization is amazing, even at 250mm. Interestingly, you can hear a click when the image stabilization mechanism kicks in. For handheld shots, especially at the 250mm end, the IS is immensely helpful for steadying your shots. I'm very impressed. (** Bear in mind, too, the rule of thumb: the shutter speed should be at least as fast as the reciprocal of the focal length. **)<br /><br />- Internal Focus (IF)<br />The lack of IF would not ordinarily be a problem unless you're using circular polarized filters. The turning of the barrel throws the filter out of adjustment, so you would have to readjust the filter after the subject is brought into focus.<br /><br />- Build<br />In terms of build quality, the lens is built a lot like the kit lens. There are complaints that it looks plasticky - maybe so - but it doesn't look cheap to be sure. It's lightweight but it feels well-built and sturdy. The zoom ring feels tight, but not overly so, so there is no zoom creep.<br /><br />- Alternative<br />Just FYI, the [[ASIN:B0007Y794O Canon EF 70-300mm]] is reputed to be sharper than this lens. You might want to give this lens some consideration if the focal range is right and if you can afford to splurge a little.<br /><br />---<br />I suspect the Canon EF-S 55-250mm is the best mid-telephoto zoom lens you can get at this price. For the budget conscious, and for people who need telephoto zoom only once in a while, this lens is a very, very good choice.of thumb: the shutter speed should be at least as fast as the reciprocal of the focal length. **)    - Internal Focus (IF)  The lack of IF would not ordinarily be a problem unless you're using circular polarized filters.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|As others have pointed out this doesn't not include the wallet and psychic paper. They're not selling us one item and delivering another. I wish I'd read further into the reviews. While I like the screwdriver I did expect more when I made the purchase. Kind of lame.
1607963027|5.0|I first read this story over ten years ago, and it is my favorite children's book. I am continually captivated by how the author, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, shows a world through the eyes of a child. The watercolor paintings are effectively imaginative, no doubt due to their simplicity.<br /><br />The Little Prince has a rose that is very special to him. He doesn't appreciate knowing her until he is away for a long time. He meets many curious characters during his year-long travels and he begins to doubt the uniqueness of his rose upon seeing so many others. Perhaps his most important meeting is with the fox, whom he also befriends, who teaches him a secret about life.
