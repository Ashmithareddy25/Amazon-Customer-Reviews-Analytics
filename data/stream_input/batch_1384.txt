B005VTS4EY|3.0|why does this game need permission to have sex with your mom? She already did everyone in the whole town.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and arrived quickly (and in time for) the gift exchange.  I was very pleased with my purchase.
B001V5CIFS|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. Something you would want to watch over and over again. The scenery and the colors were so playful.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This movie is great so I was pleased to find it and purchase it as a gift.  The movie arrived timely and nicely packaged and I was pleased with my purchase.
B003L20IJM|4.0|I did like this movie but I preferred the first Nanny McPhee. The movie is a mix of vibrant colors.  I think children of all ages would definitley enjoy.
1572816112|5.0|I have felt very drawn to this deck.  I want to visit this world -- \\"The Deviant Moon World\\".  -- I have not as of yet, gotten to use this deck.  However, I am very glad to have it.  At some point and time in the future, I know, that I will use it.  For now, this is where I am at with this.  Thank you.  Oh, Great artwork.  I like the guide for a reading that comes with the package too.  I did not look at the LWB, but I did look at the cards.  Did I ever.  I shall come back at a later date, with more information about this.
B0073PZN8O|4.0|This movie was a perfect date night movie. Amazon came through on this one and I am glad it was available to be rented. Good Job Amazon!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just discovered this 2004 BBC television adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel.  The actors are superb and the story is told truthfully, but eloquently!  Highly recommend this DVD set.  Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby Ashe have the best chemistry and you will not be disappointed.
B000U1Y5VY|5.0|I'll never forget when I first heard Joni Mitchell in 1969....Her voice resonates with perfect pitch and her keyboard work is always flawless.  She is a resourceful and complete musical artist.  Her early work is by far the best. Her ballads are a magical elixir for the soul. \\"Blue\\", in my opinion, is her absolute finest opus of her career. Every track echoes with relevance, emotion, intimacy and depth.<br /><br />Outstanding tracks include California, River and A Case of You.  This CD is an acoustical masterpiece.  If you listen closely to many of the tracks, you will hear the background guitar riffs of a young and rising James Taylor who played many sessions with Joni during the late 1960's and early 1970's. Believe it or not, I own about 5 copies of this CD-from conventional CD to audiophile caliber discs from Japan because I do not want to ever lose it. If you haven't yet acquainted yourself with her music or don't already own this CD, my deepest condolences....if you do, purchase a Japanese \\"SHM\\" CD-it will blow you away and you will never regret it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this is just the kind of thoughtful game I enjoy for myself and feel good about by kids playing.  biggest problem is putting it down.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|For six dollar i will read this book for fifteen through by kindle....i dont think so. Thanks everyone for the reviews I wish I would have listened before i read Feast for Crows
B004SYP5WC|5.0|There is a camera feature in the program that allows you to take pictures for your records. If you look through the screenshots you will see it. Thus the camera permissions. I keep my camera's lens covered until I need to use it so I understand the need for privacy, but please dont accuse the developer of bad intentions if you dont know why/how the camera is being used.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I wish I would have read the reviews before I invested time and money. I was so dissappointed. I generally speed read over the fluff so when I finished this book in three days I was deeply saddened to have not  gotten any news of some of my favorite characters. I have read the reviews on Dances with Dragons and it looks like more of the same. I wont be making the same mistake twice. It will be difficult to leave in the middle, leave so many questions about my favorite characters but from the review of book five even if I read it, I will not get any satisfaction. So I will just patiently wait for book six read those reviews and judge whether it is worth getting back into the game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game and challenging at the same time love it.<br />recommend it for all ages will garuntee a distraction awesome
0439023521|5.0|This book was purchased because I am a Para-educator in a high school setting. The 10th graders used this book as an assignment. I truly enjoyed the book. I received the used book in very good shape. I have order the next two in the trilogy. I recommend this book to others.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Pundits are saying the movie launched and crashed.  It opened in North America at $30.6 million and another $70.6 million overseas -- which is 80% of the movie market.  It is ENTERTAINING.  Isn't that what movies are supposed to be.  Any moron who thinks this movie rips off George Lucas has a history lesson coming: the story was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.  Gee, the same year the guy created a little known character named Tarzan.  If $250 million was spent by Disney it was all on the screen. It looks great, it moves along well.  Taylor Kitsch is fine as John Carter and Lynn Collins makes the most beautiful Dejah Thoris.  Willem Dafoe is wonderful as Tar Tarkus.  Dominic West is perfectly slimy as the villain.  The film does itself a favor by advancing elements from GODS OF MARS -- the evil Therns.  Look forward to seeing John Carter of Mars again!  A pulp fiction fan since I was 15, this movie sadly says what CONAN THE BARBARIAN could have been.  Look forward to the sequels and -- one day -- del Toro's vision of H.P. Lovecraft's AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is a great version of the origanal angry birds and angry birds seasons.  instead of the pigs there is the monkeys from Rio and you can use a few of the Rio birds.  I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The great thing about Kindle books from Amazon, is you can get a sample. I would not normally be interested in a book like this but I tried the sample and I was hooked. This is a professionally written, well edited, and riveting book. I highly recommend it!
B005721W9O|3.0|Funny movie, but definitely not a brilliant movie. Go for it when you have some time to kill or need a little laugh.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was the first si-fi book i ever read as a child. since  have been hooked on Card's books and always anticipating his next book.
0316069353|1.0|I gave the author one star because anyone who writes a book deserves some credit for trying but this book is just plain tedious.  I knew what the outcome would be almost at once so there were no surprises.  If you just have to read it, borrow it from the library.
B000002IQ9|5.0|If you like Phil Collins, you'll love this. All of his hits.  A good CD to have on long drives.
0385737955|4.0|This book would make a very fine novel study. And aside from that, it was just a very readable, suspenseful stories that I know a number of my teen students will appreciate (maybe the boys, more than girls since this story has such a number of great, interesting male characters).  Although compared by some (at times unfavorably) to the Hunger Games Series, I believe the book stands on it's own merit and offers readers a chance to have meaningful discussion on the themes of :survival, experimentation, catastrophe and an in-depth exploration of the \\"rules\\" societies are based upon [i.e. what makes a society successful or even viable]. Additionally, the marvelous use of language found in the story could act both as a vessel for building vocabulary and as a way to explore idioms [story contains it's own, unique idioms]).  Since there are many complex ideas available for discussion presented in the novel, if used for novel study purposes, this book would probably best be suited to older or academically able middle school students (probably late in the year advanced 7th grade students or 8th graders).
0545265355|5.0|I recieved the first book as a gift. Once I started reading it, I was hooked. I read it in a day and knew I wanted to read the other books, so bought the whole box set.

I will be buying from here again.The quality of everything is really good! I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!

B003L77GH4|5.0|If you've been hooked to Vampire Diaries Season 1, you'll definitely like this Season 2. This is total entertainment and mind blowing scenes. Highly recommended! Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley were awesome and great actors.
B002DQLGHU|2.0|I will not purchase Amazon movies again until this is remedied.  I cannot hear well and I will not hurt my ears for a product that can easily include CC.  Check out Hulu if you need to figure out how to do this.<br /><br />It's a fairly popular movie so not really any excuse when I can download an .srt file from the web.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The perfect release of a perfect movie. Loved it! Everybody should buy this pack and watch it entirely. Enjoy the films!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like most people, I wanted to read what the fuss was about. And I'm glad I did. Once you start, it becomes hard to release this book out of your hands until the last page is read. This is the fastest I've ever read a book and that's saying something. I'm really excited for this movie to be released. You fall madly in love with the characters including the antagonists. Its just that good!! I will be keeping up with this trilogy for sure.
B001QB9H10|4.0|I got the movie very fast and it was in good shape. A very good product for the price. The product was exactly like the description.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Time travel back to the Sixties!  This book reminds me of Stephen King's earlier books, where the situation was so interesting you just had to carry on reading all night to find out what happens in an unique situation.  The style of writing reminds me of \\"The Stand\\" and it is not one of his horror stories but definitely science fiction of the most clever kind.  I really enjoyed it - it made me think of the possibilities of time travel in a new light!  Really brilliant!

B002BWP49C|5.0|The LONG-awaited wedding of Bella & Edward! Their honeymoon on Isle Esme! The birth of their daughter, Renesmee. Bella's transformation! This was a LOT for director, Bill Condon, to fit properly into ONE film. But, he did it! I was only disappointed that there weren't more \\"extras\\". I would have loved to see the extended and deleted scenes, as well as hear commentary from the stars of the film, not just the director. But, all in all, well done! I LOVED IT!
B00005JPD0|5.0|Done really well, it is very entertaining. With Denzel Washington and Val Kilmer and a cast of others, Science Fiction and action, like a book one cannot put down.<br />Received in good condition. Tku.
031617615X|5.0|I had the original book but wanted it with a movie-tie-in photo. This did the trick! The book is a bit long and gets pretty detailed and even a bit confusing toward the end. Frankly, I had to read it TWICE to keep all the different covens and what was going on with each of them, straight. But it was well worth the read!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Jaden Smith does a great performance in this one along with Jackie Chan and co-stars. The artistic quality and scenery in this movie is great. This is a must see entertainment. Well done for all the training that went behind the scenes of this movie. Definitely would love a sequel to this with the same characters. Really pulled off a great re-make.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I downloaded it.  What a pleasant surprise!  I loved the whole concept of it and I couldn't put it down!
B002M5E2DW|3.0|When reading \\"Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne I was both excited and dismayed in equal measures. I love the concept of positive thinking being a way to attract positive things into your life and I certainly think that the advice provided in this book helps to focus your own positive feelings whilst negating bad vibes. Life is too short to allow yourself to second guess what you are doing and pushing yourself to the limits is the best way to succeed.<br /><br />The main negative aspect of the book for my personally was the way the author was constantly pushing the idea that material goods were instrumental in making a person happy rather than concentrating on positive relationships and internal happiness. I was a little disappointed as I had previously read [[ASIN:B007AGAIXQ Your Quest For Freedom Begins Here.]] and was expecting it to be as good as that book was.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I love English writers. Even though it is a spy book where you think you have read too many, it kept me interested until the end.
B00000255F|5.0|Sgt. Peppers, Exile On Main Street, Dark Side Of The Moon, Blood On The Tracks, Quadrophenia or (just name the greatest rock albums of all time). Think about those recordings and how monumental they were. Well I say that Born To Run belongs with those recordings. It is by far the most transformational album of Bruce's career. It was defining to the E-Street band and to their whole career and future.This does not diminish his many other efforts a number of which I prefer to this recording. Which should absolutely not diminish what I am saying about Born To Run. Even though I prefer listening to different Springsteen albums, this is the only one that is completely off the charts. A true classic.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I read the first 12 issues of Robert Kirkman's epic graphic novel The Walking Dead back in 2006. Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titled [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead:  Compendium One]]. As of today, Kirkman has published almost 100 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).<br /><br />What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of TV seasons ahead if AMC stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first two seasons. Why? Because as far as the graphic novel issue-by-issue storyline parallel to the TV series goes, I would guesstimate that the TV series is MAYBE through only about the first dozen issues.<br /><br />Has the TV series taken some liberties and made changes to the story(ies) presented in the graphic novel? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! Kirkman's oversight has brought The Dead to life in this surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. This is one of the best shows on TV.<br /><br />The Walking Dead continues the story of (former) Police Officer Rick Grimes and his band of normal-world-refugees across a world suddenly infected by a Walking Dead sickness. Civilization has been replaced by vicious hordes of the undead. But at its core, the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.<br /><br />Rest assured, there is no lack of unfathomable chaos and horror in Season 2 of The Walking Dead...although like I said...not just because of the zombies, but mainly as a result of human survivors in desperate situations that must do the unthinkable to stay alive. Fans of the graphic novel will be screaming for Season 3 because of Season 2's final episode cliffhanger glimpse of a certain person and place to come.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama. And if you can't wait until the next season, the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to get ahead.<br /><br />Check it out.as a result of human survivors in desperate situations that must do the unthinkable to stay alive.

0312641893|5.0|A futuristic, cyborg retelling of Cinderella in a post-outbreak world where there are people living on the moon!<br /><br />Society views cyborgs as lesser humans. In fact, they're lucky that science has been able to give them new life. And so it is cyborgs that are singled out for experimentation in the search for a cure against the virus that has plagued human kind. Cinder has been raised in a household that doesn't want her. As a cyborg, she is little more than her ward's possession. When she is volunteered for testing, Cinder believes it's the end. But it's only the beginning.<br /><br />Cinder is yet another of those spectacularly original teen debuts causing even adult readers to salivate and beg for more.

B002JCSRKC|2.0|I bought these boots from seeing many people wearing them and the majority of good reviews. These boots are made of hard plastic that is not comfortable at all, does not bend, and is still chaffing after many wears. Going down steps is difficult and it ends up feeling like I'm just going to roll right down because there is not flexibility. The inside of the boot is also plastic and is uncomfortable with socks. On the bright side, it keeps your feet dry.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This set is so amazing!!!! I immediately jumped on buying it when it was on sale for Black Friday. Most definitely a must have for any Potter fan!!!
B005723JSQ|4.0|Loved this book - it's a really fun read and made me laugh out loud several times! I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and this one did not disappoint.<br /><br />The only reason it's not 5-stars is that I bought the Kindle edition and the footnotes were really hard to follow along both on my Kindle and my iPad, so I ended up skipping most of them.
B006ZCWTZG|2.0|In answer to all of the excessively harsh reviews here, I'd just like to point out that every artist, Bruce included, goes through fallow periods.  This is one of them (and he's had many others). I actually like \\"Working on a Dream\\" (I seem to be alone on that one) but this is most definitely one of the ones to pass on.  Like Neil Young (who is currently driving in \\"The Ditch\\"), he'll be back.  You can't hit a grand-slam homer on every at bat.
0307956350|3.0|While \\"THE EXPATS\\", was labeled as a thriller I didn't find it that way, nor was it suspenseful.  For years, Kate has told her husband, Dexter that she worked for the State Department writing papers on our position, while she was actually a spy for the CIA.  When she started dating Dexter regularly, she investigated him and found that he was as \\"normal\\" as he seemed and prior to their marriage, she had investigated him again and found nothing.  Kate keeps her \\"real\\" career from her husband and continues to work as an assassin even after the birth of their two sons.<br /><br />When Dexter is offered an overseas position with a bank making more money than they ever dreamed, he convinces Kate to quit her job so they can move to Luxembourg.  The move will make them financially independent, though Dexter will have to work, long hours and travel and they will be able to give their children a continental education and take them all over Europe.<br /><br />The books has many turns and twists, perhaps too many but I just found the story implausible.  The idea that you could maintain this level of deception for years without anyone finding out is ludicrous and then to find out that both parties were lying just made it more so.<br /><br />It's apparent that Pavone can write and I will read his next work hoping that it will succeed where this one failed.  Found it hard to rate this three stars, but two stars was too low.<br /><br />**Receiving this book through Amazon's Vine Program did not influence my rating or review of this book.**<br />Story:  2.00 Stars<br />Writing:  4.25 Stars
B001I45UFC|5.0|We chose this book for my sons literature assignment and we both loved it so much, and hated it when we got to the last page. He really enjoyed it even more than the movie The Chronicles of Narnja. It was an awesome book and very well written.

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Takes a little bit of reading to get to know the characters, but once you do it is a very hard book to put down, and then you are hooked on wanting to read more.

1466401885|5.0|What a freaking roller coaster ride! I just could NOT put this down, and stayed up until the wee hours of the morning for 2 nights in a row to read this! Beautiful Disaster is the PERFECT title for this book, because that is exactly what Travis and Abby are...<br /><br />I feel I should say that this is not typical YA, and is meant for college aged teens and adults. There's violence, sex, language, and a VERY unhealthy relationship - borderline toxic... that said, this book was fantastic. I relived some of my college experiences, and I may have cried, a bit. I look forward to reading Jamie's other books!

I want my money back!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|if you have a PS3, but love using a keyboard and mouse then look no further. This is the best solution out there.

B0020EK4QY|5.0|Air Force One is certainly not a new film but buying it in its Blu-ray edition will most definitely be a new viewing experience for you.  I do have the original DVD release, which I had always thought was pretty good, however, on Blu-ray you will find yourself on the seat of your pants almost from the beginning.  In the first takeover scene on Air Force One, the bullets go flying literally all around you. The lossless audio is just outstanding.  Too many films skimp on proper audio production but not on this disc.  There is extensive use of all five channels from front to back, side to side and diagnally through the sound stage.<br />The video transfer would also be hard to improve as crisp details, even in the shadows, are most apparent.  The only thing lacking in this Blu-ray version is an almost complete lack of extras.  There is a commentary extra but these are most ubiqutious and that's about all.  There are a couple of movie previews on the disc.  I hate to pay for a company's advertising and wish they had used that space for any extras that could have been there instead.<br />Never the less, for the video and audiophile, this is one Blu-ray DVD that can, and should, be used for any demonstration of one's system.  I highly recommend it.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I spent a lot of time on this game and I thought it was awesome. There are so many cool games.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|a very moving chronicle.  I suffered with the characters of this book.  could not put it down, did not watch any tv until I finished the book.
1466401885|1.0|I can see why this book is appealing to a certain crowd - it features the classic good girl meets the bad boy plot, with all that flash and bang. However, I was disturbed by the nature of the relationship between the hero and the heroine.<br /><br />I started off feeling okay with the book - it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great - but then things really got going. The relationship between Abigail and Travis was severely co-dependent, and at times, nearly abusive, which bothered my greatly. Travis is overly jealous and possessive, to the point where he nearly punches \\"the woman he loves\\" in the process of attacking someone who asked her to dance. Abigail goes around like a little idiot thinking that it's all loving and cute. She only doubts the safety of the relationship very briefly, and only \\"leaves him\\" when he considers fighting for a mob boss in Vegas. Her sometimes roommate Kara is the only voice of reason in the entire book, and even she seems to have no purpose, instead moping around, pissy and unhappy whenever she has to actually see her roommate.<br /><br />The characterization in the book is sketchy at best, and all of the characters see no harm is wildly partying and drinking until they make themselves sick continuously. The main character, Abigail, nurses a \\"secret\\" throughout the book that turns out to be outstanding gambling skills that her father says she stole from him at age 13 (her father being a once famous, once successful professional gambler). At one point in the book, Abigail heads to Vegas to settle an outrageous, unbelievable debt for her father within the span of 24 hours, and her personality fluctuates wildly out of character.<br /><br />This book is incredibly farfetched and badly written, and I find the depiction of relationships and women to be reprehensible. If the author, Jamie McGuire, thinks that Abigail and Travis are good role models for people my age (21) or younger, she's delusional. I will never read another Jamie McGuire book.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|I was sort of disappointed in this movie after watching it. it is a good ideal for a story..having to use time instead of money....but the story line..the action and the characters fell flat....It could have been so much better..The plot is: a man who has lots of time comes to the section where the main character lives and while the main character is asleep gives him all his time, then kills himself. well..instead of jumping for joy when the main character sees all the time..he goes and squanders it...I think it was sort of dumb that anyone could steal time...if time was that precious, there would be some sort of code to access it or something..and places to borrow time..Now how would the person pay it back? Then ...The main character meets a rich girl and kidnaps her..there is not even a close bond between the two of them or any romance to speak of...they just keep obtaining bits of time and keep on ticking..Very few movies have heart and substance these days..one watches the movie, then has no desire to watch it again..and if went to Cinema to see it...leaves the theater feeling sort of cheated at having to spend 10 dollars on it....which is outrageous to begin with and they do not even make kids..babies keep quiet like they did when i was a kid...
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I don't usually care for puzzles. BUT, this was fun. Not too hard, but still a challenge. My 7 and 9 year old liked it and we played it together.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|I was surprised after watching this movie, as it had a good story and i would want to see it again. In the time the movie is set in, robots have replaced human as fighters/wrestlers. The main character is a controller of robots..but gets his robot torn up....buys a new one and gets that one torn up, too...Then..His son comes to live with him or stay with him and the kid finds a robot at a salvage yard who turns out to be a winner after they fix the robot up....This movie has heart..substance and an over-all good feeling.

B0014DCTCY|5.0|The music on this album is out-of-control good.  I mean, come on, The Black Keys and Danger Mouse; obviously it's going to be great.  If you're reading this review chances are you already know the music is good, though.  You're probably interested to know about the the record itself.<br /><br />The album art is pretty straightforward; pictures of Dan and Patrick with some watercolor painting enhancement.  Nice, nothing crazy, I like the watercolor theme though.  The album cover is made of thick paper, similar to that of a cereal box, but thicker.  The cover is a bifold design with two slots, a nice little extra that's often overlooked.  In one of the slots you'll find the included cd, in the other you'll find the record and a lyric sheet.  It's nice that the record and its cover to be high quality because, well, that's part of the point of buying the record and not buying the music in mp3 form.  The album also comes with an included cd version, which is great.  Record labels take note:  there are still people out there willing to buy records; cd or mp3 is a poor substitute for a vinyl record.  If you're like me, you want to own the physical record, to see the album art, hold the product in your hands, have the excitement of opening a new record, all that good stuff.  As a matter of practicality though, It's also nice to have a digital copy (a cd or an mp3 download) because it's not so easy to get a record onto an ipod.  Why are you still reading this?  Go ahead and buy this record, you'll be glad you did.

I finished the book earlier today - did some effort to figure which is Bill from Charlie on some pictures - sorry, still cant. (To their credit, anonymity is quite useful.)<br /><br />So I'm not a HUGE Stones fan -- but i am of great writing. This does not fail.<br /><br />Was using this as my trance to help reduce smoking today (a Sunday) - then he starts into smoking around?? pg 510-ish? go fig.<br /><br />Read the german book halfway thru Life - just for a break - int'g tangent. Same diff.<br /><br />Candor is the HUGE thing here -- he doesnt pull anything on anyone - least himself. Prolly re-read the thing soon. How one kid (ok, 2) from god-knows-where became -- ??!! Remarkable what technology has produced - not just cell-phone billionaires.<br /><br />Richards is the epitome of \\"those who can't, teach\\" . He easily has the most masterful knowledge of the guitar, if not music, of anyone on the planet - he has held an instrument in his hands now for?? 55 years - everyday? Thats just crazy.<br /><br />I also had to look up 2 words -- ubiah(sic) and frisson. thx.<br /><br />PS  obeah  --- and<br /><br />Richards is the last of his class - sure this has been stated before - he had to scramble for 45s, amidst fading radio signals - to alleviate boredom - thats what xbox/www does now - no more richards, lennon, orbison - except from some island somewhere.

B004SYP5WC|4.0|I support the idea of apps which cater to niche markets, but the idea of a program that's only for people named Bill strikes me as rather arbitrary. At any rate, I got my friend William (I hope that's close enough) to try it out. He said that it's a well-featured little game, and his only frustration is that he couldn't figure out where the fire button is. Did I mention that William is 8? Perhaps this should be called &quot;Bills-Over-The-Age-Of-18 Reminder&quot;?
B004HYDL1K|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film from the director of SPY KIDS Robert Rodriguez is very entertaining. It has a great storyline, and promises not one, but TWO, sequels. If you loved KILL BILL, you'll love MACHETE. Plenty of blood-drenching action, sexy women and excellent acting. I recommend it.
0439023521|5.0|In the post-apocolyptic country of Panem, 12 districts and the Capitol are what remains of North America. Each district is responsible to supply goods to the Capitol. Because of an uprising of the Districts against the Capitol 74 yrs previously, each district much select 2 \\"tributes\\", a boy and a girl, ages 12-18 to participate in The Hunger Games at the Capitol, where all 24 tributes will fight to death as both a reminder to never challenge the Capitol again and as for entertainment. Only 1 of the 24 tributes will win, the last to survive.<br /><br />In District 12, Primrose Everdeen was selected, at random to be a tribute. Because Prim is only 12, her sister, Katniss, volunteers to take her place. Katniss and her male counterpart tribute, Peeta, are swept away to the Capitol to participate in the pageantry, ceremony, and ultimately, the fight of The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Although a Young Adult novel, I could not put this book down. It pained me to actually stop reading to sleep and I quickly finished the novel within 24 hrs. Entertaining from page 1, The Hunger Games took me on an emotional rollercoaster spanning from thrilled to devastated to hopeful. I can't wait to dive into the second book in the series!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a book club read and I can't believe I waited so long to read this book. It had been recommended to me by so many people and maybe that's why I held off on reading it--I was afraid it wouldn't measure up. Instead, it was probably one of the best if not the best book I'll read this year. The plot was a skyscraper of leveled reveals that when the twist was revealed (which I absolutely didn't anticipate) I actually gasped out loud--glad I was alone. This book was brilliant. I've heard that only Ender's Shadow duplicates what Card accomplished here but, once again, I find myself afraid to chance being disappointed.<br /><br />THIS is why I belong to book clubs. Some of the best books I've ever read were either a part of a curriculum or due to book club. I'm so glad this book hit our read list.

But wanted to scream at how the characters ran around in circles..  40 years to shrug off stubborness and admit true love?  While I enjoyed meeting the other characters on the journey through out the book, if I could have shaken Rosie in the hope her stubborness disappeared, I would of.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a great game and lots of fun. My wife and daughter could play this game for hours. It actually makes you think as well, instead of just a boring game
1451627289|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book. It will not be my last.<br /><br />I literally could not put the book down and was horribly sad when I finished.  It has been quite a while since I read it and I still think about it daily.  I have certainly read many books since, but I find myself practically screaming its laurels when a friend asks what they should read next. (It is quite selfish that I do this, but I need to talk about it!)<br /><br />I have always been interested in the what-ifs in regard to the Kennedy assassination and when I saw Stephen King on Morning Joe talking about 11/22/63, I knew I'd try it out. I am still surprised at the scenario he presented and there are still a few things I don't quite get, but that is exactly why I need every one of my friends to read it so we can all come together and figure this stuff out!<br /><br />Even if you are not interested in time travel, history, or the JFK assassination, you will enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Just an excellent book.  That is all.

0375869026|5.0|\\"I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid...I know ordinary kids don't make other kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get scared at wherever they go. My name is August, by the way, I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\"<br /><br />August may not look like an ordinary kid, but he loves to do things that ordinary kids like to do such as play games, joke with friends, and do things with family. He was born with a facial malformation and has undergone extensive, painful surgeries that have eventually improved many factors of this life. However, the kids at his new school don't understand why August is different. As August says, \\"They were just being normal dumb kids.\\"<br /><br />You see August has been home schooled by his mother all his life and she finally decided that it may be beneficial for August to go to school and try to interact with kids his own age. At first, he wasn't thrilled with the idea, but he made a few friends and he really liked going to school, until he runs into some problems that may change his mind.<br /><br />This book is ultimately about August and how life effects him and is not only written in his point of view, but in other points of view such as his sister Via, his new friend Jack and Summer and others he meets on the way which are very important to the story as well.<br /><br />How can I express my feelings for this book? It is funny, moving and thought provoking. It is wonderfully written and the characters are real. I recommend that everyone of all ages read this book and hopefully it will make you reflect on your life and how you feel about yourself and others. One could only hope to become the person that August is. August is COOL BEANS!<br /><br />Thank you to R.J. Palacio, Random House Children's Books and NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to review this book.

B007APG16U|4.0|I wasn't sure if the album was going to be any good, especially from the guy that did Coconut Juice.  I was wrong, production is solid, it is mostly him and not someone else on every single track.  There are some tracks that do have that Drake feel to them but he makes them his so I can ride with them.  My favorite tracks are \\"Love Game, Black Crowns, Kings and Queens and Let it show\\".  Don't sleep on this one.

B003VWU2WA|5.0|This seems like such a neat little product, however every time I plug it into the back of my 2011 Mac Mini I get an error message alerting me that a USB device is pulling too much power and has been disabled. I've tried restarting my computer and reinstalling the Griffin drivers, neither helped. I plugged it into my PC and it functioned perfectly. So be warned, if you own a Mac Mini this may not function correctly. I'm not returning it as I can still use it with my PC, however I wish it worked with the computer I bought it for.<br /><br />UPDATE 04-05-12<br />Okay, so I searched the internet and found a solution on Griffin's website. Their product fix seemed to be a bit outdated as I couldn't find the preference file they referenced, but following the rest of their steps did solve my issue. It's now running perfectly, no issues. I've changed my review to 5 stars.<br /><br />If you're having issues with this on your Intel mac, here's what worked for me (minus the pref file which I didn't seem to have):<br />Download the latest version from the website and run the uninstaller.<br />Delete the preference file called com.griffintechnology.powermate.plist. You would find this file by going to your HOME folder, opening the LIBRARY folder, and then opening the PREFERENCE folder. Drag the file to the trash, and empty the trash.<br />Unplug the PowerMate.<br />Restart the computer.<br />Install the PowerMate software.<br />Plug the PowerMate in. Rock on.
030788743X|4.0|When I first read about this book, I wasn't sure what to make of it.  I thought it was either going to be really good or really bad; it was definitely the first - REALLY GOOD!<br /><br />I grew up in the 1980s and spent a lot of time in video arcades.  This book, and its premise intrigued me because it was revisiting an era that I had great memories of.<br /><br />The book, starts off very much playing a new arcade game for the first time.  You don't know what to expect, and you aren't sure what to do, but you keep playing because of the premise.  If you can get by the first chapter, you'll be hooked, and will be willing spend a lot of time (or a lot of quarters) to complete the story (or game).<br /><br />When reading the book, I found myself constantly going onto the internet and finding out about the games that are described in the book.  While I had played most of them in my youth, there were some that I had not.  To my surprise, every game mentioned in the book is available free online.  So if you plan on reading the book, it might not be a bad idea to play the games online when mentioned in the book.  It brings a sense of interactivity and reality to the story line.<br /><br />If you spent any part of your allowance in a video arcade, and now as an adult like to read, then this book is for you!

0385344325|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said? Child is a genius. This is a smaller story, the isolated military base town setting requiring a bit more getting used to than other Reacher books, maybe a bit more exposition. But Child works insights and wit and, somehow, suspense, even when detailing railroad tracks. His worst is everyone else's best, and this story is among his best.

B006IGZWB2|3.0|Reading the book first would definitely be my advice before viewing this movie because with the movie it seems to focus solely on racial tensions and that's honestly not what the book is about. The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, \\"Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought.\\" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.<br /><br />I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:<br /><br />1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.<br /><br />2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.<br /><br />3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, \\"Rachel\\" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.<br /><br />The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.<br /><br />Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't.

0307956350|4.0|The Expats is a new thriller by time author Chris Pavone.  It was a quick, fun and enjoyable book. I'd quite happily pick up his next novel.  Pavone was a cookbook editor before he wrote this novel.<br /><br />The Moores relocate to Luxembourg because Dexter has a new job with a bank there.  Kate leaves her public policy job in Washington D.C. and becomes a full time mother.  Unbeknownst to her husband, she in fact gave up for job with the CIA as a field operative.  The Moores are befriended by other American expats in Luxembourg.  Kate's training kicks in and she immediately suspects that the new friends are not who they say they are.  She begins to follow her intuition and uncovers layers and layers of deception.<br /><br />What makes this novel a little different from the typical spy thriller is that it does not focus on any large international issues.  Rather, it is a highly personal and close up look into the mind of a spy.  Pavone does an great job of giving Kate voice and slowly revealing the facts.  There are several well executed \\"gotcha\\" moments.  Overall, it was a well executed and fun read.  The writing is crisp and easily approachable.

I'm glad I didn't know that prior to reading them because it may have discouraged me and I truly enjoyed them.  They were well written and thoughtful.  Character development, suspense, and the full gambit of emotions was there for the taking.  Highly recommend this series to all

1451648537|5.0|Probably the best biography I have ever read! I was impressed enough that I will seek out his bio of Einstein. Jobs is not a person I could have ever worked for as his consideration of others was pretty non-existent and frankly I doubt the lack of that quality contributed to his success despite his belief that he had to be a a \\"teller of truth\\". But his amazing imagination, his ability to motivate people, and his legendary focus were big contributors to his success. His desire to be where the humanities intersect with technology led to some of the most amazing creations of our time and the company he built is a spectacular monument to a unique individual. The book was created with Job's assistance and with access to an unusual amount of information that a biographer might not normally see. The writing style makes for easy reading and for anyone who has followed the development of the electronics industry over the last 30 years, the book offers some great insights.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|Excellent 3D movie. I can recomend it. You could watch without problem. Please buy it. Need more cirque du soleil movies in 3D.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|From nightwhisper.com, this has great graphics even good sounds,  Make sure you upgrade to get out from the ads, its worth it.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|man this game sucks so much I don't see how any one could ever. play this. its sooooooo stupid I thought this was the game you run away from the monkeys
B0009P42S2|4.0|Steamboy is an awesome choice for the steampunk enthusiast. I'm always looking for steampunk anime/movies and I'm really happy I picked this one up. The animation is excellent and the voice actors are great (gotta love Patrick Stewart). I know everyone's main issue is with the plot and I totally understand that, I have a really hard time explaining to people what it is actually about, but for the visual spectacle of the steampunk genre, I think it's well worth a watch. It's only $10 and has a bunch of extra features.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Program does its job, but the radar in motion crashes the program. App worked good before the last update. I am using it on the alAmazon Kindle.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|I prefer cheese tower. Even tho CT might look like a kid's game, it's challenging enough for an adult. This game looks and feels like a kid's game, because of the simple graphics and because it's quite easy. Also the cheering after each level. The 5 star games are really fun for all ages.
0385342063|3.0|While I enjoyed reading I've Got Your Number, it just wasn't up to par with the majority of the Shopaholic series and Can You Keep A Secret?  The heroine, Poppy, was relatable enough, but she didn't leap off the page. Not going to go into the plot, but I did guess it about a third of the way through, so that made it easy to skip boring parts. I don't know if SK is running out of gas with her heroines or not, but I just didn't like the book as much as I'd hoped. The subplot with the fiance was also predictable and I guessed that halfway through as well.<br /><br />I don't expect every character to be Becky Bloomwood Brandon, don't misunderstand, but I'm talking about the level of humor and charm. There's clearly a formula to these books, and this one fell a tad flat. It just plodded on for me and I wasn't endeared to the leads.  I probably wouldn't read this again.<br /><br />Next up is Twenties Girl, and then I'm going to read the books under her pen name on the recommendation of a friend.
B005HSL626|3.0|it freezes up randomly during a game, and reverts back to the home screen. I find this most irritating! Is this a software glitch. I am not having problems with any of my other apps.

B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I read all the reviews and it was with some trepidation I bought this book.  But I really enjoyed it for what it was... great King escapism and \\"what if\\".  I'd recommend it, not as his best book ever, but a good read all the same.

B0058VW36U|5.0|this app is awesome I think it works better on the kindle fire than on the ipod touch.it is one of the best games I have.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This app has a lot of features that can be useful for bill reminding and even budget planning. The graphics are not bad and the organization of data is pretty thoroughly done. This app would be particularly useful for an android device with a camera so you can use it to photograph the bill or invoice feature. I always have my phone with me and this app is ideal for the reminder, I don't always carry my Kindle Fire so this app is not as useful on it.  Make sure that if you use the app install it on a device that you will carry with you or use it every day.  I also installed it onto a Samsung Tab 4 tablet.<br /><br />Overall this is a good app and can be helpful to many people!  It does run at startup but it is designed to advise you of the bills that are due on that day.  You can assign each bill to a category.  Under settings you can create a backup data base and also set the currency also set the reminder times.  It is best if you hold your device in the portrait mode to see the entire screen.<br />You can manage the categories and create unique ones for your finances.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />• Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage<br />• Full network access<br />• Run at startup<br />• Control vibration<br /><br />The app contains the code for AdMob adware.  I have never seen a popup ad.<br /><br />This app installed 9.19MB into my device memory and it is not transferrable to my SD card memory.

B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge is the BEST band of today.<br />What a way to impact the music world with their first cd.<br />It was very disappointing to hear of Creed's breakup, BUT this band is right up there, if not surpassing Creed.<br />Having the talents from the previous number one band, and combining with vocal talent Myles Kennedy....you can't beat them. Myles plays sweet guitar as well. It's a must have for Alter Bridge fans - or even for new comers to the group. ALL the songs on ALL their cd's are exceptional.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is their best album since 5150, hands down. The  band is tight, the singing and guitar playing are vintage Van Halen. It's like they took a time machine back into the past. This is a great cd: buy it, you won't be sorry.

B000Q66JXA|4.0|Director John Boorman's take on the Arthurian mythos is lifted from Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur.\\"  At times Wagnerian in its big screen depiction, it is compelling, beautiful, moving and infuriating with its blunt, eye-popping theatrics.  Helen Mirren is impossible to look away from as Morgana, but it is Nicole Williamson's ominous, sardonic and weird wizard Merlin that jumpstarts every scene he's in.  Through Williamson's powerful performance, we see beyond his character and instead focus on the dark magic that manipulates destinies.  The Blu-ray edition brings this medieval tale back to life.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|stole another dollar from me. updated version compared to the play market. no body to play online. words words words

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is very addicting. Love the different play modes and how you can play around with the settings. The ads don't bother me at all. The only problem I have is not able to get The Wonderful Lantern Artifact can anyone help me?
1609611543|3.0|This book is OK because it provides some background on wheat grown today (I may look into einkorn for added variety) as well as tips for unhealthy eaters and people with medical conditions, but it's not really that insightful for healthy individuals who are not overweight, have no medical conditions, and already eat a balanced diet. The author makes a lot of grandios claims about how healthy you'll be if you eliminate wheat from your diet and bases it on the fact that wheat has been modified/hybridized from its earlier state (at least more so since 1970, and without being tested), yet we also eat strawberries, tomatoes, beans, corn, other fruits, vegetables and, yes, even fish and animals that have been modified and hybridized without testing, so where do you draw the line? If you had to eliminate everything that has been modified/hybridized from your diet, you'd have a very scarce amount of food to choose from. I consider elimination of wheat excessive. I also don't believe every study out there, since there are way too many variables and they can usually be interpreted any way you want them to be. If healthy people eat balanced meals every day that they have prepared themselves from scratch and don't snack or eat restaurant food or prepacked, processed foods, etc., this should be enough. \\"Everything in moderation,\\" as the old adage says. Check out \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" if you really want to find out what we're eating as a population. It'll make you cringe...<br /><br />The author never brings up the issue of HEREDITARY high blood pressure and cholesterol--and others with these particular hereditary diseases have already mentioned that eliminating wheat didn't help them. Think back one or two generations in your family (before 1970). If they were thin, but still had these (or heart-related) conditions even though they had healthy eating habits, I doubt eliminating wheat is going to cure your problem. He mentioned alopecia, but not the HEREDITARY condition that causes slow baldness in men and women, so again, I can't imagine that eliminating wheat will solve this problem. If anyone can claim it solves all of these problems, I'm sure a lot of people would be happy to hear about it.<br /><br />I also find some statements in the book troubling. The author suggests early on in the book that you don't need to exercise to be thin (or healthy). That's a red flag. He also mentions housewives in previous generations who didn't exercise, yet still remained slim. Such a statement means that he really doesn't understand what housewives of previous generations did all day long. Has he forgotten that people had a lot more physical work to do, such as scrubbing floors and beating carpets (not to mention, when were vacuums, dishwashers, washing machines invented and were affordable)? What about the home cooked meals before TV dinners came into being? Think about when people started working regularly at desk jobs instead of working in factories or doing other physical work. Think about the arrival of TV, video games, computers. What about all those \\"skinny\\" people walking around today who don't exercise and actually carry visceral fat on their organs, but just don't carry the spare tire around their waists?<br /><br />And as for wheat sensitivity: I have a friend who was perfectly healthy and stopped eating wheat only because a member of her family could not tolerate wheat. This friend doesn't notice any real changes in her health (she was healthy before, but has mild hereditary cholesterol problems) and it's been 1.5 years. The only thing she does notice is that she DEVELOPED a sensitivity to wheat because she hasn't consumed it in such a long time. She advised me not to drop wheat if I tolerate it because once you do, it would be just like becoming lactose intolerant after stopping any intake of lactose products, or becoming overly sensitive to pets, dust, germs, etc. because you're used to a sterile environment. It's like using too manyanti-bacterial handsoaps. Your body slowly \\"forgets\\" how to handle germs. I'm not saying that everyone who has allergies got them because they weren't exposed to pets, grass, etc. when younger, but I just encourage you to think about the reasons for sensitivity in a more critical manner.<br /><br />I think the book requires more critical thinking on the part of readers. Consider the fact that most people today eat excessive amounts of (particularly processed) food and calories; they don't know what true \\"hunger\\" is. Look at people in other cultures who eat bread in all forms, yet are still thinner than we are. Consider other things that might influence people's eating habits. Look carefully at the people who eliminated wheat from their diets: they modified their overall eating habits, which would of course help them to kick old habits (like snacking on unhealthy products). The only time I remember a bout with acid was when I picked up the habit from my husband of chewing gum. Got rid of the gum and the acid went away.<br /><br />If you look at the typical foods that are recommended for this diet, it is no different than what a healthy person would be eating naturally, and yet it removes wheat. I would argue that if you are a healthy individual who eats in moderation, there is no real reason to change your diet, and therefore this book is not really meant for you. If you have an unhealthy diet, this book may be a good starting point to help you examine what you are eating and how to improve your eating habits. Take a look at what WebMD has to say about this diet as well.<br /><br />Incidentally, there are no overweight members in my family, and none of them have ever had heart disease or diabetes. Perhaps this is due to \\"luck\\" in genetics, but it's hard to say. We make all of our meals from scratch (no prepared or processed foods) and eat out only about 10 times a year for special occasions or while traveling (even when traveling, we sometimes make our own meals). Weenjoy whole wheat, rye and sourdough breads, pasta, waffles, crepes, cereals, etc. (no muffins, no bagels except on a special occasion because a bagel is extremely bad for you) as well as butter, eggs, medium and hard cheeses (cheddar, Jarlsberg, peccorino, etc.), nuts, fruits, veggies, meats and many other wonderful products--but we only eat them in moderation (no more than 1/4 to 1/3 lb. of meat, a thin slice or two of cheese, a slice or two of bread in a day, for instance, and not every day). A good meal only takes about 30 minutes to make and just a bit of planning ahead. Consciously sit at the table and savor every bite. Your \\"hunger\\" will disappear faster than you might expect. Good luck!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Fast action great story. The acting is exceptional. The movie never slows down. The only thing wrong is the title. What is wrong with John Carter of Mars. More people would have Known what they were going to see.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This game doesn't have much by way of graphics but I found it to be quite fun and sometimes seemingly too challenging.<br />Some people rated it poorly just because you can't skip levels, I don't see the problem with that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the faces they made as they moved or dropped.  Sometimes some of the puzzles had me baffled, but I simply tried another tactic until I got through it.<br /><br />I rated 4 stars because it seemed to short for me, I would like to see an update with more levels.  Yes I completed the game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|if you get the pro version this program really rocks! I share notes with my family and with coworkers all the time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|To be honest, it took me a long time to decide to purchase this book.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be one of those gore filled horror stories or a boring historical account of the World Wars.  To my pleasant surprise it was neither.<br /><br />For a first novel this book was excellent.  There was nostalgia, history, wonder, and a tenseness you don't often find in books of this nature.  I loved the addition of the photographs and handwritten notes but they do not translate well into the Kindle (at least the older Kindles) edition of this book.<br /><br />From the cliff hanger ending I can only imagine and hope there is going to be a second book to tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />If you like history, fantasy, thrillers and photography this book is for you.  I encourage everyone who is considering this book but unsure of it to take the plunge.

B006MW3VGA|5.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns of Downton Abbey, Season 2. The production is very well done from the historical costumes to the set dressing; it feels very real. There's good character development, strong tension between characters and of course, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) is fantastic--with the best lines of the show. I look forward to Season 3!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a fabulously voiced story with moments that are touching, funny, sad, and enlightening.  Stein has managed to capture the NOWness of a dog's essence and wisdom without being saccharine and cloying.  Dog-lover or not, readers will love this story and its unique perspective.
0061730335|3.0|An inspirational story of a poor boy in Africa who taught himself to build a windmill from scraps in order to generate electricity for his home, then for his village.  It could have been a wonderful read, but it was much too long because it was loaded with technical engineering details.  Most in my book club skimmed the technical sections.  In my mind, if you have to skim a lot, it is not a good read.

1416523359|1.0|My sister talked me into reading this.  Hated it...too much sexualy explicit stuff, didn't like what happened with the two little boys, bad language.  All was out of my comfort zone.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was very pleased with the promptness of the delivery of the DVD that I ordered. My children and I watched it and enjoyed it very much and I'm looking forward to ordering more DVDs from Amazon in the near future. The next one I want is the one about the boy detective and his dog can't think of the correct title right now, we went to the theater to see it and I want Hugo, I read the book to my grandson. It is much better to have DVDs in our collection so we can watch them again and again whenever we want to.  We have a large collection of DVDs and want to add more so that we can have a real movie night.

0240816250|5.0|Way Beyond Monochrome: Advance Techniques for Traditional Black & White Photography. The title says it all. This massive and gorgeous text book is intended to the photography from simple black/white photography to stunning monochrome works of art. The authors not only go over the basics of black/white photography, they also cover the many different ways to manipulate or enhance your work take your work from 'oh wow' to \\"OH WOOOOW!!\\"<br /><br />New photographers may find this book intimidating. It is loaded with tons of technical information that can potentially frighten off newbies, however for those serious amateur or better that are serious about taking their black/white photography to whole new level, this amazing book will surely help you find the way to do it wonderfully.<br /><br />I also love that the authors cover just about all aspects of photography (film and digital) and the many different ways to print. This book is just so cool.
B005H5GEQM|5.0|A very good reveiw of the racing days that Senna lived in, and the challenges of those times in F1 racing.
B003L77GGK|1.0|After all of the great season, this is the only thing they could come up with? I can't believe somebody would think this was a good ideal. A civil war in the kingdom of Heaven, the angels never seen God, and the demons never seen the devil. Whoever came up with these story lines need an good old Bible lesson. I don't mean this new wave junk, but the old fashion way. I myself like this show but i skipped this season half way through and know trying out season 7. I'm hoping they just stick to ghost and demon hunting like the first 5 seasons and not try to change the Bible.
0393316041|5.0|Feynman is the consummate scientist - to say he's confident, successful, and important are all understatements. This book is great for three reasons:<br /><br />1) It absolutely destroys the nerdy bumbling scientist stereotype society loves to propagate. Feynman is just sweel, the bees knees, and a straight-up baller when it comes to being a scientist.<br /><br />2) You learn about the youth and personal life of someone who fundamentally changed how we think about the universe. And you realize, hey, that could be you. He didn't go to some fancy prep school and his parents weren't famous scientists, he embodies the American Dream.<br /><br />3) He has some of the most critical views of faith and the people around him, but he comes off as an absolutely great guy. He doesn't let his doubts affect how he lives. I love this quote of his:<br />\\"I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here . . . I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell, possibly. It doesn't frighten me.\\"

0807208523|5.0|Wonderful and funny. This edition was read by the author and you can really feel the characters' personalities. The geese were hilarious.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|So firstly I love dragons with a passion so this is  the perfect book for dragon lovers. ;)<br />Pia and Dragos they're both strongly written characters with many different strengths. Some are very peticular cough cough foreshadowing there.  With secrets that some don't know it can cause life or death to them.<br />The story was a little slow in the middle so don't read if you haven't the patience for that. If you can make it past the slow scenes then this can be in you're top reads. The ending leaves you wanting more to read, so thank goodness that the next book is already out, and ready to read.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have small ears. The kind that are a nightmare for headphones. Either they hurt or they bounce out of my ears. For regular use I had a pair of over ear headphones, but I recently took up running, and the bulk was not working for me. I needed something small that would still stay in my ears. These work like a charm. The headband is nice and thin (and for you ladies who mind, you can hardly see it at all) and the the actual ear pieces are a good shape. They don't make my ears sore at all, and they don't bounce around when I run. These are great headphones for an active person.
1612130283|2.0|Most fan-fic writers have no idea how to write but they have great imaginations!  Unfortunately, this \\"author\\" has neither good writing skills or a great imagination.<br /><br />I read the whole series in a weekend.  It was that easily read because I was skimming by the third book.  Like a lot of reviewers, I found the lip biting, blushing, \\"Oh my\\", and inner goddess to be down right annoying.  There must have been an \\"Oh my\\" on every page.  By the third book, the sex is repetitive and superfluous.  It seemed like filler to make the book longer. Cutting out the boring sex scenes, you might get a short story out of it.  The plot was sex, sex, sex, unbelievable twist, sex, sex, sex, resolution to twist, repeat.  The language vascillated from elementary to \\"what the hell does that word mean?\\"  Thank God for the Kindle dictionary because most of the big words you could not decipher with context clues! The plot and timeline of this story is so unbelievable! How can this man with so many issues from his childhood change in a matter of weeks?  That alone was completely rediculous.  The main thing that baffles the mind is how this ever got published into book form, which only slightly beats out the baffling decision on my part to buy the whole 3 book series.  Where were the editors???  Why didn't they tell her to stop saying \\"Oh my\\" and having the main character blush all the time?  After such an introduction to sex (from complete virginity to nympho in a matter of days), Ana should be way over the blushing by the third book.<br /><br />I've probably edited this review more than the entire 3 book series was edited.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this for my son as a birthday present when he turned 6.  He's CRAZY a bought playing Angry Birds on our iPad.  I love this game because it gets his face out of the iPad and has him living in the real world.  And he can play it with other kids.  He doesn't use the cards because he likes making up his own game and rules.  I would recommend it.

From creepy Paranoia Prima to harmonica blues Staggolee, you're given plenty of strong songs but little of note.<br /><br />Sally and Jack is the emotional heartstopper, a moving 1:24 minute piano solo that juts out from the rest of the rock collection. Riot in Thunder Alley is the quintessential country western buildup track featuring marching band snares, electric guitar, and sitar.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for oldies, a cool mix of period rock, soft ballads, and tense mood music, Tarantino delivers your blues.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This album has been out forever, but like most other music of its ilk, it managed to escape my notice. I say this because I am the kind of guy that normally listens to rap, metal, and other supposedly \\"immature\\" music that the more quasi-sophisticated listener deems beneath them. Put simply, I do not need deep and introspective lyrics and composition from my music, I only want to be entertained.<br /><br />This changed for me when I began dating a new girl that was in love with Arcade Fire and listened to it constantly. Like most guys, I initially just tuned out the music of the GF, and blasted my own music the second I left her place. This went on for some time until I eventually started paying attention to it. As much as the \\"typical guy\\" in my wanted to hate it out of pure principle, I began to find myself hanging up on the various songs and lyrics.<br /><br />After about 2 months, I downloaded the album from Itunes and I have been secretly enjoying it even since. To this day, the GF still does not realize it.<br /><br />I am obviously no musical prude, so I can't really comment on why I find the album so compelling, but even if I did come up with some colorful adjectives to describe the album, it would not really make much sense to anyone else besides me.<br /><br />It is crafted in a way that defies what I previously considered to be \\"good music\\". Who knows, maybe I am growing up a bit, or maybe I am just really and deeply in love with this girl. Hell, maybe she has drugged me in my sleep. For whatever reason, I love this album and I highly suggest you give it a listen.

B000FC1HBY|2.0|George Martin is Bogging Down in this Epoch Tale.  In the beginning, the new characters were exciting and well developed, but the succeding stories have begun to disintigrate with the constant destruction of these characters and the introdution of new ones. Also, Other well developed characters have ceased to move forward.  Personally I have begun to loose track of who's who and definitely \\"Why\\". I have read other epoch fantasy tales, and have found that many authors tend to loose your interest after too many books.  The ones that have been most successful have limited the total epoch to three to four books that come to the conclusion of one story before beginning another.  Martin should use Tolkien, the inventor of this type of novel, as his guide. Terry Brooks did well in his earlier Shannara Series with conclusions ending in about three books and then picking it up again using the history to base other mini series on the previous history. I will also say that Brooks has bogged down in some of his other series works, but the groups, if not successful, do not detract from the previous successes. If you can't conclude the original tale soon you will loose the interest of your reeaders, including myself, very quickly.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|Before even reading the reviews I went into the program and tried to use it. The layout is clean and easy to use. However, as I quickly noticed as did other reviews there us no bi-weekly notification. This seems an odd thing to forget considering most jobs I have ever had pay every two weeks.
B005X7HAAS|4.0|My bias...<br /><br />Loves: Gangster movies<br />Likes: Gratuitous violence<br />Dislikes: Long movies<br />Hates: Homemade dentistry<br /><br />I've been looking forward to Beat Takeshi's 'Outrage' for months. I saw the trailer last fall and was instantly excited, and was even more excited this week when I saw that it popped up on Netflix available for streaming. Needless to say, I watched it the first chance I got.<br /><br />The long and short of this flick - Beat plays a guy who runs a crew that takes care of the Yakuza's dirty work. Obviously, there's some things that can go awry with a profession like this and things get hairy. What evolves is a double crossing, lying, cheating, murderous tale that involves too many players to keep track of. Fingers get lopped off, bullets fly, and blood spills.<br /><br />You'll have to pay attention to get the most out of this movie, but stick with it. It's a brisk movie, at 109 minutes - just to my tastes - but there's a lot going on. The violence is brutal - there were two parts that made me want to look away.<br /><br />This isn't Beat's best, but it's absolutely worth a watch.<br /><br />Score: 4/5 Stars
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Simple game but very addicting. I spend way too much time playing angry birds. It is a good distraction and a good brain teaser.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of those rare adaptations that works. It truly captures the first novel in the Song of Ice and Fire saga perfectly. From an excellent cast to an extroidanry original score, this show knows how to captivate the audience. The Blu Ray box the discs are housed in is another fine piece of HBO extravigance. Pictures of the main characters on on the panels opposite the dics and an episode guide acompanied with key family tree layouts of the major houses that unfolds beautifully into a grand map of Westeros, the continent this brilliant story (for the most part) takes place in. Well done.
B0000Z0HMQ|5.0|I've always wanted this title on DVD, but couldn't find one, untill on found it on your web site. I like the special effect's for this period time. Their was no cumputers used like today. The story line was increditble.
0307913090|4.0|With a bit of a slow start, I'm becoming more and more intrigued with this tale as I progress through the book and get to know the characters. The narrator's voice has a unique timber and he does a great job of the numerous character voices. My family is enthralled with the Game of Thrones, so I'm delighted to get on board with George Martin's intricate story.
B005KELW26|5.0|Excellent product that protects Kindle Fire very well. I like the tab folio for convenience and easy protection.  I also enjoy the various colors to keep our Kindles identifiable in the house!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got it thinking it would be dumb but it is sort of addictive id u get the hang of it.
B0071MV540|4.0|Good, fun, relatively mindless entertainment.  Not quite enough Eddie Murphy, a little too much Casey Affleck, just the right amount of Matthew Broderick (he really shined).  Worth the rental.  Glad I didn't buy.
0439023513|4.0|The books themselves are great. I love the series. So does my family. That's why I ordered them on the 8th with Amazon Prime. It said order within the next 10 minutes and get guaranteed Saturday delivery by March 10th.  So I paid the almost $12 to get all 3 books with Amazon Prime and still haven't taken delivery yet. It's the 12th. It appears they will be delivered today. This is the first time I have had a shipping issue with Amazon Prime, needless to say we were looking forward to begin reading the series this weekend and weren't able to.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Things to know: I typically love the big, bloody sandal movies -- or any costume epic, really.  And the prospect of looking at Henry Cavill for two hours seemed like a nice Sunday afternoon indulgence.  But, oooh, Stinky McStinkerson.  All the chiseled yumminess in the world couldn't save this thing from itself. The storyline and script felt like a random paste-up from the bottom of someone's hamster cage (a purpose for which the copy was infinitely better suited). Even if the story was a little more coherent, it would be impossible to tell with the horrible sound editing.  Between the ridiculous masks and some digitally forced stage depth, big chunks of dialogue seemed to be lodged in the rock walls. What a mess.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This app has a very nice, simple user interface. You enter your bills information and get a reminder anywhere from a day to two weeks in advance. It even has a built in calculator to help you figure your projected bill amount.(only works in portrait mode on my phone) Overall this is a good app that I can see using every month as a checklist for paying my bills. The only thing I would add or change would be to be able to separate between months instead of lumping all expenses together across various months. Giving a total payable amount for each month would make this a 5-Star app.
B0041KKYBA|3.0|Worth a viewing.  Generally well done and engaging.  Does a good job of noting what fell into place to allow the disaster to occur, but did not find the root cause.  Something happened when Clinton was president and Gingrich ruled congress, and this does not address that issue.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This movie has great acting, and is very well directed. I wasn't expecting too see as much emotion and as much thought put into the plot as I found but I was glad they did. This is a fascinating story and gives more than you could hope for. It offers great character progression, and insights into peoples emotions. An action drama for the ages, definately worth buying.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|its an ok game. I for some reason just don't like it and I don't know why I hare it myself! I lug bakery story though. its my fav game.
B000QCSA54|5.0|Nice book, stimulates the self evaluation and ebcourages reader to make a positive life change.<br />I am sure I will read this book again when I feel there is an action to be taken to improve my situation.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I haven't read Fifty Shades of Grey yet but did read the fic it was based on called 'Masters of the Universe'. Like I said, I haven't read it but they sound like the same stories with the names of the characters and other details changed. Wonder how people would feel if they knew they were reading a story that started out as Twilight fanfiction?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An amazing ap. It is many bibles/translations in one convenient ap. I love the reading plans and learning. I am thankful God sent me this learning tool. I asked to learn and when you ask, you SHALL receive! God Bless You ALL!<br /><br />Tim :)

0143116177|5.0|Harvard Professor and British historian Niall Ferguson's book \\"The Ascent of Money\\" and its accompanying PBS video series are must read and must view experiences for those who believe  some knowledge of the origins of money, banking and finance is essential for understanding world history and the modern economy.  Those with a background in economics and finance might gain the most from first reading the book and then viewing the video series.  Others, who are less familiar with finance and economics, would probably benefit from seeing the video series and then reading the book to explore the topics covered in greater depth.<br /><br />In both the book and the video series, the discussion of the origins of money, bond markets, stock markets, insurance, government social insurance programs, hedging, real estate markets and global finance are presented in a manner that is highly entertaining, instructive and thought provoking.<br /><br />If there is one overriding theme of the book, it is that the development of money, banking and financial markets has been a positive factor in promoting economic growth and improving the well-being of individuals. For those who prefer the convenience of modern living to the harsh life of the hunter-gathering society, it is clear money, banking and financial markets make indispensable contributions to assuring a better quality of life. No advanced economies, including those of communist nations, have been able to dispense with money.  Those societies who did the best job of developing stable money, banking and financial markets prospered far more than those who failed to do so.  For example, the gap in per capita income of US citizens at $47,300 per year and Chinese citizens at $7,600 (according to the World Bank in 2010) may be explained as much by the centuries earlier development of advanced financial institutions (e.g. banking and financial markets) in the US than by any other factor (e.g. resource, cultural or technology differences).<br /><br />Here's a few of Ferguson's success stories in financial development and innovation:<br /><br />1.  The Swedish Riksbank in 1656 established the practice of fractional reserve banking, which enabled banks to keep sufficient reserves on hand while lending beyond them to increase the supply of loans, multiply the money supply and generate economic growth.  However, Ferguson says it remains to seen whether the less than 10 percent reserve requirements under the Basel I & II international accords for banks will be sufficient for the future, as compared to  around a 25 percent norm at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />2.  The creation of the Bank of England in 1694 to assist with the financing of government debt established a partial monopoly on the issue of banknotes designed to facilitate payment without the need to have an account with the bank.  For the problems a nation can experience without a central bank to control it's currency read University of Georgia Professor Stephen Mihm's 2007 book \\"A Nation of Counterfeiters\\" to read about the problems it created for the US before the civil war in having over 700 state banks and other institutions issuing over ten thousands different kinds of paper currency and coins, with estimates as high as 10 percent on how much of it was counterfeit or otherwise worthless.<br /><br />3.  The enterprising initiative of two Scottish ministers, Alexander Webster and Robert Wallace, in using mathematics to develop an insurance fund for the widows and surviving children of deceased ministers, was the model for the development of modern life insurance and is \\"a true milestone in financial history.\\"<br /><br />4.  The employment of micro-finance in developing countries has provided an important resource to reduce poverty by giving credit to people, who have no collateral to put up for a conventional business loan, to help make them successful entrepreneurs.  Most surprising is that women are far better creditrisks than men in such ventures, as illustrated by the successful enterprise of the coffee brewing vendor Betty Flores in the street market of El Alto, Bolivia.  The fact that Bill Gates is making contributions to underwrite such loans is a credit to both his generosity and the success of such micro-lending ventures.<br /><br />5. The efforts of famed Economist Milton Friedman in convincing the government of Chile in 1975 to get sky-high inflation and government finances under control by adopting austerity measures to reduce debt and dismantle much of the socialism imposed by the previous communist regime set the stage for sustained economic growth and prosperity that became a model for other countries to emulate.  One of the most successful reforms was in enabling the citizens of Chile to invest their government social pensions into the private equity market.  The economy of Chile is now one of the most prosperous in the world and since the private pension investment in the stock market began, Personal Retirement Account funds have increased by an average of 10% per year, with an 18 fold increase at the time of the book's publication in 2008.<br /><br />Yet the development of money, banking and finance has not always been an easy or upward progression.  Ferguson, in observing the \\"saw-tooth\\" upward trajectory trend of financial progress, humorously suggests in viewing the history of financial crises and reverses that he might just as easily have entitled his book \\"the descent of money.\\"<br /><br />Here's a few examples of failures and reversals:<br /><br />1.  Spain and its conquistadors, who thought the value of money was in all the gold and silver they could forcefully take from the Incas of South America and put in their coins, were soon frustrated.  Spain's massive increase in supply of precious medals greatly reduced productive economic activity, decreased the value of gold and silver and resulted in inflation, food shortages, numerous economic crises and a series of recurring serial defaults by the Spanish crown in 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647, 1652 and 1662.<br /><br />2.  In the early development of the government bond markets, the warring Italian city-states, such as Florence, Venice and Pisa,  amassed mountains of debt (\\"monte commune\\") in hiring mercenaries, such as the Englishman Sir John Hawkwood,\\" to wage wars (often against each other).  The cost of this debt, which was a mandatory contribution for the citizens who could afford to \\"invest\\" in it, plunged the Italian cities into deep financial crises, with expenditures running at double tax revenues even in peace time.  Eventually, much of the debt became near worthless, falling to as low as 10% and even 3% its original face value in the early 1500s.<br /><br />3.  The French monarchy, in trying to copy the successes of Amsterdam with their successful stock market experience with the Dutch East Indies company, managed to bankrupt their economy and accelerate the French Revolution after employing the services of Scotsman John Law, who did not have a great reputation for character (convicted murderer, gambler and self-proclaimed financial expert), as their Controller General of Finances (responsible for the French economy).  The last straw that brought down the French economy was Law's scheme of turning French government debt into equity shares in his Mississippi Company and then deliberately inflating those shares until the bubble burst.  One interesting side note is that the City of New Orleans was founded due to Law's Mississippi company venture, and at one point involved enticing a few thousand poor Germans to immigrate to Louisiana, which he portrayed as a virtual paradise, where 80% of them died from disease and starvation within their first year.<br /><br />4. The Savings and Loan debacle of the early 1980s came about because the Reagan administration tried to salvage the industry with tax breaks and deregulation to allow these institutions topay whatever rate they liked to depositors and to invest in whatever they liked, while the amount the tax payer was on the hook for, in insured deposits, was raised from $40,000 to $100,000.  The outcome was a bailout of $153 Billion (3% of US GDP) by U.S. tax payers to clean up the mess.  Did we learn anything from this debacle?  Perhaps the US sub-prime financial crisis of 2008 would suggest we needed to go back to school and relearn this lesson.<br /><br />5.  The U.S. and Japan have created government social insurance programs to take care of an aging population, and have made promises they cannot keep in terms of what the next generation of taxpayers can afford to support the elderly in the future.  Older Japanese workers have done a better job of saving and may be more willing to pay higher taxes to care for their elderly.  Also Japanese families are more inclined there to take elderly parents and grandparents into their homes and care for them.  As such, the US may be in much worse shape in trying to find revenues for unfunded future social security and medicare costs for the baby boom generation.  Perhaps the US should look to the example of Chile in allowing US workers to save a portion of their social security in private pension accounts.  However, that only takes care of the more distant future.  In the meantime, poor planning and over promising by politicians has left the US a big mess to clean up in trying to care for the elderly in the US over the next couple of decades.  Although well intended, few reputable authorities believe Obama care will actually reduce medicare costs.  As unpopular as the proposed Ryan plan for controlling Medicare costs has been with the public, something like it may be necessary in the not too far distant future.<br /><br />Although the book was not written as a response to the 2008 financial crisis and \\"great recession,\\" Ferguson's observations about \\"Chimerica\\" highlight a root cause of the current economic problem of excessive debt, slow growth and high unemployment in the US.  Chinese workers, making $8,000 per year, are saving much of their income to invest and helping to finance the public and private debt addiction of middle income Americans making six times as much.  To be sure, this has been a mutually beneficial relationship as it's helped fuel strong economic growth in China, supplied cheap goods for American consumers and provided surplus funds for the US Federal Reserve to help finance low cost home mortgages.  However, as the collapse of the housing bubble and the sub-prime mortgage banking crisis showed us in 2008, such an arrangement cannot continue indefinitely.  \\"Chimerica\\" is an unsustainable relationship which continues to inflate the US debt bubble and threatens to bring the world economy into even deeper financial crisis and turmoil.<br /><br />Ferguson isn't the only authority on economic history to make this observation.  Economists Rogoff and Reinhart in their acclaimed 2009 scholarly work \\"This Time is Different\\" and Rajan in his highly praised 2010 book \\"Fault Lines\\" all make the same point about how massive \\"current account imbalances\\" contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.  However, Ferguson does it in a way that makes the rift between Chinese savings and US private and public debt spending, as a cause of our current US economic woes, all the more real and understandable.<br /><br />Moreover, Ferguson's example of Argentina's out of control foreign debt and subsequent massive inflation and steep economic contraction in the 1980s should serve as a warning to US citizens.  If we are to avoid the same consequences, perhaps we should be less complacent about our massive increases in public debt and the large increases in the money supply the Federal Reserve is providing to finance it (i.e. keeping interest rates low to reduce the cost of financing government debt). If we don't heed the lessons of history and get excessive US public debt under control, we mayfind we're blowing a bubble that will make runaway inflation or the bursting of John Law's Mississippi company and the French revolution look less like history and more like a current event.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I do enjoy this game. I could play it for hours. I really do not have anything else to say.  A twenty word minimum is a bit much.

0439023521|5.0|Wow, The Hunger Games was an absolutely phenomenal novel. It's kind of a cross between Battle Royale and Lord of the Flies. The characters were all incredibly well written. I can't pick a favorite because I loved them all. Although, I must admit I sobbed like a baby when *SPOILER ALERT* Rue died. I think the concept of The Hunger Games is brilliant, and also a little scary. I could potentially see something like that happening in the distant future. The berries idea near the end of the games was a great idea. It left me completely shocked. I read the book in less than twenty-four hours. It completely captivated me from beginning to end. There was a lot of crazy twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. I really hope that Katniss forms a relationship with Gale that turns out to be more than a friendship sometime before the final book. I can't wait to read book two, and find out what happens next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not typically my type of reading but i thought I would give it a try..... Well I couldnt put the book down. I literally read the book in one sitting.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|I consider this a decent game,I am not much into app games.  I like it because it doesn't force you to play it for hours.  You can quickly play a session and return to back to your non-digital life, your spouse, kids, pets, garden,etc.

1595826971|5.0|I am a huge fan of American McGee's Alice and ,its sequal, Alice Madness Returns. Naturally, I am a big fan of the series dark and twisted art style, and when they announced this artbook, I knew I had to get my hands on it. Due to me not having money at the time and me saving up for other things, I couldent get the artbook at the time of release, and I waited almost an entire year before I decided to buy it. After the long wait, I finally got the book, and it does not dissapoint in the slightest. The art in this is everything you would expect it to be. Its very dark and demented, and shows very well how the minds at Spicy Horse studios managed to turn the strange, colorful, and bizzare world of Alice in Wonderland, into a demented and nightmarish hell hole. There are small comments from people that made the book on almost every piece of art, and the book really shows how much the art changed before the final product. Some pages even have art for bosses and levels that never made it into the final game! Overall this book is an amazing artbook that anyone who is a fan of the game, American McGee, or just dark art in general needs to buy. Its worth every penny.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games you can pass easy the kids like them and it keeps the kids quiet so I guess I can't complain.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's so much fun! I love buying new games and beating them to buy more games. everyone should get this app!
B005T87QCI|4.0|i thought it is very fun but can be a bit too difficult to beat next opponent. Still very fun.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Very rarely has a tv show or movie adaptation been so faithful to the original text that was written. Though there have been many successful movie franchises and television series based on books, none to my knowledge have been as perfect translated to screen as Game of Thrones. I eagerly await the premeire of the second season. Thanks to the creators of the tv series for being so true to the original stories, and thank you, George R. R. Martin, for providing the vehicle for such a wonderful departure from our own world.
B004I744AS|5.0|Just love this app.  There are word games to play.  Word of.the.day makes for a fun day( seeing how many<br />Times you can use it in a day.)

0689835604|5.0|Me and my daughter, who's 19 months old now, both love this book. In fact my daughter loved it so much that she decided to chew it up, literally!<br />So before my daughter ruined this fabulous book, we read it every day.<br />As soon as I brought the book out she'd come running yelling \\"VAYVEEE\\" (Translation: Baby) and we'd read it together and laugh at what was hidden under the flaps.<br />I loved how it is a \\"lift the flap\\" book, it adds excitement and an element of surprise. And even though we'd read it everyday, my daughter would be equally surprised time and again.<br /><br />The pictures are bright and colorful. This book is just way too cute!<br />I highly recommend this for parents who love reading to their babies, and who love for their babies to \\"read\\" along with them.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss-N=Boots is very entertaining. Our 10yr old Grandson spent the weekend with us and when he found the movie he just had to watch it.  Before he left to go home he watched it twice and would have a third time if he could have.  Now our Daughter is asking to borrow it so she can watch it as well as both of the kids.  I would recommend this move for all ages, it is great.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I saw 2001 A Space Odyssey several times when it first came out. This film oddly reminded me of that. I just rented this and I will watch it again. Really had great visuals . Not your typical Pitt/Penn movie , but they never disappoint me in anything they have done. Great acting by all cast members.  Cu dos to the writers and director and crews that put this all together as well.
0439023521|4.0|Enjoyed the book once I got into it.  Not very literary but the plot is entertaining. Would recommend it for even younger readers.
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg's book is on par with Charles and Dan Heath's book, Made To Stick. Both give simple instructions on how to break bad habits and instill good ones in their place.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This has to be one of the saddest movies EVER!  I love Asian films, they are definitely not Hollywood films where everything has a happy ending and you know how everything will end.  I saw the film first on Netflixs then just had to have it.  If you appreciate other cultures you will enjoy this movie.  I don't want to say much about it because then I'll tell you the movie and if you see it you will know what's going to happen.  If you like tear jerkers and don't mind subtitles, love classical music, enjoy a good story line, you will absolutely love this movie. There is NO action and lots of emotions!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I enjoyed the old school version of this game. Now, the electronic version is even better. It's fun entertainment at your fingers!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a very long time. This book is at the top of Stephen Kings list of well written books. I'd rate it equal to \\"The Stand\\". Probably my all time favorite !!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun fun fun!  it was slightly hard but kinda fun. hrmn .. interesting.  yupperzoo . sorry I am like super bored.  just writing random things.
B005FITIK0|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed every Diablo Cody movie I have seen...and this one is no different.<br /><br />Charlize Theron inhabits the role of Mavis Gary so completely that it is hard to imagine that she is not that person.  From the opening scenes, when we see Theron in the messy apartment, the TV playing in the background, and she is sleeping in what can only be a very depressed state, we know that this is going to be a very dark tale.<br /><br />We slowly come to see what her vulnerabilities are.  As a \\"ghost\\" writer of a YA series that is about to end unsuccessfully, it is no surprise that she seeks out her former glory days.  High school was the pinnacle for her, and her former boyfriend (played by Patrick Wilson) becomes an obsession.<br /><br />Going home to the town where she was a \\"star\\" turns into another kind of journey.<br /><br />I could not turn away from [[ASIN:B005FITIK0 Young Adult]], even though it definitely was not going to a happy place.  This is a movie I will watch whenever I want to study a character whose sad and lonely life is hidden, sometimes unsuccessfully, behind a veneer of apparent self-confidence.

But I had a Best Buy gift card so said, \\"What the heck\\" and bought it...and I'm glad I did.  The album has a low key charm that I find very appealing. The songs are not over worked with the big orchestration that one might expect from an album like this.  Is every song a gem?  No, but even the ones I don't care for are still ok.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|These socks are awesome for visual stimulation however they have no stretch to them so they don't fit my son's feet. Granted he does have larger feet for an infant, but theyt barely fit on him as a 4 wk old. So I use them on my fingers as puppets and he really likes them.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|since the game has so many various levels, it is so difficult to complete them all.I love this game and think everyone with a mobile device should get this
B003QSS2VW|2.0|I relied on my own fond childhood memories of this film when we decided to rent it for our son.  The characters are still cute and compelling, and the music is ok.  We were all having a lovely time until the racist stereotype of the Asian cat said something about a fortune cookie.  My four-year-old didn't seem to notice, but my wife and I instantly swapped uncomfortable glances.  It was a disappointing reminder of how stereotypes are learned from an early age, often through seemingly innocuous vehicles like cartoon movies.

B006P0FICE|4.0|Anderson started out as a great visual director, and while he gets the \\"kid in a candystore\\" syndrome that has killed the plotting of many of his films, his visual flair working on someone else's script elevates this film far past the wince-inducing bad previews. It doesn't hurt that the cast is top notch...all three Musketeers give great portrayals, d'Artagnan becomes charming after the 1st 3rd of his scenes, all the baddies are well-cast (although it appears poor Mads may have had physical problems during the end sequences that they were trying to cover), and even the incidentals, such as d'Artagnan's father, stand out in great performances. Jovovich shines in almost anything she does, and she's excellent here.<br />Constance....we need to drown Constance. The one misstep in casting. It's like trying to watch Keanu Reeves in Shakespeare.<br /><br />The script is where the problems occur. It's not that they took liberties...what they changed all logically makes sense in an alternate tech timeline and are really quite well done if you don't hate the fact that they changed things. It's certainly better than the Disney script. It's not that it's a badly structured script...it's not.<br />No, the problem is that they don't know when it's good to be over the top, and when it's too much. For instance, the first act is fun, but too much, too fast (complete with comic booky Guy Ritchie style introductions)and too Mission Impossible: The Steampunk Years for the majority of the rest of the film. It makes the climax, which should be over the top for this film, a little anti-climatic.<br /><br />But when this film works, it really shines. There are scenes in this film that just play like the scenes you'd remember from your favorite comic books as a kid, with punch and visual flair. There is an undeniable charm to this film that makes me want to own it on Blu and watch it every now again, despite what it does to the source material. (And there'd be a great drinking game trying to find all the nods to all the films made.) If you don't mind the deviation from Dumas, it's very much worth checking out.to find all the nods to all the films made.)

030771652X|5.0|This is originally on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />I am absolutely blown away by Rosamund Lupton's debut, Sister. I really don't even know where to start. The emotions of this book had me all over the place. Scared, angry, hopeful, devastated, thrilled. It was quite the ride. The brilliance of this plot is indescribable. I swear this book is pure genius. And the thriller/crime aspect had me on edge the whole time. Especially the last chapter. Oh. My. God. Seriously. I want to shake this author for the turn of events. And then hug her for her brilliance.<br /><br />Beatrice was a character I could absolutely relate to. As an older sister myself, I put myself in her shoes and knew that I would have felt and acted the same way if what happened to Tess happened to any of my sisters. There is just something about the bond of sisterhood that is permanent.<br /><br />As for other characters, Kasia is probably my favorite aside from Beatrice. She is this lovely sweet innocent Polish woman who sees the joy in everything. She becomes such a strong force and great friend for Beatrice.<br /><br />Now. This plot is absolutely spectacular. From the beginning, Beatrice knows that there is no way her sister would have committed suicide. I felt so frustrated for Beatrice too as she tried to tell the police that her sister just wasn't that kind of person. It's infuriating when people think they know my sister better than I do. I want to shake these people and get them to listen. And just when you think you've figured it out, you're wrong.<br /><br />I seriously cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. If you love a good thriller, if you love good emotion, if you love books about the relationships of siblings, you have to read this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that I can constantly be entertained with this app! the only negavtive u have to say about it though is that it is so difficult to get enough points to unlock more games.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is a great interpretation of the characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson with incredible detail paid to bringing their mannerisms to life.  Though there are some discrepancies between the movie and the stories the production team does a good job of keeping the important parts in place with little changes made to the theme or characters.  The way Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) play off of and often against each other really drive the way the story plays out and how the deduction skills of the world's greatest detective come to fruition.

B004YXE438|3.0|Amazon: You should ask reviewers to start with the device they are using. Apps perform in different ways depending on the device. As for Spectrum Puzzles, There are lots of images and several levels to choose from. My snag has been the failure of the software to recognize when a puzzle is finished. Usually going to the simplest level, which is quick to solve, provides the \\"done\\" that allows me to go to the next image.
B004ZNAXX2|1.0|It's well documented that Pink Floyd filmed a complete Wall concert.  Why are we still waiting for this footage to be released?  Is there any Floyd fan out there who would not pay good money for a full Wall concert video on BluRay?  Nobody cares if the footage is dark and not up to today's video standards.  It's Floyd history - man - and it's long overdue!  Shame on the band and record company for \\"sometimes throwing us a bone\\" and only including a brief snippet of live concert footage in this Immersion set.  Let's have the full concert already, before we're too old to care.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This movie is so freaking cool. Way ahead of its time and top notch acting. Kinda long but worth it, I really wish more movies would be made like this one.
B004VYYA2K|3.0|I bought and had this shipped to my niece.  She brought it to my house this weekend after about 4 days of play and it seems okay so far.  It's just a zip up box with printed pictures, so don't expect a \\"Dream House\\".  It does it's job of bring a place to store barbies.<br /><br />I wanted to give this as a Christmas gift, but delayed ordering and the price more than doubled due to product \\"shortages\\" (aka scalpers).  Don't pay more than about twenty dollars for this item.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This, the third and final installment in the \\"dragon tattoo\\" series is so fast-paced and well-written, I could not put it down. I downloaded this on Saturday night and finished it on Sunday night, luckily my husband was home to care for the children. IMHO this is the best of the series!
0140277447|5.0|This book is excellent overall but especially eye opening. I knew my high school history classes were pretty much useless but I had no idea of what went on in China.<br />It's a difficult book to read but it is so helpful in more ways that one. You can see very clearly what the ambitions of the Japanese were during the war, that they were willing to do whatever THEY thought it took to succeed. You just need to be prepared that you are going to be horrified at what you are reading but it is well worth buying.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|The first time I watched this it didn't quite compute.  A friend gave me the DVD, I'd heard nothing about it, and was non-plussed that it was seemingly such a departure from the original P&P.  Odd, since I'm a fan of both Austen's and time travel stories.  But there's a lot to digest, a LOT going on.<br /><br />After watching it several times, my admiration has grown exponentially.  The dialogue is marvelous, the language sublime- that's what's most noteworthy, in my estimation.  I loved the language so much I watched it one time through with English captions on, so I wouldn't miss a syllable.<br /><br />The characters are fully fleshed out [with one exception, below], their actions in keeping with the original, yet they grow, develop, partly as a result of their contact with 21st century Miss Price, partly as a result of the absence of Lizzie.  We come to know them much better.  They're funny, wry, clever- all perfectly in character- phenomenal.<br /><br />ALL the actors are wonderful.  I especially liked the characterizations of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Wickham, & Mr. Bingley- their development, the greater understanding we gain of them.  For me, this definitely rounds out, deepens, the P&P experience.<br /><br />Only a few small quibbles do I have (SPOILER ALERT- DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED).  I'm no prude (for example, thought the \\"landing patch\\" bit funny), but I thought the sniffing fingers business was gross, repulsive- moreover, a distraction, because in every subsequent scene with Mr. Collins you're waiting to see if he does it or not, rather than attending to the dialogue and his wonderful acting.  Annoying.<br /><br />Secondly, although the story is jam-packed, Darcy doesn't have enough to do, as compared to the original.  He mostly just looks stern and dubious, one eyebrow arched.  We don't see much of an evolution over time, as we did with Colin Firth's Darcy- wrestling with his emotions, taking action to correct things, etc.  [Granted, many of Firth's actions occurred off-camera, but we learn of them- in subsequent viewings we know what he's up to, been up to.  This Darcy does a lot less in front of the camera, AND behind the scenes.]  His softening/metamorphosis comes almost entirely at the end, with little precedent (or build-up of dramatic tension, I thought).<br /><br />There could've been dynamite scenes in which Darcy learns the truth about Wickham, or, spearheads the effort to rescue Lydia, or, orchestrates the Collins's anullment.  The script neglects him, or renders him incidental in many scenes (perhaps some scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor).  The focus was on Miss Price, and I think the plot would've been better served, the end even more satisfying had Darcy played a more active role throughout, would have provided greater justification for her falling head over heels in love with him.  Indeed, Mr. Wickham's character was much better developed, it wouldn't have surprised me if she'd fallen for him.<br /><br />I have other small gripes, such as the fact that she's a smoker, has only one cigarette left, takes one puff and then tosses it away (would never happen), and noted several missteps in the plot (they could've expanded on Darcy's experience in modern day London, for example, or could've had Mr. Bingley and Lydia go off in search of Utopia instead of for an apparent tryst), but oh well.  The missing Downtown scene, though brief, was endearing and humanizing, softened her brashness, too bad it was left out.<br /><br />But, these are relatively minor gripes.  The music was great, the lighting and sets gorgeous, the acting uniformly superb.  And kudos to the lead actress- she got it just right- perfectly natural, never a false note, at first like a bull in a china-shop, but gradually becoming more at home in her surroundings, more attuned to others (and 18th century sensibilities), more in love, more luminous.<br /><br />Well-done, a keeper!mera, but we learn of them- in subsequent viewings we know what he's up to, been up to.

B000092Q4U|5.0|AS THE PALACES BURN is one of the best albuns from the great LAMB OF GOD!!!! the first LOG album NEW AMERICAN GOSPEL is good, but the sound there is REALLY REALLY RAW, and Blythe only scream and roar all over the songs.....AS THE PALACES BURN shows a huge evolution on LAMB OF GOD style...some songs are METAL gens like FOR YOUR MALICE, 11th HOUR, RUIN, A DEVIL IN GOD´s COUNTRY and the title track!!!!! This is LOG at their RAWEST, but not incredibly RAW like on NEW AMERICAN GOSPEL!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|This is a highly intelligent and thoughtful movie.<br /><br />I thought Will Smith was fantastic, this is one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />The idea of the story is very relevant to what is happening today, and it is a genuinely terrifying premise.<br /><br />Very very good.
0812550706|5.0|This is one of a handful of books that I read every year and have for over a decade. In fact, I still am reading the same copy I originally had in high-school when I first read it for a science fiction literature course. So, in other words, I really, really, really love this book.<br /><br />In a future time, Earth is recovering from  previous intergalatic battles with beings known as \\"buggers.\\" A third war is on the way and as a means of finding the next great commander, a Battle School has been created. From a young age, children are monitored to find the ones right for this new school which is how Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is selected. He is a rarity: a Third child in a world where most families only have two. His older brother Peter was considered too violent, his sister Valentine too passive. Ender was conceived to be a mix of the two. So, as a young child, Ender is taken from his family to be trained at Battle School, where he quickly emerges as a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The scenes at the school are wonderful, especially during the games. Sometimes, however, I do have a hard time believing the children are as mature and articulate as they are written considering how young they are. Although I suppose it's possible it can just be chalked up to a different culture and education then here in 2012. The characters themselves are each unique and memorable, especially Ender who is certainly one of the best children in literature and his sister Valenine, who is my favorite character in the book. But, really, all of the children featured are clever and funny and I like that Card focuses more on them rather than the adults in their lives.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I was there for the concert and it was great. Joe was super as usual giving his all. The concert sold out in about 20 mins. There was a second night added later. It was almost a duplicate of the one earlier in the year at westbury but for the addition of guest performers. Been looking forward to the dvd. I hope it does it justice. I do have to add that even though I liked both concerts last year, his live at the Albert Hall was my favorite.<br /><br />Update after release<br />The more i see it the more i like it.  Joe gave another great performance. This concert was augmented by some great blues singers. When Joe pairs up with Beth Hart it is really great. Beths performance in sinners prayer brought strong reminesence of the immortal Janis Joplin. With Joes guitar getting into heavy blues and Beths singing there is magic and it is like capturing lightning in a bottle. I look forward to their collaboration on an album together. What a combination! paul rogers too made a good pairing with Joe.  We all know Joe can sing and needs little but he had a good idea putting his playing guitar with other singers. This is what makes this a standout concert to own with albert hall. The only disappointment with this dvd is they left out some of the concert like just got paid and sloe gin two of my favorites. I was seeking a complete replay of the experience and didnt get it but this is still extremely worthy whether you were there or not. The beacon is a must have with albert hall. Enjoy and keep an eye on Beth Hart.<br />New addition:<br />Beth hart and joe bonamassa album is out and the title is \\"dont explain\\". After listening to the collaboration album the first time i thought it was so so but after a few more times it got better as i listened to it. Sinners prayer was better on the dvd but most of this album has style and Beth can really sing the blues with her own imprint not just singing in the style of Janis but with other influences present to form her own way of warbling. Chocolate jesus is very catchy too and your heart is as black as night is a sultry affair. Joes production company put out this album and beth has a future. They team well together. Buy this one too, i dont think you will be disappointed.

My biggest complaint though .. is that it takes no time at all to unlock ALL of the games and WIN most .. so you are stuck with the IMPOSSIBLE ones and nothing NEW to play!
0899668380|4.0|This is definitely more of a haunting vampire tale then one of gore, action or romance. One man, Robert Neville, has survived a plague virus that after killing, resurrects its victims as blood suckers. I AM LEGEND is Neville's skillfully told horrifying and sad account of the end of the human world; as he struggles to hold on to his own sanity.<br /><br />The despair and loneliness of Neville is almost too much to take at times, as he borders on giving up and slipping into madness. And although genre as a horror, I found I AM LEGEND more gut-wrenching and heartbreaking then anything. I truly appreciated Matheson's emotional writing style, as he completely captivated me with Neville's bleak story.<br /><br />*I have yet to see the highly acclaimed Will Smith movie version of I AM LEGEND, although I do hear it's a bit different from the book. I'm now intrigued...
B0000508U6|4.0|The Coldplay debut is a nice pop album with some rock guitars... All the songs are nice...It really reminds me RADIOHEAD with a much more poppier feeling! It´s a good album to give to your girlfriend, or if you have insomnia and can´t sleep...

B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is super versatile.  I immediately ditched the strap that came with it and got the [[ASIN:B005CHGWUS 18mm James Bond Khaki / Red - Nylon Nato Ballistic Military Watch Band Strap G-10]], which completely changes the look.  I get compliments on it all the time.  It came with the newer 7S26C movement, which has been pretty accurate for it's price range.  I lose about 4 seconds a day.  My only complaint is that the crystal is prone to scratching.  I already have two from everyday wear.  Other than that, I woud absolutely recommend this watch for a solid business casual watch.<br /><br />Edit 1/13:  I broke it trying to regulate it myself like an idiot.  I liked it so much that I bought a second.  The new one is WAY more accurate than the first.  I've had it for about 3 months and am losing maybe a second a day.  I've had to adjust the time twice.

The singer Chris Martin  born to be a singer...I think he got that special light only few in the rock pop world have...LOVERS IN JAPAN, LOST!, VIVA LA VIDA and LIFE IN TECHNICOLOR are amazing pop songs...Really reminds me to U2 in their glory days with some Radiohead feeling...Coldplay is a good band!

I am wishing them a happy ending.  I am off to purchase parts two and three now and hope the author gets A and C to make it work.  You know how great a story is when you do not want it to end.  This is one of them!
B003XRDYX2|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for someone who is a SERIOUS Bob Dylan fan and not only did he love it, but it had more detail and extras than he expected.  I believe it even has a code so you can download the entire thing and keep your set of CD's pristine for the future!

COCHISE, SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE, GASOLINE, I AM THE HIGHWAY, SHADOW OF THE SUN and LIKE A STONE are great rockers!!! I think the pinaccle of Cornell is his SOUNDGARDEN years, but he sounds powerful here! The RAGE menbers bring a wonderful heavy mass of sound, but i miss the angry brilliant raps from Zack De La Rocha...

B004VF68AQ|3.0|Really like THE GREAT ESCAPE ARTIST...Only the fact that Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro are together make me smile...This is not Ritual de lo habitual or Nothing Shoking...No, these albuns were from 88, 89...This is a more mature band, after many years of heavy guitars and screams...Some songs are amazing, from their best of like UNDERGROUND, END TO THE LIES, CURIOSITY KILLS, IRRESISTIBLE FORCE and ULTIMATE REASON! I'm happy to see JANE's again...Perry Farrell is a brilliant lyricist! WELL DONE, JANE!!!

B004EPYZP8|5.0|Just watched this movie again with a friend who hadn't seen it.  If you like a modern noir legal thriller set in L.A. that is a bit Chandleresque, you should enjoy this latest enactment of Michael Connelly's book brought to life.<br />Inspired casting and screenwriting, cinematography and direction made this movie pulse.  I hope they produce more of Connelly's books as movies.  Connelly is a masterful storyteller who worked as a reporter in L.A. and his books offer up an authentic slice of L.A. detective life.  I would like to see Mickey Haller again on the big screen.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is highly addictive and SO much fun! The graphics are great,the levels are challenging and Om Nom is freaking adorable. It would probably be my favorite game if I hadn't found &quot;Where's My Water&quot; first. Swampy is #1 on my list, but this one is a CLOSE second. Hours of fun- great way to pass time. Good for adults and children.

0553582038|2.0|Given the sheer number of reviews already posted, I would suspect my comments will be just another \\"2 thumbs down\\" summary.  So, I will keep this review short and to my key points.<br /><br />After enjoying the first 3 books in the series, I was truly looking forward to this fourth book.  Not only was I amazed at the amount of \\"literary fodder\\" (\\"stuff\\" that just takes up \\"space\\" in the book, but does not really significantly \\"add\\" or contribute to the overall story) in this book, I was so irritated and disappointed when I finished that I was not going to purchase (which I did not) the fifth book to read.<br /><br />This book, in my opinion, was not well planned (from the perspective of providing a solid, substantial contribution to the series) and developed.  There are too many pages for little, \\"real\\" story content.  After getting past a few hundred pages, I felt compelled to just then read the first sentence of the subsequent paragraphs and the last 1-3 pages of each chapter to minimize going through much of the low/non-value \\"fodder\\" of this book.<br /><br />I expected so much more than what was delivered.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Ok, so I finished the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy. I will say this, if you have a weak stomach or an emotional disability DO NOT READ IT! BUT, it is a very well written trilogy. I can honestly say it breaks your heart more than the Harry Potters. I can't deny that as twisted as these books are, I will be hooked to reading them over and over like I do with \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Harry Potter.\\" It's hard to say that it is a great book, but only because I feel guilty that something so awful was so well written and intriguing to read. If you can handle such awful circumstances then it is a book worth reading time and time again. But if you are one that can't handle tragedy DON'T read it! If you have a child it will really mess with your emotions.
B002ZG98FU|1.0|I really wanted to see this movie when it was in theaters but never got around to it. Recently watched the first half on netflix and decided not to finish, which i rarely do. The main actress was absolutely horrendous. Her character was completely one dimensional and unrealistic not to mention how much she annoyed me and her bangs made me want to slap a bitch. Wasn't worth it to finish.
B00742BVW8|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the very best 'wushu' or 'kung fu' movies ever made. This is the movie by which all the rest from the genre need to be measured.<br /><br />The color and cinematography is amazing. Each action, each word, each musical piece is intertwined to create a whole that is much larger than any part. The story is top-notch and thoughtful. The music enchanting.<br /><br />When I watch a movie and am left thinking about the real implications I know I've hit on a gem.<br /><br />Be aware, however, this is a propaganda piece from the Chinese government. It's intended to show a particular take on how citizens should respond to the order that government can bring. If you can look past that and just enjoy the movie for the experience you'll not be disappointed.<br /><br />It's well acted by an all star cast with vast experience. Out of all the cast I found the Jet Li character to be the most wooden and least interesting. The rest of the characters come alive in various ways and pull up emotions that can often be in conflict.

But something changed after that and now I am relieved that poor Clark is released from what must have been a bewildering existence.<br />Kudos to Tom Welling for being adorable and genuine all the way!<br /><br />slp

B002ZG97M4|5.0|Grew up on the corny 1984 version and refused to see this version in the movies, I thought \\"how can you remake Footloose?\\" but then I rented it and loved it!! It's fun and just as corny as the original.  Footloose isn't meant to be an Oscar nominated film, so don't watch it expecting that. The soundtrack, I like the changes that they made to that too.
7119032194|5.0|Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found it's a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about 500 years ago.<br /><br />It's said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups, their languages and can't be translated without losing or adding the meaning. But this epic translated by Roberts completely grasps the meaning of Chinese, both literal meaning, culture meaning and history background meaning of words, not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaning------the meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese, no more and no less. If a Chinese author translated this middle-ages novel to modern Chinese as Prof. Roberts to modern English, he can do no more and better than Prof. Roberts.<br /><br />30 years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last 15 chapters whose content is about how \\"traitor\\" overwhelmed \\"loyalists\\" and not \\"political correct\\". But this English version read I from the 1st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese don't know.<br /><br />The shortcoming of this translation is to non-Chinese readers, especially the English name of the people/place in this history fiction. I think western readers will be easily confused because when 30 years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles.<br /><br />But the translation of title is so cool. \\"\\"(['kau'tsu]the earliest ancestor of this dynasty) and \\"\\"([tai'tsu'wu'hug'di]the 1st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits) is translated to \\"Augustus\\"-------the only and very  correct translation I think. In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history, \\"Augustus\\" is simply transliterated to \\"\\"[au'gu'si'du], because hardly a corresponding ancient Chinese title can be found , \\"\\" is the fittest one.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I went in to  \\"John Carter\\" filled with trepidation.  I often avoid these big, splashy CGI spectacles that never live up to their promises and I was sure that this film was going to be nothing more than lots of cinematic eye candy and short on substance. Added to that there was a lot of lackluster critical reviews.  Well, all I can say is that this was a grand entertainment and I am so glad I caught it on the big screen!<br /><br />I've heard some critics say the plot was a mess and overly convoluted. Really?  My suggestion to them is \\"don't text while watching a movie, you might miss something\\".  I found the plot fairly well done and actually made sense (if only the last Star Trek film had that going for it) and was interesting to boot.<br /><br />I also read that the look of Barsoom (Mars to you and me) was dull and uninteresting.  Hmmm, never been an admirerer of the stark and raw beauty of the American southwest I guess.  Personally I found Barsoom to be beautiful, alien, exotic and familiar all at the same time. After all, the Mars rovers have confirmed that the Red Planet does indeed look like our American southwest and I for one happen to think both places very scenic.<br /><br />Some critics have said the story is dull and lifeless.  OK, put down the crack pipe and step away from the video game console.  \\"John Carter\\" has a great fast paced plot with lots of interesting twists and turns. I also thought the characters were nicely drawn, if not overly complex, and that the alien races on Barsoom to be very interesting with fascinating customs which only made me want to learn more about them.<br /><br />Other critics have complained that they have seen this stuff before in movies like Star Wars and Avatar.  Wellllll, it seems as though those two directors (among other film makers and writers) have been looting the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs for quite some time so I guess there is bound to be a feeling of deja vu.<br /><br />Have we really become such a culture that is so easily jaded?  Can we no longer feel that sense of wonder and feeling of adventure in a film like \\"John Carter\\"?  Maybe we are too use to storylines being spoon fed to us in easily digested bites and cannot follow along with a film that isn't zipping past our eyeballs at 186,000 miles per second with flashy explosions at every eye blink.  If true then how sad that such a wondrous film will get pushed to the wayside in favor of something like Transformers 8.re that is so easily jaded?

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This movie tells the origins of Cap, and does it extremely well. Chris Evans is very believeable as Steve Rogers, both before the transformation of the expirment. And after, And Hugo Weaving as Red Skull. Wooooooooooow, people have complained that this movie was empty. And lacked substance and style, for a movie set during WWII. Question for you, would it really be appropiate to have modern day explosions, which there were plenty of. The director handled Cap with class and dignity, surprisingly following the comics. After he becomes a supersoldier, because the doctor is killed by a Nazi spy. The formula is lost, leaving Rogers to be the only Super Soldier. So the army uses him as a propaganda tool, a nod to what both D.C. Comics, and Marvel comics did during WWII. Using their characters to sell war bonds, Rogers gets tired of this. And goes off on his own, to rescue a squadron. Including his friend, my only problem with this movie. Is that they kill Bucky, but the movie actually makes up for it. For those who didn't like this movie, must have liked the 1990 movie, where Captain America is portrayed as a buffoon. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO RESCUE HIM FROM RED SKULL, but I digress. A dignified presentation of a classic comic book character, which is more than I can say for the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. Or the Dark Knight, this is how you handle a Comic book character. Not philisophically, or trying to be afraid to be a comic book movie. It is what it is, I loved this movie. And I highly recommend it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|While this book will probably be less remembered than The Hunger Games and MockingJay, it is still wonderful. The Games while not exactly like the first were still very interesting and fast paced. What I liked about this book is the introduction to other Hunger Games winners like the engaging Finnick and the somewhat abbrasive, take no crap Joanna to many others. I made the mistake of reading reviews on the Hunger Games series before I was done reading the books and the mixed reviews and other opinions really got to me until I was able to experience the books for myself and realize that they are some of the most amazing, addictive, interesting and even life changing books I've ever read. Glad that I read them. I also of course loved the dynamic between Katniss and Peeta &lt;3

B001TWT0AE|5.0|hahahahahahahahahah, I'm laughing at the negative reviews of this movie. People forget, that the song \\"I'm dreaming of a white christmas\\" was considered a terrible song when Irving Berlin first wrote it. Same with this movie, but the difference is, that even then. It was a great western, hind sight is always twenty twenty. It's easy to look back at this movie and say it's cliche'd. With all the westerns that have come after it, Wayne plays a rancher, who loves  a local waitress. While Jimmy Stewart is a Naive lawyer, whe wants to bring Law to the lawless, and to disagree with a fellow reviewer. Stoddard takes quite a while to recover from the beating he takes at the hands of Lee Marvin's Liberty Valance.  Stoddard is found on the side of the road by Wayne's character, and taken to the restraunt. Where everybody is waken, so they can take care of Stoddard, who is unconscious. He is given whiskey to calm him, and while he's drinking. The restraunt owners and Halle, Wayne's girl in the movie. Fix him something to eat,  Wayne's character is the tough old west kind of character. John Ford builds the tension between Stewart's character, Wayne's character. And Marvin's character, that when Valance is killed. You honestly think that Stewart's character is the one, But Wayne's sets the record straight. Amazingly enough, his character even gives the girl up, when it's obvious she's fallen for Stewart's character. This movie is a good ol fashioned western movie, with a strong villain. That when he dies, you root for him to die.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I made the hugest mistake ever!!! I read a review. I read it on the Hunger Games review after I had already read The Hunger Games, but the reviewer decided to review the whole series and write some super HUGE spoilers that pretty much ruined my day. They spilled the beans about most of the end of MockingJay and so I was torn between having to read it and being too scared to read it. I am glad that having to read it after enjoying the first and second books won out. I read it the slowest out of all of the books because it was hard to read. Not hard to read because it was bad, but because I had gotten so close to the characters and I was afraid what would happen next. I also came into reading it with a skewed 1 star review dancing around in my head. What I read was action packed and addicting. Yeah, there is a LOT of violence, and I mean a LOT, but the book holds onto what its going for, showing the effects of war and violence and even greed. I have read a lot of reviews since that talk about how this book didn't have a redeeming theme and I completely disagee! I was intrigued and interested to read about District 13 and I wanted to see how Katniss and Gale acted now toward each other after everything she had been through. I loved that there are, for a lack of better words, no wimps in this book. Everyone is willing to die for what they stand for. I guess when there isn't much to live for, you'd die for a better world. That is what a few people do. Please go no further if you have not read this book already, just know that it is worth every page. Ok, now having given that disclaimer, I'd like to think that some of the people that died like Finnick or Prim would have been happy to die for a better world, that they didn't die in vain. I really hated to see some people die, but I read it all on the edge of my seat not knowing what would happen next, hoping that everything would somehow work out. Things get so much worse before they get better. When Katniss gets to see Peeta after they rescue him, I could feel the joy and excitement with her and my heart broke when he tried to kill her. I've never read a book that made me feel so much. I have to admit that Gale and Katniss never worked for me as a couple. I just never truly connected with Gale. He seemed like just another one of the other soldiers. Peeta had such a goodness about him. I feel like Katniss, as much as she tried to push him away at times couldn't help but fall in love with him. At the end when she shoots Coin I caught myself actually grin for some wierd reason. The biggest problem that I had was that after the friendship and evertything that Gale and Katniss were supposed to have together, he pretty much abandoned her. Where the heck was he when she was sitting there in District 12 suffering? Peeta came back to her though and then made her world, or at least District 12 a better place. I love that at the end she realizes that Peeta was the goodness her life needed. I loved the symbolism of the dandelion. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. I can't say how much I loved this series and the interesting part is that I don't even read these kinds of books. I would not just recommend this series but highly encourage them to anyone.

B004G600A4|1.0|I'm going to get alot of comments on this, but I don't care. And when I write a review, I usually don't put a spiritual spin on things. But this movie leaves me no choice, as an Apostolic Pentecostal. This movie offended me, and my wife. I find it interesting that Disney, and most people today. Say that the hair means nothing, but that's not true. The Bible is very specific about a woman's hair, and I find it interesting that those who defend the short brown hair look. Over look the fact, that after that happens. Rapunzel is the one who asks Flynn to marry her, not the other way around. Which by the way, is a feminist view on things. I'll get comments for that. How dare the man be the one to ask, woman are equal to men. Said sarcastically, and yes. The mother figure, portrayed as being evil, is killed. But it's okay to disobey, because we don't believe in absolutes anymore. such as, an authority figure can't tell me what to do, I'm my own person. I would say, if you want to enjoy good Disney movies. Watch the ones from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. And a few from the 90's, by the way, for those who defend this movie, it's not even close to the original story of Rapunzel. Just a thought.

It became his favorite book about 4 months ago and now he won't get into bed until we've read at least one story, even if we read something else first.  Tons of things to look at and identify on the pages which is fun even if we don't manage to actually get through a whole story.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I thought this book was a quirky romantic comedy like Kinsella's other books. I enjoyed it very much, a page turner for sure.

I puchased the ebook edition so the footnotes were a little annoying and I skipped most of them but still loved the book.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I was very curious how Oldman would handle such a classic role.  My wife and I are big fans of the BBC version, which she says did justice to the nuance and complexity of the book.  The new version is a very good movie experience, unusually dense and intricate for 2 hours.  However, there is so much that is missing and it moves too fast - it is very hard to follow, demanding on the attention of the viewer because crucial points are under the surface, and impossible to achieve the fullness of character and plot of the longer version.  Oldman is a truly great actor and was definitely up to creating a character that was not based on Alec Guiness, who was always old, but again the stamp of the original is simply too deep for me.<br /><br />Recommended.  But watch the old version as well if you like this one.

B007H7XJD4|1.0|It is the era of the Internet. this movie should have been at least as bad/or good (depending on your perspective) as the original Clash Of The Titans. But it reeks of Internetness in the negative sense of it.<br /><br />A lot of VISUAL information is its most noticeable characteristic. And as in the Internet, it's mostly disorganized and confusing. Here's why(the devil is in the details):<br /><br />1.-The famous bow it's mentioned to had been forged by Heracles, or Hercules AFTER the story mentions that it was used BEFORE human existed in a war between Titans and gods. Heracles was human. That is simply an atrocious overlook either meant as a test to viewers attention (and then a very disrespectful action) or an act of idiocy.<br /><br />2.-They simply took a modern cheap recurve bow and painted it black to make it look epic. What is there left to say?<br /><br />3.-In the scene where Hyperion takes the bow you can clearly see Mickey Rourke had no clue how to pull a bow correctly, half an hour with a practice bow and an instructor would have been enough to retake that scene. It seems he actually did later on which leaves that first scene even less unexplained.<br /><br />4.-In ACTUAL greek mythology gods were known for constantly intervening in human affairs, specially wars. That was the WHOLE point of Greek mythology. If you forgive the fact that trying to go against it doesn't make any sense its even more gut wrenching when you see the absurdity of gods dying withstanding an overwhelming number of titans because they didn't intervene when they still had a chance to avoid the titans being released. No one knows why they gods didn't eradicated the titans on the first place but what is more painful is that they weren't smart enough to act when they had the advantage and simply chose NOT to do it because \\"they had faith in human\\". Faith and stupidity are two different things and it doesn't involve dying from a god's perspective. It doesn't make any sense. If you aregoing to do a radical change like that, THINK about it.<br />All in all I would have given this script another 6 months to a year to actually film it.<br /><br />5.-The gods costumes, it looks like a fashion designer wanted to take revenge on the world and decided to come up with the most freakily costumes they could design to cause physical pain on the viewers.<br /><br />6.-The gods cast. I can't understand why did they looked for teenage models to play the gods. The gods were supposed to be badass forged in the legendary war with the titans. The actors didn't look badass. For example, Palas Athena is supposed to encompass wisdom. I don't think she did. That tells me they didn't put enough attention to detail to the gods characters.<br /><br />7.- When the party arrives back to the temple where the oracle was the mute priest runs off and Theseus screams: \\"It's a trap\\". Then he clumsily proceeds to follow him to conveniently fall into it, lose the bow clumsily and get Apollo murdered by his father by trying to rescue him. This is the typical and abundant stupidity challenging cheap resource to twist the story in an absurd way to allow the screenwriter to force an outcome. It's so frequent that it must be in the screenwriters manual on page 1.<br /><br />8.-In the final fight it's obvious that Neptune gets killed by the titans yet you see him fighting in the heavens alongside Theseus in his child's vision. It is not clear to me if the two yellow figures rising from \\"Tartarus\\" are Zeus WITH Athena in his hands and Neptune following. It wouldn't make any sense since he was getting chopped while Zeus brought the mountain down.<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />The idea of the Minotaur as a torturer/executioner/overly big guy with a helmet is somewhat original and probably the only thing that made some sense in the movie. I would have explored that a little bit more.<br />Human costumes. The human costumes were ok in my opinion, from armor to weaponry(except the\\"epic\\"bow) with the exception of the swords that looked more like gladius made in Rome.<br />The message in the \\"politician\\" who wanted to negotiate at the doors of extinction and gets his head chopped. If it wasn't because people can be this stupid I would say this part didn't make any sense either( you would think a politician would find something his counterpart wanted to bargain first) but indeed, the message of what happens when you're so stupid is there.<br /><br />The story looks half baked to me.
1451683405|4.0|It's great to have Sam on board the no-free-will train, but for those of us who have been riding it for a while, the scenery may seem largely familiar. Still, the idea of not having free will is so difficult to grasp, even for those who have been struggling with it for some time, that Sam's arguments, analogies, and the recent research he presents are likely to be helpful. It's a short book for such a big topic, but its brevity and clarity may make it more accessible to some than a work of more depth might be.<br /><br />On the other hand, it would have been fairly easy to give his arguments a broader perspective. For example, he says:<br /><br />\\"People feel that they are the authors of their thoughts and actions, and this is the only reason why there seems to be a problem of free will worth talking about.\\"(pp. 31-32, all references are to the Kindle Edition.)<br /><br />In fact, people of all cultures and all times have not necessarily had this feeling. The Greeks seem to have laid the foundation for the idea, and it primarily evolved as a topic of Western thought. Seeing free will as a cultural, historical phenomenon can undermine the sense of inevitability that accompanies it in Western discourse.<br /><br />Free will is part of a complex of misconceptions about how our brains work, and while Sam scratches the surface of some of these in a scattered way, these misconceptions reinforce each other, making it difficult to root one out unless all of them are exposed.<br /><br />The limitations of conscious thought are part of the complex: we are conscious of only some of the end products of infinitely complex unconscious brain processes, and this is a topic Sam covers very well:<br /><br />\\"Our sense of free will results from a failure to appreciate this: We do not know what we intend to do until the intention itself arises. To understand this is to realize that we are not the authors of our thoughts and actions in the way that people generally suppose.\\"(p. 17)<br /><br />This failure to appreciate the limitations of consciousness leads to further misconceptions, one of which is the sense of a unified self. Sam mentions that \\"People have many competing desires,\\"(p. 22) which would have been a great place to bring up the idea of multiple selves, or what I call \\"situational identity.\\" Understanding how competing desires arise and how the idea of a unified self obscures their origins could further undermine the notion of free will, and help clarify how \\"one of these opposing desires inexplicably triumphs over its rival\\".(p. 22)<br /><br />Language is complicit in many of our misconceptions, not just those involving free will. Its limitations allow us to imagine entities that don't exist, and no where is this more significant than in the idea of a unified self.<br /><br />If Sam had explored the topics I've mentioned more thoroughly, he might have further loosened the grip of the idea of free will, and he would have had a broader base from which to explore the benefits of giving up that idea. As he says, \\"Getting behind our thoughts and feelings can allow us to steer a more intelligent course through our lives (while knowing, of course, that we are ultimately being steered).\\"(pp. 52-53)<br /><br />If you'd like to go further behind your thoughts and feelings and pursue the implications, check out my essay on free will: [...]><br />This failure to appreciate the limitations of consciousness leads to further misconceptions, one of which is the sense of a unified self.

B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene in a tight, black leather costume as usual.  This is the best part of the movie.  She is HOT!!!! The fourth entry of the \\"underworld\\" franchise is not enjoyable at all.  The film has a very underdeveloped (being nice) storyline. You do not connect with any character including Selene, which is hard to accomplish since you know her back story.  Action scenes are OK, but the film drags terribly when there isn't fighting.  I kept waiting for the movie to pick up or end.  It was unfortunately a contest that shouldn't be in your mind during a movie. Some of the story finally has a little more depth at the end but the clearest item was that there will be another one.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Raw and rowdy, you just can't go wrong with Pink. This album has great songs throughout. From the spunky \\"So What?!?\\" to the sympathetic \\"Family Portrait\\" to the painful \\"I Don't Believe You\\", this has it all. And, don't dare down yourself, because Pink makes it clear that you are &lt;ahem> Perfect -- just like this album. Plus, the deluxe edition has a dvd with all her videos. WIN/WIN!

B00005KHJT|5.0|This version still slices and dices, but a little extra is thrown in the mix.<br /><br />Halloween needed a little more time added to be aired on NBC, so scenes were added that would also connect wit Halloween II. The additional scenes definitely add to the movie. The score doesn't leave your mind easily, and you never want to fo to the laundry room in the dark again.<br /><br />Oh, and it is amazing what a clothes hanger can accomplish. I am stoked I got this edition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am completely blown away at the description and plot of this book. Even though it brought tears to my eyes, I still loved it. I recommend it to everybody.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good game. I would recommend this game for the casual game player. Lots of different games to play.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Best Buy is so biased, they wouldnt even post my review! Who are these people who love this album?!!! I AM a VH fan - the DLR years only. I appreciate Sammy but to me his voice never fit VH. So now Diamond Dave is back. But his voice is shot! Can't sing. 30 years of smoking does not do well for a singing voice.  His golden voice has turned to coal! He struggles to sing on this album. DLR used to sing well & yelp & screach. I loved his voice. But now you can hear that he's struggling real bad.  It's sad really.  Eddie VH's guitar playing isn't that great either. I'm being honest. I want to hear a great VH album. I want to feel great emotion. But I just feel great sadness wen I listen to this cd. Who wants to buy this CD from me? Alex VH is still a great drummer. He deserves to be in a great band with great musicians. But he would never play outside of VH. Lastly, Michael Anthony IS part of VH - his backing vocals & bass playing are essential to VH. It's a shame the VH brothers got bitter towards Mike just because he became good friends with Sammy. It's a big loss to have VH without Anthony.  So all in all, I'm really surprised that a lot of you think highly of this album. IMO, this album should have never been made.  It tarnishes the VH legacy. I have to listen to VH1, VH2, 1984, etc & try to cleanse myself & remind me how great VH used to be. You can't tell me Dave sounds good live in their concerts either! I would highly doubt this.
0446547603|4.0|I just finished reading this book and loved it. It kind of reminds me of \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" except that this story was much better. Highly recommend it.

B002AF4Y9G|1.0|I would give this a minus 1,000,000 stars if I could.  The very fact that this is a movie about insane seriel killers is bad enough, but then for them to get away with it is tops.  At least show them in a final battle, getting blown away like Bonnie and Clyde.  But no.  Stone had to go one more and in the last shot, I am assuming a few years in the future unless these two are also child nappers,  shows these two sickos driving a van with their kids in the back.  Not only do these two get away with all of their sick crimes,  but they breed and are now going to teach their kids this sick behaviour.  I dont mind horror films.  Or explotation films,  I love the Exterminator from the  early 80's, but at least that has  a hero in the film.  These two are just insane.  Heck, even John Waters had the good mind to kill off Dawn Davenport at the end of Female Trouble.
B007JF87VS|4.0|Season 2 of the Walking Dead has had its ups and downs, and I have been getting less enthusiastic about the show lately due to how it is dragging out conflicts in the group that could be handled with a little more imagination on the part of the writers. With that said, I feel that we have all been waiting for this episode to happen. I don't want to put spoiler's in here so I'll just say I can't wait to see how it plays out. I want to see how the rest of the group reacts to what everyone who has seen the show now knows. (On a side note, I took away a star for a campy b-movie horror flick effect they used close to the end. Like I said, some more imagination and a little less overt foreshadowing would do wonders for this show.)
B005LJK3AC|3.0|It was entertaining, but not super funny. I'm not a big fan of the 3 main actors, but many people are.
1250004217|4.0|I really enjoyed this book about the Holocaust. The read was not so harsh and bloody as so many books on this subject. It got to the point but more in an emotional way. We all get this stinging feeling in our heart when we hear what went on back in the 1940's, but this woman was so touched 60 years after the fact, that she could not give up until she found Sarah. It changed her whole life.
B003Q6CUAI|4.0|If you read this book to the end and follow the guidelines, you will definitely lose weight . I don't normally read this type of book but gave it a go after a friend recommended it and have found it easy to follow without getting hungry.  So far I have lost 4kg in 3 weeks !
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great product and had great service getting it. With it in stock it only took a couple of day to receive and had in time for a christmas present
0143038419|2.0|Eat, Pray, Love was a book I was interested in reading, mainly because I knew it had been made into a movie with Julia Roberts. I had not seen the movie before reading the book (actually, still have not seen the movie) so I started the book with no real expectations for the story. I thought it was interesting that author Elizabeth Gilbert is also the main character, so I quickly figured out this is a memoir of sorts of her life. Gilbert realizes that she is unhappy and unfilled in her life, so after a divorce she plans a year long trip of discovery to visit Rome, Mumbai, and Bali.<br /><br />I'll be honest in my review - I really didn't enjoy the book. I realized from the first few chapters in that I couldn't remember the pages I had already read. Nothing stuck with me. As I'm trying to write this review and give a synopsis of the story, I really can't because I started speed-reading to get through it. I wish I knew what it was about the book that made me so uninterested. Maybe I'm just not into memoirs or self-discovery? I am surprised though because I'm a fanatic about traveling, so I really thought the scenes and descriptions of her travels would excite me, but I was wrong there. Overall, not something I would recommend unless you know you happen to love memoirs about self-discovery. Just wasn't my cup of tea.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|There have been a number of former prosecutors who have turned there talents to writing legal thrillers, often with varying degrees of success. With Defending Jacob former assistant DA William Landay shows that he understands not only the workings of the legal system, but its heart and soul as well.<br /><br />When Andy Barber's 14-year-old son Jacob is charged with murdering a classmate in an upper class suburban community in Massachusetts, Landay shows that he understands the gray areas that crowd in against the strict black and white of the law. Not only is the defendent accused, but his family stands accused, too. That's the case here where the Barbers' are snubbed by their neighbors and former friends and fault lines begin to appear between Andy, his wife and his son.<br /><br />More than just a legal thriller, Landay is as much a meditation on nature vs. nurture, the possibility of a \\"murder gene,\\" bounds between parents and children (and how far we might go to protect a child).<br /><br />Many others have summarized the plot of Defending Jacob and I see no reason to add my own synopsis. Suffice it to say that I've read my share of legal thrillers and have seldom found one that gets not only the \\"facts\\" about the law but the emotions behind it so on-spot perfect. Watching the Barber family go from typical suburban family to a family rubbed raw by fear and doubt is harrowing.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|It wasn't too bad a remake. I really liked some of the new actors and still preferred some of the old ones like Bacon. I liked that they didn't add too many new dance styles with people just constantly break dancing all over like most new dance movies these days. I do wish they would have kept it back in that time era though, i find it hard to believe a town would pass a no dance law in 2011. However, all in all it was a pretty decent remake.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|A great app that does what it says. For those with reading comprehension problems, the camera permissions are clearly explained in the description. You can take a photo to be included in the reminder. There are no communication permissions so it can't send any of your info to anyone.
6305311463|2.0|Just got this in today. It was shipped promptly, but the packaging and discs look somewhat suspect. The item was listed as 'new' but contained no booklet or insert which it should have. After playing the disc I would wager that it is a bootleg -- which was warehoused and shipped directly from Amazon. I can't say the seller knew this, but it is still disappointing. I own nearly the entire criterion collection and have come across several bootlegs in the past, so it's not a huge shock. I'd still probably give it 3 stars, but the film itself is terrible.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|4.5 stars, actually.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is not the kind of I book I'm usually found reading, as I tend not to care for anything dystopian/fantasy-ish as a rule. That being said, I really really really enjoyed it. The classic awesome storytelling, the strong and likable characters, the believable development of relationships, even the way Collins writes, giving you just enough to let you know exactly what is happening but leaving room for her readers to fill in the spaces themselves; it all makes for a compulsively readable adventure that had me turning pages faster than I have in a long time. It's the sort of story that has something for everyone who might pick it up. To be honest, it has me reconsidering my close minded tendency to limit my genre reads.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so these games look like they would be so fun but u download the game and its not all it comes up to be I mean yeah its fun to play these but they.get.boring fast
B004UID2LC|5.0|I bought this as my first app and loved it ever since. I love downloading. music and Tv shows. At first I didn't know wear the music and shows went then I figured it out the music goes to music and the videos go to gallery I highly think money savers should buy it
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I really enjoyed Foer's account of his attempt to compete in the United States Memory Competition. A fascinating introduction to how human memory works. Very humorous at times, while also very educational. Sometimes I felt it went a little too deeply into the history of memory, but I would definitely recommend the book to others.
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|My system: Merlin TSM-MXr speakers on loaded Skylan stands, Manley Stingray II tube amp, Rega DAC fed by Mac Mini running pure music, stand-alone CDP is an oppo, all cables are cardas and subwoofer is MJ acoustics 150 MKII. This is a reasonably high end system, highly resolving with excellent tonal balance and continous response. The system is in a dedicated listening room and it is powered by it's own power leg in my home.<br /><br />I ordered the 2009 Abbey Road remastered CD, which is one of my favorite albums of all time.<br /><br />Yikes! It sounds LOUDER, almost as if the midbands have been pushed too far. Gone is the articulation of bass I recall and the layering is hard to hear when things sound so harsh! And I mean VERY harsh. My system is Manley Stingray running Merlin TSM-MXr's, which is a very sweet sounding rig.<br />I was so worried I re-biased the amp, but it was within range and Abbey Road did not sound very good. So I went upstairs and tried Abbey Road on my little Martin Logan motion 4's with the Dynamo sub and Denon amp. It sounded thinner, but still pretty bad. I recall Abbey Road sounding better on my Creek amp and Wharfdale Diamonds or Heybrook HB-1's of years ago!<br /><br />I threw on Stompin at the Savoy with Ella and Armstrong and all was well, smooth, balanced and just terrific sounding. In fact everything else sounds great including my Beatles Love CD, but Abbey Road is terrible. I called up a buddy and he confirms that his boxed set was sold off because it was terrible sounding (He's running Revel M20's with Parasound power).<br /><br />So what's with so many great reviews of these CD's and the digital remaster? I did find VERY detailed reviews agreeing with what I heard (not many), but I am clearly in the minority. But after trying the CD on two systems (sounds awful in the car as well) I think a lot of people don't know what proper mastering sounds like or the lack the gear to explore the details.<br /><br />Capt RB

B0054JZC6E|4.0|just download the game and I dont think it is half bad. its a free app. you get what you pay for
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a decent game nothing to challenging. Its one of those games you play when your bored and have nothing else to do! Overall not bad but not excellent.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|I don't mean to be too cute with my title, but having been familiar with Hollywood's take on this classic, I wanted to read the original.  It's a revelation, it goes much deeper into characters, and is written with such elegance.  I think shocking is not too strong a word to describe this novella.  It really deserves its fame.  If your a parent, have your child read this, instead of any number of \\"popular\\" modern works that can't hold a candle to this.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I like action packed along with a little comedy movies and Lethal Weapon collection is one of my favorites. I like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game for my kindle. it keeps me entertained. for hour's! I recommend. this game for everyone of all ages. its fun and never gets boring.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|First off I am about half way through the third book of the series so my comparative comments are based around the show versus the first book.<br />The good stuff;<br />I love the casting across the board from King Robert in King's Landing all the way up to the \\"Old Bear\\" Mormont in charge of the Night's Watch.  Great acting and very convincing dialogue all around for this series.<br />The music and costumes are fantastic and really help the series come to life and the opening title sequence sometimes changes a little bit depending on the emphasis of the episode in question which is really cool.<br />The story obviously is very impressive with minimal emphasis on the fantasy and more on the reality human nature (there are some fantasy elements but they are used sparingly to help tell the story.  No LOTR type wizard battles here).<br /><br />The bad stuff;<br />Pretty much all my negative comments are how HBO (in my opinion) cheapened the integrity of the show by adding in almost endless raunchy sex scenes just for the sake of shock value.  I realize there are nude, raunchy scenes in the book but they are written for more story telling purposes rather than just \\"because it's HBO\\".  An example of this is the totally unnecessary homosexual sex scene between two male characters in the show (I won't name them in case you have not got that far yet in the show) which was not in the book and is only in the show just to have an explicit male sex scene.  I'm sure the screenwriters (who did a very excellent job with merging all the timelines and stories in the book for only 10 episodes) were cringing when HBO said to them \\"we want as much sex as you can fit in the show\\". They even added a red headed whore character that is not in the book and does nothing for the show except that she is naked in pretty much every scene (not that she's bad to look at but it gets kind of stupid after awhile).<br /><br />That's about it, good show but could have been better of HBO didn't whore themselves out on this very excellent saga.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|I loved how it shows you the exercises and is super easy to use. The workouts are great as well. a problem is that if your playing music on your phone while using the app and have the sound on it turns the volume down by half. U can stop this by turning the sound off,  but then u don't know when your exercise is done. I wish it would have an option to beep and let the user know the exercise is over without turning down the music .
B0009P5YXO|4.0|this screwdriver is great, especially with the two interchangable invisible and black ink pens. The only thing i don't like about it is that the noise is kindof quiet compared to the 11th screwdriver, and the invisible ink ran out within the week, but then again, i was writing on pretty much everything, because i was excited with it when it arrived
B004SYP5WC|5.0|nice app and at least it isnt a 3yr old's theme game! like it a lot. you should download and try it at least once guys
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very easy to use! I love the fact that I can go from book to book easily, and can change versions in midstream. It has enhanced my Bible studies a lot! Highly recommended. :)
B001R6AW18|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this classic. The image quality is very good and the special supplements are excellent. Highly recommended.
1612130283|4.0|I loved the story and the characters.  It kept me so involved that I read the trilogy in one week, and am now re-reading the books.  But what ever happened to proof reading the finished product.  There were so many grammatical errors and extra words added in sentences that didn't make any sense.  I have seen an increase in this problem in all the e-books that I have  read lately.  Really editors what is happening.  The story gets 5 stars from me but the bad proof reading down graded it to 4 stars.  That being said don't let it discourage you from reading these books.  I loved them.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Choose number of suits, replay deal option, and unlimited undo. Works well on the Fire because the cards scale up to fit the screen.<br /><br />I would like even more Spider variations such as the four suit variant with the cards dealt face up.<br />The only drawback to the ads is that they make you miss lovely dealing animation. It only takes a second to hit the back button. Kindle Fire and HTC Sense
B0000047CX|5.0|I first heard this incredible set way back when it was new.<br /><br />Its rhythmic nuances washed over me and I became immersed in the incredible beauty of the bossa nova message.<br /><br />It was a new music then, finding it was like discovering a new planet.<br /><br />That simple recording session recorded almost 50 years ago endures even now.<br /><br />Jobim, the two Gilbertos and Getz come together for the first time in a series of tracks destined to become standards of the genre.<br /><br />It's hard to believe but the much-lauded quartet were virtual unknowns back then.<br /><br />Standout track is the song by which all later Latin musical works would be judged \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\".<br /><br />But listen well, there is hidden beauty in all of these original masterpieces.<br /><br />Five stars for the magic captured on those sessions, that autumn back in 1963.
B006O5YHUY|3.0|Just your run-of-the-mill Hollywood sports movie, it's disappointingly static and mostly predictable with an armload of blatant plot holes. It does deserve credit for bucking convention in a few ways, particularly in building to the inevitable finale with two potentially viable results. Typically the happy ending writes itself halfway through the picture and then just goes through the motions to get us there: in Warrior, we follow both perspectives for the whole of the film and either outcome would make for an appropriate, warm ride into the sunset. The fight scenes are fun, if highly exaggerated, takes on an in-vogue sport; it's about as realistic a portrayal of mixed martial arts as Rocky and The Replacements were to boxing and pro football. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for grizzling up and embracing his inner Burgess Meredith, but I didn't see anything above and beyond from leading men Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Great app hands down but it's turning on and draining my battery. Will check settings to correct but if not able will delete. Nexus S Sprint.
B00004YZFR|4.0|A documentary crew tails the Rolling Stones for a leg of their 1969 North American tour and unwittingly captures one of the nastiest, bloodiest all-day concerts in music history - the infamous Altamont Speedway show. Mostly pieced together from ambient handheld shots taken on the day of the festival and shown sans narration, it's a stunning stream-of-consciousness presentation of the crowds, cultures and events leading up to the angry, violent personality of the gig itself. It's stunning just how little foresight and planning went into this event, as two days beforehand organizers were still trying to settle on a venue with little or no mind paid to such vital elements as parking, waste management or security. Maybe that kind of mindset would have worked for a small or mid-sized show, but with a crowd in excess of 300,000 showing up to take in what was being portrayed as \\"Woodstock of the West,\\" the only possible outcome of such an awful strategy is total, unmitigated chaos. And that's what they got, as a pushy, balls-tripping audience ran headlong into a moody, fight-spoiling security outfit and lit a set of tragic fireworks. A painfully slow degradation of civility and humanity set to music, it's a dark counterpoint to the radiant, optimistic attitudes seen at Woodstock.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game I play it a lot I play it when I wake up in the moring I love it, ,o

B004LROUNG|3.0|The Litigators, I felt, was not one of Grishams strongest offerings.  The furter I read, the more I kept wondering where the \\"impact\\" moment would be.  This book just didn't offer it.  Sure, it was well written, well edited and a good story all the way around, but it was rather tame, and didn't meet the Grisham standard of creative, impactful, or \\"must read\\" status that I have come to love from all of his other offerings.  It was just average.

0316056863|2.0|I love Tina Fey, and I am a 30 Rock addict. I wanted so much more from this book. I had read a few excerpts online and was under the impression this book would teach me something about becoming a powerful woman in a male-dominated industry. As a writer myself, I wanted to know what it was like to be a writer for a major television show. I also thought it would be genuinely funny. Alas, these topics were skimmed at best--and Fey's humor doesn't seem to translate to nonfiction.<br /><br />Over half the book contains anecdotes from Fey's childhood and teenage years. They're amusing, but flat--lacking insight and depth. They were just random stories about how awkward Fey is/was (many of which were already familiar from watching 30 Rock). Another large chunk of the book was what I can only guess is a weak attempt at satirizing the femoir: chapters on beauty tips, breastfeeding, photoshoots, etc. (And am I the only one getting sick of Fey dwelling on how unattractive she thinks she is?) The best part of the book was that spent talking about the Sarah Palin bits on SNL. But it was a swollen section in a quite unbalanced book. The book lacked theme, structure, or concept. It read like a collection of columns that were edited together chronologically, with no thought to a bigger picture.<br /><br />But the worst thing I can say about Bossypants is that there weren't any parts I wanted to read aloud to someone. It just wasn't that funny.
B007JF87VS|2.0|Well, I have to say that these last 2 episodes of TWD have been full of major surprises --and sad farewells. The episode itself finally brings the simmering hostility between Rick and Shane to a close. While people have said Shane had to die to stay true to the comics, I feel they could have deviated from this and created situations whereby he has left the group, but not been killed-off. Both actors who played Dale and Shane were excellent and gave the show a great balance/excitement with their characters. Out of the remaining group, only Rick and Daryl seem to have leadership potential--and add excitement to the show. But Daryl is not the leader type and more of a loner. T-Dog has been inactive the whole season, and Glenn is quite frankly too meek of a character and this is not helped by the actor who plays him. All of Herschels group are kinda useless, and Lori is an idiot. Andrea also adds little, but she is better than Lori. Unless the core group adds some super-interesting members(and great actors), I feel that TWD may run -out of steam in the not-so-distant future. I don't think you can kill off main players portrayed by excellent actors and expect you can just plug in another person to fit the bill. TWD could have killed-off some of the lesser characters and been fine with a replacement... instead they did the opposite. I still like the show, but can't say I like the way it's going. Season 1 was better than 2, and 3 may be the worst. Time will tell.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|When John Locke agreed to meet me at his local Starbucks, for a half hour, to tell me how he sold all those books, I was happy. I knew it would be how he did it, not how I would do it, but because I had paid $50 to go to a Stephen King lecture on publishing just to be in his presence, hoping some of his success would rub off on me, and paid $150 to see Anthony Robbins in person for the same reason, I figured it would be great to get Mr. Locke's advice for free.<br /><br />On the day of the meeting, it hit me; it would cost me $8 in gas round trip, plus $5 parking, plus I'd buy two medium coffees and two donuts for about $14, all totaling $27. Then I thought, \\"How much of his story can he tell me in a half hour?\\" His book must have 3 hours of information. Plus his book is $24 cheaper than meeting him.<br /><br />So I downloaded his book for $3, and stood him up. But I didn't feel bad because after reading his heartfelt story, I knew he'd be asking every man in Starbucks if they were the guy he was suppose to meet and probably be buying coffee for all, and getting a few more fans.<br /><br />Locke's book tells how he positioned himself for lightning to strike. He even explained how lightning struck for him. I enjoyed his entire story, sitting on my sofa, 'being in his presence', which is what I paid to do for Robbins and King. It also gave me hope. Maybe that's the main reason to buy it. Following his advice, I did tweak a few things in my strategy. Just reading about what not to do, was worth it. If I had read his book sooner, I would have saved a lot of money.<br /><br />Part of his reason for success is that Locke answers every single one of his fan mails. After standing him up, he probably won't answer mine.

0786915749|2.0|I'll make this brief.  I loved this book when I was a kid, but I tried to reread it now and it bored me to tears!  The plot is meandering and spends so little time focused on events, that the characters are stuck traveling around too much.  Little action, stock characters.<br /><br />Try Joel Rosenberg's The Sleeping Dragon, or any of George R.R. Martin's Fire and Ice series.  Even R.A. Salvatore.  But not this book!
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I like Game of Thrones, that's why I bought it on blue ray, This is a review of the features not the show.<br /><br />Usually when I buy a full season on DVD or Blue ray I feel a little bit cheated. Sure it comes with the show and that is why I bought it, but the features are always lacking IMO. This is not the case with this set. The first disc has a very in depth Character profile section, these are clips of the actors and show creators explaining who the feel they character is. This feature is well presented, and contains most of the characters from the show, not all unfortunately. Another feature was the In episode guide, Which is a pull out side menu that accompanies you as you watch each episode, this feature while functional and cool, does not add anything to the episdoes and all of the content is from the already given bonus features, so you learn nothing new. There are many other featurettes included on the last disk.<br /><br />The best feature by far for me was The Complete Guide to Westros, this feature is awesome. It provides a great way for a new fan or even an old book fan like me a great way to go in depth into the history of westros and Essos. It is split into 3 sections History, Houses, and Lands. The Lands and Houses section is just text, but the History has many different topics ranging from the Children of the forest to ancient Valaryia's history, these topics are narrated by the actors from the show and lay out the history of this world very well, some topics come with multiple view points portraying how opposing Houses view a topic. Each video is composed of hand drawn images and many of them are very well done. While I didn't learn anything new, having the info put out there in that fashion really brought the history forward and made it tangible.<br /><br />The next best feature was Anatomy of an Episode, this feature was unfortunately only available for episode six, but I loved it. The feature plays the episode but has pop out windows with the show creators discussing each scene in detail. I thought it was very well done and the presentation of it was smooth.<br /><br />All together the Blue Ray edition is a must have for any fan of the show or books.

B003L77GH4|5.0|Having read the books, I was at first a little miffed that this series wasn't following that story line.  But the story lines that are in the TV series are well thought out and stay just far enough away from being a total Twilight knockoff to keep me coming back for more.  The actors are great and the twists keep you guessing.  Overall, it's a great teen show.
B001DUKHXQ|4.0|I didn't realize I was getting the 25th anniversary edition with the original cover artwork actually on the vinyl with the cover artwork from the \\"Thriller\\" single on side 2 (colored/picture vinyl is so cool) the record sounds like whoever had it before me never played it. My only complaint? It didn't come with the cardboard sleeve, which is iconic, and the clear plastic protective sleeve was not in great shape. Overall; pleasantly surprised, but with a couple drawbacks. Delivery was prompt
B0050AV5MW|4.0|I must say I am a long standing fan of fantasy fiction. This is my first experiance with G Martin & I was unexpectedly surprised.<br /><br />Not only does his style of writing capture you with not wanting to put it down.<br /><br />its not the good guy wins all the time. good and bad things happen through out the book so far, where normally a injustice is discovered and everything works out, this is not always the case. Events in the book have left me speechless on many an occasion while angry on others. You never know when your reading which way it will turn out. I look forward to my train ride to and from work each day. George tugs on your emotions between right and wrong, he challanges your thoughts.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|This movie was sad at best.  What made it really bad was the waste of a good story.  Greek mythology is teaming with epic movies and this story is one just not this movie.  From my knowledge Hyperion was a Titans, so I guess this guy took the name as a metaphor between the battle in heaven where the Titans (Original God) fell to the new gods, Zeus and his boys.  I'm not sure but that's what I got out of it.<br /><br />The movie was slow and the story was confusing and non linear.  You just wait for the good to happen and it never does.  The Brazen Bull is a good touch.<br /><br />The Props were bad they used rebar for everything.  I didn't realize rebar had been around for so long and was capable of holding gods, in all of Hollywood they couldn't find something better than rebar. The Bow was purchased from the nearest sports store and had some crap glued to the handle and painted black.  I didn't realize the gods were into carbon fiber limbs and sight mounts, just sad.  Then the armor.  It was metal of some kind but when Theseus takes it off in the Titan cave in crumples like it fabric of some kind.  Those type of errors are just awful in big budget movies today.<br /><br />This is nothing like 300, a great movie.  It's a sad example of a studio trying to cash in.
B003F1HWUC|4.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater when I was about 10 - tagging along with my older sisters and brother.  Even though I didn't quite get the spoof at the time, it's always been a favorite of our's.  It's such a great, funny movie, with terrific actors.
B004VMK4ZO|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own. In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.an's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

1419701533|5.0|My kids love the hardback set and seem to take better care of the books.  They read and reread them all the time.
1410446077|4.0|I love fairy tale adaptations, whether they're just fleshing out the original story (Robin McKinley's \\"Beauty\\") or spinning the bare concept off in a totally different direction (the anime \\"Pretear\\").<br /><br />And Marissa Meyer's \\"Cinder\\" is actually quite clever in its dystopian/futuristic-steampunk reimagining of the famed Cinderella story. While it cleaves to the basic storyline of the fairy tale, Meyer weaves in a conspiracy, a brewing war, a plague and a secret identity into the story. In short, she allows the story to stand on its own two feet... or rather, one foot of its own and one robot foot.<br /><br />In the futuristic city of New Beijing, Cinder is a cyborg -- a second class citizen who toils away as a mechanic for her cruel stepmother Adri. Her only friends are her kind stepsister Peony and her quirky robot Iko.<br /><br />Then one day, crown prince Kai secretly hires her to repair an old robot for him, even as New Beijing prepares for the arrival of the cruel, powerful Lunar queen Levana (who wants to conquer Earth, possibly by marrying Kai). But Cinder's whole life is thrown upside down when Peony contracts letumosis -- a deadly plague with no cure -- and an enraged Adri sells Cinder for medical testing.<br /><br />The twist: Cinder is immune to the plague. The eccentric Dr. Erland takes an interest in her, even as Peony's condition worsens and Kai desperately searches for a way to avoid marrying Levana. But as Cinder struggles to stop the plague and save the man she's falling in love with, she begins to learn more about her own mysterious past -- and why she might be the only hope for Earth.<br /><br />\\"Cinder\\" is a brilliant example of how an author can take a well-worn fairy tale and breathe new life into it. It's a pretty decent retelling in its own right -- complete with sci-fi versions of the fairy godmother, glass slipper and evil stepmother. But it also stands on its own as a solid science-fiction story with unique subplots, characters and backstory. THAT is a truly good retelling.<br /><br />Meyer has a strong, smooth writing style, splattered with grease, disease and squalor as well as white silk, silver and gleaming laboratories. She neatly twines together several subplots (Levana's schemes, Kai's search for the lost Lunar princess, the damaged robot, Peony's deathly illness), although I was left wondering what was going on with the crying Lunar girl. Perhaps that will be answered in the next book.<br /><br />What was the book's biggest problem? Probably the huge TO BE CONTINUED ending, and the fact that it's pretty easy to figure out Cinder's true identity. It could have used a teeny bit more mystery.<br /><br />But the strongest part of the story is our Cinderella herself. Cinder is a strong, selfless heroine who has a genuinely horrible life -- everyone looks down on her because of her cyborg parts, and she struggles with telling Prince Kai about her true nature for fear that he will be repulsed by her. At the same time, she's also struggling with the discoveries about her own past.<br /><br />Kai is also an excellent character, and quite different from your usual fairy tale prince -- he's trapped in a no-win scenario that may enslave the Earth no matter what he does. And the cast is nicely rounded out by the malevolent, vain Levana, the adorably quirky Iko, and the mysterious Dr. Erland (who is far more than he appears).<br /><br />Marissa Meyer does not disappoint in \\"Cinder,\\" the first of a series that seems to be made up of dystopian/sci-fi fairy tale adaptations.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|I will admit that I saw the movie first before reading the book. So working backwards, I have to say that the movie is so well done it definitely inspired me to read the book. As a whole I found the movie entertaining and I welcomed the journey. When I read the book later i felt that while it did leave somethings out (there is always that natural sacrifice with any adaption) the heart of the story and the characters were still there. I feel the cast really nailed their individuals and taken by itself this movie is one of my favorites. If you loved the movie, I think you'll love the book.
076790382X|3.0|I first read this book about ten years ago, when I was twenty. I thought it was hilarious then. I recently re-read it and thought it was pretty good, though I didn't find it as funny as I had in 2002.    Just one note: Bill Bryson mentions a Lear Jet crash about a fifth of the way into the book. He says that no-one had been able to locate the airplane. There is then an update from two years later, saying they had *still* not been able to locate the aircraft.    If anyone is interestied, the jet was found, almost three years after it went down. The details are located here:    [...]

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The story is great, and the quality of the actual footage is amazing.  I am not going to repeat what the hundreds of reviews already say on this.<br /><br />However, the Blu-Ray disc menus are a bit tedious.  First of all, it takes a few minutes just to get to the main menu from disc insert.  Every feature of the set is available in any of the disc menus (they are all identical.)  It will prompt you to insert the correct disc.  Now, I have not tested this but I assume, like every Blu-Ray I own, once you pop-out a disc, you need to get to the menu all over again on the new one.  The least they could have done was grayed-out features not available on the current disc, or displayed disc number, so I was not scrolling and clicking through item after item until I hit the feature on the current disc.<br /><br />Hopefully Season 2 will have these issues resolved.  Love the show and the story - will gladly support the author, actors, and studio by purchasing these sets, but I cannot praise complicated and difficult menu systems.<br /><br />EDIT: Changed to 5 stars.  Turns out if you change the disc while the prompt to do so is on, it plays seamlessly without too much fuss.  I can deal with that, much better than having to wait 5 minutes to get the menu to load.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|DRIVE is a welcome addition to the genre and revitalizes it with a fresh approach to a genre that at its best is exemplified by the Steve McQueen movies,  BULLITT and GETAWAY. In fact, Ryan Gosling's character is a kind of demented Steve McQueen and does violent cool pretty well. This is an engrossing film with many elements to keep you thinking about. The actors are all so good and they have created through nuance and silence many themes that interlock with the plot. This is so good that it is destined to become a classic.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It is a good and easy read for teenagers.  But something's missing to be a great read.  I knew that the story was going to be kind of cliche, but I bought it expecting to find a surprise such as a compeletely new point of view about life and death, fresh ideas, or something deeper.  Unfortunately it remained cliche until the end. The novel is well-written, but I found nothing extraoridinary in it.  I'd read so many positive reviews and praises on the book, but I think it is a little overrated.  Barely satisfied, kind of disappointed.

We actually saw it at Toys R Us first, but when we went back to get it - it was gone. So I did what any grandmother would do...I came home and immediately looked at amazon.com and found it! The only thing we don't like about Gizmo is that he has no volume control, and he's kinda loud. That is the only thing that I don't like about this product. Now if I could find a Stripe that actually does something besides just be a stuffed animal, I would buy it to go with Gizmo...lol.
B006O5Y0SS|2.0|Based on the reviews I expected to see a solid film. Three members of my family watched it and we all agreed: It was disconnected and without any purpose. It is a trip to nowhere.
1594203334|4.0|This book is well written and entertaining.  It is not a \\"how to\\" book and isn't meant to teach you how to raise your child.  It is more of a collection of observations (with some research to back it)and anecdotal stories from an American woman raising children in France.  I thought it was a good read for vacation!
B005GVA2L0|3.0|I bought this package deal because I was under the impression that the DVD was a live concert. It is not. Mostly just behind the scenes footage. As a fan of Evanescence,I don't mind having the CD. Just don't buy it expecting a Concert DVD or you will be disappointed.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I can play it and not get bored because it's challenging and entertaining. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who enjoys interactive puzzles.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it so so so so much I can never put it down.If you're reading this mom yes I'm still reading books.but I just love this game infact I'm going to play it once I'm done with this review I'm going to play it.
B000QZTK28|3.0|I LOVE tracks 33, 20 and 9 -THEY RULE!!! Track 9 is very addictive to me.<br /><br />Otherwise I'm not really into the other songs on this album -usually the way it goes with me for alot of bands I like anyway.<br /><br />Here's some other tracks I love from other Minutemen albums:<br />- POST-MERSH, vol. 2 (1987): tracks 9, 11 and 13 -these songs rule!!<br />- POST-MERSH, vol. 3 (1989): tracks 10, 44, 45 and 46 -these songs rule!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I have just gotten started on reading the book so I cannot say 5 stars yet, but I definetly will not give it a rating below 4 stars.  He has always been one of those personalities that keep me wondering if he was a real genius or just a run-of-the-mill geek that was in the right place at the right time.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun and challenging.  Worth the cost. I definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a casual game to relax and play. Very enjoyable.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Leaving Eden so far is their high water mark. Fantastic diversity of styles and tunes. Very entertaining. Buddy Miller was a great choice to produce and record them live which is their element. It's been interesting to watch this band grow, expand and develop from students at a music camp in West Virginia to Grammy award winners.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and I hated it because the games are boring and pointless. Spend your time playing better games.
1400069289|4.0|\\"The Power of Habit\\" is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they're developed, how they're formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell's books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--\\"The Habits of Individuals,\\" \\"The Habits of Successful Organizations,\\" and \\"The Habits of Societies\\"--and provides clear examples to back up what he's written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits.<br /><br />This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn't provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you've built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I just downloaded this app a little bit ago.  Ive already entered my monthly bills very easy.  also created a new category.  now I wont have to find my bill book each month, just open my app and I will know in an instant who to pay each week.  Love it. glad it was free but I would have bought it if I had known it exsisted.  gonna tell my friends.  THANKS
B004UID2LC|4.0|Works great DroidX and replacement Incredible 2. Lookout A/V says its ok. Use menu key (duh) and/or long-press video for function--read the instructions for app or your phone!
1612130283|5.0|I had heard about this book EVERYWHERE and curiosity got the best of me.  I read it in a day and a half on my Kindle.  I love to read but sometimes do not have the time, but I made time for this book.  It is intriguing and flows well.  An easy read, this book will help you escape.  It is very graphic, so be aware, but I really enjoyed the tease of the book.<br /><br />But, I will say, do NOT waste your time or money on book two... it does not live up to the first book in any way shape or form.  I didn't even finish it and I won't.  Enjoy the first and be ok.  Book one ends in a cliffhanger, but since there is a series, you can guess what happens.
082221718X|4.0|If you look at the cover you see the words Dramatists Play Service. In large type you will also see the words Acting Edition.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I loved the first book of the series and the second is very disappointing.  I wanted them to develop Christian's character more, instead, all the do is end up having s*x all the time.  The lines repeat and lose value (\\"Laters, babe\\"; \\"I want you now\\", \\"stop biting your lower lip, you know what that does to me\\",  etc.) and the story becomes completely predictable.<br /><br />I am so disappointed that I am not even going to finish the book.  The first book was great, this, the second book, is a complete and utter let down.  Unless all you want to read about is sex, then you will enjoy it.  I was looking for more of a story line.
0061743526|2.0|I got this book to read for a class assighnment. i love the book as in the story but the pages had been like riped apart from the others and were very frayed. they were cut crocked and shreaded at the viewable ends. it was very dissapointing to recieve a very good story in a horrifying package. i would reccomend this book but not from this page. i would go purchase it from a store so you know what condation it is in. i would expect better from a 50th anaversy edition. p.s excuse my spelling please. i don't take time to correct my mistakes
B0067Q42BY|5.0|challenging and fun! I don't like putting it down! I love the graphics and that I can play three different ways!
B002ZBZFNY|5.0|Okay, Five stars just for that. My major man crush. I forgot he was in this movie. I'm going to run out and watch \\"I'm gonna get you sucka\\", right after I finish this movie.  Love you Mr. Casey.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I found Game of Thrones to be very entertaining. I have read Mr. Martins books and eagerly await the completion of the series. I admit that I held reservations about purchasing the first season. I was extremely disappointed by the pathetically failed attempt at bringing The Sword of Truth to television. However, HBO's Game of Thrones does not disappoint. If you are a fan of Mr. Martins you will enjoy what HBO has created. If you have not read Mr. Martins books, which this production was based upon, then I highly recommend that you do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Takes a while to accumulate points, so unlocking later stuff is time-consuming. Little bit of lag in the &quot;drag stuff&quot; games. Otherwise great -- classic and new/creative minigames aplenty!
B004SYP5WC|1.0|funny how all my reviews get erased but the creator can write a ton of 5 stars for him/her self. this app does nothing more than a recurring reminder on the built in calendar that comes with the phone. done end of discussion.

B005T87QCI|4.0|This is so cool and one of the best games on the kindle fire . I really like this game.
0345528581|5.0|Being a desk jockey and commuter too much of the time, and with many days that have me gone from before light until after dark, it has long been difficult for me to maintain any type of fitness program.<br /><br />Though I originally started looking into this sort of exercise solution as a result of reading The Paleo Solution, this book really brought home how easily I could fit fitness into my schedule WITHOUT ever having to walk into a gym. Being former military, I can verify much of what the author says.<br /><br />The exercise variety is excellent, the programs are well designed and the progression WORKS.<br /><br />Now, you may need to fine tune things a bit. No two people will ever progress exactly the same way on a set schedule. But as an outline and guidance, as well as demonstrating a host of practical exercises you can do to achieve optimal fitness, this book is EXCELLENT and the authors have done an admirable job.<br /><br />I don't follow this book precisely because I have some other routines I follow. But that in no way diminishes the value of this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This was awesome to get for free. I like the mini games. They are challenging (some of them) and fun. I'm glad I downloaded this for my kindle fire.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Story was very good. I am a Stephen King fan and looked forward to a good story.  Mr. King sometimes goes on and on with words but this one was compelling from the start even though it was long.  I didn't want it to end.  Also, sometimes Mr. King's endings are a bit lame (great build-up; lame endings) but this one was perfect.  Great book!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's a relaxing but challenging puzzle game. There are tons of levels and the sound track is beautiful. It's just a very well made game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is solitaire... very simple but fun game. great time killer also keeps tract of your stats. has a winning shuffle mode. has options to change deck/ background Colors.
1451683405|5.0|Sam's new book is short and to the point: free will is an illusion. The idea that you are the conscious arbiter of your thoughts, actions, and beliefs is just false. Even though the book is short (less than 70 pages), it covers a lot of ground. I wish Sam had written a full-length book on such an important topic, but even with its shortness, \\"Free Will\\" does the job and makes a compelling case.<br /><br />I'm hoping to see Sam and Daniel Dennett have a conversation on their differing views of free will. Sam's treatment of Dennett's position, compatiblism, were thought-provoking and made me reconsider my own position.<br /><br />It is doubtful this little book will end the debate, but it will add much to the conversation.<br /><br />Another book that argues free will is an illusion is Michael Gazzaniga's wonderful book, [[ASIN:0061906107 Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]]
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Wow AMAZING!!! This spellbinding production of Love Never Dies is a sequel to Phantom of the Opera and has pieces interspersed throughout to tie it to the original, but it is a very different show and stands on its own merits. The characters have evolved and grown, and become more complex in their relationships with each other. They have become multi dimensional.<br /><br />The gothic splendour of its Coney Island freak show setting allows the brilliant designer Gabriella Tylesova to provide a sumptuous feast for eyes with her totally breathtaking set design and costumes while the orchestrations and magnificient souring music reach into your soul and sweep you away - to another time - another place, just as Phantom does.<br /><br />Bravo to Andrew Lloyd Webber for bringing us yet another wonderful piece of musical art. You will laugh, you will cry and you will gasp at the jawdropping staging and incredible performances by a world class cast. Must see for any fan of musical theatre, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Phantom!
0061730335|4.0|I found this book as I was working on a community-based development project in Malawi. It was a great resource for understanding the life in the country, and I was delighted to see all the initiative this story seems to have sparked there. As an engineer myself, it was fascinating to see someone figuring out all of these things in such an adventurous way. This book has given me valuable insight for the project we are doing.
B00785P2QC|3.0|For the most part this game is fun... but I had to do this review so I could get in game credit/cash or whatever u call it.<br /><br />Love,<br />the guy who didn't take this review seriously

B004SYP5WC|5.0|Some funny a s s reviews at the bottom. lol. Anyway, great app and would highly recommend it to those that need help remembering
B0006VIE4C|2.0|Are these discs made out of gold and platinum? How could one movie ever be worth this much, especially nowadays. I can see buy the the trilogy for that much, but for just one episode? This just blows my mind. No wonder there's so many pirated copies online. Who's gonna spend close to $300 just to get the origial trilogy in their collection?<br /><br />I can buy the original TRILOGY, enhanced and originals in widescreen, for $35!<br /><br />Am I missing something?
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Love this game.. I'm glad we have free app of the day since I probably would not know about this game
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is my first review of anything, but I have to say that I like this game immensely . It is both relaxing and challenging.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|I dont understand why a billing app needs to have permissions to a phone camera unless the developer intends on creeping users and taking snapshots when doing bills to try to get a bank account number, credit card number, or name for identity theft. Take away the camera permissions and this is a 4 or 5 star app. as it stands now, this is an invasive data collection app.
B007FTZDN8|1.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle fire but was never able to open it. every time I tried a dilogue box told me the app had unexpectedly stopped running and I had to force close.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't believe this is free!' I love the many Bible versions you can choose from and the audio ability.  NLT's voice is the best!  There are many wonderful devotions and reading plans on the app with the ability to schedule daily reading plans and even a catch up feature if you get behind.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I used the film to expose my microeconomics class (Junior College) to an overview of the financial porblems of the past couple of years.  The film has a perspective with a hollywood liberal bias.  However, it does portray many of the facts and \\"players\\" in an objective light.  It was a very valuable teaching aid.  I am looking for additional similar material.
0374531269|4.0|At the age of twelve years old, Ishmael Beah becomes acquainted with the horrors and atrocities of war firsthand as rebels swarm the villages of his native Sierra Leone.  He becomes separated from his family and friends and hopes to survive by hiding in the bushes and going from village to village.  This is not to be however, as he is captured by the army and turned into a child soldier, now committing those atrocities that he was initially shocked and horrified by.  When he is taken in by UNICEF, he needs to learn how to feel, care, and behave towards others all over again and his rehabilitation does not go unnoticed as he becomes a spokesperson for child soldiers and children's issue in his second chance at life.<br /><br />I can't say this was an enjoyable read as the subject matter is gruesome and sad, but it was definitely a valuable read and shows how resilient the human spirit can be.  I was drawn into Ishmael's story but was a bit distracted by the choppy writing.  I understand how difficult it must have been for him to try and remember and then record his thoughts and feelings about the war years, but I feel the writing could have been smoothed out a bit more by the editor while still allowing Ishmael's voice to come through.  I also would have been interested in hearing more about his family and life before the war.<br /><br />This is a story that needs to be told, no matter how difficult it is for the audience, and I highly recommend this book for older teens and adults.  Ishmael's story will put the day to day difficulties of life in perspective, as most of us cannot even imagine dealing with a situation like his.  Five stars for the story, four for it's execution.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I just finished reading this book last night and I have to say I was left feeling like the story was not finished. I don't know if there are plans for a sequel but I feel that the format has left much to be desired and the ending wasn't sufficient enough to give a resolution to the whole thing. It ends with a twist and ends abruptly. It's also very wordy, I'm normally a person that likes wordy books but not when half the book is just repeating itself. I do have to say that it kept me hooked, not right off the bat but eventually I did get drawn into the book. Good premise, mediocre execution. Could have been a lot better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy to play. Anyone that loves to pass the time with a quick game of solitaire should down load this game.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Two Thumbs Up to Dreamworks for including a standard digital copy along with the UltraViolet digital copy.  I'm not a fan of the UV digital copies.  I use the digital copy so my son can watch movies on my laptop while traveling.  Since we usually do not have an internet connection in our car it makes streaming the UV copy impossible.  Besides, why use up your bandwidth when you can just download a standard digital copy to your hard drive?<br /><br />As for the movie, well to be honest I have only seen bits & pieces of it, but my son loves it.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Wow!! I couldn't put this down for the life of me.  Ms. Hamilton had me hooked in the first chapter of this book. I truly hope I don't give anything away about her story.<br />This story starts with a girl named Sophia who studies the Wiccan religion and has a friend named Ivory that accepts it with her. Sophia's mother is a God fearing woman that really believes that Sophia is tampering in a world that can only cause problems.  Sophia has inherited her grandfather's home after he passes.  She finds something that gives her the impression that her great grandmother was a witch.  She goes out one night with Ivory and meets the most handsome man named Charles.  She is so drawn to him, she doesn't realize the danger that surrounds her. He takes her to safety and becomes her protector.  Charles is an elemental and is fighting the feelings he has for her so that she isn't drawn into the danger of his world but life has other plans for that. Sophia learns there is more to life than just humans and that she has a power she never knew she had.  There is so much danger around her she is going to have to learn how to use these gifts for the good of the world. Is there a possibility that things can actually work for Sophia and Charles? Will she give up her life that she knows to be a part of Charles' life? Who can she trust? Again, this was a wonderful story and so easy to recommend to readers. I want more from Ms. Hamilton and look forward to reading more of her stories.
B005LAIGIM|2.0|MOVIE REVIEW #22: \\" A Thousand Words\\"<br /><br />Directed by Brian Levin better known for his executive Producing of TV series One Tree Hill, Smallville and What I Like About You - Brian needs a little direction himself. The film itself - which is  often slower in pace in parts and not really `flowing' from scene-to-scene - seems to take its' time to get where its going. Probably from a simple and mundane script from Steven Koren who amazingly also wrote such scripts as Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty, Click and was a regular writer on SNL.<br /><br />The most interesting part and most pleasing thing about this film was Eddie Murphy himself. Unfortunately , even with a bad script and poor direction, Eddie could only shine on a gag-by-gag basis and does have some good physical comedy moments. Not worth the theatre price but definitely a good `catch on cable' or DVD rental show.<br /><br />The concept is simple. Eddie gets `magically' connect to a tree that literally pops up in his backyard. He learns from a famous Indian `Guru' played by Cliff Curtis (Training Day, The Last Airbender) that with every word he says a leaf falls off this tree. When the leaves are gone, he dies. Yawn. But again, Eddie is an amazing physical talent and he just hasn't found his right material to match his talents in a long time. (See him in Dreamgirls - he was amazing).  There are literally some laugh outloud moments due to Eddie's performance, but he wasn't supported byt the direction of the movies important message.<br /><br />However there were great standout performance by some of the cast including Ruby Dee who plays his Alzheimer's diseased mother and Allison Janney his advertising firms boss.<br /><br />Way too simple, way to long and way to dull. The message of the movie is excellent and quite important in todays world - listening takes a lot of work and is most important in all relationships - but too bad the script wasn't better and the direction more dynamic. (3/2012)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's great to have the entire set!  I was going to buy the few DVD's that were missing from my son's collection, but it ended up being cheaper, to buy the entire set.
B000VWGYEI|5.0|Stupefied to find only one review of this album. I've never written a review before and shan't again, but this neglect is criminal. I bought the album when it came out b/c I dug the cover art; after I'd played it once I ran across the street and grabbed my buddy Steve and said, \\"You have GOT to hear this!\\"<br /><br />It was spell-binding, meditative, utterly sui generis. Still is. \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" especially blew me away; to this day I find it Elton's most lyrical, and maybe most complete, song. I haven't been a fan since he morphed into a circus performer. But there's denying it: this is possibly the finest first album in rock history.

B005YVSIZ4|5.0|Having read The Walking Dead comic book series, I was wondering how much they would \\"keep to the story\\". The truth is they haven't. Instead, they have deepened the relationships. While this may come off as \\"slow\\", to me in makes every life, and every death, that more meaningful.<br /><br />Read the comic book if you want a fast, action-packed zombie killer. Watch the TV series if you want a deeper connection with the characters.<br /><br />Well worth the current $2/episode. My only complaint is that they make you wait 24 hours before they post the most recently aired video for download.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video after having a baby almost 2 years ago. I was able to get back to my pre-baby weight but not my pre-baby body. I decided to buy this after hearing some good things about it from other mommies. I have a very large tummy, that is saggy still from having a baby over 9 pounds. I am on day 4 of level one and I can already see a difference! My clothes are looser and fit better. Plus I am starting to see some definition in my abs. People at work are even saying to me that they can see a difference. I know I will never look like Jillian and that's ok, but I feel better about how I look and that's all that matters to me. As a recently divorce mom who is trying to get back into the dating world, it has helped boost my confidence and allow me to put myself out there. Jillian is tough, if you want an easy workout go somewhere else, but if you want results... This is the way to go! I feel if the people on The Biggest Loser can do it, so can I.
B005QMOZOO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was kept intrigued by the plot and PD James kept the character profile accurately. It is a light easy to read crime novel written with all PD James skills.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|What can I say?  I loved the conclusion.  The way the couple developed into a strong relationship from the first book to the last was perfect.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|I have never shown this series to anyone and not had them love it wholeheartedly. I begged a law-enforcement friend who lives in another state to check it out for months before he caved & bought the series. He is now an unabashed Browncoat. Fans of this series have railed and named themselves Browncaots. They have set precedendts in Hollywood with their ardency and the way they cross demographics. Gigilos, homemakers, chic-flic fans, forklift operators, emo chics, die-hard sci-fi buffs, & Mothers-in-law, all love this show. So worth your time and heart. Awesome awesome lines to quote, characters to love, laugh out loud humor, and nice pathos. You will rue this series demise as much as all the other Browncoats once you watch the first 10 minutes of the first episode. God Bless Joss.<br />\\"Well, my days of not taking you seriously are certainly comin' to a middle.\\" Mal from Firefly

1594203334|5.0|From now on when a friend announces her pregnancy, this will be the only book that goes into the gift bag. My husband and I LOVED this book and found its content and humor more applicable to parenthood than any of the other books we've been told to read. In this one book it covers everything from sleep habits, to manners, to all day snacking.  I cant wait to read it again in a few months when our little guy starts eating solids. Thank you PD for a refreshing book about parenting...the way parenting SHOULD be.

B007H51DQG|4.0|I'm sorry, I'm glad Dale is gone. He's a fine actor, but his character was so pretentious and preachy. Dale walked around with a floppy hat and didn't have to make the hard decisions and sacrifices like Shane, Rick, Andrea, and the rest of them. What Dale didn't realize is that little jerk is not a 'kid' he looks well into his late 20's and his posse of 30 men or so would end up raping the women and children and burning the whole farm down. Dale is delusional and a self-appointed self important philosopher with nothing to back it up. The world has NEVER been civilized.  Remember Genghis Khan? Stalin? Pol Pot? Woodrow Wilson? I can go on and on...The world has always been dependent on individuals who take risk and sacrifice their lives so people like Dale have the luxury to grown old and fat and sit around judging. So he's gone like most marxist marie antoinettes...their delusions of utopia always ends up in a gulag in cambodia or a gulag under Stalin or in a FEMA camp. I like the series and zombies are not that far fetch of an idea...just look at the zombies in the UN and the House and Senate sucking the life and liberty out of individuals everywhere.  Look at the zombies in the UN that surpass the Congress and throw our troops into 'conflicts' Never declared wars!  Anyway, it's a tv show and it is interesting.  They need to get some decent women on there instead of the 'Usual Victims'...it's getting annoying.  RONPAUL2012  Also, Thanks Amazon.com for offering the series.  I don't have TV and I do everything on the computer and it's great to watch the series when I can!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I have absolutely fallen in love with \\"Stephanie Plum\\", her crazy family, and her chosen profession. I have read all the books in this series and cant wait for more.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|I heard a few songs from this CD on Pandora and bought the digital copy soon after. I LOVE it, Almost every track is fantastic.  However, I do wish I had gotten the edition that included all of the \\"B-sides.\\"
0439023491|4.0|As quite a few of the reviewers here have said, this is once again an absolutely superb book. I bought it immediately after reading the first book, so to me, the only complaint is that it seemed a repeat of the first book as far as the \\"Games\\". I had not expected to be thrust back into that Survivoresque World so soon. Aside from that, once again a brilliant and innovative dystopian look at a post-apocolyptic world.<br /><br />I had no idea until I read these reviews that this was \\"young adult\\" reading! I do agree also that this has a bit of \\"middle book syndrome\\", still, it's a natural seque into the third and final installment of the Trilogy - which I have just downloaded.<br /><br />Collins has created a remarkable and stunning world here, frightening in its scope and narrative. Highly recommended for readers of any age.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Action by the boatload, a sandstorm, great gadgets, scaling the Burj Khalifa, enough gunplay to give goosebumps to a doomsday prepper, and Tom Cruise running for what seems like a full 10 minutes of screen time.  If that doesn't sound like a great formula for MI:GP, then break out the AED because you're having heart problems.<br /><br />Brief plot synopsis (potential spoilers):<br /><br />Ethan Hunt was in the Kremlin on a mission when something huge went awry, IMF is implicated because Hunt is seen running (!) from the scene, tensions in the already strained US/Russia relations rise, Hunt and team - Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane (Paula Patton), Benji (Simon Pegg) - go rogue to clear the organization of wrong-doing and save the world from enemy Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) nefarious plans.  So, par for the course when Hunt chooses to accept his mission.<br /><br />Director Brad Bird really nails it in this one.  From beginning (awesome prison break scene) to end (amazing final battle), he brings life back into the MI franchise with a balance between frenetic and suave, putting Cruise in a position to succeed and filling the gaps with a great blend of action equal (Renner), foreboding villain (Nyqvist), gorgeous sidekick (Patton), and comic fodder (Pegg).  What's great, however, is the narrow roles defined for each are easily outdone, as each actor brings so much to their individual character.  On top of that, the FX is simply jaw-dropping on a fairly large scale.  Throw in pulse-pounding, nonstop action and this is easily my favorite MI film.  I can't wait for the next one.

0307593312|5.0|I went into 1Q84 before seeing a few mixed reviews and thought that I might have purchased a 900+ page book that would be an ordeal to wade though. Fortunately, this wasn't at all the case. 1Q84 creates a series of rich characters centered on Aomame and Tengo; there is a distinct chance that you will love them. Every chapter leads you deeper into their stories and the mysteries of this parallel world. Its compelling reading and the 900 pages fly by.<br /><br />I am unable to label 1Q84 as a fantasy, mystery or picaresque novel after reading it. I would recommend that as other reviewers have suggested, you just give yourself to it and let it guide you. Its a wonderful journey which went by too quickly!
B005LAIH2W|3.0|\\"John Carter\\" is largely based on stories published in 1912, ultimately released in a novel called \\"A Princess of Mars\\". Consequently, there has been much discussion that James Cameron's ultra-popular film \\"Avatar\\" was also inspired by the same stories. While there are similar themes, \\"John Carter\\" seems to be a much more fateful representation and \\"Avatar\\" took many liberties and creative reroutes.<br /><br />John Carter is an American Civil War confederate army captain that is, through a course of events, transported to a strange planet called Barsoom. He later learns that Barsoom would be what we on Earth would call, Mars. He is gifted with leaping abilities that it seems nobody on Barsoom has. Because of this, he finds himself involved in a complex and long raging war for the future of the planet.<br /><br />While \\"John Carter\\" is gifted with great visuals and a complex storyline, it is also heavy-handed in the drama and complexities. Much of the film is taken up explaining the intricate connection between Earth and Mars and then the intricate factions of the people who are involved in the battle and why. The movie gets bogged down with a little bit too much explanation and over dramatization from the characters. The movie tried to have fun from time to time, as if it knew it was giving the audience a heavy-handed movie, but it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"John Carter\\" is being dubbed the first blockbuster of the year and that could be the case, but once the other blockbusters start rolling out, it will be quickly forgotten. The action scenes and events in the movie are fleeting. The humor and joy seems to be an after thought to the intricacies of the storyline. The storyline is a good one and I enjoyed the thought that went into how everything worked. I also enjoyed how the creators spent some time getting us involved in the characters, but they may have overshot in their efforts, and because of that, the movie lacks the fun it needed to truly make it memorable.memorable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy how this game challenges the intellect.  I recommend it highly to anyone... I also love the relaxing music.  very soothing.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|One thing is for sure if you venture to see \\"Act of Valor\\"; you will be seeing something you've never seen before. It is almost like a documentary, but it isn't, but it's entirely realistic. The actors in the fictional movie, based on actual Navy Seals operations, are real life seals and because of that, some of the acting is a little stiff, but on the other hand, because of that, the Seals operations depicted are jaw-dropping realistic.<br /><br />On February 7th, retired Lt. Gen James Vaught confronted Special Ops Commander Adm. Bill McRaven about the recent openness of the Seals tactics following the killing of Bin Laden and in the forefront of the release of this movie. The seals rely on secrecy to prevail. They require anonymity to be who they are. So, does \\"Act of Valor\\" reveal too much about the tactics of Navy Seals? I would be naïve to have an opinion either way, but I do anyway. Navy Seals require all elements of a team working together. One comment in the movie was this, \\"One stick can easily be broken, but in a bundle, that stick is strong.\\"  Seals are the best of the best. If our enemies learn anything from this film, it is that if the Seals are onto you, you better have been trained well.<br /><br />\\"Act of Valor\\" as said to me by a veteran of Vietnam who was sitting nearby in the movie theatre, \\"should be required viewing in high schools and college.\\"  It is plain and simple an inside look of the sacrifice that these elite men do to keep the world safe. There is evil in the world and as much as many try to deny it, it is true and these Navy Seals silently, secretly and without praise, defend us on a regular basis so that we can sleep at night and get up and watch the news and have opinions about what is going on in the world.<br /><br />The bird's eye view inside the Navy Seals is one of a kind and not to be missed. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I felt the intensity of the operations first hand, understanding what was at stake and knowing that these men, although it was just a movie, are patriots and comrades to the 9th degree. \\"Act of Valor\\" is not only a good movie but an important movie.d knowing that these men, although it was just a movie, are patriots and comrades to the 9th degree. \\"Act of Valor\\" is not only a good movie but an important movie.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Once again, Jodi Picoult captures your attention and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the conclusion! Her subjects are always timely, often dealing with a subject recently in the headlines.While reading The Pact, I found myself constantly changing my opinion as the facts unfolded. The raw emotion of the parents involved is heart rending.The story makes us asks ourselves if we ever REALLY know our children.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|This movie was quite simply amazing.  The story is one most people are familiar with on a basic level, but it takes us well beyond what, I think, the average person knows about J. Edgar.  The number of new things I learned surprised me, and I really enjoyed the movie as a result.  I am sure that a real J. Edgar buff might have known it all, but for most of us it was very \\"educational\\".<br /><br />I also thought the movie was very tastefully done; while it touched on the fact that he cross-dressed and was gay, it was really not at all a focal point of the movie (although his long term relationship was certainly highlighted).  They could have easily made this into a gossipy feeling movie, and they nimbly avoided that pitfall.<br /><br />I thought the acting was good, particularly DiCaprio.  While I have always been a DiCaprio fan, I think this has to be one of the finest examples of his work.  You could easily forget it was him beneath all the makeup.  He really got into character, and made you believe in what he was \\"selling\\".  I feel he understood the character well, and I doubt anyone could have done a better job with the role.<br /><br />Overall, I think the movie captures all sides of J. Edgar as he really was.  He is a figure that history has a hard time seeing clearly (and who was certainly not seen clearly during his lifetime), and I think this movie really \\"got\\" him.  I highly recommend to any novice historian or political buff.  One of my favorite movies of recent times.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I haven't been watching baseball much in recent years because of school, but in high school (which happened to be the early 2000s) I was a pretty avid baseball watcher, so this movie was really perfect for me.  I distinctly remember Giambi and Damon playing for Oakland, and I remember David Justice etc.  So I was probably bound to enjoy this movie regardless, but it really surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Brad Pitt was, as always (in my opinion) phenomenal.  However, I was particularly impressed with Jonah Hill.  I have never seen him do anything remotely serious, and I wondered how he would do - and he nailed it.  Just the right touch of humor and seriousness to really fit the feel of the movie.  He and Pitt were great together.<br /><br />Overall this was a really great movie.  I laughed, and I enjoyed seeing a little more of the \\"behind the scenes\\" of a game I enjoy.  I definitely recommend for any baseball fan, or anyone who likes a good inspirational story with a little comedy on the side.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Best survival knife on Amazon? Absolutley not, best survival knife on Amazon for the price? Absolutlley. It's a no nonsense medium-large sized knife composed of medium-high quality steel, coated for corrosion resistance, and paired with a decent sheath. I've got it in my emergency survival bag at the moment with a Swiss army knife dropped in the buckled outer pouch of the sheath for finer tasks. In my opinion a much better option than some gimmick hollow handled with a few matches and a fish hook inside the handle survival knives. The money here goes into the albeit simple / no nonsense blade and sheath components. If you feel that for some reason everything you need to survive in an emergency should be enclosed with your knife; Throw a few storm matches and a fishing hook in the pouch on the sheath.  It handles well and it's a steel that I know from experience keeps a decent edge without slipping into impossible to sharpen in the field territory.<br /><br />As for the reviewer that managed to break his battoning branches, I can't see how that is even possible. This is a task that this knife excels at, sure it's possible to snap a carbon steel knife of this whereas the lower end steels will tend to have a bit more give and bend (at the cost of edge retention) but you'd have to be doing some very aggressive prying or hammering hardened objects to do that. So yeah, broken in TWO spots? Maybe if they were doing something crazy (yeah \\"abuse\\" sounds about right) where a knife isnt a reasonable or even safe tool, and then trying to get it covered as a warranty replacement citing failure during a normal to heavy use scenario.

0307593312|3.0|Funny that one of the main characters espouses the rules of good writing, but some of them seem missed here.<br /><br />The worst thing: There is a lot of repetition to the point of being annoying.  I felt like I was reading a serial that was published as a novel.  Repeatedly explaining things to the point of wanting to skip ahead.<br /><br />Some of the love aspects a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />The characterization...like stereotypes, e.g., \\"the dowager\\"...maybe it was a direct translation and the japanese makes more sense.  But the dowager this and the dowager that...his older girlfriend this and that...aye yai yai...<br /><br />Could it be a bad translation?<br /><br />Well...I guess nothing compares to Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />But it tries...some parts are good.<br /><br />Some things seemed borrowed (maybe just coincidence) -- the two moons/alternate reality seems like it was taken from Dhalgren (Sam Delany)...but could HM even know that novel?<br /><br />-td
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's brand new DVD (and off-shoot double live CD) Time Machine Live in Cleveland 2011 is a must for ALL RUSH FANS!<br />Recorded and filmed in Cleveland, Ohio at Quicken Loans Arena in April of 2011 just as the second leg of the Time Machine Tour was underway and sees Rush capturing a majestic show (the first time a live DVD came from a US performance although some bits of 1989's A Show of Hands album were recorded at shows in the US) into a stellar DVD.<br />I must confess, even as a longtime Rush fan (solid Rush fan here since 1990 and are my favorite band alongside Pink Floyd and Genesis), that some fans are starting to complain that Rush is releasing too many live DVDs and live albums (like Iron Maiden and post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and also David Gilmour) but such as life. Then others complaining about Geddy Lee's voice being off for this show (he might have either been under the weather or whatever for the show, then there are the bellyacher reviewers who must be either Britney or Gaga or Katy Perry fans). Despite Geddy's voice feeling under the weather (the 1978 portion of Different Stages in 1998 had Geddy singing with a bad cold and his voice struggled) his always excellent bass guitar playing and keyboards here more than make up for it. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is excellent as always and Neil Peart's drumming hasn't lost a step.<br />I'm not complaining about Rush releasing yet another live album/DVD. Thing was, I missed the Time Machine Tour due to the economy being at an all time low (and it's not getting any better folks believe me) and also Roger Waters was touring with The Wall so I went to see Roger perform The Wall in Boston (I was living in south Florida in 2010) but knowing Rush very well (and being a 20 plus year fan), I knew a live CD and DVD would come from the tour (this is the first tour I missed since the Roll the Bones Tour in 1991/92). In my view, it's a great live disc and even superb DVD and gave me a chance to hear what I missed (my father bought me the DVD this past January along with a replacement copy of the CD for my 36th birthday this past January).<br />There are some new tunes performed here like \\"BU2B\\" and \\"Caravan\\" which are from their forthcoming Clockwork Angels album (due in May of 2012 and cannot wait for it) but both tracks are performed much better here than the studio versions out on download (the MP3 sounded like crap). Neil's constantly evolving drum solo spot this time called \\"Moto Perpetuo\\" and Alex's acoustic instrumental called \\"O Malley's Break\\" are also excellent new ditties.<br />The band pull some lost nuggets out of the archives on this new live album like \\"Presto\\" (which had not been played live ever until the Time Machine Tour and during the recording Geddy goofed on the words but were able to fix from another show), \\"Time Stand Still\\" (which was last performed on the Counterparts Tour in 1994), \\"Stick It Out\\" (last played on the 1997 Test For Echo Tour), \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" (which had not played since 2002's Vapor Trails Tour, unique to hear without it segueing into a drum solo), \\"Faithless\\" (which was not performed on the Snakes and Arrows Tour) and \\"Marathon\\" (which was last played on 1990's Presto Tour).<br />You also get classics that have appeared on previous live albums but done well (the opening \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Workin' Them Angels\\", \\"Freewill\\", \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"Closer to the Heart\\" (performed live for the first time since the one-off for Rio in 2002 with almost an Irish breakdown jig sound for the third verse rather than a by-the-numbers rendition), \\"2112 (Overture/Temples of Syrinx)\\", \\"Far Cry\\", \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" (this time with polka induced intro) and a unique take of \\"Working Man\\" which is done in a reggae beat for the first verse and part of the second verse and then goes into its normal take before ending like on Rush in Rio this time with a teaser of \\"Cygnus X-1\\" at the end) and all are perfomed well.<br />The real treat here is the whole of 1981's Moving Pictures album played start to finish. You have the staples being Side 1 of the album which had all been released on most of the live albums since 1998's Different Stages and done well (\\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Red Barchetta\\", \\"YYZ\\" and \\"Limelight\\") plus \\"Witch Hunt\\" (which they had resurrected in 2007 on the Snakes and Arrows Tour), \\"Vital Signs\\" (last played on 2002's Vapor Trails Tour) and the best tune from the album \\"The Camera Eye\\" finally on a live album (last played in full on the 1981 Moving Pictures Tour). The ending of \\"The Camera Eye\\" features samples from Mike Myers as Austin Powers (\\"yeah baby yeah\\") and classic Monty Python movies (Eric Idle's \\"BRING OUT YOUR DEAD\\" from The Holy Grail and John Cleese's \\"machine that goes PING\\" from The Meaning of Life) thrown in for a hilarious touch.<br />The DVD was brilliantly filmed by Sam Dunn (same guy who brought us the Rush documentary Beyond the Lighted Stage) and in addition to the show also comes with the screen films that were played at all shows. The first one that precedes the show with Geddy as a waiter/cook, Alex as manager Ray Ganniels and Neil as police officer O'Malley watching Rash who were dressed like Rush's 1970s selves performing polka versions of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" before a device switches the band to play disco, country (hilarious) and the classic studio version before the machine goes bonkers then the band hits the stage. Then another which takes place in 1980 with Alex as manager of Rush, Geddy as Cecil the British director (complete with bad teeth) and Neil as Percy the cameraman plus a horde of beautiful German women carrying pitchers of beer and trying to shoot a video for \\"Tom Sawyer\\" with the Time Machine device altering every bit. The Paul Rudd bit isn't here but who's complaining (replaced by the band as they were in the first sketch performing a polka version of \\"Closer To the Heart\\"). Then you get outtakes from the two aforementioned films plus a performance from Rush with original drummer John Rutsey playing \\"Need Some Love\\" and another from 1976 with the band performing \\"Anthem\\".<br />For Rush fans who are hardcore fans and who like to have a souvenir of every tour, like myself, scoop this live album up! For those who don't either like it or don't want it then stay clear.<br />RECOMMENDED!eal treat here is the whole of 1981's Moving Pictures album played start to finish.

1451627289|1.0|I am a long-time reader of King who loves his early work and had almost written him off in recent years, but decided to give this one a try based on the intriguing premise and the numerous 5-star ratings.<br /><br />What a mistake.  In the new Kindle vs. Hardcopy debate, I found a new plus on the hardcopy side of the ledger: if you hate a hardcopy book this much, you can at least get some satisfaction by throwing it against the wall.<br /><br />The first adventures through the time portal were engaging and a real page-turner.  And then he went through again, this time to save JFK...and then...oh, dear God.  I began to think there was a mistake in producing my Kindle copy.  Someone had accidentally inserted a Harlequin Romance (and not a very good one) in the middle of my King novel.  And it went on...And on...And on some more.<br /><br />As others have stated, it becomes a bloated, saccharine romance story of the hero finding love and single-handedly redeeming high school students through his loving care and selfless devotion to improving everyone's lives (everyone's but mine).  Not one, but TWO charity benefit shows are described in page after page of endless detail. And has been mentioned, the sex life of the hero and the poor, damaged soul he falls in love with is repeated again and again and again in the most insipid manner.  I wanted to shout at the book, \\"They're really-really-really in love and have sex alot, WE GET IT ALREADY!!!!\\"<br /><br />Oh, well.  I hope my pain and this review can save at least one poor soul from spending time and money on this book.

I had purchased one of those \\"rugged\\" high-speed flash drives from Corsair only to have it break after a few months use (fast drive, but under the rubber is the circuit board, exposed, no plastic case). Anyway, since it cost $100+, cheaper to buy an micro SDHC card and reader since the readers are generally cheap and you won't lose your info. Originally bought the [[ASIN:B002HGFKR8 elago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)]] which works great. But after buying a couple more to use as drives (running portable apps one one, books and documents on another, and video files on a third) they started to become bulky to keep in my pocket.<br /><br />Originally skeptical of the durability of these kingston readers since the USB contacts are exposed but thought I would give it a try after one of my elago readers cracked and failed. It was a good decision. These things read and write fast, are very compact, inexpensive, and have lasted thus far (about 3 months use). I keep 3 on a small keyring in my pocket with my keys and they haven't been damaged in any way. I don't take the micro SD cards out very often though, so I cannot say whether doing that more often would decrease the reliability of these readers.<br /><br />I have two design suggestions (which I don't consider cons, so they won't affect my rating). One, add a small LED light to the end to show read/write activity (I have a old Sony thumb drive and an old Sandisk SD/USB card combo, both as small and thin as this reader and both have an LED light). And two, these should be available in different colors to distinguish between multiple readers more easily.<br /><br />All in all, a great product.

B005R32L66|2.0|Goes offline each time phone is left alone for any amount of time.  No power save settings are enabled, and sync all applications anytime is on.  But for some reason, when going into settings for Applications and Sync, my Skype account shows up under manage accounts, and it says sync off, right under my account icon, with no option to enable sync for Skype.  I'm not sure, but it's annoying, as I have a Skype out number, and this way, I won't be able to receive any calls, unless I'm using the phone and then it connects back up to Skype.  Skype for the iPhone models works flawlessly.  So if you must have skype and have the extra money, go for the locked down device from Apple.<br /><br />Again, this is for the Samsung S5360 Galaxy Ace smartphone.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|Cover fits great and looks great and serves its function. Only issue I found is the strap that holds the cover open or closed doesn't have as much strength as it should. It has started to stretch out on all 3 covers that I have purchased.
B006C45MRE|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I ever thought possible.  The title and my low expectation kept me from watching it for the longest time.  But there was no typical campy film class silliness: they played it straight and it turned out to be quite a good western, which just happened to be about aliens visiting the west.  Weird, and yeah, almost impossible to describe without making it sound like something that only the Village Voice would like, but nah, it's a fun well-acted movie

B003V4AK8E|3.0|I bought this controller so I can play Street Fighter against my PS3 friends without dealing with PS3's weird controllers. For that, it was great. The controller felt great in my hands and I felt like I was on an XBOX. But unfortunately, about 2 weeks into playing with it, the top padding of the left analog stick started peeling off. It doesn't look like its something that I can fix either. That being said, it doesn't seem to be the best controller if you are going to be \\"button mashing\\" a lot but maybe it might work better for first person shooters? Either way, it speaks volumes to the quality of the product, which unfortunately isn't very good.
006197806X|4.0|*****There are SPOILERS in my review******<br /><br />I'll have to admit that out of the YA trilogies I have read and currently reading, the Delirium series is not my favorite as far as plots and characters. But one thing that I must say is that there are certain parts of beautiful writing and I feel just for a few moments that I am reading poetry. If it wasn't just for that fact then this book would have received only 3 stars from me.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with Pandemonium is that it was way too predictable!!! Nothing was surprising! The thing with her mother, saw that coming. Falling for Julian, obvious. Alex's surprise, not a surprise either. When the book ended I didn't feel anything, no shock, no \\"what just happened\\".<br /><br />Also, there seems like so many things aren't developed for us. I was expecting to read how Tack became so nice and gentle. One minute we are reading how everyone stays out of his way, and then the next he is comforting Lena. We got to see how Lena and Raven's relationship changed to what they are now but we don't see how things changed with Tack. I just think it would have been a nice touch.<br /><br />I like Julian, he's kind of what Lena was in Delirium. I liked Alex too, but honestly I'm tired of love triangles (almost every YA series feels like they should drag this plot in). And it made no sense for Alex to be mad at Lena at the end. He was the one that sacrificed his life for hers, he knew all the risks. And it's not like she could have known that he was still alive. I hope in the 3rd book that we DON'T find out that he was brainwashed into hating her or something.<br /><br />So overall I would say it's a decent read, not as good as I expected it would be. And I will more likely be reading the next book because once I start something I like to know how it finishes. Hopefully, the next book will deliver.

B0048WQDIE|5.0|This is a marvelously written, inexhaustibly depicted, vividly portrayed, and sarcastically alluded novel that dazzles with mind-blowing vise and addictive charisma!<br /><br />I picked up this book in a bookstore by accident. Before I bought it, I only heard of this book somewhere too distant too recall. One day I was walking around a bookstore with a friend, and suddenly bumped into the title \\"Catch-22\\", and a comment saying that it is a good novel came up to me. I eventually bought the book out of that impulse.<br /><br />In fact, when I was reading the first few pages, I had a difficult time getting used to the atmosphere that was looming around all the characters in the book, as well as the general tone of absurdity that is everywhere, and the hilarious logic. However, once you get used to the tone and move on in the story, you will be exposed to a world of dark comedy and heart-breaking scenes.<br /><br />When I was reading the book, it was very common that one sentence can make you want to cry, laugh, fume and think at the same time. Jacob Howard has said that some literature scholars claimed that Joseph has \\"shouted\\" the words on the paper instead of \\"writing\\", this is an accolade in terms of the emotions that mingle across sentences in the novel. I feel that the the emotions have been woven so well across the entire world that is behind the words, that every single sentence, every single adjective, is powerful enough to pierce directly to your heart and touch the truest and purest materials there, and at the same time create the kind of resonance that make you unwilling to put the book down while pondering upon the meaningfulness of most of the stuff that are prevalent in today's world.
006123205X|3.0|I have a considerable drive to work so I decided to revisit this book via audiobook.  I think a reader w a better voice would further benefit this audiobook.  I knew the audiobook covered much less content then the book but some really good material was left out.<br /><br />If I had not read the book, I likely would have given this at least a 4.  If you haven't read the book then I recommend this audiobook.  If you have time, I highly recommend the book.

B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I do enjoy this game, smooth on Kindle, but no explanation of the &quot;credits&quot; you earn, or the multiplier.  also no way of buying and upgrading ALL weapons (should be able to replay after you complete a level, and KEEP your previous weapons, instead it all erases).  should allow user to sell weapons after game overs, since certain bosses have different weakness, and the User might have upgraded the wrong guns for that boss.
0439023491|4.0|Although slower in the beginning than \\"The Hunger Games,\\" \\"Catching Fire,\\" book two of the three book series, ends as a page turner that makes sense and continues both the pacing and themes established in the beginning of the series.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is a good, clear writer.  Her main characters are sympathetic, and we know who the villains are and why we despise them.  Although a teen series, this book serves up entertainment and themes that will keep the adult reader interested.  \\"Catching Fire\\" continues to explore themes of the individual versus the all-powerful state and what it means to contemplate and take action that moves toward freedom.  The heroine Katness  Everdeen, and her male cohorts Peeta and Gale, add personal dilemmas that make this a multi-dimensional story.<br /><br />Like \\"The Hunger Games,\\" the larger issues are the backdrop for a good action packed story that moves.  Think of \\"Indiana Jones\\" (Ms. Indiana Jones) being inserted as the lead character in George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and you get an idea of the flavor of this book and the series.<br /><br />Aside:  I can't help thinking millions of soon to be and newly registered voters are reading a book that clearly places a large and omnipresent state as the enemy of liberty.  It will be interesting to see if this series - given the polarization in our country over the role of government and the individual - will have any impact on the philosophy of young voters.
B0059XTUMC|1.0|I don't know how this film won any Academy awards. I guess for those that think they are sophisticated and that the Opera and Theatre are great, this would be great film. As for me, it is boring without much substance. The instances where the dialog bubbles popped up, The larger ones disappeared before I had time to read them. The whole movie is dependent on the cute smile of Bérénice Bejo, who is delightful, but it takes more than that to make a good movie. If they had put an ugly girl that wasn't perky like Bérénice, the movie would not have even been noticed that it exhisted.

B004RJMUJO|2.0|I love Fruit Ninja - it's a fun time-waster and plays beautifully on the Kindle Fire. However, DO NOT INSTALL THE NEW MARCH 2012 UPDATE!!!!! It wipes out all of your saved data (include items you \\"won\\" in the dojo), the game occasionally lags/freezes now, and worst of all: it tries to sell you junk constantly! If you play the game often enough, you earn reward points - and those rewards are just more advertisements to buy junk!!! (Like gym shorts for $50.) Now you need to be VERY careful about what you click, as Fruit Ninja will be happy to charge your account and take your money. AVOID the update, and shame on you, publishers!!!

B006H3MIV8|2.0|It's too bad such a worthy cause - Amnesty International - got saddled with such a lame charity album. Track after track of slack, bloodless, clumsy versions of classic Dylan tunes, recorded by contemporary artists who almost uniformly prove to have tin ears. This 4-CD set is far, far below the \\"hit ratio\\" of this kind of tribute album... Normally they seem to be about 50% listenable-to-cool, this mammoth box set dips down below 15%.<br /><br />I don't think the issue is \\"only Bob Dylan should do Bob Dylan songs,\\" as many people have posted: other artists have been covering Dylan for decades, and I think the Byrds, et al have proved the durability of his work. The problem here is that these are just terrible versions of great songs. I suspect the scale of the project - fours discs worth of material - had something to do with it... It's okay if a couple of artists just phone it in on one of these tributes, but it sounds like most of the big-name artists did that here, while others went in the opposite direction and over-emoted on their cuts. It's just not a very enjoyable record.<br /><br />I liked what one person said: if you support the humanitarian work that Amnesty does, just give them a donation. If this record helps out, great, but I personally don't need to sacrifice any shelf space for this music. (Axton the curmudgeon)
B004SBULWE|5.0|As the title says, it's a must have for any android device.  I originally got this for my smartphone at the recommendation of the salesperson.  I had never had such a device so I got it.  Boy am I glad I did.  This app will shut down unused apps that are running in the background for no reason.  I don't know why some apps turn themselves on when you're not using them, but they kill your battery life.  This app shuts them back down making you battery last much longer than it would have.  It doesn't block updates, gps, email, text, or any other systems you want running.  It only shuts down the unused stuff that has been turned on for some reason.  I have downloaded this for every android device I've had since that first phone.  I highly recommend it.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|After watching the movie and hearing my descriptions of seeing the live production, my teenage daughter wanted to see a live production of Phantom. Since we live quite far away from any current company production and the touring company is no more, the prospects of her actually experiencing Phantom as it was meant to be seen seemed slim. Enter this bluray! While not exactly the same as being in the theatre, this comes quite close -- and she can watch it as many times as she wants! The roles of Christine, the Phantom, Raul, and Carlotta were acted and sung beautifully. I enjoyed experiencing those 'things of the theatre:' microphones, make-up, sweat on the faces, little costume concerns-- all those things that make live theatre LIVE! This was obviously a live production -- no second chances - and that added to the excitement of the production. Yes, you miss the chandelier crashing down, but that's all you miss. An amazing, beautiful production that I (and my daughter!) highly recommend.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I've had birds on several devices.  I bought a Kindle Fire so when I downloaded birds for it I finally decided to buy the add free version instead of downloading the free version.  This is so nice, and I should have done it on my first device.  Same ol' birds, but that annoying add that pops up in the top right corner of the screen is GONE.  As a result you can not only see better, but things run faster.  People complain that there are still adds.  I don't see them, and wonder if they have the free version still installed, and are not playing the paid version that they just bought.  Also if you push pause there is the list of adds that run vertically down the middle of the screen.  You can push the icon of the pig in the bottom right corner of the screen to turn those adds off too, and you'll bee 100% ad free.<br /><br />The only down side.  If you've already got the free version of birds, you'll need to start over if you buy the paid version (at least I did with seasons).  If you've got the free version and you buy this you'll have 2 versions of birds on your device, so my recommendation is to delete the free version, THEN download the paid version.<br /><br />I'll buy the ad-free version on all future devices, this was so worth it.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  You can make notes, or a check list, then color code the page and sort in whatever order you want.  Very easy to work, and looks great.  To quote the tv infomercials... \\"but wait there's more\\".  Once you've made a note you can sync it with any other device you have this downloaded to.  I have it on my smartphone and my Kindle Fire.  I keep several notes, but here are two examples of notes that are nice to have on both devices.  I have a \\"movie\\" list that I will enter movies into my Fire if I'm at home and see a preview that looks good.  Then later if I'm at the video store and can't remember the movie, I just sync ColorNote and there the list is from my Fire, on my phone.  I also have a \\"Honeydo\\" list.  If I have something I need to remember I type in into there.  Maybe I'm going to stop at the grocery store on the way home from work to get some milk, but at some point during the day my wife noticed we need bread.  She can type in bread into the Fire and I'll see it on the list in my phone.  Yes a text message would work for that last one, but it's just an example of how nice it is to be able to have all your devices share the same notepad.<br /><br />This is by far the best notepad I've used.  With all the free apps out there I rarely pay for one.  This was free, but if it was a pay for app, I would buy it.  Don't delay, download this now!
0307956350|5.0|From an uncorrected proof copy<br />The Expats is the impressive debut novel by American author, Chris Pavone. Set mainly in Europe, the action switches between Paris in the present day and Washington DC and Luxembourg two years previously. Kate Moore quit her undercover job with the CIA, a job that was secret even from her husband, Dexter, to move to Luxembourg with him and their young sons, Jake and Ben. There, Dexter's job as a systems security expert for banks could afford them a better income and an enviable lifestyle which included weekends in places like Paris and Amsterdam. As expats, they socialised mainly with other expats, and had soon formed a friendship with Julia and Bill Maclean. But Kate's CIA training leads her to suspect that Julia and Bill are not what they first seem and she begins to wonder: are they are assassins? Are they investigating her for unlawful actions in her CIA career? Or are they after her husband? Which leads her to start wondering if Dexter has been completely truthful with her. As Kate makes certain discoveries in the present day narrative, she flashes back to two years ago, her exit from the CIA and their early months in Luxembourg, and certain events and conversations suddenly become startlingly clear.<br />This novel has a superbly clever plot full of twists and turns that has the reader guessing to the last line. Without giving away too much of the story, Pavone uses the present day narrative to sow enough seeds of intrigue to keep the reader engrossed in the action two years previous. Interestingly, Pavone writes from Kate's point of view, something he does very competently. As the suspense built, I found myself more and more on the edge of my seat. Proof of Pavone's excellent descriptive talent is that as I sat reading the window ledge scene, my legs were aching, my body's usual involuntary reaction to being at unsafe heights. Occasional lighter moments are provided by the children and social interactions with other minor characters, but for most of the novel, the tension is high. Pavone's first-hand experience as an expat is apparent from the way he effectively conveys the atmosphere of European cities and expat life: his characters are realistic and his dialogue, credible. The novel poses a few pertinent and topical questions: When is it OK to steal 25 (or 50) million euros? Are we deluded in thinking that our money can ever be safe? Who guards the guards? Is anybody ever what they seem to be? Does anyone ever tell the whole truth? This novel has been described as \\"Brilliant, insanely clever, and delectably readable.\\" I wholly concur.
159562015X|4.0|I received the book much sooner than expected very well packed. The book itself is not what I expected. If there was a possibility to get just the code and make the test it would be great, because the info received in the book was already send to me by internet after the test.
0761169253|5.0|This is a pretty cool book.  Easy and entertaining read and I appreciate that the author got right to the point and didn't fill the book with another 100 or so pages of \\"filler\\".  It is a small book (140 pages or so but there are a bunch of illustrations and stuff like that) so for just an hour or two of your time you will more than likely come away with some motivation and a pretty good idea of how to get started.  I should point out that I am usually a big fan of libraries but this book wasn't available at mine and the book was so cheap I just bought it.  I'm glad I did because I think I will use it as a reference or read it to refresh every once in a while. Overall the idea for the book was good and execution was excellent.

B002RKSZWG|5.0|Persuasion  ,  .  .  .  .  Jane Austen<br /><br />A number of reviewers complained of serious issues with the printing of this book.  Fortunately for me, I experienced no such problems.<br /><br />Jane Austen was an excellent author and Persuasion is a superb example of her work.  It is a classic novel of England at that time period (1818). It is a complicated story of romance greatly affected by the class system.  There is a bit of good ol' dry English humor as a member of the upper class is forced to take a step down and still manages to keep his nose in the air. Then there's a love tale of the past that just might flame up again. Of course there has to be a villain in such novels and the one here does a fairly good job of being secretly nasty.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This spider game is an absolute delightful experience.  The game functions are very easy to use.  The cards are easy to see and read.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The fact that this movie's title changed from \\"John Carter of Mars\\" to simply \\"John Carter\\" is symptomatic of how hard it is to sell the planetary romance genre to modern audiences.  And that's a shame, because planetary romance has already achieved commercial success in two major franchises.<br /><br />Sci-fi fans will recognize all the elements: an adventurer travels to a foreign land, faces hostile tribes of primitive aliens who wield considerably more power than the \\"modern\\" despots, earns their respect, and ultimately leads a rebellion in upsetting the old world order while winning the hand and heart of a princess. Sound familiar? Before Star Wars and Dune, there was Edgar Rice Burrough's Barsoom series.<br /><br />Here's the thing: planetary romance by modern standards is cheesy, shallow, and likely a tad racist if not misogynistic.  The \\"savage\\" races are often analogues for other cultures, women are trophies to be won, and the hero is usually a white guy.  In short...all the criticisms leveled at Star Wars. Modern audiences won't tolerate anything so overt, so the princesses are always tough - but they still need rescuing.  The princess of John Carter is no different; Lynn Collins plays the princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris, and as soon as we see her it's hard to ignore the fact that the girl is buff.  There's a reason her arms are so wiry, and it's refreshing to see that Thoris looks and feels like she could kill a man with a single sword stroke.<br /><br />But back to the titular hero.  He's a Confederate soldier with an awkward past on the hunt for gold.  The Han Solo of the Barsoomian universe, he's largely out for himself. In a world where he can jump fantastic distances and punch twelve-foot tall four-armed Martians to death, Carter is free to do as he pleases.  The only shackles binding him are the affairs of the heart, thus the importance of the princess and Carter's involvement with Thark leader Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe).  Their relationship gets off to a rocky start when Tarkas gets Carter's name wrong and insists on treating him like a pet.<br /><br />It's not long before Carter stops worrying about getting home and starts thinking about getting it on with the inventor/warrior/princess Thoris.  She's fleeing a pending marriage to rival despot Sab Than (Dominic West) that threatens to doom her kingdom.  Imagine Princess Leia never taking off the slave outfit from Return of the Jedi with more muscles and you get the idea.<br /><br />And that's the thing.  On the surface, John Carter seems like a copy of the films that have since imitated its source material. There's a loyal dog-like alien named Woola, an alien sidekick, and swashbuckling battles on hovering ships.  John Carter is epic, but it's a little late to a party it kicked off decades ago.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is a blank slate, playing Carter as a brooding and monosyllabic thug.  Carter might have spawned rough heroes like Han Solo, but Kitsch lacks Ford's easy charisma. Unfortunately much of the film rests on Kitsch's chiseled abs. The film soldiers on heroically without him.<br /><br />The special effects are effortless, which is no mean feat in light of four-armed aliens, four-armed apes, and six-legged everything elses. Dafoe is brilliant as Tarkas, Collins is alternately desperate and heroic as Thoris, and even Woola manages to not be too annoying.  The script is top notch, filled with humorous asides and character-building moments that swell along with the music.  It's just Kitsch that's the problem.  If you can look past Kitsch, this is a rollicking good beginning to what we can only hope is a trilogy that will make its grandchildren, like Star Wars, proud.f to a rocky start when Tarkas gets Carter's name wrong and insists on treating him like a pet.<br /><br />It's not long before Carter stops worrying about getting home and starts thinking about getting it on with the inventor/warrior/princess Thoris.

Dafoe is brilliant as Tarkas, Collins is alternately desperate and heroic as Thoris, and even Woola manages to not be too annoying.  The script is top notch, filled with humorous asides and character-building moments that swell along with the music.  It's just Kitsch that's the problem.  If you can look past Kitsch, this is a rollicking good beginning to what we can only hope is a trilogy that will make its grandchildren, like Star Wars, proud.
B0042KA58G|4.0|I really liked the first season, started to fall in love second season, can't wait for the third season. I love how all the character's are becoming their own. Who doesnt like a love triangle, and can I say everyone is HOT on this show. This is my guilty pleasure.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is an album of songs about people who have failed, hurt, capitulated, and still sing on. If you are new to Leonard Cohen the voice will put you off right away, but maybe you'll find some compensation in the background music and the cathedral-like background voices. The themes of these songs come from deeply penetrating human experience and do not lend themselves to easy or even ordinary listening. They are for people who have undergone wracking experiences and nonetheless continue to believe there is meaning behind it all. I'd say if you haven't been tragedized don't bother with this album, but if you have, you'll find no better expression of hurt plus recovery in song.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This is the kind of app that I know a lot of people can use.  I've already been using a system like this for a few years now.<br /><br />This application itself is simple and pretty well done.  Everything is set up in the form of reminders. The repeating feature is quite handy. All reminders are able to be repeated by X amount of day/week/month/year.  So let's say you get paid every 2 weeks - you set it to repeat in 2 weeks, or 14 days.  The program also features a customizable list of categories in case you would like to categorize the type of payment/bill.  The program itself doesn't have a password protection, which I'm ok with. Some people might not be.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's a pretty well done app and it doesn't have crazy permissions.  I would highly recommend this if you feel you could get a better grasp on your finances.  This could help quite a bit.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|If you take this work as inspired by Homer's Illiad, but understand that it is not the Illiad, then you can enjoy it as a wonderful action adventure epic film complete in itself.<br /><br />However if you are overmuch concerned with the integrity of comparison between Homer and this movie, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The enjoyable aspects have been well covered in other essays. I will touch on the one negative that can't be eliminated however, which comes from comparing the works, that was key to Peterson's film but likewise, integral to Homer.  That element is the voice and action of the gods.<br /><br />To Homer, and to the Greeks, the work was surely as much about gods as men.  In the Illiad, the gods enflesh themselves, they talk to each other, they talk to mortals, they fight and they are key and indispensible dramatis personae.<br /><br />Peterson eliminates them.  With all the imagination of a post-war, modern-day Freudian atheist, he just purged their existence as if they were imaginary.  As if there were no cult of Hellenistic gods that existed for centuries, that were the subjects of real worship, and the inspirational archetypes even for Christians in centuries since Constantine.  All that is gone, flushed away, and here you have the Kali-juga iron age  version instead.  Here the only Apollo is a dead statute that Achilles gets to deface and destroy.  In terms of the cultural vacuum of today's West, this is an apt artistic choice, but one that is made so unselfconsciously that it in itself is a desecration, a de-sacralization, of the Illiad, that is very much a religious epic as much as an adventure.<br /><br />By doing this Peterson makes way for a thrilling and enjoyable action-adventure film, based on the story of Troy, but he cheapens the content.  Yet in a way, could this work have been done in any other way today?  Concerning what we know of the irreligious, materialistic attitudes of \\"Hollywood\\" today I think probably not.<br /><br />If one can forget the religious and cultural signficance of the Illiad, then you can really enjoy this film.  I don't recommend it to peple who take the source inspiration seriously as they will tend to be troubled by the desacralization, and a thousand lesser changes such as other reviewers have mentioned.e can forget the religious and cultural signficance of the Illiad, then you can really enjoy this film.

1849162751|5.0|Argggg....Why did Steig Larsson have to die so young.  All three of his novels are great.  They are real page turners and I'm ready to visit Sweden any time.  Oh by the way, they sure eat a lot of sandwiches in Sweden. If you read the books, you'll understand what I am talking about.

B004UHF51S|5.0|I heard several songs on a jazz station and I loved them.  They had that typical Michael Franks sound......melodic, some very mellow, some a little upbeat, which I have always loved.  Since receiving the album, I have not stopped playing it.  I love listening to it in my car.  If you are a Michael Franks fan, you will love this album.  I am glad to add another treasure to my Michael Franks collection.

0985081821|4.0|What an interesting story! This story took what we normally think of vampires and weres and flipped it on its back, bringing a few new and refreshing twists to the paranormal world. Now we have the Cruor, which are a bit like vampires, and the Strigoi, which are a bit like weres, but so much more. Think shapeshifter...with the ability to shift into....nah, read it for yourself!<br /><br />Sophia Parsons is a 22 year old Wiccan who just inherited a house from her grandfather. She's only got a couple friends, due to some horrible things that have happened that have basically made her an outcast in the small town where she's lived her whole life. She also is hearing voices in her head, which would drive the sanest of people crazy - ya know? By the way, let me mention here - you definitely need to watch the trailer for this. Its definitely one of the best trailers I've seen!<br /><br />\\"He's just a man. A strange, ancient man - but still a man.\\"<br /><br />Ok, back to the book. Sophia's friend, Ivory, takes her out for a night and she meets Charles. Oh, he's charming and handsome and all that jazz. Definitely, that goes without saying. But man oh man, this guy really was irritating me for a bit. He was definitely one of those guys who says one thing, does another, and then doubles back on both and makes you wonder if you are coming or going. You don't know how he truly feels, you just know how you do and you hope he feels the same. Yeah, that's him. But never fear, there are reasons for his behavior and its not that he is just some guy who likes to play mind games with the women who are interested in him. And once you get to know him a bit better and he gets more comfortable, well, there is a wealth of heart within this man and you know you don't want to let him go. Um, I mean Sophia, Sophia doesn't want to let him go....ahem.<br /><br />This story can definitely teach us that things are not always what they seem. Those you trust are undeserving, yet have their reasons. Those you aren't sure about can be the greatest ally. These are some of the issues Sophia is running into. One thing I really love about Sophia is that although in the beginning you get the feeling she is more mature than her 22 years, you really get to see her grow as a person within these pages. The girl is dealing with a lot - including a mother who has taken up with the town evangelist and really isn't the mother she should be. Seriously, this woman had me on fire with some of the that came out of her mouth! Argh!<br /><br />This story is full of secrets, and apparently everyone has got them! It's a really terrific read and Rebecca Hamilton has really done a great job of streaming everything together. You definitely get some eerie and scary moments, a look at the past and a hope for the future, and even a couple \\"oh no she didn't!!\\" moments haha! I think readers will definitely enjoy this fresh take on the paranormal world, and eat up the book as fast as they can! The characters are very dynamic and fleshed out, and you really get a history of the character, not just some two dimensional vision of them, you actually get to see them. And when you start getting the answers to your questions, the book really takes off and you get a rollercoaster ride of events!Those you aren't sure about can be the greatest ally.

B003ASLJK4|5.0|No matter how many times I see this movie, it makes me cry!  Total chick flick.  Being from another country, I can totally relate to this woman (Not that I am having or plan to have an affair!).  It's just such an emotional film.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Bought this movie for an Uncle that kept asking for it, did not know what to buy him for Christmas and this was a great gift. Til this day now, he claims to watch it atleast twice a week.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Never thought they would be able to make another one as good as the first, but they did.  I actually think in places this film is better than the first.  If you have the first movie, this is a must.  Very funny and cringe worthy at the same time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever you should definitely get it.  there really is like one hundred and one games all in one actual game
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I liked this film so much that I bought the sound track.  I played it so much it drove my husband nuts.  The only thing I felt a little dissapointed with is that track number 9 is sung by Faith Hill instead of Garrett Hedlund.  I think the song is much better sung by Garrett!
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I love thus game it is so fun. I also understand the game that is why it is fun to me. you all might not like it but I love it. &lt;3

My intention was to finish The Hunger Games by March 23rd when the movie opens, instead, I completed the series in just 2 short weeks. If you are looking for something to capture your interest, this is the trilogy for you!

B005WY8YZW|5.0|My husband and I have listened to this CD probably 100 times now. It's not exactly like Tool or A Perfect Circle but I think it's cool to hear how Maynard's music has evolved over the years.
1451673442|2.0|A repeat of information. Was given these books as gifts, read them quickly, surmised they are a rehash on so many other books out there by writers from all over the world. Common sense, folks, is your best guide. If you lack common sense I doubt reading a book will solve your problems.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I was concerned about the quality when I bought it after reading the reviews because of all the comments about poor editing, foul language, etc, but I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot! I don't think you can find many DVDs nowadays that look different as far as editing. I enjoyed the view of the wonderful London theater and the audience singing... the whole environment was lovely. It felt like I was there or something! I love the songs so, that is the most important part. I do not care much either if she uses some \\"bad\\" word multiple times. Let's focus on the key point... she is an amazing singer.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|LOVE the ease of access! To have both my husband and I's desktop available at a click! It functions well. Both he and I have move this!
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I was really exited about purchasing this CD and once we had it at home, we played it a few times. Now it's in the car and my husband loves listening to it everyday on his way to work and back home. Every time I listen to it, there is some new sound (instrumental or vocal) that captivates my attention and so I get to cherish it more and more everyday. I just heard the songs played on radio stations when I bought the CD and I knew they were amazing, but so is the rest of the album.
B004MKM8L8|1.0|Would Like to see if i may exchange this for a replacement! We watched it three times feeling that it was just our equipment, but after trying it on a friends machine we have found the same concern. About half way through the movie the voices and film are off sync! Please let me know what i can do! Thanks
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is a great Docu Drama and the movie is well done.  It is a movie that every American should watch and experience.
B004UQPM4E|3.0|The Classic Superman movies are so great, excelent and very good made. However, the re-adaptation of the movies from one source to a brand new one (blu-ray) are not very nice. What I mean is that these movies have to be re-mastered with more detail and with more hours invested in order to get an excelent work. The high definition quality is not as one expected to have. If you compare these movies with Back to the future movies or Star Wars Blu-rays, you could problably say that Superman movies have the poorest qualtity of them. I was expecting a better quality when we talk about high definition picture, may be I am so demanding but I like movies and I like the classic the most. Superman has been always one my favorites characters and so the movies. Blu-ray means that the movie per se has to offer you the highest qualtiy possible compared with other sources like the DVD, so the studios have to invest a lot of hours, work and huge budget in order to make an excelent job not just a good job. Old movies are more complicated to re-mastered because the original source could be damaged or lost, but technicians know how to solve this issue. In conclution, I would say, that if you allready have the movies from the DVD collection, keep them and take in mind that probably in the near future, there is going to be a better release of Superman anthology.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I was skeptical that a $28 item could make much difference. I kept looking at the $100-$150 amps couldn't convince myself that this amp would please my ears. But about a month ago, I bought it. One of the best buys I've made in a long time.<br />Not only does it amplify the sound so that you don't have to overdrive the earbuds, but it really clarifys the sound. I' have plugged it in and then removed it to compare. It definitely makes a big difference. I also find that fully charged batteries get about 8-9 hours of service.<br />My only disappointment is that since I use it mainly with my iPad (original version) , which has no USB port, I have to charge it on my laptop, which is sometimes inconvenient.<br />Overall, a great product...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Just like everyone else says...awesome. The fluidity of controls is unmatched...love it. Why can't all apps be as seamless as quell...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app; simple to use and keeps my thoughts organized. Makes my life much easier. I highly reccomend.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|The form of the app is great - good recipes, videos and tips.  Unfortunately, the usefulness of the app is undercut by limited functionality on my Fire.  As mentioned by several others, the screen will not orient to landscape in a recipe despite a persistent little animation above the recipe steps prompting one to turn to landscape to see the accompanying photos.  I'm sure they're great - but I never could see any of them.  In addition, the shopping list is essentially a frozen screen with a black line running down the center for me.  Neither of the buttons at the bottom of the screen respond, and the ingredient lists for the recipes won't import.  This would be so useful, if I could get it to work.  Unfortunately, all my best efforts and those of a very helpful Amazon tech were useless.  This is a problem on the developer end, and needs to be addressed in an update, please!
B004YHRZLM|5.0|I got the Blu-ray copy of Dumbo for Christmas last year, and it never looked and sounded this great before. The picture was so crystal-clear, I literally noticed the grainy texture on the backgrounds and cels in various shots. Also, the new 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix had literally blown me away. For instance, between the opening narration and the song \\"Look Out for Mr. Stork,\\" the airplane sound effect had literally caused the floor to vibrate, as it came from the rear speakers and the subwoofer. The Blu-ray also comes with the restored original mono mix, so I can watch the film on my Blu-ray player in my bedroom, and the mono mix is also for those who are purists. I also enjoyed the DisneyView presentation of Dumbo, because of the beautiful artwork replacing the black bars. I remember watching the 1950's Buena Vista reissue of Dumbo on VHS when I was a kid, and now I noticed that the original RKO Radio Pictures title sequences have been restored for the new Blu-ray release. I'd strongly recommend this Blu-ray to everyone, especially those who aspire to become an animator.
0062119044|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book - but struggled with the flowery style.  I don't know if it was the narrator's character, or the author, but 6 metaphors in a single paragraph is a little too much.  It didn't help any that I (a pretty educated, well traveled person) didn't understand at least 20% of the references.  One review I read said that the author \\"takes society to task\\" - which wasn't true at all.  The author had one bad guy here, and that was clear from beginning to end.

0316017922|5.0|I have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books- \\"The Tipping Point\\", \\"Blink\\", \\"What The Dog Saw\\", and \\"Outliers\\".  Without a doubt and without a question, \\"Outliers\\" is his crowning achievement.  It is a book that gives perspective and even a tangible road map on how to succeed at something. Whether you want to be a success at playing a musical instrument, business skills, writing a book(s), inventing something, etc., this book has great stories from The Beatles to Bill Gates on the quantatative (rather than just qualitative) aspect on success.<br /><br />The \\"10,000 hours rule\\" is a great roadmap on how many hours to spend on something or skill to become a tremendous success- or an \\"outlier\\".<br /><br />In our time of instant gratification, it is refreshing and honest to know that we need a combination of inspiration and perspiration to become an outlier.  There is a huge difference between being an outlier and a hobbyist (or someone with mild interest).<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell's book, \\"Outlier\\", should be one of those required reading for business, education, and other notable fields.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B002OT730K|4.0|\\"Love You Live\\" is not the most loved live album among Stones fans, but it is an important one, and a glimpse into a period that is usually overlooked and under-represented.  This is the only document of the 1975 \\"Tour Of The Americas\\" (Ronnie Wood's first tour with the Stones) the 1976 European tour, and The Stones' legendary set of shows at the El Mocambo in Toronto.  It's a look at 3 years, a great 3 years in the bands long history, mish-mashed up on one double album.  It contains several songs that only appear here in official live form.  Such as \\"Hot Stuff\\", \\"Fingerprint File\\", \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" (as part of a medley with Get Off Of My Cloud), and until the recent releases of \\"Brussels Affair\\" and \\"Live In Texas '78\\" it was the only live version of \\"Star Star\\".  Some tracks are better than others, but to me it is an overall great live album, and at this time the only glimpse into this period of their live career.  Maybe one day (hopefully soon since the Stones have opened their vaults) we'll get a complete '75 or '76 show, or the El Mocambo '77 show, but for now and for years prior, this was it.<br /><br />***Edit:  After I wrote this, the Stones released L.A. Friday as part of their online archives.  So this is no longer the ONLY document of the '75 tour anymore.  But none of the songs on Love You Live come from that same show, though I think it does have a song or two from L.A., but I'm pretty sure different dates/shows.  L.A. Friday is great because it's a full show, whereas this is a compilation from shows in '75, '76 and '77.  So both are great to have.***
0439023521|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to read this book!  I read it in under 24 hrs, and would've been faster if I hadn't had so many \\"life\\" distractions, I wouldn't have put it down until it was finished!  I expected to like it, but not LOVE it!<br />The book is about a girl, Katniss, who volunteers to be the contender in the Hunger Games in order to save her little sister from the fate.  The games are a horrible \\"punishment\\" set by The Capitol (their government) and is a fight to the death by chosen children from each of the 12 districts.  There can be only one survivor, which means either she dies, or she kills 23 other kids, all ages 12 to 18!  Among these other contenders is Peeta, a boy who Katniss feels she owes a sort of life debt to already.  We follow her through many trials throughout the games, and her continued confusion over Peeta.<br />The Hunger Games had me holding my breath many times.. Trying to predict what was coming next, and being surprised at some of it!  It is full of action and suspense, and a great love story that leaves you feeling strongly for both of them!  I can not wait to read the next books, I can't wait to see what happens next and how the story will end!  I recommend this book for everyone!  It's a great story, and the movie comes out on March 23rd!<br />I gave this book 5 stars, without hesitation!<br />[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This looks like a good app for those of us who live in the real world. It's nice that the faotd is something useful rather than another game I won't ever play. For those of you who think you're really clever and funny... Seriously, why do you feel the need to bring down a good app's rating just to be an obnoxious ass? Just saying.
B00007JMCX|5.0|I loved this movie. It was everything everyone told me it would be. My friends can not wait to have movie night so they can watch it!
B0078N2MTE|2.0|Ok, the acting was good, but I am the type of movie watcher who wants to be entertained.  If I want to strain my brain, I will pick a good forum and try to stir up a debate.  So, if you like the kind of movie which doesn't really go anywhere, but has dark pockets of cerebral imbalance with matching mood music to titillate the artiste in you, well....have fun.  At the end, I said....why did I waste my time.  Oh, sure the critics loved it, and some audiences, but for my two cents, it was not entertaining, but painful.
B0055SWM08|3.0|I enjoyed the first 5 to 6 shelves on the \\"Bookshelf\\" of the first part of this game. It starts out with a shelf and every shelf consist of 3 groupings,each group consist of 4 games. The first bookshelf has 7 shelfs. I appreciated the challenge to make a person think, then almost at the very end of the shelves year 1945 and 1946 I needed to take a break. At that point it seemed as if the game was not just on a different level, it was as if several games where compressed into one, the games no longer felt as if they built on one another, it seemed as if a totally unrelated group of moves where just placed in the game at different intervals, no longer did the game feel a test of logic that also challenged other skills. After a break I will go back and try to continue. I really had a great time and love challenge, but at shelf 6(which I completed)then shelf 7 which I only had 1 more game to go and thought this does not make sense anymore, the game for me was lost, what I felt that was so great in the beginning, the building of logic and skill, was not part of the game anymore. Like I said after a break I am going to give Quell another go, then finish this review.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|fun logic is a simple challenging. game for all ages you will enjoy the many levels of challenging. fun and. good Pst time
B005T87QCI|4.0|this game is cool and all but it is not worth a dollar it should be free. u cant be any of the main bots like atom or Zeus. wy does it have atom on the picture if u cant play as him. MAKE THIS GAME FREE PLEASE. the only reason I 4 stard this game is because the gameplag is amazing.
B004HEXSLI|3.0|My father had a stroke a little more than a year ago and is still not speaking. I hoped this book would shed some insight as to what he is feeling and going through and how to help him. Unfortunately it was much more technical than I expected it to be and quite difficult to read.

All of the Wonderful songs! Dances! And Chitty Chitty it's self! And the blu-ray version is just so clean and clear! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! I look forward to sharing it with my nieces and nephews!
0439023513|5.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I cried sooooo much at the end.... first book that makes me cry soo much. I cried for like 10 minutes during the end and after. It was just so hard to read the last part after the death of Prim because I just felt really sorry for Katniss because she is suffering mentally and is not rational most of the time. I was mad about how they discarded her like thrash after the war, mad that they only used her, mad about all the deaths. I love the Hunger Games. It is a depressing trilogy but interesting. I love you Katniss and Peeta. I hope you did live happy lives without having to suffer from the Hunger Games and the war. ( I am crying while I type this). Katniss was really strong and I cannot understand how she was able to suffer all the hardships and the failures that the adults symbolized in this series. I love you Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay. I love you Katniss and Peeta.

B004SYP5WC|4.0|Looking at this I thought immediately that it looked very familiar. Well that's because it was. I own the app [[ASIN:B004GYVYV0 EasyMoney]] and the Bills Reminder here is built into that already. So I guess I don't need both. I would really recommend buying EasyMoney (even though it costs about $10) and just get that. But there are some who wouldn't want EasyMoney and use a different finance app instead that might not have a bill reminder feature. In that case it might be worth getting this standalone version of the Bill Reminder. Because it is really useful to have the reminder. I usually am good at remembering my bills, but there have been a couple times the bill reminder has alerted me to something I might have forgotten about. It seems to work well and does the job for me.

1590171993|5.0|A brief commentary by Frank Wilson at the blog Books, Inq--The Epilogue stimulated me to read the book. More on his thoughts later.<br /><br />The story begins with a two-paragraph recap of his his life--entering the University of Missouri in 1910, receiving his PhD, his acceptance of an instructorship there, his lack of ascension in the ranks, and his death in 1956. Right away, the reader knows there are problems ahead, e.g. \\"Stoners's colleagues, who held him in no particular esteem when he was alive, speak of him rarely now; to the older ones, his name is a reminder of the end that awaits them all, and to the younger ones it is merely a sound which evokes no sense of the past and no identity which they can associate themselves or their careers.\\"<br /><br />From a poor farm background, Stoner's reticent father suggests that he go to U of M to study agriculture--they'd saved some egg money; but professor Archer Sloane changes his life. He wasn't going back to the farm after school; he was going to be a professor of literature. There is an awkward scene during his graduation when he tells his parents his plans. The poignant conversation concludes with his father simply saying, \\"If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that's what you ought to do. Your ma and me can manage.\\"<br /><br />In graduate school, Stoner has two friends--David Masters and Gordon Finch. They'd meet at a saloon Friday afternoons and one day, Masters asks them if they'd \\"ever considered the question of the true nature of the University.\\" They smile, but say nothing. Masters then offers his version of their inner thoughts: \\"Stoner, here, I imagine, sees it as a great repository, like a library or a whorehouse, where men come of their free will and select that which will complete them, where all work together like little bees in a common hive. The True, the Good, and the Beautiful. They're just around the corner, in the next corridor; they're in the next book, the one you haven't read or in the next stack, the one you haven't got to. But you'll get there someday. And when you do--when you do--\\" After covering Finch, Masters expresses his view that it \\"is an asylum...a rest home, for the infirm, the aged, the discontent, and the otherwise incompetent. Look at the three of us--we are the University....\\" He further tells Finch, \\"you're capable of work, but you're just lazy enough so that you can't work as hard as the world would want you to. On the other hand, you're not quite so lazy that you can impress upon the world a sense of your importance.\\" And again to Stoner: \\"You think there's something here, something to find. Well, in the world you'd learn soon enough. You, too, are cut out for failure; not that you'd fight the world....\\" The whole sequence is fascinating; and in the introduction, John McGahern suggests that it reflects the author's own views.<br /><br />WWI occurs. Finch and Masters entered the military with Finch stationed in New York while Masters got killed killed in France. Stoner got a deferment and received his doctorate in 1918. Sloane then offered him a full-time job. He meets Edith, a beautiful girl, and falls in love, although it is so distant and awkward, one wonders how. Williams describes her in a way that gave me chills: \\"She was educated upon the premise that she would be protected from the gross events that life might thrust in her way, and upon the premise that she had no other duty than to be a graceful and accomplished accessory to that protection, since she belonged to a social and economic class to which protection was an almost sacred obligation...She learned that she would have duties toward her husband and family and that she must fulfill them...yet she was ignorant of her own bodily functions, she had never been alone to care for her own self one day of her life....\\" It was a disaster in the making, confirmed at their first sexual encounter, the second night of their honeymoon, and throughout their married life. The only time she was sexual was a brief period when she wanted a baby. It ended after she became pregnant with Grace.<br /><br />Edith's strange behaviors fill the book--Stoner sleeping on the couch, her \\"illnesses,\\" contrasted with periods of frenzied activity (usually for \\"good\\" ends), her manipulations (particularly with Stoner's home office), and her erratic dealings with Grace. All while Stoner accepts it, muddling through his life, and focusing on his work as an escape. There's a new element introduced with a crippled but lazy student named Walker; and Lomax, soon to be department chairman and Stoner's nemesis in the inner world of campus politics. Stoner got assigned the worst schedules possible and without any upper classes. \\"A kind of lethargy descended upon him.\\" Then...<br /><br />Stoner falls in love with Katherine Driscoll, a younger member of the staff. \\"In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that...love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another...Nearly every afternoon, when his classes were over, he came to her apartment. They made love, and talked, and made love again, like children who did not think of tiring at their play....\\"<br /><br />Consider these thoughts:<br /><br />\\"Now in his middle age he began to to know that it [love] was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart....<br /><br />\\"He dreamed of perfections, of worlds in which they could always be together, and half believed in the possibility of what he dreamed....<br /><br />\\"They grew from passion to lust to a deep sensuality that renewed itself from moment to moment....`Lust and learning,' Katherine once said. `That's really all there is, isn't it?'...<br /><br />\\"They had been brought up in a tradition that told them...the life of the mind and the life of the senses were separate...That one could intensify the other had never occurred to them; and since the embodiment came before the recognition of the truth, it seemed a discovery that belonged to them alone.\\" I definitely wanted it to work out.<br /><br />He was, of course, deceiving Edith; and the word was getting out that \\"Old Stoner\\" was having an affair. Enter the \\"son-of-a-bitch\\" Lomax who wouldn't let it go. The matter-of-fact discussion between Stoner and Katherine--of their love and happiness and the end of it--is sad and touching.<br /><br />Life with Edith, Grace and at the university were a strain as Stoner plodded through that which needed done. He became an oddity on campus. Grace got pregnant, on purpose, escaping the unhappy home. But after WWII, he had the best years of his teaching. \\"He worked harder than he had ever worked, the students, strange in their maturity, were intensely serious and contemptuous of triviality.\\"<br /><br />In 1949, he learned Katherine had written a book, dedicated to W.S., and he got a copy as soon as he could. \\"It was as good as he thought it would be. The prose was graceful, and its passion was masked by a coolness and clarity of intelligence.\\" When I read that second sentence I thought it described Williams' book.<br /><br />Stoner gets cancer and there's a brief but satisfying comeuppance with Lomax, but Stoner dies with his thoughts, Edith nearby.<br /><br />Frank Wilson thought it \\"approached a sort of American Existential\\" and said, \\"This book really is a masterpiece - a quiet, unassuming masterpiece in which Williams captures the missed opportunities that, in the end, return to us with a frightening, unavoidable consistency.\\"<br /><br />I just had to read it; and yes, it is a masterpiece. Beautifully written, the sad, lonely, but heroic life of college professor William Stoner emotionally grabs the reader--I wanted so much more for him--yet there was a fascination with how he dealt with his tribulations. After Katherine left, a little earlier in the book, there is this: \\"But Stoner knew of the world in a way that few of his younger colleagues could understand. Deep in him, beneath his memory, was the knowledge of hardship and hunger and endurance and pain. Though he seldom thought of his early years on the Booneville farm, there was always near his consciousness the blood knowledge of his inheritance, given him by forefathers whose lives were obscure and hard and stoical and whose common ethic was to present to an oppressive world faces that were expressionless and hard and bleak.\\" I'll leave it at that.the life of the mind and the life of the senses were separate...That one could intensify the other had never occurred to them; and since the embodiment came before the recognition of the truth, it seemed a discovery that belonged to them alone.\\" I definitely wanted it to work out.<br /><br />He was, of course, deceiving Edith; and the word was getting out that \\"Old Stoner\\" was having an affair.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|Neon Genesis Evangelion was originally a 26 episode anime series.  The story is now being retold in four \\"Rebuild\\" movies, of which this is the second.  The third should be releaed in Japan later in 2012.  The quality of animation improved incredibly from the TV series to 1.11, and has improved even more in this film.  Other differences: on the one hand, there's more humor and light-heartedness in some scenes, but on the other hand there are a couple of pretty brutal fight scenes between Evas and Angels.  In the first of these, the background music is this gentle song, sung by a child, which creates an extremely creepy effect.<br /><br />The battle between humans and the Angels continues.  Two new Eva pilots are introduced: Asuka, familiar to viewers of the TV series, and Mari, a completely new character.  Askua fans may be upset with Mari stealing her screen time, and we don't have much of an idea of who Mari is and what she's up to, but I say give her a chance.<br /><br />You definitely need to see Evangelion 1.11 before seeing this movie, but you don't really need to be familiar with the original TV series to understand this one.  The first film stuck fairly close to episodes 1-6 of the series.  In a way, this new movie takes us up to episode 19 of the original series.  In another way, it jumps up and down on episode 19 until there's nothing left but teeny tiny pieces.  And this is a good thing.  This movie completely changes the relationship between Rei and Shinji, and thus the next two movies might be completely unrecognizable from what has gone before.  Could we even be heading towards...a happy ending?<br /><br />Bluray features<br />Disc 1<br />- U.S. cast commentary (The actors for Shinji, Rei, Misato, Asuka, Gendo, and Mari talk mostly about their characters, not the movie.  Then they bring the senior mixer in to fill time.  The last 20 minutes or so have no commentary.)<br />- Trailers for 8 other anime series/movies<br />Disc 2 (40 minutes)<br />- Trailer and tv spots<br />- Rebuild of evangelion 2.02 (22 minutes)<br />- 4 omitted scenes (storyboard) - not very important.<br />- \\"I would give you anything scene\\" NOGUCHI version: I can't tell the difference between this scene and the one in the movie.r and tv spots<br />- Rebuild of evangelion 2.02 (22 minutes)<br />- 4 omitted scenes (storyboard) - not very important.<br />- \\"I would give you anything scene\\" NOGUCHI version: I can't tell the difference between this scene and the one in the movie.

B00007KWHG|4.0|The early stuff is pure dynamite.  Incredible hooks.  Straightforward beats.  And Frankie Valli's screaming falsetto knocks you out.

Overall, very upbeat and listenable.

0385737955|2.0|Just the word \\"maze\\" incites an instant mental picture of adventure, mystery, danger, and bravery. James Dashner's, The Maze Runner, has screamed at me from bookshelves for the past six months. At last, when I found an extra $9.99 in my pocket, I purchased it.<br /><br />The story follows a teenage boy named Thomas who wakes up in what seems to be a never-ending pitch-black elevator that deposits him into the center of a maze--a maze that's kept over 50 boys prisoner for several years. With a faulty memory and determination to find answers, Thomas seeks knowledge in every nook and cranny of the hundred-foot walls surrounding the only safe square to live in--the Glade.<br /><br />He has a rough entry into the created Glade culture, where boys take little pity on newcomers and everyone has accepted the fate of what seems to be an unsolvable maze. Every Glader has a duty--farming, cooking, healing, etc. Thomas wants to be a Runner--an explorer of the maze who spends all day seeking answers. Instead of welcoming him with open arms, the Gladers suspect him when things start to change. Boys remember him, but they don't know why. A girl shows up in the elevator-box (the first one ever). A message is received from the Creators. And Thomas somehow has bravery and answers no one else has seen before.<br /><br />When the \\"end\\" is triggered, the boys are forced to fight for their lives, their friends, and their sanity against the dreaded enemies called \\"The Grievers\\". Time is running out and escape options dwindle like a trickling waterfall.<br /><br />This book was a quick read--took me less than a week, which is saying a lot in my busy schedule. The plot was intriguing and many of the character emotions were deep and believable. I felt confused with Thomas and frustrated with his fleeting memories. The adventure is constant and page-turning, but a little on the darker side. Many children die over the course of the book and there are other things like sacrifices and torturing sickness.<br /><br />The end was rather dark and a little depressing. Not a lot of hope is left or achieved. The \\"last battle\\" of sorts is graphic, sad, and slightly disturbing with the knowledge that all the screams and deaths are those of teenage children. Throughout the novel, I found Thomas's lack of compassion in certain situations disturbing, like when a boy is sacrificed to the Maze.<br /><br />The plot had a lot of potential. It built and built and built to something I hoped would be great, but turned out to be predictable. It didn't feel unique, which then didn't seem to match the rest of the book. Once I discovered the answers behind the existence and purpose of the maze, I was sorely disappointed. It wasn't believable to me. It kept the imagination-cogs turning through the novel, but in the end weakened the story.<br /><br />The characters came off sadly bland and inconsistent. Thomas in particular seemed lacking in emotions and somehow managed to succeed at most of what he tried. While the reader wanted to see the characters eventually succeed, I felt a lack of inner conflict. Thomas just had a lot of outer conflict that was \\"conquered\\" with just a little average thinking.<br /><br />The \\"culture\\" created in the Maze lacked  hope and compassion and the only clear theme running throughout the novel was \\"never give up.\\" But once we reached the end, no hope was reached. The book had so much potential--cool title, catching first chapter, and who doesn't like the idea of a giant creepy maze? Overall, I found the read interesting, but mediocre. It's doubtful I'd read it again.sickness.<br /><br />The end was rather dark and a little depressing. Not a lot of hope is left or achieved.

0634022296|5.0|I needed a handy guide to Beatles' chords and lyrics, and I'm very happy with this one. The songs are presented in their original keys, with just the necessary chord information to play them, but not more than what is necessary; This yields a concise set of songs and a very satisfying user experience.<br /><br />I've used this for both sing-alongs with friends, and for my own personal study of the tunes; my only complaint would be the binding of the book -- it's so thick that it wants to close by itself, and I have to use a heavy object or a capo to keep it open to the page sometimes. But you know... that's a first-world problem.  Love this book so much that I bought it twice when I lost it during a move.
0525423656|2.0|How could I ignore the requests, the temptation, and the pleasant blue color of Ally Condie's newest release, Crossed? This is the continuation of Matched and I picked it up as soon as it arrived at the library.<br /><br />Cassia is headed toward the Outer Provinces in search for Ky against all odds--the attack of the Enemy, the ploys of the Society, and the deathly embrace of the unknown land. She sacrifices emotional keepsakes for information and leaves her family behind. When her adventures take her into the Carving--a canyon of poisoned rivers and death--the obstacles only seem to grow. She's faced with starvation, exhaustion, and doubt on where to go.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ky is trying to survive the harsh 60-day-death-sentence, working and burying the dead in the Outer Provinces. No one has survived 60 days yet. He has to. He must, because he needs to return to Cassia. He makes an impossible escape attempt during an attack from the Enemy and battles memories of his childhood as he tromps across familiar wasteland.<br /><br />It was difficult for me to jump back into the story after the year gap and I found myself wishing I'd re-read Matched. There was absolutely zero re-cap in Crossed and I felt a bit lost at the beginning. I picked up Crossed hoping it would build into more action and more depth than Matched. Matched was interesting, but so slow moving, I couldn't decide if I was bored or not. Sadly, Crossed didn't pick up the slack. Though there is more action, the book is more dominated by inner thoughts, musings, poems, and descriptions. The description-style is written well, just not in the same alley of my preference.<br /><br />We enter into both Cassia's and Ky's heads this round. I can see how they are growing; however, I felt like they weren't the same characters from Matched. Ky seemed more hardened and grown up, while Cassia seemed much more in tune with \\"the real world\\" than she was in book 1. It's nice that she puts two-and-two together faster (in most cases), but it's out of character. Also, it was very difficult to distinguish between who's head I was in. Each chapter says clearly, \\"Cassia\\" or \\"Ky\\" at the beginning, but I wanted to recognize their voices, yet I couldn't.<br /><br />The action picks up around the 3/4 mark of the book. I read a bit faster to see how they escape, to discover the \\"secrets\\" about specific characters, to see if Society shows up, and to see if the Rising is real. I connect with some characters in some moments, but all in all the flow of the book left me disappointed.<br /><br />A lot of plot-progress takes place through \\"coincidence\\". All the right clues fall into Cassia's and Ky's hands in the perfect order as they tromp through the Carving. I found the clues and coincidences over the top when Ky finds a pamphlet that explains the history of the Rebellion. It felt like an information dump and provided too much information (such as the Rebellion's password, where the Rebellion is located, and a \\"title\\" for the Rebellion's leader).  Even though he supposedly \\"knew\\" this information already, it was a little too clear-cut.<br /><br />Try as I might to push past it, the character's just had too much of a lack of believability. So many actions/re-actions just didn't seem human. When Ky declares the one thing he won't do for Cassia, she's not shocked or sad or hurt or stunned...she just has a \\"softened look\\" because she can see that Ky's hurting. I understand that there's a softness in Cassia, but there should also be human desire and reaction in her, but we just don't see it. Both Ky and she don't seem to have many natural responses. Even when Cassia is practically drowning in the rapids of a poisoned river, she's reminiscing about swimming with Ky and Xander back when they were kids. Really? Why isn't she thinking, I need air! I need help! How do I survive?<br /><br />I couldn't relate. When a reader can't relate, that distances him/her from the book. On a different note, though, the book follows the same level of \\"appropriateness\\" as book 1 (Matched) did. It remains clean--there's no swearing or high-level intimacy. The violence level stays rather tame in my mind. A few characters die, but the reader doesn't see it happen. A lot of dead characters are \\"found\\" by Cassia or Ky. There's mention of bombs and bodies flying. There is blood on Ky's hands and on some dead bodies, but I don't think it's enough to really affect a younger reader much, especially with the immunity our culture creates through movies and other graphic pictures. There's a brief hint of possible suicide, but nothing more.<br /><br />The end of the book leaves no excitement or desire for book three. It all seems very sporadic and a month's worth of time passes over the course of a couple chapters. Instead of wanting to read more, I was left feeling even more cut-off from the characters with no desire to see the end of the story.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the book to younger readers looking for a small taste of dystopian fiction, simply because of it's clean content and appropriateness despite the bland areas.  I'd allow my children to read it, but I wouldn't label it as a \\"must read\\". I doubt I will finish the series.e book follows the same level of \\"appropriateness\\" as book 1 (Matched) did.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is a good way to keep track of those pesky bills coming due.  It has one glaring error, however - it does not provide for bills recurring quarterly. How could developers have forgotten this?<br /><br />update - I was just told about recurring every 3 months.  App now 5 stars.
1439102732|5.0|Sorry it's so long...<br /><br />Jodi Picoult has been one of my favorite authors ever since I read her book The Pact several years ago.  It definitely is a book worth reading.  I had a problem with the ending of the book, though, so, since Jodi Picoult is still alive and has an email, I emailed her and asked her why she ended the book the way she did since it was obviously the wrong ending.  (I was much nicer in my email, I promise you!)  Within 24 hours, this published author wrote me back!!!!!  I was so excited to see her name in my email in-box that my heart literally fluttered in my chest and I had a hard time catching my breath as I opened the email.  She was very gracious and admitted that the ending of The Pact is her only writing regret; she had ended the book as she'd expected her audience wanted rather than the way it should have.  Of course, it was a lesson learned and she has devoted herself to writing the way her characters truly are and not what she, the actual writer of the words, feels the story should go.<br /><br />I so greatly admire that, especially her honesty!  Not to mention the fact that a published author wrote to ME!!!!!  And she does answer her own emails!  She does NOT have an assistant!  Call me naive; I don't care.  I believe her!<br /><br />I've gone on to read many of her books--not all, especially not her early ones, but definitely all of them in the past 5 years.  My favorite Jodi Picoult book is My Sister's Keeper.  If you saw the movie, you truly missed out on what made the book worthy of being made into a movie.  The ending is a real surprise rather than the expected ending of the movie and the movie ending is definitely a disappointment.  Of course, I don't like the ending of the book, either, but that's because I didn't WANT that to happen, but it's the \\"right\\" ending....the movie ending isn't.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm leaving it at that!  I hope you all go out and get a copy of the book and READ IT!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, Sing You Home is Jodi Picoult's book that came out earlier this month--I got it within two days of its release!  I would have had it sooner, but the day I was going to get it, my battery died on me, making me late to go pick up Samuel!<br /><br />Anyway, this particular book will always hold a special place in my heart because in the very first chapter, Max and Zoe suffer a stillbirth; they lost their sweet Daniel at 28 weeks while I lost my precious James Isaac at full term, 38 weeks.  Like me, they had also been through 2 miscarriages, as well.  I felt as if Jodi was telling MY story.  Of course, I didn't go through IVF to get pregnant any of the times I was ever pregnant, but any story of child loss creates a connection that only those who have been through it TRULY understand.  I was devastated for Max and Zoe and I knew that if their marriage survived, it would be a continuous uphill battle.  I've dealt with that part myself, as well.<br /><br />But Max doesn't want to continue watching Zoe go through everything she has to go through in order to just get pregnant, so when she says she's ready to start the treatments again, he ends the marriage.  It is expected, but still sad.  Both deal with not only the loss of their child but also the loss of their marriage in tragic ways and suffer greatly.<br /><br />It isn't too long when Zoe is pulled out of a pool (is she trying to drown herself or not?  you read it and see what you think) by a casual acquaintance, Vanessa.  The two women quickly become the best of friends and, yes, they're soon lovers.  They get married and decide to have a baby....one of the embryos still frozen from Zoe's last IVF treatment cycle.  This is where the \\"fun\\" begins.<br /><br />From there, the story truly become a 3-ring circus.  I'd like to say that not all Christians are the way Christians are portrayed in Sing You Home.  Granted, I have to admit that Jodi is portraying Christians in the stereotypical light that they (I should say we) have become.  It's so very sad.  But again, not every Christian is a hypocrite to the degree that the Christians in this story are portrayed.  Of course, the worst is the lawyer who claims to be a believer, yet who obviously wants this case for what it can do for his career and to make him more visible in the public eye.  I truly am disgusted by Wade Preston and wanted him punched in the face by SOMEONE!!!  He never asks for what Max wants or really cares about Max.  (In case I forgot to say it, Wade Preston is Max's laywer.)  By the time the lawsuit is filed, it's completely out of Max's hands.  He honestly doesn't even have a choice in the matter of whether or not it continues.  It's so disgusting.<br /><br />Liddy, Max's sister-in-law, is my favorite character in the story and, I think, the most misunderstood.  She is seen/portrayed as the \\"perfect\\" Christian.  The woman who has waited for marriage to have sex.  The woman who has been a Christian all of her life.  The woman who prays all the time.  The woman who has a \\"perfect\\" life with a \\"perfect\\" rich husband.  But yet, Liddy, like Zoe, has several miscarriages (5 if I am remembering correctly) and is having fertility problems as well.  All Liddy wants, like Zoe, is to be a Mom.  Yet, Zoe hates Liddy and everything Liddy stands for.  At one point in the story, Zoe refuses to have anything to Liddy because, as Zoe says, they have nothing in common.<br /><br />I was so saddened to see that what Zoe was craving from others--acceptance for who she is and what she wants in life, she is unwilling, unable to give to Liddy.  Rather than embracing Liddy as \\"sisters who have shared grief in child loss,\\" Zoe lashes out at Liddy and completely makes the Liddy the \\"bad guy.\\"<br /><br />Yet, Liddy, like Zoe, is just trying to do her best in this crazy, mixed-up world and to be the best person she can be.  She has sins in her life, just as she says Zoe does--of course, Zoe's sin is for the anyone to see who's willing to see (according to Liddy's beliefs as a Christian, now--keep that in mind)--that she's gay and in a gay marriage--while Liddy's sin is secret and locked behind a hurting, very scared heart.  (If you want to know Liddy's sin, you just have to read the book!)  Zoe is brave enough to follow through with what she wants and what she wants is Vanessa.  Liddy hides and pretends that all is well in her world, yet everything she's ever known, loved, or believed in is crashing down around her.<br /><br />I love both Liddy and Zoe in this story.  I desperately wanted Zoe and Liddy to be friends.  I could see even early on that these two women could be soul mates...if only Liddy could love Zoe unconditionally and if only Zoe could see that Christians aren't perfect!!!!<br /><br />The trial between Max and Zoe for the embryos is the main focus of the book and takes up more than half of the book overall--at least 200 pages +.  But to me, the REAL story is between Liddy and Zoe.  I hungrily ate up the pages, looking and hoping at any moment for these two women to fall into each others' arms--not as lesbian lovers--but as women who have shared more than either one realizes because each is so wrapped up in her own world--of hurts, pain, and suffering.<br /><br />Yes, Sing You Home has as a central focus the theme of homosexuality.  Yes, it's an issue that is dealt with and covered in more ways than I thought possible.  I'm not sure that there's a real answer to the problem of lack of tolerance for gays and lesbians, but this story certainly shares both sides of the story in a way that gets the reader thinking--in good, and hopefully, very productive ways.<br /><br />But the homosexuality issue/theme is, to me, more in the background of the story.  This is a story about finding the one thing that every single human being craves with every fiber of our being....love and acceptance for who we are where we are in any given moment of time.<br /><br />Sing You Home is beautifully written and an absolute must-read.  You will probably focus on details and issues different from mine, but that's just awesome!  I know that I focused on Liddy and Zoe because both women have been through similar experiences to what I have been through.  As a result, I wanted throughout the book for all 3 of us to be the very best of friends.  As far as I'm concerned, I was successful in achieving that goal.......g to Liddy's beliefs as a Christian, now--keep that in mind)--that she's gay and in a gay marriage--while Liddy's sin is secret and locked behind a hurting, very scared heart.

0061122416|5.0|My daughter had to order this for school and she really liked this book.  I recommend it for teens.  The whole class really enjoyed it so much that when my daughter was done with it.  I read it too.
0312370830|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I agree with all of the reviewers who have noted that Julia's story was not nearly as compelling as Sarah's. It was a little hard to understand how someone would suddenly become so unhappy with the circumstances of her life after living it for decades. I really enjoyed the back and forth between both stories - the book drew me in right away. This was a really fast read - I started and finished the book within a three hour flight. I, like others, felt the end was a little contrived, but all in all, this is a tearjerker worth reading.
1863514201|5.0|I had been doing some historical research on Chinese silk needle painting and became amazed at the skills. I wondered if I could learn how to do this. I bought this book after reading the reviews from others and references from embroidery teachers. As soon as it arrived I grabbed my supplies and started on the first lesson. My husband was speechless. When I completed my first flower I showed a friend who is a skilled seamstress and quilter and she said, \\"You learned this from a book?\\".<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to be the first book purchased by a beginner. I like the simple practice lesson which teaches you one new aspect at a time. Each project is even broken down into steps. The instructional diagrams and photos are designed so that you know exactly how to proceed.  Oh, did I forget to mention that the only thing I've ever done with a needle was sew on a button or hem?

I set it to repeat every 2 weeks. after saving, I went back to view it and not only did it appear as a payable, but the next repeat date was 2 YEARS out. not at all how I entered the information. i deleted the entry and tried again. No better result. very disappointed. Just glad I didnt pay for it. Uninstalled.

B004K4AUZW|3.0|Lots of people spend so much time describing what the lyrics of each song mean to them but don't really tell anything about the quality of the music and how the songs sound - this is a music album, after all, not a book!<br /><br />The truth is, Lady Gaga makes OK sounding music. Nothing great.... And then she relies on the people to like and connect to her lyrics and uses her weird image and the media to make bada-bing red carpet news and get some hype about an upcoming album or a concert tour... (These tactics are so obvious and well known to anyone who is inside the music business)<br /><br />This album fails to deliver in the \\"sound\\" category, in my opinion... Almost all songs sound like Swedish pop music from the beginning of the nineties. As a matter of fact when I first heard some of the songs I thought she must have collaborated with Ace Of Base or a member of ABBA... It sounds just like them... at moments it is so cheesy it drives me nuts... I didn't really enjoy most of the songs in the album at all. Her music is nothing special, really, that's why she only gets nominated (you usually get nominated when you do a lot of sales) for awards, but rarely wins any. But most importantly her music is \\"Listen\\" only type. And it gets boring fast. The radio stations don't even play any of the songs in this album any more, if they do they play Gaga songs, they play her best 2 songs - \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\"... And you'll never hear a Gaga song in the clubs... (Just Dance, may be).<br /><br />I am not saying that every album should be made for the clubs, but if you want to be a Pop star you better make 2-3 \\"Dancing\\" songs or may be invite a rapper as a featuring...to make it more interesting. She wants to be the new diva queen of pop but her music is not popular everywhere really and that's what pop really means. Or she could of made a couple of songs with one of the top European \\"House\\" DJs (David Guetta, for example) like Kanye did with Daft Punk. Or she could have done something new, that no one has done before, or something that rarely gets done - like mixing it up with reggae or Latin or something else... She started this Swedish pop sounding thing with \\"Alejandro\\" from her previous album and I thought, Well - OK - one or two songs that sound like this is fine, but then she released \\"Born This Way\\" and most of the songs sound like this... for me, this is very disappointing!<br /><br />I hope she comes up with something better next time!ave done something new, that no one has done before, or something that rarely gets done - like mixing it up with reggae or Latin or something else...

B004Y6MU6S|5.0|I've read about 50 scifi/ fantasy books. This and the first three books in the Game of Thrones series are the best.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Once I got into this book, I pretty much could not put it down.  Just like the protagonist, the reader is completely in the dark about what is real.  Most of the book is written in journal form, with pieces of the puzzle added every step of the way.  When I finished, I couldn't  believe I didn't see the end coming, but in retrospect the clues were so obvious, yet woven so expertly throughout the text.  A great story!
0887081770|2.0|This book was so much smaller than I was expecting. I thought it would be a full sized hard cover children's book.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This story was unlike any I have ever read.  The story really takes on a life of its own.  The author takes the reader on a thrilling journey, with amazing and entrancing imagery throughout.  The story was seeped in fantasy, but it didn't feel contrived, it felt almost historical.  A great read, and one that I would definitely recommend to others.
B006JD48NM|5.0|DO NOT BE FOOLED BY LOW RATINGS OF THIS FILM AS ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE RELATED TO PURCHASES OF THE NON-US RELEASE WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC IF ONE DOES NOT SPEAK PORTUGUESE.  I've read where the Senna family is approached multiple times a year by one screenwriter, producer, director or another about making a film based on Ayrton Senna, his life, and his career.  This film has emasculated any efforts of interested parties in producing a film on Senna for at least the next five years.  Kapadia's Senna is a wonderful story magically produced through the use of archival footage.  Having been only a slightly passive observer of auto racing since the early 1990s, I was not too familiar with Ayrton Senna and as I set out to see this film for the first time, I was unaware of the ending and what was in store for me emotionally.  This story is woven into three distinct acts that move smoothly from one scene to the next and, quite honestly, I cannot see how a feature-length film with high budget actors and directors could have done a better job in the telling of this story. As the film progressed, I went from curious interest to immersion into excitement, joy, frustration, and, finally dread as I suddenly pieced together what I was about to see as the film awakened my memory of what I thought was coming.  The ending is particularly powerful as we see the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows brought together with the starkest contrast I can imagine.  The musical score is fantastic; a perfect fit for the movie.  This film is not only for Formula 1 fans, it's not only for auto racing fans, it's a film for anyone who enjoys good storytelling about a personality that Hollywood could only imagine as real and could probably never, ever, capture the essence of who Senna was and what he meant to his countrymen through the use of actors.  The DVD (non Blu-Ray) has special features which include short family videos, commentary, and interviews not used in the film.  Be aware, however, the non-english commentaries DO NOT have subtitles so you should brush up on your Italian or Portuguese.  The Blu-Ray version, I am told, has many more minutes of extra footage not used in the film.  I'm buying that and giving my standard DVD copy as a gift.
1612130283|1.0|The best part about this book is that the reader can skim like mad and not miss much. Predictable, boring and silly -- in addition to being poorly written. Made for desperate hoursewives, is my guess. Really not worth the trouble unless you're just curious. Curious is okay, really.
0439023483|5.0|I bought all three books in the trilogy and am now in the middle of the third one.  They are quite well done, albeit admittedly \\"easy reading\\" since they are for young adults.  So don't expect alot of \\"complexity\\". Still, I can highly recommend these three books for their novel depiction of the age-old themes of the fight against tyranny and how lethargic and apathetic most of us can become, overlaid with a coming of age tale.<br /><br />As the author is female, expect alot of strong  female role models, but on the whole, the gender gap is fairly even-handed. That being said,  Katniss, the heroine, can get on one's nerves after awhile, if only because she is so obstinately oblivious to  what is happening around her. Still, I keep reminding myself that she is supposed to only be a 16/17-year old girl, and therefore one cannot properly judge her through adult eyes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a ton of fun for anyone who's bored or wants to forget about life for awhile. I particulary like the fact that one can choose a winning deal any time.

0375842381|3.0|The first book was somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. The second book was sorry, maybe two or three stars. It was just a transition to get to the third book. The third book was just better than three stars. Harry Potter ended with a grand crescendo, a major event, the fight with Voldemort, that tied up all the pieces. This series tied up some of the pieces, but the bigger question of what the new order is was never broached. In book three Pullman was too spent too much time not so subtly taking jabs at the Catholic Church and Christianity by giving his story a biblical content instead of telling a good story.
B0059XTUO0|5.0|This is a story that needs no words.  Each movement and each expression is more expressive than words could ever be.  In our world today with all the modern technology that has engulfed us, we have lost the ability to speak with simple expression and gestures.  This movie was total enchantment from the  moment  George entered the screen until the moment it ended with the dance into talkies.<br /><br />I can't say enough about little Uggie.  He was the one constant who, without, the movie would not have been the same.<br /><br />Bravo!  This is the epitome of cinematic genus.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|First off, yes, Game of Thrones is a very interesting and great show. I love the characters and the political minefield that the characters have to navigate in order to survive, or at least try too. This show is great to re-watch after you get through the entire season, things you might of missed or even watching things unfold again brings up new speculations about characters intentions. The amount of care that is put into every character is staggering, even the extras were fantastic. After reading some of the more negative reviews, the complaints about the HBO effect with gratuitous nudity is prevalent. Sometimes I can understand the important character development in these nude scenes, and sometimes not. It all boils down to your personal opinion about sex scenes in shows, but I do not believe it diminishes this show in the slightest. And the complaints as to why a certain character would wait and not tell the king about the goings on in his kingdom is not out of a weak story structure, its just the problem of speculation and the morals of the character. I say give this show a chance and watch the show completely before rendering judgement. At times I would despise certain episodes, and others I would love, but in the end It seems like everything fit and I would begin to actually love the episodes I despised at first.<br /><br />However, not everything is right with Game of Thrones, particularly the Blu-ray. This is a great show, but I am annoyed with the set up of each Blu-ray. Navigation is terrible without the handbook, some discs have 2 episodes, other's have 1 or 3. Nothing is indicative that one special feature is located on a particular disc and not the one that is in the Blu-ray player. Why couldn't the discs just show which features are only available on the disc that's currently playing!?!?! The loading times are noticeable, even on a PS3, but not a deal breaker. And the commentaries are some of the most fun I have ever heard, so give them a try. In theend I am glad to be an owner of this series and I cant wait for season 2.

This CD does have some swearing in the lyrics and so if this is something that you are sensitive to, I would get the edited version, otherwise, the original is still best. I wasn't sure if I was a Nicki fan, but this albulm makes me one more fan of hers.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|All in all I have to say it's pretty good.  If you liked the Shrek stories this fall fairly well in line with them some liberties taken on fairytales and a few twist added in but all in all pretty good.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Highly addictive fun game, however, after playing it as my main source of killing freetime when I was bored (i'm a working mom, freetime is practically an oxymoron), after 2 weeks, I'd completed all the goals and apparently updating it doesn't add any new goals. Sad, but true. Once you've finished, you've finished. I'd estimate I spent an hour every other day playing it, and finished it in 2 weeks. Loved it, but now i'm sad :(
B007BLCGNU|4.0|This movie was so well done, from the acting, to the makeup, to the way they played out the story going back and forth in time.  I don't know how well it matched the actual history but it seem very believable.  Would recommend this to anyone that likes to see history played out in a movie rather than a documentary.  I watched it twice and caught even more of the emotion in the acting the second time.  Leonardo is such a talented actor and played J Edgar superbly young and old, through so many different aspects of his life and career.  A classic!

0385040253|5.0|This is the 2nd copy of this book as I have worn out the first. This is the book that knot tyers refer to when discussing knots, knots are called by the numbers in the book and so are designated ABOK XXXX so that everyone knows which knot it is.<br />It does not contain all the knots known but has a huge selection.<br />It is also not easy to follow and the descriptions sometimes need some study to understand.<br />This book is owned and needed by all serious knot enthusiasts.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the Omnibus edition on the recommendation of a friend. I was hooked! Read the first one, and since the others were right there on my Kindle, I just kept reading. I read them all in one sitting, had a rough time getting up the next morning. I highly recommend them
B00007KQA3|1.0|Yes, I had seen this movie and, yes, I did a mistake thinking for ten bucks I couldnt go wrong. Boring! As I mentioned in other reviews all English movies are boring and this one is not exception. We basically see nothing except TV with some idiot on screen all the time which supposedly means something and as we suppose to know this movie is about communism and socialism and, well, whatever.<br />Stay away unless you planning commit suicide. Stick with Tinto Brass and cheer up.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|As a huge fan of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy, I was eager for something along the same lines, with good old-fashioned swordplay and just a touch of magic. I won't bother summarizing the plot, since others have done this so well, but if you are expecting something similar to \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" where the good guys win against impossible odds and the violence is sanitized, you might be in for quite a shock when watching \\"Game of Thrones.\\" This is very different from what you might be used to.<br /><br />Although the series starts off slow, it gets quite compelling as the story continues, with plenty of twists, turns and fascinating characters that will hold your interest and have you cheering and cursing in turns. However, if you're a sucker for happy endings and stories where the hero triumphs unscathed against all odds, this might not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Also, this series probably isn't one to watch with the kiddies. The violence can be quite graphic (think Braveheart, not LOTR), and there's some pretty stark nudity (although the nudity isn't always pretty. This IS the middle ages after all... ) Specifically, the nudity includes both male and female characters, and at least one scene with full-frontal (a dude, not a chick, just so you guys don't get your hopes up).<br /><br />All in all, it was great adult entertainment, even if I watched a few of the more violent scenes with my hands covering my eyes. What can I say, I'm a wuss.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder is cyborg and (cut the niceties) a slave. Her stepmother can't stand her and keeps her around as a source of income, which she makes as a mechanic at New Beijing's weekly market. Iko, an android with a programming error that gives her a lively personality and Peony, one of her stepsisters are her only friends. While removing her too-small foot and waiting for Iko to return with a new replacement she meets Prince Kai. He's looking for the girl everybody says is the best mechanic to fix his android Namsi for so-called sentimental reasons. Cinder's cyborg abilities senses His Imperial Highness isn't being truthful, but any reason why he's lying couldn't be very important. Right?<br /><br />Cinderella is a cyborg! What isn't cool about that and the possibilities it brings to a very well-known story, which makes it new all over again.<br /><br />I think I'm one of the few that wasn't a fan of the original Cinderella story as well as a lot of fairy tales as a child, but after reading the synopsis for CINDER I knew I'd love it and I do to the point I wish it was the original story. Personally, I don't see CINDER as a retelling. There are definitely moments you sense what book was the inspiration for the story, but Marissa Meyer has a unique take and doesn't follow the guidelines of the original story, which makes things unpredictable. There is also a lot more suspense and action than the story that inspired it. The fact the relationship between Cinder and Prince Kai is still developing and not instantaneous is another of the differences that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />CINDER is a fascinating and richly imagined futuristic sci-fi fairy tale and I'm really looking forward to the next book in the Lunar Chronicles series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, what a follow up to Hunger Games. What a cliffhanger conclusion too. Can't wait to start the last of this fabulous trilogy!!
B006JD48NM|5.0|If you're a racing fan and know everything about Ayrton Senna, or if you've only heard of him by name only, BUY THIS MOVIE! Not only is this a great documentary, but it does incredible justice to the legend of one of the greatest racing drivers ever!<br /><br />Pay no attention to the 1 star reviews saying it's all in Portuguese or it can't be played on American DVD players! The AMERICAN version was released March 6, and while there is still some Portuguese dialog with English subtitles, 90% is in English. In fact, at least 90% of Senna's own dialog is in English!<br /><br />I can't say enough about this movie. Buy it and I promise you will not be disappointed!
B007JF8NRQ|5.0|We knew another Rick/Shane confrontation was going to happen, but everything else in this episode was out of the blue.  Outstanding writing and acting.

B005USZYDU|5.0|wow! such a wonderful novel for young adults! mystery is one of my favorites because of all the suspence! i'm so glad that there is a second book too! most books like this are really boring at the beginning, but i think this one really grabs you right away! great book!

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book gives insight to things that we all wish our mothers had known and could have passed on to us. Chapman lends insight to the mysteries of relationships in a way that is easy to understand.  If the information here were taught in every middle school, young adults would have a valuable tool for lifelong understanding of what makes people \\"tick\\". It could save many heart breaks as they begin the quest for lasting love. As for those of us who are \\"older\\" it is one of those \\"a light just came on\\" moments.  Looking back you can see missed opportunities and many mistakes that could have been avoided.
B006M9NJFG|4.0|Exciting as a \\"go anywhere, do anything\\" minimalist cook set is, in practice it's more cumbersome than a traditional backpacking cook set.  Also, it gains very little except aesthetics over the milspec version.<br /><br />Now, I know it's supposed be a minimalist piece of kit, but you could save weight and maybe even headaches with a platypus bottle and GSI Minimalist cook set. The GSI can be used in conjunction with a folding stove as well; for times when a fire isn't an option.  The canteen's shape makes it harder to use on an open fire than one might think, and the handles are coated with a rubber that melts if it gets too hot, like in a fire.<br /><br />Military canteens have a propensity to taste nasty after a few dozen uses, and are hard to clean due to their shape.  This is true of the canteen as well, but it for some reason came tasting of chemicals and new plastic.  The cup too, it smelt so metallic when I first purchased it that I was at loath to use it.  A few washes later and it smells better, but why wouldn't that be taken care of before it was sold.  First impressions and all.<br /><br />So bottom line: nice, but better options exist.
B0012GMYTG|5.0|This isn;t Alice Cooper's best or most recognized album. But it is a great guitar album with the likes of Steve Vai, Vinnie Moore and Joe Satriani making contributions. I liked Alice in the 70 and then lost interest until seeing him do  \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\" in \\"Wayne's World\\". It seemed like a \\"worthy\\" return.
0439023491|5.0|This book was so good, I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting!!! It was amazing, hope they make this second book into a movie too!!!
0307959856|2.0|PD James is always articulate and never completely boring but this book comes close.  Unlike Jane Austen's books, \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is replete with bland characters, generic dialogue and not a whiff of suspense or conflict.  There's a murder, but no one seems particularly concerned about who did it, just mildly alarmed about the social repercussions.  This is one long snooze of a book.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Mile 81 is another one of Stephen King's books that brings real life with a mix of the unnatural. As a bored kid growing up in a small town with nothing to do I could relate to the kid. I enjoyed reading this as I do most of his books.

B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the greatest DVD concert to get with Shania Twain.  She does all her hits to an outrageously huge crowd.  Her energy and connection with the audience is top notch.  I didn't realize she was such a fun performer before I saw this.  She really engages with the audience from one hit to the next.  There's also great cutaway shots to the band and to audience members.  It really gives you a feel of actually being there.  I watched this on a powerful surround sound system so naturally its triple heightened.  All I think of when watching this is, \\"What energy!\\"  She really is an awesome performer.  Of course I'd like to think that she'll be back and more powerful than ever.  We'll just have to wait and see.

B000UPGQQW|5.0|It wasn't in tell I met my husband that I finally got to see this movie. I enjoy it from the beginning till the end. I grew up in San Jose Cali. When I lived there I would take trips with my friends and family to Santa Cruse Beach Board Walk. So watching this movie and seeing some of the places in the movie takes me back. Thank you for that  :)

0316056863|5.0|Seriously the funniest book I have read in years!  Tina is smart and insightful.  Too often we feel we need to sell a tragedy to sell a book.  Tina could easily have used her apparent \\"scar\\" tragedy to cheaply sell books.  She did not need it!!  I could not put this book down!  It put a smile on my face.  I found myself rereading passages because I was laughing too hard to capture the message entirely!!
B00006LPER|1.0|If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. If you like true tragedies, then I think it would be a good film. The acting is quite good. At one point the main character tries to make love to her own mother. The whole movie was just too disturbing for me.
0374275637|5.0|This book is worth it just for the description of how we think and choose. Kahneman has added more to the field of psychology with his analysis than anyone in the last twenty years.

B000W7JWUA|3.0|In Settlers of Catan you place settlements (upgradable to cities) on a board made up of hexagon tiles representing different resources. You roll dice to harvest resources and then build roads, cities, and purchase development cards. Rolling a 7 gives you control of the robber and the right to block another resource tile. First person to a certain number of points wins.<br /><br />The game is designed well. The random placement of the resources tiles creates a unique game every time that you play. The options that you have each round are plentiful enough to remain intriguing, but not so many that they are overwhelming. If you decide to get Catan, I would recommend that you upgrade with the expansion pack. More options, more fun.<br /><br />I have two main complaints about the game. The game is based on dice rolling to get resources. This makes it a game built almost entirely of luck, and less on skill. Sure, there is skill involved in placement of cities and deciding where to build and who to block, but without the dice rolling in your favor, you're in trouble. My other complaint is the robbing element. If you're only playing with a couple of people (on the regular board), it just gets to be a lot to block those people repeatedly. If you're very competitive, beware. There's nothing as upsetting as somebody blocking your ore production. One<br /><br />All that said, I probably won't play this game again. I liken The Settlers of Catan to a gateway drug. Before I really knew that strategy board games existed I loved the idea of Catan. I played it a lot with friends and enjoyed it. Once I started getting a taste of other strategy board games, I found that Catan was not the game that I wanted to be playing. There were many games that I could play that didn't incorporate the two aspects that I mentioned above, and were extremely fulfilling to play. Settlers introduced me to the world of games that I now love, so I'm grateful, but I've found other games that I love playingso much more.<br /><br />If you're interested in a strategy board game and want to move beyond Catan, try one of these:<br /><br />Stoneage: Great game for a wide array of ages. Very easy to play, very fun.<br /><br />Pandemic: Everybody plays as a team against the game. A really interesting concept that is seriously challenging and exciting. If you're really competitive and don't want to always compete against the same group of friends, this game is fun.<br /><br />Puerto Rico: You choose what role you want to have in the city and everybody gets to utilize that role, you just get an extra benefit. Your strategy changes every time you play based on who you're playing with and what roles they choose.<br /><br />Agricola: The high-gravity beer to Catan's non-alcoholic. Every move matters. You can't waste a move or you risk not being able to accomplish your goals. Don't let the farm theme fool you, this game is for hard core players. Several decks make the game incredibly expandable.<br /><br />There are a lot of games out there. Look for some other ones. Expand your horizons.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|How can you not love Angry birds seasons, they make me so happy. Those darn pigs I could just kill! Fun game and the different seasons just make the game so much better and entertaining. Very fun App!
B000LZ6DM8|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out back in the 90s - but, alas, my favorite song \\"Tomorrow Started (Live at the Hammersmith)\\" has a big scratch going thru it and it bounces around like crazy.  Drats!  I was just about to order the Amazon MP3 version of this CD when I discovered that it doesn't include Tomorrow Started. Double drats! Apparently the last two songs on the CD version are not included in the mp3 line-up. Sigh. Looks like I'll have to choke-up the 24 bucks for import because it's worth it for just this one song!  It's THE best version of Tomorrow Started that I've ever heard.
1612130283|1.0|I bought into the hype and what a huge disappointment!  This was not in any way romantic, erotic or exciting.

I don't care how poor you are, if your major is in writing then a computer is the first thing you would buy!<br /><br />This book was so bad I am embarrassed to say I actual read it.  What a waste of time.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Great movie for those of you with awry, er, a wry sense of humor. If you are the kind of person who likes the jokes that everyone else is laughing at and don't get it when there there are only a few people laughing then you might be one of the people rating this one star. If only there were more of it, but I guess short and sweet will have to be sufficient for this web-blog madcap venture.<br />The blu-ray commentary is worthwhile for fans to purchase the disc. I'm pretty sure that's the first commentary I've listened to in song form. No wonder I find regular movie commentaries so boring, if only those shows had the foresight to do what these people have done. I wish there had been video with the commentary, that would have been worth seeing as well, and commentary subtitles, but those are not something people would expect or miss.<br />Just wondering when some of these actors will be releasing their own cds. Neil Patrick Harris has a surprisingly smooth voice.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|For one's story to be considered legendary within the science fiction community is a goal often pursued yet rarely achieved by writers of the genre. There is a certain je ne sais quoi that separates the supreme from the mediocre. \\"Wool\\" has found and captured that je ne sais quoi with the finesse harnessed only by such greats as Asimov and Card.<br /><br />From the very first, \\"Wool\\" pulls you in. Characters you've only just been introduced to quickly feel like old friends. Your desire to journey with them, to learn what has happened and will happen to them, evolves from a desire to a need so quickly that you're hardly aware of the change. The sherriff, the mayor, the mechanic -- all are people beside whom you can truly feel yourself walking, winding up and down the cold staircase of the buried silo, the ring of your own footfalls on each step impossibly loud within your head.<br /><br />You will mourn for \\"Wool\\"'s characters as you mourned for Jonas of \\"The Giver,\\" living in so limited a world without any comprehension of how else life could be. You will recoil in the same horror you felt at the leaders of \\"The Hunger Games\\" for the ruthlessness with which the public is kept under thumb. And you will marvel, as you do with any true classic, at the brilliant and inextinguishable flame of the human spirit.<br /><br />Simple and uncomplicated, yet solid and whole, \\"Wool\\" is deserving of \\"classic\\" status. And as I watch eagerly for it to rise to that level, I will be recommending this book to every avid reader I know.
B000E6EGX2|4.0|The music flows naturally with very fluent playing skills. As compared with Kempff's playing of this piece, Mr Schiff's appear to be more lively and \\"dance-like\\".

B004LWZW8I|3.0|Immortals is Greek mythology in the same way that PF Chang's is Chinese food. At best, this film can be described as \\"Greek-inspired\\" or \\"Greek-themed\\" mythology, because if you're looking for an authentic retelling of these age-old stories, you came to the wrong place, buddy. It takes some of the people and place names and concepts from the tales of ye gods and goddesses, puts them all inside a high speed blender, and mashes up everything beyond recognition. So much so that major characters are reduced to tiny ones (Lysander, Minotaur), a Titan (Hyperion) made into a ruthless and evil human king searching for a mythical weapon called the \\"Epirus Bow\\" that was invented for the movie, and the main character made into a peasant of illegitimate birth (Theseus) instead of noble lineage.. Instead of mighty precursors to the gods, the Titans are depicted as animalistic blue savages trapped inside a cube and arranged in neat rows like figures on a foosball table. I won't even mention the anachronisms and gaping historical liberties taken with what's supposed to be Ancient Greece, but I will mention the Mad Max/bondage-themed attire sported by most of the bad guys!<br /><br />One should not look to movies to educate. For that, we have books and documentaries. If you came to be educated, please go read a book (like the one I mentioned: [[ASIN:0451628004 Gods, Heroes and Men of Ancient Greece (Mentor)]]. What you get here is mindless hack and slash entertainment. Being the spiritual and stylistic heir to 300, if nothing else, this movie looks fantastic, speaking purely from a production design standpoint. Directed by Tarsem Singh, who also helmed the equally visually-stunning [[ASIN:B001BPJJ82 The Fall]], there's no denying that this movie absolutely drips with masculinity and taut visual style. Don't mind the story too much. It's utter nonsense about a king with a major grudge against the gods who seeks a weapon to free the Titans so they'll run loose and fight the Olympians. It does not follow any established story in Greek mythology and there are huge gaps of logic all over.<br /><br />Most of the film is very dark and grey both in terms of visuals and storytelling. Lots of barren rock and cliffs, and lots of decapitations and gore. Not much color, except for some signature splashes of golds, and red, which Tarsem is fond of. Do take in the gorgeous costume designs, sets, glistening muscles of Henry Cavill and the other actors, however. For the ladies, there's a lot of man-beefiness, and maybe too much on display on Mount Olympus, with Poseidon and some other dudes hanging out in all their glory, if you know what I mean. Much of the costuming and design reminds me of the videogame [[ASIN:B000ZK9QCS God of War III]]. The scene where Poseidon plunges into the ocean looks straight out of the game.<br /><br />All in all, this film was OK if you've got nothing better to do for two hours. The ending was a lot of mindless violence. Some interesting use of super slow-mo cameras, but 300 did a much better job of fight choreography. They were much more creative, varied, and stylish. In Immortals, I got fight fatigue.. it looked the same as other action movies..

B001N1DPDE|5.0|i had been eyeballing this knife for close to a year now, anxiously sceptical about the reviews i had seen.  i had been looking for a rugged, hard use survival knife that was still short enough to handle the more delicate work involved with field dressing game, etc. While this knife is still slightly larger than expected, it matched my purpose perfectly.<br /><br />This knife has no problem batoning wood. afterwards, it still held it's edge perfectly for me to dress up some fish and squirrel for dinner. The steel is absolutely wonderful, Becker didn't skimp on the quality of this product. The grip is very comfortable in the hand, even if it is a bit slick.  I don't see this as much of a problem since the grip pommel and hilt contour perfectly to your hands.<br /><br />i have 100% confidence that this knife will out live me, and it outperforms my other $300-$400 knifes easily.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is very good no wonder it made a lot of money.level are easy in the start but get hard at the end
B005VTS4EY|5.0|got it as the free app of the day. lots of fun and very challenging levels! I recommend this app to anyone who likes puzzles!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are entertaining, but they aren't of very good quality. Some seem almost impossible to pass and they make it so you have to get deals to have enough points to purchase a new game.......
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a cool app but the people look weird because the Fashion Story people look way different. But that is just me...
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|i love this movie.i have looked all over for it and found it here on amazon.it was at a good price.i think everyone should own this move.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I saw this movie first in the theaters and I enjoyed it so much I bought it.  I think Robert Downey Jr. is hysterical and Jude Law plays a great straight man opposite him.  The story line is a little out there but is exciting none the less.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Im so happy, to actually own this on blu-ray, I already had it on DVD but its so good that I wanted to have it in the best quality possible. The movie is amazing, the soundtrack and everything else is just perfect.
B004EPZ0H0|3.0|This was an interesting read. However I felt that the author devoted too much time to the family history and not enough to the discussion of current scientific opinions, which was relegated to a relatively short section at the end. Definitely a must read for all those working in medical, health or scientific fields.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|It is a good app but would be nice to have a bi-weekly option for repeating items such as paycheck income.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|This is not a high end turntable, so it should not be expected to have features such as tracking control, stylus pressure, fine tuning of speed, etc. However, it does a great job of intuitively converting vinyl into the digital realm.<br /> Ion uses a magnetic, instead of cheaper, more common ceramic cartridge, which is the component that holds what we used to call the \\"Needle.\\" Ceramic cartridges are very common, used in all Crosley turntables I believe, and are cheap and sound that way. Magnetic cartridges give a more natural, musical sound to your record. You do not have to be an audiophile to tell the difference, simple tinny laptop speakers reveal the tale. See the link below..<br /> You must also download itunes to use the EZ vinyl tape converter. After recording you will be given an opportunity to list the artist, title and each track. The software senses the lack of sound between tracks and if there are four songs there will be four tracks listed for you to type in the names of each- intuitive and simple. Then the software converts your recording down to Itunes at 192kbps. They actually sound very good, better than I expected. One caveat, if your source vinyl has a lot of scratches, clicks and pops the sensing for tracks may not work properly and you may end up with fewer tracks listed, although all the music will be recorded. It just does not sense the breaks between tracks. This is a relatively unusual occurence however. There is no manual method to input track breaks or change settings for encoding.<br />  There is also included a more advanced type of software called Audacity, which allows you to do many things to your tracks, including how you wish to store, transcode and edit the audio itself. Very nice software.<br />  The turntable itself has a manual cue with a mechanical pickup and a hydraulicly damped lowering so as not to scratch your records. You really don't scratch your records when you pick the stylus up unless you slide it across the surface. A nice feature is that you can leave the recording unattended once you set it up and the tonearm will sense the end of the recording and return the tone arm to the rest automatically. Also the software sneses the end of the recording and will stop recording. There are 33rpm adn 45rpm settings on the table and a 45 adapter is included in a recessed cavity of the turntable body. Not a high end turntable, but respectable in what it does. There is also a \\"Stop\\" on the front which can be depressed to lift the tone arm and return it to the rest and shut the turntable off.<br />Pros-<br />  easy to use and great value<br />  Moving magnet cartridge, fairly light tracking force<br />  Very Good Sound quality<br />  Has built in pre amp great for connecting to non phono inputs<br /><br />Cons-<br />  Software has little fine tuning, you cannot select where tracks begin and end. Horrible for scratched old records.<br />  Straight tonearm, S arms track better<br /><br /> Conclusion, this is a wonderful turntable and software package for the price and really does a nice job giving you a lot of bang for the buck. I am sensitive to sounds and audio in general, and  like the turntable and software a lot. I have used this product to convert approx a dozen LPs into I tunes and just revised my review to lower it fo four stars. Software is weak and while the MP3 files sound great. While you can save your work as a cd the software does not allow you to fine tune where tracks begin and end- horrible for some of the noisy old records I find at the thrift store. In doing this I ended up with 1 or two track or else 25, when there may have been only 5. I did find software that allows great flexibility in this department- \\"Spin it Again\\" from acoustica software.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is awesome it is really good I had to carry the charger with me everywhere. that is how awesome
0545101417|5.0|Following up on the amazing The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins brings us back to Panem in 2009's sequel Catching Fire. In this volume, Collins expands the story beyond District 12, the Capitol, and the Arena, and delves deeper into the politics, culture, and history of the world. There's still plenty of action and excitement, however. I'll try to avoid spoiling anything from the first book below, but really, do yourself a favor and go read The Hunger Games now if you haven't already.<br /><br />Following her survival in the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is set to begin a victory tour of the Districts and Capitol of Panem. But the way in which Katniss won her Hunger Games has led to tension in the Districts, and the Capitol does not like to be challenged. Katniss is instructed to tow the Capitol line on her tour and help quiet things down. Between what we know of Katniss after the first book and the fact that the second is called Catching Fire, you can probably guess how that goes.<br /><br />This leads into the 75th Hunger Games. These games also happen to be the 3rd Quarter Quell, which occurs ever 25 years. Each Quell has a twist to the usual format of the games to remind the Districts who's in charge. This Quell's surprise is particularly brutal and unfortunate, and this also plays into the brewing dissatisfaction with the Capitol.<br /><br />As much as I liked the first book in this series, I think I enjoyed Catching Fire even more. The Hunger Games has more raw action, but the addition of more information about the setting, which shows us the true weight Katniss' action have on the world, the political tension, and the fact that we as readers care more about the characters who survived the first book only to face what they must in this volume - all of it adds up to a fantastic sequel.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of Catching Fire, read as the first book was by Carolyn McCormick. McCormick again delivers a strong performance, and I enjoyed her character voices, pacing, and ability to convey the drama.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a really fantastic book. The second part of a trilogy often feels like it's mostly transition, and while the story does move from conflict in the Arena to the conflict in Panem, it's done so well and keeps the stakes so high that Catching Fire keeps you glued to the page. I'm really looking forward to finishing the series up with Mockingjay and seeing how everything turns out. Collins has herself a winner in this series.character voices, pacing, and ability to convey the drama.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a really fantastic book.

B0056BU3I2|5.0|This movie is great! The director is a keeper, he knows the right feel for this franchise. I hope they don't change because they have a Hot item here and I don't think anyone else out there will get it right.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|This is just an amazing book! Action packed with a whole bunch of new characters The Son of Neptune is such a good read!!!!!!! It left you hanging and wanting more!!! That's why I just can't wat for the Mark of Athena. What's Annabeth going to be upto? Probably searching for her one true love Percy who, she hasn't seen since he disappered! Love is in the air!!!! And what will come of Jason and Piper and Hazel and Leo??? LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and  defintely adventure!!!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I like the pink color becaue it doesn't blend with other stuff, so I can see it when I sat it down.: )<br />I like the way the back folds into the line and lets it stand up by it's self, because I get to read hands free.<br />I am so glad that I purchased this extra piece for my Kindle.  I know if you choose to own one too, you will find it a very nice addition for your Kindle.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Insidious was insidious in the way it started off so slowly but after a while I was totally mesmerized by it. I was just watching it, not even intending to wait until the end, but it really got me hooked. The director, James Wan, is from Malaysia, and he is perhaps best known for his work on the Saw franchise. I haven't seen them, but imagine they would be much more violent than Insidious. Wouldn't expect the director to be so subtle in drawing you into the premise.<br /><br />The story is about a boy and his family who move into an old house that seems to be haunted. He is exploring the attic when he falls off a ladder and into a coma. The doctors say he checks out fine, yet he is in a coma. The paranormal activity ratchets up, with the mother convinced the house is haunted, but the father skeptical at first. Reluctantly he agrees to move to another house, yet the strange occurrences don't let up. An old friend of the family, a woman named Elise Reiner, is called to help. She reveals that Dalton is a Traveler, adept at astral projection. His father is also talented in that way, but he has suppressed the memory. The boy, Dalton, is trapped in a strange dimension called Further where lost souls and demons roam, looking for vacant bodies to inhabit, such as Dalton's. If he doesn't get back soon, he could lose his body to one of the malevolent creatures intent on doing harm with it.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story, because it works best if you don't know where it is going and let yourself slowly get pulled in. Patrick Wilson plays, Josh, the father. He was Nite Owl in Watchmen, and was also in Hard Candy with Ellen Page. His part wasn't written or directed so well, as he goes from skeptic to participant so quickly it seems sudden and forced.<br /><br />Elise Reiner: Close your eyes, Josh. Take a deep breath and relax. With each breath, let the life around you fade into the background. Just listen to the ticking of the metronome. Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead. The universe is deathless. It is deathless because having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man, by not advancing himself, stays the further ahead of himself.<br /><br />(That last part sounds like it came from the I Ching).<br /><br />Patrick Wilson was adequate, and I've seen him do much better in the other roles I mentioned. Rose Byrne is the mother. She was in X-Men: First Class and Bridesmaids. She does most of the heavy lifting, acting-wise.<br /><br />I think the director did a great job of building tension and drawing you in. It was very realistic and believable and when all the crazy stuff started happening, I got goose bumps fur realz. This kind of story, where one must go into the underworld and bring someone back, is one of the oldest stories around. Dante's Inferno, Orpheus, Ulysses, etc. I think that once it got going, it was almost a little too straightforward. Where was the twist?<br /><br />But nevermind. I've said too much, and don't want to spoil anyone's suspense, or suspension of disbelief. The Bottom Line is that it had a lot of style, was subtle but certainly frightening enough once it got going. It avoided most of the cliches of films from this genre. Like, usually they stay in the haunted house even though it is obvious that's a terrible idea. Too bad moving doesn't solve the prob:<br /><br />Elise Reiner: It's not the house that is haunted.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was hesitant at first, but this is pretty fun, and is a great time waster.  I can't wait to get to the higher levels now.
0061537934|5.0|I read this book a year ago and recommend it to all my friends with dogs.  It is a book that can span the range of emotions we feel in our daily lives.  I think of this book when I feel I am taking life for granted.  It is a great reminder to love the ones you have and take nothing for granted.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game u get so many games in just one app i love. this app i am so glad that i downloaded this app i so recemend it for everyone:D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get this game it is the best game in the world<br />to get the game you go to the appstore and search it
0307949486|5.0|I like thrillers and I like mysteries. My guess on the people who did not rate this book highly is that they may not enjoy the genre.<br /><br />For example: one reviewer complained that the prose was \\"artless.\\" I wouldn't judge a mystery thriller on that, I would look to a literature piece for haute phraseology.  In a mystery thriller I look for pacing, complications, interesting characters and plot twists.<br />This book satisfied on all counts.  Salander comes off as an original, unique, interesting character.  Blomquvist perhaps less so, but interesting enough.  The mystery on the island is riveting.  There are some disturbing sexual themes.<br /><br />I liked the set up: an island with a seemingly un-solveabe mystery.  As in an old fashioned Dorothy Parker or Agatha Christie novel it limits the suspect list.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained that the author described \\"too much\\" everything in the room.  Actually I LIKE being able to imagine a scene in my mind.  Too much modern fiction reads like a screenplay for my taste.  I PREFER having descriptive paragraphs.<br /><br />When the book was over I wanted more. I'm on book three right now.  Book one does focus more on Michael Blomquvist more than Salander.  The second book focuses more on her.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|\\"Castle\\" is an adventurous, humorous, and thoughtful look at a well-known-although-fictional murder mystery writer -- Richard Castle (played excellently by Nathan Fillion). Castle has become bored with Derek Storm, his hero of twenty-odd best sellers. Castle has killed off Storm in his most recent best-seller.  Castle needs inspiration for a new character to create, and he uses his friendship with the mayor of New York to get an assignment to follow seasoned homicide detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).<br /><br />Kate is rough and tough but somehow always feminine and mysterious. Kate 's mother was murdered when she was a teen, and that loss created the monster that became her drive to put bad guys behind bars and eventually solve her mother's murder.<br /><br />An unlikely friendship develops (a la Bones and Booth of the series \\"Bones\\"), and (of course) sexual tension and serious feelings run high. Through the seasons, Castle develops and grows as he sees the reality and horror of true crimes against the innocent and evil. Beckett develops and starts to push past her walls, occasionally allowing Castle a glance at the truly amazing woman behind the \\"iron curtain\\" of her personality.<br /><br />The series is greatly benefited by the amazing support cast,  Season Two has some fun paying homage to the Nathan Fillion Sci Fi Channel cult classic \\"Firefly.\\" Those who are fans of that show will especially enjoy this season's Halloween Episode.<br /><br />Anyone deciding whether to start enjoying this show, PLEASE do so. If you're a fan of cop shows but need a special twist, Castle will meet all your viewing needs!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really love how versatile the app is with the ability to view many different file types. The whole program is really easy to understand and use!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Paul has a LOT of past work to compare this CD to. Look at Martha My Dear, I Will, Rocky Raccoon, When I'm Sixty-Four, etc. Give P.M. a break! He's just going for the types of tunes he heard growing up with his Ma and Pa. It's fond Nostalgia for him and for many of his listeners. I think it's REFRESHING to hear rock n roll artists like Macca do the old standards and step out of the ROCK/POP BOX they have been in since 1964. Different is good! If you don't like this CD, You just must not like jazz/pop standards. Yes,...He has always featured 'cheesy' tunes in his set lists, either on album or in concert.<br />I have a bias here. I am a jazz radio DJ. Yes, we have this CD in our rotation. NOT ALL the tunes on the disc are 'spot on' and 'winners', but I can't think of hardly any artist who has a 'perfect' album anymore, or in the past for the most part. There are very few 'perfect' albums or artists.<br /><br />I LOVE that he went back to his musical roots! I love that he uses REAL JAZZ ARTISTS like Bucky and John Pizzarelli on guitar, Diana Krall on piano, etc. CHANGE IS GOOD. Not perfect, but over all, still good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was pleased that this was a FREE game for my Kindle. It is fun and very entertaining. I like having it downloaded so I can play anywhere. There are lots of levels so you dont get cheated just because it is a free game. Fun stuff!
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|I've had it for three months now and it is working as it should.  Four stars rating because the short cable puts a lot of strain on the socket.  Using extreme care is the only way to go.

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Fantastic insight into the autistic life and all its quirks. I understand my son much better because of this video.  I recommend this video to any family member/friend of an autistic child!
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC is a great band overall especially when they had their original singer: Bon Scott. This album is easily one of their greatest.

B002RI9SC4|5.0|I love this book! I love the entire Twilight series. I have enjoyed reading all of the books and am highly anticipating the final movie to come out. I had actually already read the entire series of books, but lost this book in particular. Being able to buy it from Amazon to go straight to my kindle was Fantastic! If you have not read the books and are curious if they are worth the read, I say YES! If you don't like love stories or stories about strong family ties and vampires, then don't read it, but if you do.......what are you waiting for?
B000654YRY|2.0|The real must-see Dire Straits concert video is \\"Alchemy,\\" a film of a 1978 show where the group is at their very zenith. It is fantastic, Hall of Fame stuff. \\"On the Night\\" is a sorry 15-years-later fake reunion (with only the original bassist returning to join Knopfler)along with a dozen mediocre session players cashing in on a giant stadium tour. The renditions are competent, and Mark always has his array of impressive licks, but it's just going through the motions here (although admittedly there's a bit of fire to the version of \\"Brothers In Arms\\"). I saw this tour when it came to the U.S. and was somewhat disappointed, but to see it in close-up now confirms my \\"they're only in it for the money\\" suspicions. The off-the-chart audience reactions seem to be photo-shopped from some much better show. If you're a die-hard Dire Straits fan, stick with \\"Alchemy\\" and you won't be sorry. They were a phenonmenal group then.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I'm baffled how any serious music fan could not love this album. I've enjoyed the albums by the Derek Trucks Band for several years, but I only recently discovered Susan Tedeschi. When I first heard her, I thought I had found Bonnie Raitt's long-lost cousin: a woman who can play guitar skillfully, and who has that special soulful voice. So, having Susan and Derek and band together for this album created very high expectations. And I really think they delivered the goods here. Some heartfelt, memorable tunes, backed by outstanding musicians. What's not to love? I'm thrilled that this album was a good as I had hoped it would be.
0375869026|5.0|Hands down, one of my all time favorite books. I'm 44 years old and I'm so glad I saw this as an employee favorite in the book store. This book is for everyone of all ages. You won't want to put it down!!
B000068PQ7|5.0|Ah, another great album by a great artist that STILL doesn't get the plaudits that he deserves. I only discovered this album in the past 6 months, but I play it frequently, letting these songs seep into my soul. And there are some amazing tunes on here: \\"The Virgin\\" ... \\"White Light\\" ... \\"For a Spanish Guitar\\" ... and a cover of \\"Tears of Rage.\\" The CD also includes 5 bonus tracks. That's a nice plus, but honestly I don't care for his version of \\"Stand by Me\\" ---not horrible, just totally unnecessary. But the rest of this album is mighty fine. Any fan of the Byrds or 70s singer-songwriters in the folk-rock or country vein should dig this album.
0765348276|3.0|Scalzi's brainstorming session for this book:<br /><br />I've got this great premise for a book about old people who are given new bodies to go fight an interstellar war...  But what should the plot be?<br /><br />--The explorations--both emotional and physical of having a second life<br /><br />--Understanding the shady special forces.<br /><br />--The implications of a soldier finding the body of his wife used to house another personality.<br /><br />--The moral implications of being forced to kill a variety of alien races that might not all be bad.<br /><br />--The repeated losses of old age. Losing spouses and friends during life then losing new friends during this second life<br /><br />--The rightness/wrongness of war.<br /><br />--The implications of drastic jumps in technologies that comes with meeting different alien races.<br /><br />--What does it mean to be human?<br /><br />Or..... I could do THEM ALL!  Sure--all of them will be shallow and barely discussed but so what!???!?<br /><br />I didn't dislike this book; the premise really carried it though the plot points but a bit of editing and focus would have turned this from \\"ok\\" to a real contender for a new science fiction classic.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great Show.  I never watched it on TV; bought it solely on its reputation.  It lived up to the accolades,excellent writing, acting and direction. However, the Commentaries (which I do listen to) give away some future plot points.  Very annoying to a new viewer.  Although you may need the Commentaries to find out who some of the main actors are,if you never watched it on TV, and if you intend to listen to the Commentaries, I would recommend watching the 13 episodes first and then going back and listen to the Commentaries. These Commentaries are pretty episode-specific for the most part, so it may be hard to remember exactly what happened in an episode that way, but it is better than having the future episodes spoiled to an extent before you get to them. Because there was so much going on in each episode, they were not completely ruined, but it would have been better if the future plots were kept under wraps as they said they were during the actual first season run, and talking only about that or previous episodes. I otherwise enjoyed the Commentaries, as they are very informative.
B004HNTER6|1.0|Very disapointed.  Move cam in Italian and unless I purchase a NEW DVD player for ALL regions I can't view it.  SO this was a waste of my money and I had to purchase a new one.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|This stand DOES fit your ipod or iphone.  It is handy and works easily to hold up your display.  Until you need to put on something that isn't perfectly level.  Or until you want to have your display stand up instead of laying horizontally.  Or until someone accidentally nudges the desk/table/stand/shelf/counter you have it sitting on.  Overall, if your just using this to watch your ipod instead of holding it on it's side yourself, it's great for you if you have an isolated spot for it and it's perfectly level.  If you are using this for any other application, avoid wasting the money.
1451627289|5.0|One of the best Stephen King novels I have read.  I have been riveted to the point I can hardly put this book down!  It is well written as it focuses on traveling to the past and the romance side is touching.
1849514003|3.0|With this \\"book\\" purchase, you are basically paying for example code that you more or less need to sift through in order to figure out what is going on.  The book itself offers very little instruction or learning beyond that of \\"here's something neat you can do in cocos and here's the code (you already have because it came with the book), but printed out (which itself is not very readable in the e-version)\\"  I found the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" it works to be fairly lacking.  That, combined with the fact that the code is difficult to read in the e-version makes the book itself also of limited utility.  Ultimately, you are paying for the code that accompanies the book.  As for understanding the concepts, it's back to scrubbing various online forums yet again.
B003INBNXO|4.0|I bought this movie on iTunes without knowing what it was all about. But I have to say that I was happy once I did see it. Of course in all movies there are some things that are \\"over-the-top\\", and this movie had its share, but I love to watch it, and I will continue to do so because there is plenty of Wing Chun action.
B00166QJRU|4.0|Excellent 2-track recording by the KMET team. This performance is more raw than the Ziggy Stardust Motion Picture. What you get here is mostly the 3-piece lineup of the Spiders From Mars. The wonderful lead guitar playing of Mick Ronson is out front in the mix, along with David's vocals. Of note, Mike Garson's piano on Changes is not buried way back in the mix like it is in the Motion Picture. Much better.<br /><br />This show has been amply reviewed, so I won't go into this song or that, except to say that they're all great! My only qualm with this release is pretty much the same problem I have with everything these days, the mastering is a few decibels too loud.<br /><br />Oh well. I'll save the lengthy essay on my contempt for 99% of the world's mastering engineers for my next review. Otherwise, I still have to give this 4 stars, simply because there isn't a lot of live Bowie out there, and the show is really good. It also comes with some tasty swag, some cards and a booklet.
0425241505|4.0|The book arrived quickly with Prime. Easy book to read, paints a thorough picture in your mind. At first I felt that the book was a little modernly explicit, a little dry, but it's a new genre for me, so I think I just hadn't yet adapted to it. The further I got, the less I was able to put it down and when I was finished, I had that usual disappointment that follows after I've read a good book and have reached the end. I hadn't considered purchasing the sequel at first, but now Storm's Heart will soon be in my book collection alongside this one.

B0055QYKQO|1.0|I have bought the new GA-990FXA-UD3 motherboard for my new system build to work with 3D. I've also purchased an AMD Bulldozer F-8120 Octa-core, 16Gigs of Corsair Vengeance 1600mhz Memory, an EVGA GTX 550TI 2Giga GPU and a SAPPHIRE 1050W PSU and two 500Gigs Western Digital SATA 3 Hard Drives.<br /><br />Everything is installed properly, but I can't install a new fresh copy of Win7 x64 Ultimate in RAID or AHCI mode. All drives that are on the motherboard CD-ROM and even the ones in Gigabyte's site don't seem to work.<br /><br />When I load the Win 7 installer, when it's time to choose the hard drive, it doesn't show (when the configuration in BIOS is for AHCI). I try then to load the drivers supplied, but I keep getting an message that says something like this: \\"You can't install non-supported drivers, because if my crash your system installation. Please refer to drivers that are assigned and approved, etc.\\".<br /><br />The same thing happens when I try to install the new OS on a RAID-0 system. In that case, the drives show, but there are no suitable drivers for the installation of RAID on the system.<br /><br />I've searched the web and found out that this a common problem with this motherboard.<br /><br />So I guess is up to you to decide, but that really was a let-down of the board for me.

073933705X|5.0|I just finished listening to the audiobook format of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas today. The story gripped me as few have before. This a holocaust story told from the point of view of two innocent nine year old boys from extremely different circumstances who manage to become friends (one a prisoner, one the son of a Nazi commander). First off, the story was incredible well-written and really felt like the thoughts and dialog of children, including siblings arguing, children trying to make sense of the grown-up world around them. The speaker in this audiobook was absolutely perfect, with his wonderful accent, and his use of voice for the various characters. In addition, the haunting music played at the end of some of the chapters added to the experience enormously. I will never forget this story, and it was moving and painful beyond words. Yet there was also beauty, tenderness, friendship, love and humor. I recommend this audiobook highly. For adults or mature adolescents. With only four CDs, it is a fairly fast \\"read\\" (listen) also.
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Being a fan of Johnny Depp and the writings of Hunter S. Thompson I was highly anticipating The Rum Diary. I was not deterred by the mixed reviews and was still quite syked to blind buy the Blu-ray on release-day.<br /><br />The movie is great! It is a lot of fun, smart, and highly entertaining to the right crowd. If you liked the substance of Fear and Loathing you may enjoy this. However if you were simply entertained by the dinosaurs in Fear and Loathing then you may not fully understand what was going on in that film or this one. Rum Diary is based loosely off a true story, yet it is still charming and informative. As other reviews have said, the first half is much more fun, and the second half begins to drive harder on the drama aspect of the story. Over-all I loved the film and was highly entertained. Fans of Thompson or Depp or the rest of the cast should not hesitate to check this one out.<br /><br />The supporting case also did quite well. I was especially impressed with Giovanni Ribisi and Amber Heard who even in their smaller roles still managed to impress and stand out. Giovanni's character was hilarious and I even found myself re-watching scenes to hear what he said for a chuckle. I never really noticed it in her other roles, but Amber Heard is gorgeous. The movie takes place in the mid-20th century and Heards outfits and style really fit well with her look. She moved up a notch in my book. Michael Rispoli was also very funny and the Depp/Rispoli team was quite entertaining as they went to cock fights and other little adventures. I still remember Michael Rispoli as Spinner in Death to Smoochy though.<br /><br />The PQ is breathtaking as the scenes of Puerto Rico are so very beautiful and the colors really pop. The image is very consistently sharp, crisp and clear. Even in the dark scenes the image still manages perfect contrast, clarity and depth.<br /><br />The AQ is very crisp and clean with remarkable dialog as well as music and ambient noises. I was impressed!<br /><br />Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. I loved it and I am glad I own it as while the movie starts on a fun note and ends in drama, there is a bit of magic in there which will bring me back for many more viewings in the future.impressed!<br /><br />Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this movie a chance.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried several other Bible apps for Android and have settled on using the YouVersion - Holy Bible.  The feature that I like the most is the Reading Plans.  There is a large variety of plans to choose from, and it is really simple to use.  I was also able to access the NASB translation for free (only with wifi access) enabling me to use it for reading, hilighting and notetaking.  It is also interesting to read others' notes on verses throughout the Bible (although one must be careful not to consider these comments as \\"studied\\" commentaries, but more like a Bible discussion in a study group...)<br /><br />This app, which has worked flawlessly so far for the last 6 months, has doubled the value of my Android phone (HTC Thunderbolt), allowing me to use the phone for something of REAL import... staying in God's Word.<br /><br />Thank you to the developers for such a great tool to help me be a better instrument for Jesus Christ!

0060558121|4.0|American Gods is the sort of book that you can tell is supposed to be Important and to offer some great insight into American culture.  But for the life of me I can't pin down just what that importance is.  And it's a look into Middle America, but it's cloudy, as if viewed through a smoky piece of glass.  I suspect people whose only view of Middle America is from above (and from fiction) will read it and say, `yes, it's just like that!' and people like myself who have lived in Middle America will read it and say, `no, that's not quite right.'  What's left is just a book full of beautiful prose and mediocre plotting.<br /><br />The premise of American Gods is simple.  Gods are created and draw power from the belief, worship, and sacrifice of regular people.  The various people who came to America brought their gods with them, subsequently forgot them, and then went on to create new gods (e.g., media).  But the old, forgotten gods remain.  They are left understandably put out by new gods replacing them.  (Oh, and there are manifestations for each god in each applicable country, hence they really are American Gods.  I think neither I nor Gaiman has any idea why arbitrary lines on a map make any difference to gods.)  The gods tend to call to mind the line from the intro to the old Kevin Sorbo Hercules TV show that \\"the ancient gods were petty and cruel.\\"<br /><br />Our protagonist, Shadow, is let out of prison after a three-year stint at the beginning of the novel.  With nothing to go home to, he accepts a job offer from a mysterious man.  A significant portion of the rest of the book is spent crisscrossing the US.  There are plot twists, but none that aren't either unsurprising or rather illogical.  One sub-plot is just sort of shoehorned in (I think we can see the roots of why this happened in the Q&A with Gaimon included at the end of the book).  For a book that is supposed to make you think, far too often thinking about it exposes gaping logical holes.<br /><br />American Gods reminds me of the work of Cormac McCarthy on a certain level.  It's not that it has much at all in common stylistically (it doesn't, and is much easier to read than anything I've read by McCarthy).  It's more a parallel to the line on McCarthy that he writes poetry as much as prose but his books aren't much for plot.  The writing here isn't quite as beautiful as McCarthy's (although again, it's easier to read), but it is certainly beautiful.  There is more to the plot than typical of McCarthy's work, but the plotting isn't the strength of American Gods and it meanders.  What American Gods lacks, at least to me, is the epiphany of sorts I always get when I finish a McCarthy novel, where I set the book down and just say, `wow.'  I think Gaimon was going for something similar here, and it seems a lot of other people had such a moment but to my frustration I did not.erican Gods reminds me of the work of Cormac McCarthy on a certain level.

1400079144|2.0|There is a certain fun in reading Dan Brown's stories. The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were unarguably intriguing and sometimes I even had a sense that maybe I've learned a thing or two. However, in The Lost Symbol the writing-style and story development was taken to the ne plus ultra of obnoxious. The story went on way too long and became more of a gaudy display of historic and conspiratorial theory. You could honestly read the first hundred pages and then the last hundred pages and not be lost or disappointed in the least.
1612130283|1.0|After all the hype I downloaded the book to my kindle. I describe it as a traffic accident. You don't want to look but you do out of curiosity. This book sets women back decades. If women think this is sexy being tied up and being a submissive then we have really set our standards very low. What is sexy about not be able to touch your partner and having them dictate what you can and can't do. I thought this was a piece of crap and I think that anyone who calls this a sexy book doesn't know how to enjoy sex!
0812550706|2.0|I have to say I didn't like this book as much as I had hoped. I know that this greatly puts me in the minority as almost everyone I mentioned I was reading this book to just LOVES it, but I guess it went over my head a bit. It's Science Fiction to the extreme (which is not a bad thing) but I found it difficult to fully follow what was happening and so the ending was a bit anti-climatic for me. In that it's such a classic though I think it's worth reading for one to form their own opinion on it -- who knows you may love it.

0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely engrossing! Each book pulls you helplessly into the next as you await to discover the fate of each and every character. It has suspense, drama, action, comedy and love story to boot. It's also a pretty easy read so bar some violence it's fairly appropriate for a wide age range. I was not disappointed and I'm sure you won't be either. This is a must-read!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I thought the ending was perfect! To bad Larsson is not around to see the success of these three great novels and would have been nice if he could have continued to write more... This trilogy has to be one of the best, in the mystery gernre, that I have read.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Don't mistake this book for literature.  It's a fun, quick read by a self-centered author who thinks we should have great interest in a few comic creations of hers.  Her own personal life is more interesting than her life in stand up comedy and broadcasting.  Her perseverence is impressive.  If you've got a couple of hours on an airplane, and aren't in the mood for something serious, this is worthwhile.  I read it more out of curiosity than the motivation of being a fan of SNL, or 30 Rock, which I've never seen.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is the best series since I Claudius.  Superb acting by the entire cast bolstered by a fantastic script.  Maggie Smith gets too many of the good lines, but is that really bad?  Oh could there be just be a Season three with same quality?

This does not include the Christmas special but, that is not a part of series 2 anyways... its its own separate entity... after watching the \\"cut\\" PBS Masterpiece editions that claim to be uncut and ARE NOT (also the editing of the PBS versions is terrible! very choppy!) and then watching this set I can now say I am glad I ponied up the extra money to buy this set... if you thought there was something wrong with the versions you watched and that there was something missing, you would be right! There is more footage across the whole series and it really makes it more amazing than I had already thought it was! I would compare it to the Lord of the Rings movies... The theatrical releases where obviously good but when the studios released the extended editions it was INCREDIBLE! That's this box set! It's the way it was meant to be seen! I call it Uncut, but for those of you who fell in love with the series on your local PBS station, you will be in for a real treat when you buy the \\"extended\\" editions! I hope you enjoy this series as much as I have!Enjoy!
B0073LJ61S|4.0|At first listen you may ask yourself, \\"did I hear what I think I heard?\\".  The answer is YES!  Van Halen is back in a big way, I have always been on the fence when it came to Sammy Hagar being in the band.  There is something about David Lee Roth that just puts the sound right, his voice isn't what it used to be.  But he still brings it and makes it work and now that Eddie is sober his guitar playing is as good if not better than it has ever been.  The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars was the fact that I really miss Michael Anthony.  His bottom end and great harmonies are the one thing that would have propelled this thing to another level, don't get me wrong.  Wolfgang is a good enough player, but I don't think he has the loudness, dexterity, or vocal chops that Michael has.  That said, this is a must buy for any classic heavy rock fan.  Makes me feel young again!
B005LAIH3G|4.0|The best thing about the movie \\"John Carter\\" is...John Carter. How rare it is to have for the main character a man who is actually a hero; a man whom one can root for; a man who is unafraid to make a stand against those who wish him merely to \\"comply.\\" Combined with the strong-willed Dejah Thoris, John Carter and his faithful Woola in the company of Tars Tarkas and his daughter Sola seek to change a world that is not-so-slowly dying from unwarranted tradition and gratuitous cruelty.<br /><br />Combining action, humor, amazing scenery, well-developed main characters, and a sense of wonder too lacking in modern cinema, \\"John Carter\\" transports us to a fantasy world that nevertheless is strikingly \\"real\\" to those who experience it with an open mind and an open heart.<br /><br />This is not a movie for cynics who diss any movie not led by an anti-hero. This is not a movie for the oh-too-sophisticated who disdain admirable characters and a rousing plot in favor of story-less meandering and disgusting souls bent on self-destruction. This is not a movie for those who have lost touch with hope and honor and honesty.<br /><br />The pundits have already written off this film as a \\"flop.\\" Perhaps \\"John Carter\\" won't be a blockbuster financially. But those who crafted this movie have a winner of an experience for those who appreciate an engaging cinematic experience.<br /><br />I'm hoping that positive word-of-mouth will make liars of those who condemn this film and that more episodes in this saga will be made. The world that is Barsoom and the hero that is John Carter deserve to have their stories continued and explored.<br /><br />I certainly have quibbles with parts of this movie, but rather than focus unduly on the superficial, the incidental, the trivial as avenues to attack this film's value, I prefer here to emphasis what is great about this movie and what makes it worthy of its viewers' time.<br /><br />I hope John Carter's motto -- \\"I still live!\\" -- becomes the reality for this movie and that the series will not die with a single film.y for this movie and that the series will not die with a single film.
B005FITIK0|4.0|\\"Sometimes in order to heal a few people have to get hurt.\\" When Mavis Gary (Theron) receives an e-mail about her high school boyfriends new baby she reads more into it then is there. She decides that he is still in love with her so she goes back to her hometown to win him back. While there she meets another former classmate and begins to re-examine her life. This is a movie that is not for everyone. While it is a comedy it's not really a laugh out loud/pee your pants comedy. I wouldn't quite call it a dark comedy although that is more accurate. This movie is done by the same writer and director of \\"Juno\\" so it's that type of comedy. Stuff you shouldn't laugh at and most of the movie you aren't sure if you should laugh or not. All that said I really liked this and the acting was fantastic. Patton Oswalt was great in this and I hope he gets more work like this character. I recommend this, but unless you have seen \\"Juno\\" it's hard to describe the comedy. Overall, a really good comedy that makes you laugh but feels weird when you do. I give it an A-.
0385342063|4.0|I've never read any Sophie Kinsella before. It's true. I'm not sure if it was the titles of her Shopaholic series that put me off, or if they were merely big at a time when I wasn't reading much chick lit at all, but one way or another I was never tempted to pick them up. After that. I likely relegated her name to that series alone and never investigated any further. Silly me. But. I began seeing reviews of her latest, I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER, popping up here and there. As far as covers go, I'm liking this one. I love the silhouettes, the text bubbles, and the font. More importantly, I think the cover overall accurately gives the reader a sense of what she will find inside--a phenomenon that seems to me to be becoming rarer these days.<br /><br />Poppy has, well, she's taken leave of her senses. In a moment of madness, she allowed her bridesmaids to pass around her engagement ring at a posh party in a London hotel. It (along with her cell phone) go missing in the fray, and Poppy is reduced to canvassing the entire hotel and menacing the staff into finding the missing ring. Alas, nothing turns up. But the frantic Poppy does spot a discarded cell phone in the hotel garbage. Utterly at her wit's end, she snatches up the phone in order to stay in contact with the hotel in the coming days, hoping they'll call saying her fiance's treasured family heirloom has magically appeared. But a wrench is thrown in the wheel of Poppy's mad machinations, when one Sam Roxton enters the scene saying the phone she found belongs to his former PA and he needs the information on it ASAP. Poppy convinces Sam to let her keep the phone just until the ring is found, promising to forward on any and all important messages and emails. And so a hilarious and awkward relationship is born. Poppy and Sam become inextricably linked through a near constant stream of texts and emails. Being the outgoing, curious girl she is, Poppy can't resist peeking into the insane business world Sam lives in. And for his part, Sam loosens his tie long enough to offer his help and opinions (welcome or not) on Poppy's tendency to be a pleaser and focus on everyone else but herself.<br /><br />I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER is a real charmer.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|\\"I'm ready to be a real husband and father, just wake up. Please Liz, just wake up.\\" Mike King (Clooney) is having a rough time. He is the trustee for his families land in Hawaii and is about to finalize the sale of it. He has two daughters he is trying to raise with thier mother and his wife in a coma. At the time he gets the news that his wife is for all accounts dead he finds out that she was also cheating on him. There are some movies that are so good that after you watch there really are no words to describe it. This is one of those movies. Anything I say may cheapen the way this movie makes you feel. I can say that Clooney did an amazing job in this movie. He plays a guy that is down on his luck and a type of \\"everyman\\"...and he makes it believable. For someone like Clooney to pull that off is amazing. Also the girl that plays his older daughter is absolutly wonderful and almost steals the movie. This is again a movie that needs to be watched but there are not enough words to describe why. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and I have to say \\"The Artist\\" must be amazing in order to beat this for best picture. I give it an A+
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is as advertised.  I use this at home, on my phone, and on my tablet.  sync is quick.  what more could you want?
B006P0FIGU|3.0|\\"I believe in us, till the day I stop believing in that there are still things in this world worth fighting and dying for. All for one and one for all!\\" After a conspiracy against the king is uncovered it is up to a group known as the Three Musketeers and a young man named D'Artagnan (Lerman) to stop Milady (Jovovich) and save the king and all of France.  As I have stated many times the way you feel about a movie is about 85% based on expectations. Usually you can say that a movie is better or worse then expected when telling people about it. This is the rare type of movie that is exactly what I expected. I thought it was gonna be boring with good fighting...and that's exactly what it is. The beginning and end are great but the story aspect is drawn out. I think that the main reason it felt that way is because this story has been re-done so many times that it begins to lose impact with every version. I don't really blame anyone for that but you can only do the same thing over and over before it becomes boring. Another example of Hollywood running out of ideas. Overall, not bad, not good, just OK. I give it a B-.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|\\"How's your thirst for adventure? Unquinchable Tin Tin.\\"  After buying a model ship Tin Tin (Bell) is approached by a stranger who offers to buy it from him. When Tin Tin refuses he is kidnapped and brought abord a ship. When a mutiny goes bad Tin Tin, his dog Snowy and the captain of the ship begin an adventure that could end up with a large, lost treasure.  My main reason for watching this was because it was a Spielberg movie. After about ten minutes I was hooked. This is one of the few family movies that is actually a movie that adults can watch without feeling like its a chore. The best way to describe this is that it is a cartoon version of \\"Indiana Jones\\".  The good ones, before Lucas added aliens.  This is a movie that I was looking forward to and was actually better then I expected. I recommend this for family night. Overall, a really good movie that a family can all watch together. I give it a B+.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|My wife ordered this movie on Netflix because she likes Johnny Depp( I also think he's a great actor btw). First warning sign that this movie would be terrible was that Angelina Jolie was in it. She has to be the most overrated actress currently active in the film world. I sat through the first twenty thirty minutes... and i couldn't stand watching this turd anymore. Angelina Jolie is not only a horrible actress but she looks like an emaciated corpse with a pair of collagen-implant-surgery gone wrong set of lips-the director should have just cast the remains of Rin-Tin-Tin instead of this walking corpse. Synopsis: don't waste your time...unless you are trying to fall asleep

B00006I53S|4.0|I consider myself a novice at best so I'm not completly privy  to the technicality. I do have to say the lens performed to my satisfaction while attending a composition class. It took some great shots and handled alot of shots using lower exposure settings. I used that while shooting at the lincoln memorial, world war memorial, and the world war II memorial. Only gripe I had was that the lens was very heavy compared to the 18-55 kit lens. I chose this lens because I wanted something to be a happy median between my kit lens and the big beast 55-250 lens.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I loved this game, UNTIL the update.  Game is fine, but now I am continuously interrupted IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING with annoying ads disguised as \\"rewards\\" for reaching a certain amount of points. Reward? Really?  What an insult!!!<br /><br />Three different times I was at a critical point in the game, about to rack up my score, when the game paused and an annoying pop-up flashed in my face. Reminds me of a golfer about to hit the ball when someone sneaks up behind him and screams in his ear.<br /><br />Geesh, even the free version is polite enough to wait until you're finished playing before it starts flashing ads in your face.<br /><br />I hope this gets fixed soon.  I have a feeling I'm not the only one who will sadly say goodbye to this once fun and entertaining game.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|The boys are ready for another bachelor party and this time beautiful Thailand plays host to the gang of irresponsible nitwits. It's Stu's turn to get married (Didn't he marry a hooker in the original film?) Jamie Chung plays his lovely Thai-American bride Lauren. Her parents are planning a beautiful wedding in Thailand. Stu invites his best buddies Phil and Doug to join him but this time the bachelor party will be dinner at IHOP. No more shenanigans for Stu. He has a conservative future father-in-law to impress. After what happened in Las Vegas, Alan is out of the picture until Stu is convinced to invite him along. Is Thailand ready for this gang?<br /><br />Alan promises to behave but an impromptu bonfire party for the guys at the beach goes wrong--very wrong. The guys are joined by Lauren's teeange brother teddy. Of course, the next thing we know, Stu, Phi and Alan wake up in a strange Bangkok hotel with no idea of what happened. They've lost Teddy but gained a monkey and somehow the mysterious Mr. Chow is with them. There is one more item of note in the room but I won't spoil the surprise.<br /><br />The humor quickly turns dark and even more raunchy and vulgar as the guys try to figure out what happened last night and desperately try to find Teddy who may be \\"lost to Bangkok\\" which must mean he'll never be seen again. The guys's fill in bits and pieces of their lost memories and end up with a Buddhist monk, a facial tattoo, a destroyed bar...should I go on?<br /><br />I felt bad for Thailand that such a silly movie was filmed in their lovely country. Although the wedding is taking place at a beautiful seaside area, the guys end up in a seedy and ugly part of Bangkok. I found several things distasteful about this film. The monkey is shown smoking and \\"works\\" for criminals. The item found in the hotel room that I have not mentioned specifically is such a major issue and it is taken lightly. It's bad news for that item to be there. Stu has unprotected sex with a Thai prostitute and there is no mention of consequences except that he \\"cheated\\" on his future wife and obviously has a thing for prostitutes. Be prepared for an extra surprise in that part of the story.<br /><br />Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow, a rather embarrassing character and a not very politically correct protrayal of an Asian character. Chow is something out of a bad comic book. Just looking and listening to him makes you want to cringe. Bradley Cooper is back as the pretty boy of the group. Justin Bartha has a smaller roll in this film as Doug.<br /><br />HANGOVER II could have made better use of the beautiful Thai scenery. The raunch could have been toned down. Alan is so much trouble yet he gets to come along and chaos ensures. The way the monkey is presented disturbed me and the whole story of the extra item in the hotel is unnerving because of the ramifitcations which are barely mentioned later. You have to watch the credits to see that pictures of the night that were taken to get some explanation of the mysterious item. HANGOVER II was terrible and I am sure HANGOVER III is on its way,
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this product. I have lost weight and I am noticing some definition in my arms.<br />One of my coworkers asked me what was I doing to lose so much weight. I told her about the workout. I love the different levels she offers. It gives me a variety. If I dont feel like working out I do level one. If I am up for the challenge level 3. I loved this workout so much I ordered her Extrem Shred and Banish Fat.
B00454U1NS|4.0|This CD has a lot of good songs and I love Pink's vocals. I don't mind swear words in the lyrics as long as it integrates with the song. A good example is \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\". However, in Pink's case the swear words seem to be written in specifically for shock value. \\"Perfect\\" is a good example of this. This is a great song and the profanity actually distracts from the flow of the song, it doesn't add value. This isn't the case in all of her songs but I don't understand why she is so dependent on this type of language. Her voice is fantastic and she doesn't need to rely on gimmicks and the profanity often feels like a gimmick in her music. Maybe she'll grow past this phase but who knows. It's still a great CD with a ton of good music and superb vocals. Highly recommended.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I never heard of Leonard Cohen??  But the other night I heard his new cd on the radio.  I liked what I heard very much so I ordered it.  Now that I have it, I love it.  I am going to dive in and order I'm Your Man since everybody raves about that one too.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is such a good movie that I'm sure it's one we'll watch many times. Two very strong characters, portrayed by two outstanding actors, build a working relationship that makes both better people. The fact that the story is based on true events makes it even more powerful.
1451627289|5.0|Yes...I cried at the end...and it was a good thing. My heart was touched.<br />This book has it all...and I loved it. Who would have thought King would actually write what could be looked at as an epic \\"love story\\"....but with sooo much action and mystery going on throughtout!!!<br /><br />I have always been a huge fan and have read almost everything....but this one will now rate at the top of my list. What an awesome book. Yes...don't get me wrong. There were some ugly bloody parts...but they actually \\"fit\\" the story...not just there for the sake of being there.<br /><br />I know a great many people who won't pick up a King book for fear of being scared to death by ugly horror. They have no idea of the serious storyteller he can be. I have noticed that over the most recent years he has been finding an even richer voice.<br /><br />If you are even considering reading this book...even just for the historic aspect of it...Do It!!<br />Mr King....this is my all time favorite yet. Not many books can make me sit and cry at the end. Thank You!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|So I had a real hard time describing what Real Player One is about to my friends...but here's what I've come up with:<br /><br />· Imagine a time in the not-so-distant future when RPG games have become so amazing that you're basically playing them with holodeck like realism<br /><br />· Imagine further that the virtual universe was created by a guy who LOVED everything about the 80s...so much so, in fact, that he created entire worlds/sectors that are all Star Wars...all Lord of the Rings...all Star Trek...no magic...all magic, no tech...no magic or tech, etc.<br /><br />· Now imagine further that the guy created a Quest in that universe, and as part of his last will and testament, he declared that the winner will take his entire estate and fortune, which includes ownership of a company that created the virtual universe.<br /><br />· And finally imagine that millions of people are trying to solve the clues he left behind, which requires very detailed knowledge of all things 80s related, including knowing about 80s movies, arcade games, etc......and among the millions vying for that prize is one very determined and (pretty evil) corporation that wants to take ownership of that virtual world and monetize it, and suddenly the stakes become life and death, both virtual and very real.<br /><br />· and there you have it.<br /><br />Ready Player One.  An extremely well-written, fast-paced, geek-nirvana book.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this book for my book group.  I would probably not have chosen it myself as the descriptions of the story seemed vague to me but I found that I loved reading it once I started.  This book grabs you and pulls you into it's world from the very beginning.  I love the way the author writes, making the places and characters come completely alive.  I love the descriptions of the circus and found the story quite interesting.  It's very fantastical and some members of my book group found it \\"too out there\\", but I loved it.  I think those who tried to read it quickly missed a lot of the beautiful descriptions.  It is a book to get lost in.  It is different and interesting and at heart a beautiful love story.  Savor every word.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the first book in long while that carried me to another time. I have been an avid fan of Stephen King and I have read several books that didn't stand up to The Stand, The Shinning, The Green Mile and Bag of Bones.  I'm happy to say that this current book  made me believe in the writer again.<br /><br /> Having been a young adult during those years memories came flooding back of the era. But I was also reminded of the things we tend to forget.

B0015DRPJU|4.0|Life's never been simple for dhampir Rose Hathaway. Now, while mourning the loss of her long-time friend, Mason, and contemplating her upcoming graduation, things are more complicated than ever before. And when you add in her undeniable love for fellow guardian and instructor, Dimitri Belikov, Rose's life at St. Vladimir's is just downright insane. And about to get much, much worse...<br /><br />I wasn't sure I was going to care much for Rose when I first started this series. She's headstrong, she's crabby, and she has the tendency to blow off anyone who doesn't agree with her. Even more so when she knows they're right. However, these are the traits that, if developed and used properly, will make her into an exceptional guardian in the future. I have to admit, although she's still a bit headstrong and inflexible, she's learned a lot and has grown even more over these first three novels. In Shadow Kiss, she's forced to face reality on more than one occasion and learn to deal with - and even accept - the kind of horrible things that happen in her world. Not an easy road for a seventeen-year-old, even if she is half-vampire.<br /><br />Dimitri, despite himself, really starts to loosen up around Rose and lets more of the real him show. I really enjoyed getting to know Dimitri better and learning just a touch about his non-guardian side. He's the quintessential guardian - he's strong, dedicated, and he's learned to put all else second to his charge, no matter how tempting that distraction might be. To allow Rose into his life like he has, even knowing that it's the last thing any sane guardian would do, takes a lot of courage - and trust in Rose's abilities. I know he's the major reason for her successful progression as a guardian. His belief that she can do and be all they expect of her forces her to focus and prove Dimitri right. They make a great team when they work together.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss is an excellent follow up to Frostbite, carrying on the story and pulling the reader deeper into the world of the Moroi and dhampir. You learn a little bit about everyone in this third installment and you can definitely find growth across the board with all the major characters. I loved how the author took time to focus some on Lissa's use and development of her spirit magic as well. I am very excited to move on to the next book in the series, especially after the shocking ending of this one!<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS YA Reviewsing the reader deeper into the world of the Moroi and dhampir.

B001HN69AY|4.0|I found this entertaining as well as confusing...at times. It had hints of other things Heath had starred in and ended rather sadly. Something you need to have seen in other films, but one you would definitely find interesting.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|This series is one of the best series of books that I have had the opportunity to read. George R R Martin is a genius. If you enjoy fantasy books about Kings and Queens and Knights, you will love this series of books. I am patiently waiting for the final two books. Check out Game of Thrones on HBO. The second season starts April first.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is an excellent series.  It reminds me of the old Upstairs Downstairs, but it is not limited to just where they live.  The World War I scenes were very realistic.  Am glad that there is going to be a third season however will be surprised to see what happens.  I highly recommend this.

B005L12SH6|4.0|I can't say that I'm a great fan of EWF, but I am a fan of good music, and this group has some very good music that I still have yet to discover.  I didn't expect such an expansive catalog of albums when I opened that box. I must say that the digital remastering job is superb, and the sound quality couldn't be better. In the box, a good amount of info is provided, as well as a couple albums that weren't included (as far as I remembered) on the description.  I remember my dad buying Powerlight on LP, then later, the Heritage album.  Seeing and hearing these again brought a smile to my face, especially being in the crisp, clear sound that was provided by the digital experts who put their genius to use on this project.

B002RKSZWG|5.0|I'm thrilled that this book remains a perennial favorite, despite the theme.  These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.<br />By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.  Great casting throughout.

0062082353|4.0|Chris, with the help of others, has written a engrossing auto-biography about his experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. I really appreciate his attention to detail even to the point of his concise explanations of military acronyms such C0. In the earlier portions of the auto-biography Chris details his various equipment choices including firearms and tactical gear. Chris's wife Taya has also written for the book in the attempt to explain her experiences that I'm sure are shared among countless more brave women across this country. Chris's candid admission of loving war above and beyond his own family and children was a shock to me in some ways but in a different respect I'm not shocked at all. His attitude reminds me of Jeremy Renner's character in the blockbuster movie \\"Hurt Locker.\\" The man shares the same complicated psychological love of war. Their love translates into an addiction to killing. This is a hard issue to tackle because in one respect you don't want a grown man to shirk his responsibilities to take care of his wife and children to the utmost of his abilities but at the same time if men and women stand by and do nothing (as often is quoted) then evil will triumph thus robbing us all of the freedom to have the opportunity to live a respectable and peaceful life. If you have a love for country, firearms, and case studies into a soldier's psyche, read this book.

There are funny little featurettes, deleted scenes and every disc has its own gag reel. No seriously. EVERY DISC HAS ITS OWN GAG REEL. Worth it just for that.<br /><br />I love this show, the packaging and content is great, just buy it already.

Practice makes perfect!<br /><br />The clear plastic is of good quality, but don't expect it to be indestructible. I've dropped mine several times onto carpeted floor with no dings or scratches so far. I'm not so sure it would be the same story on a hard kitchen floor.<br /><br />Wish there were more toys like this when I was a kid!<br /><br />P.S. I totally bought this one for myself.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the specialized studies. I'm currently doing 3 simultaneously (one for the second tme). This app is highly recommended.
0307946711|5.0|It takes excetional talent to weave two lives through a series of changes. The book has all of the earmarks of a book that reads wondrously from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Just brushing the surface of this powerful and useful app.  Love it's integration capabilities with multiple devices.  Really strongly recommended.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Michael Connelly has a written another \\"can't put down thriller\\" in his Detective Harry Bosch series.  Connelly has the ability to tell his story in a way that becomes addictive.  Once you get hooked on his stories, you can't wait for the next release because the characters become your friends.  Another home run by Connelly.<br />JRC3
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie is shown so seldom on regular TV, I decided to buy it for myself. Having been a part of the generation that grew up with The Lads from Liverpool, this purchase was a slam-dunk!<br /><br />The quality of the visuals are better than I remember in the cinema way back when and the music is sensational.<br /><br />When I'm down about the state of the world here in 2012, I simply put this on and via my own DVD, have the closest thing to Mr. Wells' Time Machine available to mankind. I must add, however, my kids that are now in their mid-30's, are bored to tears watching this, so it is truly in the eye of the beholder, I must suppose.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really liked the game but the idea about buying the games with your points......I don't like...,..they should. give all the games at once
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish.  Can't wait to read the others.  I hope they are as good.  Can't wait for the movie also.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|An album can not be a classic out of the gates. It needs to withstand the test of time. This will be one of those rare albums that will be/should be a Classic. It's AMERICAN music personified. Rather than Wrecking Ball, it could be named Made In America. Woody Guthrie would be proud.
1451627289|5.0|I've recommended it to everyone and bought it for 2 other people.  I chose it as a selection for my book club and they all loved it.  I felt like I was actually in those historical times and places and could watch events unfold up close.  What a way to look at the ramifications of \\"what if\\" and to see into the mind and personal life of one of our country's most infamous villains.  When I finished the book I had to remind myself that it was mostly fiction.  (And I loved how he handled the ending!)
B005BDZN62|5.0|I bought this video for my dad for Christmas.  He had told my mom that it was his favorite musical - he really liked it when I presented it to him - he and I watched it that day.  Very nice.
0156034565|1.0|I love to read and fly fish, and Thought this would be the perfect book.  Worst book I have ever tried to enjoy, save your money go to the movie.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|very nice product, the size is just right to carry the kindle fire in my purse, so glad that I purchased it at the same time.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|Chris Gardner (Will Smith) lives in a cheap rental apartment with his partner, Linda (Thandie Newton), who is the mother of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Gardner works as a salesman and is trying his hardest to support his family, but nobody wants to buy his bone density scanners. Bills are piling up, the rent is two months behind, and his landlord is running out of patience.<br /><br />Gardner's world changes when he has a chance encounter on the street with a stockbroker. The man owns a flashy car and Gardner notes that everyone walking out of the office building seems happy. He decides to apply to Dean Witter in an attempt to solve all of his problems.<br /><br />Getting the attention of his potential employer is not easy, but the film, which is set it 1981, uses a Rubik's Cube to demonstrate Gardner's intelligence. Gardner manages to share a cab with a Dean Witter employee who is in a position to recommend him for an interview, and he solves the puzzle of the Rubik's Cube during the journey. That leads to an interview, but Gardner is arrested for non-payment of parking tickets the night before. He turns up for the interview covered in paint and without a shirt. It's a great scene with a lot of humor and Gardner somehow passes the interview.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story and shows a typical struggle of a man trying to make his way in the world. You might compare it to It's a Wonderful Life in many ways. Linda eventually decides to leave Gardner, but he insists that Christopher will stay with him. It's here that the film stands out. The relationship between father and son is the very heart of the film. Gardner tries to support Christopher, but money is always a problem. The pair are forced to endure some rough times, but Christopher trusts his father and rarely complains.<br /><br />I think Pursuit of Happyness was a breakthrough role for Smith. We already knew that he could pull off action roles and comedy, but he had to show considerable range to play Chris Gardner. The performance earned him an Oscar nomination and it was truly deserved.<br /><br />It's interesting watching Gardner claw his way up while he serves his internship. His dual role as a father limits the time he can spend working and studying, but he makes the best use of what time he has available. Jaden Smith was effective as Christopher, though I wonder how much acting was necessary when your on-screen father is your real father.<br /><br />Director Gabriele Muccino did a good job of focusing on Smith's emotional side and I found myself fully-invested with Gardner's struggle the whole time.<br /><br />The film makes me wonder how many people are quietly struggling through similar problems every day. In the current economic climate, things are even tougher than they were in 1981. What would you do to ensure that your family is able to survive? Taking two or three jobs is an option, but that places a strain on you and on all of your relationships.<br /><br />How do you define happiness? Is it enough just to be able to survive? I've explored this theme in a number of reviews and it's highly relevant here. I don't think Gardner was simply pursuing money and career success; he was taking care of his child. Maybe it's important to feel like you are making the most of your abilities? Pride in your performance is one measure of success, and so is spending time with the people you love. I think The Pursuit of Happyness explores a number of important themes. The definition of happiness is subjective. Do you know what your own definition would be?e to play Chris Gardner.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this review is a little rediculous but everything else about evernote is legit. I love how I can just use Spanish and it tells me if I spelled it wrong without even having to switch the language
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I found this second book in the series thoroughly enthralling, couldnt wait to be able to keep reading, kept me guessing all the way through. I really like the way that the books in the series follow on from each other. I find this  book better than the first and I am sure the 3rd book will be just as good
B004XCUEXY|5.0|Bought this for my nephew,not only did he receive it earlier than expected but LOVES the blue ray! Great video for music lovers, Foo Fighter fans!
B005OYKI1I|4.0|well worth the cash... loved it in theaters and just had to buy the blu-ray. i cant wait for the sequals.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Such a great talent. I was surprised when I listened to it the first time. If all of her music continues like this I  will always be a fan.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Went to see this movie in the theater and end up paying 32 dollars for this trash. This movie was so bad that halfway through the film, I felt embarrassed for paying money to watch this.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|I've played this game a few times and got bored quickly. It is no comparison to Bejeweled, a much better and engaging game.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|there are plenty of times when I'm playing against the computer it doesn't give me the points I score..other than that its ok.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I am a fan of Jon Krakauer works. So I had to see this movie when it came out. In some ways I am happy Christopher lived life on his own terms. It takes a lot of guts and determination to do what he did. But in the end I am sad he died.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I could watch this concert every week for the next 5 years. The sound quality is excellent, the video is for the most part good,, but it is a  concert, not a screen production. What i really like is the fact that the instruments really complement the vocals. His doo-whop singers are great, especially Sharon Robinson. I first saw the concert on public TV and knew I had to have it.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Ordered this for my grandkids for Christmas. They like to build the obstacles. This at least gets them thinking about how to make something instead of just pushing a button to knock stuff down on a digital screen.
B000066SBB|5.0|Aretha as we have grown to love her. This import double disc has all great hits of the queen of soul. It's a must have for her fans.
B005K17RU0|4.0|easy to read, quick and as accurate as weather can be. would recommend it to everyone whether at home or on the go
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This was one of those games you think is gonna be disappointing and boring.but never judge a book by its cover because I was very impressed by this game, very fun and addicting, two thumbs up, or in this case, 5 stars : )
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Good book.  Several twists to the plot. Close to what he would have written had he lived to finish it.  Will be interesting to see if a sequel follows.
