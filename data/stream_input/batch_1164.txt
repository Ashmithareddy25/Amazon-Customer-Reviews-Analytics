B004INNRFK|5.0|This is a terrific CD & DVD set. There is a large variety of memorable hits by David Foster and many talented artists.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I cannot recommend this series highly enough. The cast is wonderful, the stories charming and thoughtfully acted out and written.  It is really a treat, but a shame that there are so few episodes.  Fortunately there are four excellent seasons to treat yourselves to!
1400110335|4.0|The book presents the impact of financial systems and innovation on world history.  Although finances are not the only factor that shape events, they can have a pivotal or enabling influence on key events.  In short, the author argues that financial history is worthy of consideration and study verses the knee-jerk reaction of some that financiers are to be distrusted and maligned.

0071762345|5.0|First, I was fortunate enough to receive an advanced copy of the book. Dave's book is chock full of great and useful information. As someone who works in social media marketing, I initially thought this book would be like the dozens of other social media marketing books, which all just state the same vague statements. Boy, was I wrong! Dave does a great job of cutting through all the marketing jargon and vague statements, like \\"create content\\" and \\"have a social media strategy.\\"<br /><br />The book showcases how you can harness and extend the power of word of mouth marketing via listening, engaging and being authentic on social media. The large amount of real-life examples and case studies, from many different sectors including pharma, government and retail, really help to back up each point.<br /><br />While this book is definitely more suited to beginners, even the most skilled social media marketer could learn a few things from Dave's insights. Overall, a fantastic read!
0071762345|5.0|I've been following Likeable's blog for a while now, so purchasing a book written by the company's CEO was a logical progression.    On the whole, this truly is a fantastic resource for business owners (small and large) who are interested in utilizing social media platforms to increase their brand awareness and customer engagement. Dave does a great job at giving you not only a thorough theoretical understanding of why it's important to cultivate genuine and long-term relationships with your customers online, but also concrete and actionable tips and tricks on how to do so. Each chapter ends with guidelines that will help you identify how the chapter's content applies to your particular business and/or organization, which I found particularly valuable. Filled with fascinating case studies and SPECIFIC tips on how to make your brand more \\"likeable\\", this book is an absolute must-have!

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|The blu-ray version of Tron Legacy looks amazing and I'd still buy the disc for the movie alone. However, if, like me, you also buy blu-rays and DVD's for the extras, you'll be disappointed with this one. Unlike the original Tron DVD/Blu-ray, the extras here are sadly lacking. There's perhaps an hour (max) of extras - if you want more, you'll have to download an app to your iPad or PC and run it simultaneously while the movie runs in your player.    Really? To me, that's cheap. Many other movies (including Disney's Pixar releases) include picture-in-picture and branching extras but apparently they couldn't be bothered to do this with Tron Legacy. My only hope is that they used the disc space they saved on the extras and used it to provide the best possible image quality on the movie instead.    So I give this 5 stars for the movie and 3 for the cheap extras.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I'm a big fan of the game on PC, but this is just a terrible effort at porting it to android. It's huge and bloated, slow to load, and it doesn't play well at all with other applications. Don't try to take advantage of any multitasking while playing this. I recommend supporting some of the developers who are creating great and we'll written android games instead of sloppy ports like this (and Chuzzle). Shame on you, Popcap.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Although this movie only received 3 stars by the newspaper reviewer in our area, I took our children to see it at the movies when it came out.  I loved the movie when I saw it, but do not like to buy too many movies.  My son later asked me for the movie as he is reading the book series and really like the movie.  He normally watches a movie once and that is it, but he watched this one twice already at home!  It is worth every penny of the price.
B001POX73C|5.0|Kitty Charing has lived all of her life under the protection of her eccentric guardian uncle.  He has decided that in order for Kitty to inherit she will have to marry one of his nephews.  Kitty is not completely against the idea, as long as the right one proposes.  She has set her heart of Jack Westruther who has no present inclination to be forced into any kind of marriage, being a dreadful rake and flirt.  In an act of desperation she convinces her honorable cousin Freddy Standen to pretend to be engaged to her in an effort to make Jack jealous.  Things do not go as smoothly as planned for Kitty as she has a lot of lessons to learn about life and love.       I have enjoyed reading Georgette Heyer novels in the past because her plots are always so much fun to read and she has such a wonderful way of making Regency England come alive.  I found that I enjoyed this one the best so far out of the ones I have read by her.  The characters really do sparkle off the page, they are clever, funny and eccentric.  The dialogue was also at times so funny I found myself chuckling.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  As with any Georgette Heyer novel the descriptions of gowns and clothes were so vivid I could imagine what each character was wearing.  I can't say enough just how much I enjoyed reading this book it truly was charming, funny and delightful.

B000JQUZCI|4.0|I have seen the numerous reproductions of the Frankenstein theme and I felt like I was rather familiar with the plot. Recently, I realized that I am a bit ashamed that I have yet to read this book for myself since along with Dracula it is considered such a classic horror story.  I was so surprised as I started reading this book to find that all of the things I had thought about the story were actually wrong.  This book is not so much about horror as it is about the basic human emotion for love and acceptance that we continually search for, and while the movies touch on this theme a bit the book is mostly about this thought.  In a sense it is not so much horrifying as it is sad and disturbing, but the brilliance of the story is that it really makes you step back and look at yourself and what it means to be human.<br /><br />A Swiss medical student, Victor Frankenstein, discovers the secret of life and decides to build a man from various corpuses.  He becomes horrified by what he creates and runs away from what he considers a monster.  The creature suffers from a fair amount of confusion and neglect and begins to see himself as a terrifying monster.  He is incredible smart and is able to teach himself language and means of communication through watching a poor family.  He discovers the truth about his identity and begins to seek revenge on his creator.  Through a series of tragic events Victor Frankenstein chases his creation around the world meaning to rid humanity from it.<br /><br />It is easy to see why this book has stood the test of time.  For the time period that it was created in, I can see why people were so interested in reading it because even today it raises a lot of questions and it is so original.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|I got this case a week ago and its not exactly what I thought it would be, but its still good. It only took 2 days for Amazon to ship it, which is good. Its a rubber case, the whole thing. Its not a hard rubber or plastic. The whole case can bend and twist. Which is not a bad thing, but Im just answering questions I had before I bough this. It looks like their is a line that goes along the side of the case, maybe a front and back that snap the iphone in the middle. No. Its a single case. You have to push the bottom of your phone into the bottom of the case and then work it up the sides and pop the top of the case over the phone. It has a nice fit and is not loose at all. BUT there are some loose parts. The strip that goes above the dock connector and volume switches is thin and is a little loose, but it does not bother me too much. The case does get finger prints but you can just wipe it off. Same with dust. Although, when its in my pocket, none of the lent in my pocket stuck to the case. Something else you are asking your self is, \\"does the screen protector peal up when I put the case on?\\". The answer to that is NO. At lease for me. I put the case on with the factor front and back screen protectors that came with the phone and those were safe(I cut off the little tabs at the bottom and around the camera on the back). Then I've been taking the case on and off to put my new screen protectors on as they came in the mail and none of them pealed. The case did not stretch out at all with all this taking on and off I did. Heres some PROS and CONS.    -PROS-  - great item for the price range.  - has a some of the case go over the screen to make sure the screen does not touch the surface of a table if you lay it down like that.  - good cut outs for the different ports and buttons.  - color of the smoke looks good with the phone and you can still see through it.  - nice fit and not too loose  - comes with a screen protector that goes on easily and mine did not leave any bubbles    -CONS-  - does leave some finger prints  - dust collects in the cut outs(a lot in the apple logo cut out)  - those two thin strips move a little.  - on my case, the left side shows more of black edge of the phone than the right side. Like its been shifted left(not that big of a deal)      Other than that, this is a great starter case and works well for anyone. It has a nice look and fits well. With only minor problems (to me, my opinion. Might be different for you). But if you just got your iPhone 4 and want a nice case to protect it that also comes with a screen protector, then this is the case for you!   If you think this review was helpful for you, you can check the yes. And if did not think so, then leave a comment if their is still a question you have that I did not answer.
0345529057|5.0|I discovered the series because of the HBO show and after about three episodes I needed to buy the books! Cleverly written, full of suspense and intrigue, and wonderfully complicated developed characters! I feel like I'm in Westeros whenever I'm reading! I'm already on the third book and I've only had the set for a couple weeks (these are long books: roughly a thousand pages a piece). I can't put them down! There are many characters- which at first was hard to keep track of- but once you get into the rhythm of the story you can catch on. Also there's appendixes of the families and houses in the back of the books to help keep track of who's who. For under twenty bucks for the first four books of the series- this is a STEAL! I highly recommend it!
B003THHIEM|5.0|The actors perform flawlessly, the characters play well off each other.  Great writing, plot twists come at the right times.  Just enough action.  A great blend of comedy, suspense, action and pathos.  Best series to come along in years.
1433502410|5.0|I have read through the ESV four times in the last six years and all I can say is that it is a great translation, the best. I have read extensively the NASB, KJV, NKJV, NIV and I find that the ESV is as accurate as any, and as elegant in style as any. Getting yourself a good interlinear old and new testaments and comparing the original language to the ESV will answer all your questions. You will find that it is a highly accurate translation, not perfect. If you are looking for perfection then by the hebrew and greek transcripts. Anyway, this is a great study Bible.

6304711905|4.0|Charlton Heston makes this worth seeing and I think it was his last film.  Russell and the gang have fun in this cartoon like movie.  You will have fun too but don't expect an even vaguely historically correct timeline or presentation.  Clothing costuming is excellent (yes, the Earps OFTEN wore suits since the Earps were NOT buckaroos) but obviously some cowboy action people took a hand in the leather chosen and used which often exceeds the time's leather use.  Shotgun shell holders were rare then and most folk just had two in the barrels and two more in a pocket of their swallowtail.  Walking around strapped with 5 extra pounds of leather in the Arizona summer was not exactly their true style and many just stuffed their bidnesses into their pants or voluminous pockets.  But it is fun, sort of a western in the tradition of Big Trouble in Little China meets cowboy action shooting...Kilmer's great performance to Russell's straight man makes the movie work.

WELL, I WAS SO FILLED WITH HIS WONDERFUL MUSIC THAT I STOOD UP  (WE WERE IN THE 7TH.

B0052OWGYW|4.0|Okay, as of late I have been stuck on period pieces, romantic movies and TV shows with hot vampire guys.  I was glad to get a break from my normal girly stuff.  I really enjoyed the action, the espionage genre depicted (although somewhat fantastical), the subtle comedy, and (yes) the \\"kick-a**-ed-ness\\" of it. Jason's acting is as usual...come on, what did you expect.  However, it was nice surprise (as I didn't read anything about this movie cause my husband picked it out) to see Ben Foster and Donald Sutherland give the movie some much needed quality acting.  For all you girly girls out there this movie is fun to watch...give it a try and make your significant-other happy.
B004UXUSIM|4.0|Woody Allen started off his filmmaking career with comedies, then swung to Ingmar Bergman influenced \\"serious\\" movies, but lately Allen has found a nice balance between the two, at least in \\"Midnight in Paris.\\"<br /><br />Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is an American hack screenwriter in Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachael McAdams). Gil is worried that he's missed the literary boat by not trying for art and writing a novel while living in a garret and suffering for your art. Gil is in love with the nostalgic history of Paris and the 1920's \\"lost generation\\" of Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and visits to Gertrude Stein's (Kathy Bates) salon and feels he was born in the wrong era. On a walk through the streets of Paris at midnight he's picked up by a car full of revelers and they whisk him off to a party, and finds himself being serenaded by Cole Porter (Yves Heck), and talking literature with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), and they whisk Gil off to meet Hemingway and soon Gil is showing his novel to Gertrude Stein!<br /><br />This is every writers and/or artists fantasy, and Allen pulls it off masterfully. From capturing the sights and feel of Paris, to giving life to the period pieces of the fantasy. All the actors turn in fine nuanced performances that let you buy into Allen's fantasy. Nobody but Woody Allen can write the kind of dialog Allen can, in another writers hands the dialog would seem fumbling and tangential.<br /><br />All the characterizations are spot on, the actors even look like the people they're supposed to be, Kathy Bates as Stein almost steals the movie, and Adrien Brody's Dali is a humorous cameo. The only characterization that is a little off is of Hemingway. Allen's Hemingway seems like it's everything you've ever read about Hemingway in a condensed version. One minute Hemingway is pontificating about Zelda's envy of Scott Fitzgerald's writing (as correct as the assessment is) and the next second asking who wants to box.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a nice fantasy, and an interesting alternative to all the super hero movies of this summer..    \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a nice fantasy, and an interesting alternative to all the super hero movies of this summer.
0307595579|5.0|I so enjoyed these books I still have the last one to read and also the one about   Stieg Larson.  Too bad he passed, the books were so intense it was hard to put  down.

B0048LPRCS|4.0|Oscar, a likeable foreign drug dealer living in Tokyo with his stripper sister, Linda, is fatally shot in a police raid.  Soon after, his spirit leaves his body in a hallucinatory odyssey that merges his past, present, and future into a chaotic whole.<br /><br />This riveting third film from French filmmaker Gasper Noe is a must see.  If you like movies by David Cronenberg, you will probably like this film.  It is shot in a non-linear way (jumping back and forth between past, present, and future).  Also much of it is shot above the heads of the actors (because the main character's spirit is floating above them).  Or it might be shot behind the main character's head (in past flash-back scenes).<br /><br />the main theme deals with \\"what happens to a person when they die\\", and this film explores those possibilities.  Deifinitely mind-expanding to watch.  The movie is 2 1/2 hours long, so you have to be patient as the plot plays out slowly.
B004V9J21O|5.0|Disc One opens with some of the best Neal Morse music writing with the melodic Mercy Street followed by the progressive Overture No. 4.  Time changer changes time back to the time of Spocks Beard but even better.  These three songs are worth buying the disk for, but Neal never cuts the performance short.  The remainder of disc one is solid, but it is disc two that really shines.  Absolute Beginner is a great rock hit.  Supernatural is one of the best ear candy/harmony/pop hits that I've heard in several years.  I will be contacting Word FM to get this on the airwaves.  Seeds of Gold is a gem - great song writing with a cool Steve Morse guitar solo.  Disk two could easily stand on its own, but along with Neal's second testimony, it is a great combination.  Thank you Neal for inspiring others to get closer to Jesus and for writing some of the best music of the 21st century.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|\\"Sucker Punch\\" is most likely going to be the most misunderstood film we'll see this entire year.  And sadly enough, I can't completely discuss the film without revealing some HUGE spoilers.  What I can say without any danger is that this movie works on at least three different levels... and the film absolutely lives up to its title.    At its most eye-popping level, the film is a fantastic action-adventure with an all-woman team of warriors.  Just on this level alone, the film's action sequences are breathtakingly stunning.  These sequences are original, flashy, silky smooth and carry a scope that boggles the mind.  I mean, where else can you see a movie that combines strong, sexy women, martial arts, shoot-em-ups, zombies, golems, Nazis, orcs, killer robots, airplanes, helicopters, mecha and DRAGONS?  Seriously.  It's all in there.  Just from the action included, the movie is off the charts.    But the action is only one layer of the film, and people who are watching the movie expecting this non-stop get to be the first winners of the titular sucker punch.  It's not an action movie at all, although all of the action I've talked about it is absolutely in the film.  It's just a part of the larger story, which is much more gripping and emotional by being put in contrast to the elegant fighting sequences.  At this level, \\"Sucker Punch\\" is a story about abuse and banding together to survive a brutal, horrific reality.  It gets uncomfortable at times, even, seeing what the characters have to cope with, but that makes the moments when they can be mentally and fantastically free so much more transcendent and poignant.  It truly works.  For anyone who has ever had to deal with abuse, be it sexual, physical, emotional or otherwise, this film sends a powerful message about the struggle to keep a part of yourself free and untainted from the cruelty of others at any cost.      And then there's the third level of the movie, but I'm not discussing that in detail in a public review, because it is best appreciated without any preexisting bias or foreknowledge.  This deepest level requires some serious thinking, but it's very much worth it.  If you knew, I mean absolutely KNEW, that you were doomed beyond a shadow of a doubt, how far would you go to save someone you loved?  THAT is what this movie makes you think about, in the end.  And any movie that makes me think and makes me feel is a movie worth seeing.    One last comment about the dress (or relative lack of it) the main characters seem to find themselves in throughout the film, if you don't mind.  As a woman, when I let myself fantasize about things, you'd best believe that I'm sexy and showing it off in most of my fantasies.  That's true for most women, if we take the time to think about it and have the courage to admit it.  So I'm not bothered in the least by the sexy outfits our girls wear in their fantasy sequences.  In the real world sequences, the skimpy attire has entirely the opposite effect, which I believe was quite purposely done; instead of being powerful and sexy like in the fantasy world, the revealing attire is both shameful and degrading to the characters, reinforcing the ugliness of their situation on that level.  The effect on the viewer is extremely dichotomous, and it's done in such a masterful way that it reinforces how brilliant a director Snyder really is.  Again, we get sucker punched, and it makes watching this movie unlikely anything else you'll see for a long time.    Watch \\"Sucker Punch\\" with an open, questioning mind, and it'll reward you with a unique, revealing experience.  Go into it with expectations of a bikini-clad assassin team with T&A everywhere and you'll be sorely disappointed.  But by all means, see it.
0307719774|4.0|The only reason I bought this journal was because I understood it to have starter questions.  What I am disappointed in is that the questions only cover a one year period.  I may have missed it in my purchase description, but I thought there would be different questions for each of the five years.  Instead, there's a few lines on each page, that you answer five times...with the point being to see how your thoughts have changed or stayed the same.<br /><br />Some of the questions are really bad... like... what was the last fruit you ate?  Or... what did you wear today? - Really???  Anyway, so for the novelty of it, I DO like it and I think that it's something basic one can get to answer simpleton questions for a year.<br /><br />The quality is also good, as you can use a gel pen and it won't run through the paper.  And I do think this would make a great gift, and I may just give it to someone in the future.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|[*no spoilers*]<br /><br />If you're after a non-stop thriller, packed with massacre and destruction and alien culture, this is not your movie. Super 8 tells a different story from the one suggested in its heart-pounding trailer, in that it DOES tell a story. And if you're fortunate enough to have been exposed to Spielberg before, you know any story in which he takes part is not one you want to miss.<br /><br />Super 8 is about relationships and the power and ramifications of feeling, which the supernatural element serves to amplify and test. We are tipped off to these film centerpieces in the opening scene, when thirteen-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) and his father (Kyle Chandler) are suffering through a personal tragedy, and his father's misgivings about someone in town are presented. We care already, especially with Courtney's earnest and expressive eyes that evoke empathy with every emotion he conveys. He is a promising actor whose future I look forward to seeing develop.<br /><br />Don't think this film is entirely dramatic and weighty, however--the comic relief is surprising in its placement and frequency alike. It roots us in the un-jaded juvenile mind and emphasizes the grand proportions (which really pop on the big screen) of what is unfolding around the group of boys we follow and attach ourselves to.<br /><br />Carrying us along on their adventure is a solid script and thoughtful detail placement. As Jamie Graham of Total Film puts it, \\"Like Spielberg, [director J.J.] Abrams has an eye for awe.\\" Think back on the landscape you caught a glimpse of through the hole in the bedroom wall, once you've watched the film, and you'll see what he means. Or, in retrospect, mull over the defense Joe's father presents to his son, the irony in his declaration that as the town deputy, with the sheriff not present, everyone is relying on him. There used to be someone else, but now there's only him. (For now you'll have to take my word for it...)<br /><br />The score, reminiscent of something from John William's legacy (hats off to Michael Giacchino)...the transportation back to 1979...the young male camaraderie and adventure...the nods to Spielberg's classic results from dabbling in the otherworldly...the focus on the characters and storytelling...all of these elements make for an experience you don't want to miss. You are, at the same time, given a dose of nostalgia and a new classic to cherish. Brilliant.legacy (hats off to Michael Giacchino)...the transportation back to 1979...the young male camaraderie and adventure...the nods to Spielberg's classic results from dabbling in the otherworldly...the focus on the characters and storytelling...all of these elements make for an experience you don't want to miss.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Marvel comics X-Men character Wolverine gets his own movie X-Men Origins:Wolverine.The movie originally released in North America in May/2009 stars Hugh Jackman as,of course,Wolverine and a fine job he does reprising his role as the fearsome mutant.Legendary comic writer/creator Stan Lee is also back in the production department.<br />The story starts out back in the 1800s as we see two brothers in a room,one sick in bed(it appears as an on going issue)and the other at his side.A man comes in to comfort him and soon has to leave abruptly as there is a commotion downstairs.Not too long after a shot rings out and his \\"father\\"lays dead on the floor.The \\"sick\\" boy comes out to witness the scene and leaps in rage at the man who appeared to kill his father and kills him.It turns out he has just killed his real father who had come to get his son.The man on the floor was a doctor of some type who had done experiments on his brother and himself.The boys flee their \\"home\\" for good.<br />The movie progresses ahead through time as the brothers reach manhood and are seen in various wars,world and otherwise;very little aging having taken place.The last war they engage in is the Vietnam War as the Wolverine's brother Victor(Liev Schreiber)has gotten them both into hot water.After a military firing squad fails to dispatch the pair they are recruited from jail to join a black ops project,which turns out to be a mutant squad.The head of this project is one Col.Stryker(Dan Huston).Time passes and Stryker's team is in Nigeria finding out the origins to a mysterious piece of metal called adamantium.It is on this mission that Wolverine calls it quits.<br />Wolverine goes to Canada and leaves the life of a humble lumberjack.In the meantime the black ops mission he left has not stopped but actually stepped up its protocol.They fake the Wolverine's fiancee's death in order for him to become so bent on revenge that he submits to being injected with an admantium compound.He becomes experiment#10,and a successful one at that.He goes after his brother Victor but it turns out Victor is just a red herring.Col.Stryker as usual is the one pulling all the strings.In fact Stryker has been rounding up mutants the world over and depositing them on an island which we later learn turns out to be the infamous nuclear reactor facility of Three Mile Island.<br />The Wolverine makes his way there and in the resulting struggles manages to free all of the captive mutants.His brother Victor,who has been popping in and out of the plot,helps the Wolverine to defeat experiment#11;a composite not only of the Wolverine but of some of the other captive mutants held there.The captives manage to find their way out of the facilities and who should be waiting in a stealth helicopter outside,but Xavier himself(Patrick Stewart).Meantime Col.Stryker has created some admantium bullets to stop the Wolverine with.While they don't kill him the Colonel pops two into his brain which causes a terrible memory loss.The movie ends with the Wolverine on his own,confused and fleeing the authorities who arrive on the scene.<br />The movie,while not jam packed with weird and wonderful mutants showing off their wares like the previous X-Men films(which I can see would a problem with those expecting this),still has many wonderful and exciting moments throughout as the pace/plot winds its way to its inevitable conclusion.We certainly see a more human side to this character and we have much more empathy for him now that we know where he came from and why.Jackman,et al,do a wonderful job in their parts and the special effects are top notch.<br />Technically speaking the movie has been transferred well and is in its original a/r of 2:35:1.The trailer is packaged here along with a featurette on the origins of the Wolverine in the comics and movies.<br />All in all a recommended movie for all fans of the other X-Men films.The movie is fast paced,has some nice action tucked here and there and the S/FX are great.Recommended.

B000WD66BM|5.0|While it isn't the album that got me hooked on Nightwish, Oceanborn is definitely the best and my absolute favorite of their releases. The atmospheric keyboards, the roaring guitars, and the speedy double bass are all ripped straight out of Stratovarius' playbook, but it is the combination of keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen's knack for melodies and hooks and vocalist Tarja Turunen's soaring siren-call that whips Oceanborn's music into a perfect storm of symphonic metal.<br /><br />If Nightwish's first album, Angels Fall First, is a calm autumn breeze, then Oceanborn is a category five hurricane, practically bursting out of the gates only seconds after the album's start. From the insane interplay between keyboard and vocals on \\"Stargazers,\\" to the infectious guitar melody of \\"Sacrament of Wilderness,\\" to the Plavalaguna-like metal opera \\"Passion And the Opera,\\" everything on Oceanborn feels colossal and larger than life. The album is just as eclectic as it is grandiose, as evidenced by songs like the epic \\"Devil And The Deep Dark Ocean,\\" the Egypt-inspired \\"The Pharaoh Sails To Orion,\\" and the beautiful ballads \\"Swanheart\\" and \\"Sleeping Sun.\\" Trans-Siberian Orchestra fans should enjoy the whimsical space ride that is \\"Moondance,\\" and Christmas enthusiasts will find the cover of Howard Blake's \\"Walking In The Air\\" a pleasure.<br /><br />In short, Oceanborn is as much an unforgettable experience as it is a musical recording. This is Nightwish at their very best, a masterpiece rivaled only by their 2005 album Once. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys film scores, keyboards, and unique vocals.

0439023521|5.0|Collins has put herself in the ranks of J.K Rowling and Philip Pullman with this novel originally written for an adolescent audience. You know a book is excellent when it can reach audiences that it wasn't even intended to be written for. I'm in my 20's and I couldn't put this book down, and I definitely went through it in 2 days. If you are a fan of fantasy novels such as the Harry Potter series or the Golden Compass, this will appeal to you, as it has many of the same appealing themes: a young heroine trying to survive in an unfair world ruled by evil forces. But Collins has added in another edge to her work by bringing in the element of 1984's \\"Big Brother\\" but seen through the eyes of a young teenager. I highly suggest this book if you're looking for a book to catch your attention and you happen to have lots of free time coming up for a few days.    My only complaint is it is simplistically written and the romance theme is sort of over-played which I fear might become problematic in the 2 books I have yet to read in this trilogy. There is also a lot of unnecessary descriptions of dresses and clothes, however, keep in mind it is written for a younger audience.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|After weeks and months of speculation, the thing is unveiled. And, it turns out, what SUPER 8 is, is a blast from the past, a nostalgic kick of cinema. And it's good, it's really good. There's a kid in this film who, whenever he thought something was cool, would remark, \\"That was mint!\\" Well, sir, SUPER 8 was mint.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is set in 1979, in the heartland town of Lillian, Ohio. Four months after the death of his mother at the local steel factory, 12-year-old Joe Lamb and his dad are grieving still, Joe's dad, a Sheriff's Deputy, still so affected that he's become estranged from his son. Joe at least has got his friends to distract him. It's summer now, school in the rearview for a while, and Joe's promised to help out his good chubby buddy (and budding filmmaker) Charles with his 8mm zombie movie, hopefully to be finished in time for an upcoming film festival. Joe builds train models, but he's also handy with monster make-up.<br /><br />Joe is particularly stoked to learn that his dream girl, Alice, will be acting in the picture. Joe and his friends (and Alice) all agree to sneak out at night and shoot scenes at the local train station. But then their little horror film gets upstaged when a military train rumbles by and derails spectacularly. And that's the start of a series of mysterious and frightening events befalling the town of Lillian.<br /><br />Joe Lamb, observant and early on tapped as the prospective protagonist, notes that something has punched thru the steel confines of one of the box cars. Soon after, the town suffers persistent fluctuations in electrical power, dogs are running away, and people are vanishing, as well as automobile parts and various everyday household items. And the U.S. Air Force has come to town, behaving oddly and sweeping the town streets and fiddling with their instruments. In the air wafts the smell of  a military cover-up.<br /><br />In a nod to the paranoid 1950s sci-fi flicks, certain of the townspeople blame the Red Menace. Joe and his friends know better. They've seen stuff, including these weird little cubes. But they were warned, warned by the only other person to have witnessed the train crash (and he actually caused it). If the kids talk, \\"they\\" will get them... and their parents, too. Except that this is the kind of movie in which the adults are the ones milling around, perplexed, and kids are the only ones who can save the day. I'm all for this kind of movie.<br /><br />This is intentionally a throwback film. And it throws me back to that era, when disco was at its last gasp. When the Walkman was the latest revolutionary leap in music accessibility. When sexy Debbie Harry was doing her thing. When the Three Mile Island disaster was still topical.  When folks said things like \\"gnarly.\\" SUPER 8 will resonate with just about everyone, but even more strongly with those falling in the Generation X bracket. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams has learned well at the master's feet. Much of what's in SUPER 8 evokes classic Spielberg. This story is darker and with a harder, more brutal edge, but somewhere in it you can catch glimpses of E.T. and THE GOONIES. Only, the special effects are much more lavish. Even if Abrams teases you for much of the film by only revealing shadowy bits of the terrifying alien set loose in the tiny town.<br /><br />Abrams constructs a good mystery, and he's excellent with staging the reveals. All of that doesn't impress me as much as how he handles the story's human elements, or, more specifically, how good he is with those scenes showcasing the children. He treats these scenes - which are all a homage to adolescence - with clear affection and humor and perceptiveness. More, he obviously feels a kinship to these kid characters who, just like him at that age, are avid film buffs and amateur filmmakers. Somewhere, in a producer's chair, polishing his Oscars, Spielberg must've been beaming, just beaming. It helps that the two child leads, Joel Courtney and ElleFanning, are so terrific. They hit those emotional beats just perfect. I also got love for that firecracker-obsessed pal of theirs who is certainly destined to be a future arsonist. What's less excellent - partly because it's resolved in such a perfunctory manner - is how Joe and his dad's strained relationship is developed. Also, Joe's dad (Kyle Chandler) seems slated to have a bigger role to play in the story. But, it turns out, not so much. And, if you're anticipating a full-on E.T.-type interaction between the kids and the alien, prepare to be thwarted. For the most part, this alien is nothing like E.T. ***SPOILER FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCE ONLY*** SUPER 8 shows what well may have happened to E.T. if the military had gotten its hands on him before Eliott did. SUPER 8 is watchable because the premise hooks you in and Abrams knows storytelling. But, for my money, it elevates to must-see status because these kid actors are so good at their craft and because Abrams does well with evoking a child's natural sense of wonder. It's all mint, baby.<br /><br />And mind that you stay for Charles's completed zombie film (titled \\"The Case\\") which plays during the closing credits.Fanning, are so terrific.

B004B8DH98|1.0|\\"The American\\" is certainly not what you would expect from the previews/trailers for the movie.  They give the impression that the movie is supposed to be action packed, thrilling and suspenseful, however, the movie falls short in all three of these categories. The movie centers around George Clooney's character, an assassin who obviously is conflicted about what he is doing and so is getting out of the business with \\"one last job\\".  The actual job and the slight twist accompanying it are revealed at the end of the movie and are somewhat of a letdown. However, he lowest low of the movie was the music selection, which tended to make even the most exciting scenes less so, such as in the case of the single car chase that takes place within the movie.  The tempo and feeling of the music just seemed to be off in any scene that contained the slightest bit of action/adventure, counteracting anything exciting going on on the screen.   Finally, the most redeeming quality of this movie, I think, are the scenes featuring Clooney and his love interest, a prostitute who he has started to feel for.  After the initial few sex scenes, their relationship becomes more intense and consequently more interesting as his suspicion of her motives grows.  All in all, \\"The American\\" is not at all the Jason Bourne-esque picture that it is advertised to be so if you are looking for a movie with some action, I would suggest skipping this film.
B004SBB0LU|3.0|I am not an audiophile, just a lover of Classic Rock who has purchased Queen in various cd forms over the years, including the original 1980s versions, the 1991 Hollywood Records \\"remasters\\", several Japanese remasters, the \\"Crown Jewels\\" boxed set, and now this. Man, am I tired of purchasing the same music over-and-over, never to be completely satisfied with the sound quality (except with the 2 cd, 5.1 surround anniversary remaster of \\"Night at the Opera\\"...get this if you can!). The sound on these cds is slightly (almost imperceptably) louder than the Crown Jewels cds (not enough to make repurchasing the cds worth it!). Also, The few Japanese remasters that I own sound much better than their \\"2011 remaster\\" counterparts (but even these fall short of what I expect from a remaster). It's too bad Hollywood Records couldn't do for the Queen Remasters what was done for The Beatles Remasters; the sound on those was very satisfying IMHO. The extras included on the 2011 Remasters, while appreciated, are a huge let down. The only people who should be buying this Boxed set are those who have no Queen cds, only own Queen greatest Hits cds, or those who still have the original cds produced in the 1980s. The only 2011 remasters I will be purchasing from now on are those not included in the Crown Jewels Set and that I don't already own the Japanese Remaster of. Looking forward to the Pink Floyd Remasters later this year... TONS of extras!
B004ZH66XO|3.0|the games is cute, but the controls are frustrating and i think they would drive my kids crazy fast. if you use the screen, your finger is over everything you need to see. using the control pad makes it a little better, but not by much. i haven't gotten too far in the game but the graphics are cutish.
B000WGYMAQ|4.0|There's no way a movie can duplicate the intensity of a live performance experience.  (And I think I have enough experience to confidently say that this is just as true for the cast as it is for the audience.) But I am finding the difference easier to \\"forgive\\" than some other reviewers.    Chris Columbus was, I think, justly criticized for his Harry Potter adaptations being \\"too faithful.\\"   But the tendency to faithfulness worked very well here.  He cut a few numbers, made minor concessions to realism, and took advantage of things that the live stage could not in terms of scale: filming on a rooftop and a desertscape for What You Own, a huge ballroom for Tango Maureen, and the beautiful church in which his few close friends look positively lost during Angel's memorial service.   Same with the audio production techniques, which are closer to what we're accustomed to in rock albums than on a stage.   The extremely slow tempo at which Collins starts the \\"I'll Cover You\\" reprise belongs in that category also: I think that is too hard to attempt when you have to do it live every night, but it is incredibly powerful here.    All in all, I think the only thing I missed about the movie was that Mark had less depth: his very raw and emotionally intimate relationship with Roger, his vulnerability and his isolation, all of which comes out in the longer, original version of \\"Goodbye Love,\\" were not obvious enough and so he was just not as sympathetic as the rest of the characters.   Oh, and I would have liked the scenes of the HIV support group to have been explored a bit more.   But really, as long as you don't hold it to the impossible standard of having the same intensity as live theater, it is quite good.

FOR SOME REASON EVERY TIME I WALKED INTO A BOOK STORE I COULDNT HELP BUT NOTICE THE COVER....(GREAT MARKETING BY THE WAY)....FINALLY PICKED IT UP AND READ IT LIKE A 12YR OLD DEVOURS A HARRY PORTER BOOK. THE AUTHOR TAKES YOU FROM THE HUMBLE BEGINS OF HIS LIFE WORKING AT A GAS STATION AS A PUMP ATTENDANT..TO PORK CHOP SALESMAN....TO GETTING HIS FIRST JOB WITH A SHEISTY SMALL COMPANY....TO THE START OF HIS CAREER WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS. THE BOOK WAS VERY DESCRIPTIVE, I FELT AS IF I WAS THERE THE ENTIRE TIME. HE CONNECTED WITH ME FROM BEGINNING TO END. WHAT I LIKED WAS HOW THE AUTHOR INTRODUCED EACH CHARACTER OF HIS STORY WITH HIS OR HER OWN PERSONALITY. THIS GAVE ME A GRASP OF WHO WAS WHO AND WHY THEY PROBABLY DID WHAT THEY DID. THERE WERE EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER RIDES AND TWISTS ALL THROUGH THAT KEEP ME INTRIGUED AND ANXIOUS TO KEEP READING.I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CALLED RICHARD FULD \\"DICK\\" FOR SHORT..PARDON THE PUN....<---THAT WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL OF ME(LOL). THE AUTHOR GIVES A GREAT EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WE ARE IN THIS FINANCIAL DEBACLE,AND THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS AND THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE.I RESPECT THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT BIAS IN HIS WRITINGS,BUT PROVIDED US WITH UNKNOWN FACTS AND EVENTS,THAT ALLOWED US TO MAKE OUR OWN VERDICT. THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS BOOK IS LIKE A FUSION OF \\"WALL STREET\\" MEETS \\"MAD MEN\\"...I GUESS THAT MAKES LARRY MCDONALD....

1592332803|5.0|When I went vegan, the one thing that always depressed me was that I couldn't enjoy my sweets. I would have to buy 5 dollar cupakes and 20 dollar cakes. Colleen Patrick Goudreau changed that. The recipes in this book are easy, and extremely tasty. And I would know, I have a huge sweet tooth. In fact, I use to only make processed cookies and cakes, with this book, my pastries are more rich and delicious than before, and WAY cheaper!! Colleen is an angel, in so many ways. Her words and advice on her podcast have changed my life, influenced me to make the right step in a vegan lifestyle, and she also provides me with the best way to coup: sweets and treats :D So far I have made chocolate frosted cake, blueberry bundt cake, buttercream cupcakes, no-bake strawberry chocolate pie, pancakes, and chocolate cookies. There is a lot of room for change too, like if you prefer using flax instead of egg replacer.<br /><br />MUST HAVE, especially from such a great price.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I held off on purchasing an SB-900 for the longest time, having read a number of negative reviews on overheating and size. I finally bit the bullet and can say I should have jumped sooner. Nikon have another winner with unbelievable performance, and importantly, handling. The flash is easy to use, with dedicated switching for master/slave configuration, and the inclusion of a diffuser and gels is a bonus. I haven't experienced any of the overheating issues mentioned by others, and the flash is still a brute in terms of size, which is why I rated it a 4. But you can't go wrong if you want a fully-featured top-of-the-line speedlight.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|Ok, so the old review was for the 30th Anniversary Vinyl, and now we have this 50th Anniversary Box with the Blue Vinyl LP inside with all sorts of problems with 'Noisy sounding pressings, and it seems to be a problem so let me tell you what I encountered with mine. First of all, the music is superlative, you just can't put a price on it and there is a reason people like me keep buying all these  Anniversary issues. But this one is way beyond nice, it's beautiful to a fault. I'm actually surprised this didn't list price for $199. The book is Beautiful and the Box is thick and very very high quality.  Now to the Blue album.  Mine WAS very noisy, pops, clicks you name it. I was initially very peeved off but as I've been buying a lot of 'Newly' pressed vinyl, I've run into this more than you can imagine. And I remembered something from the old Mobile Fidelity Days......in the liner notes for their albums, they told us that they didn't 'de horn' their pressings and that you would probably hear, initially, some clicks, pops, and noise, But give the album around 5-9 plays, clean it between plays, and it should get quieter. Mine did. The other MAJOR thing is Static Electricity. The vinyl they used is VERY prone to Static, which will then give you mucho clicks and pops, it's not the LP, it's the Static. Try using a used Laundry Dryer cloth/pad that makes clothes soft, they often will discharge Static, Just make sure you use one that's been 'through the drying cycle' so the chemicals embedded on it will be dissipated and just very lightly let it touch the surface of the LP while it's turning. That should do the trick.  It seems like a lot of trouble for an album but the results are worth it. My Blue vinyl now only has very minor noise in the lead on grooves that dissapears very quickly and the pressing now sounds like a reference disc. Very well mastered and sounds like it should.......the greatest Jazz album released!!  Hope this helps. Gerard Masters
B001TODCII|1.0|No.  Judge Dredd is the worst, but TAKEN easily moves into second place.  The writing, editing and acting are all atrocious and manipulative.    The movie starts with a montage of a father flipping through pictures of his daughter as a child, a banal attempt to set up an emotional connection with the viewer, which utterly fails for anyone over the age of about six.  More failed emotional blackmail follows as the father buys a present for his daughter, then takes it to her birthday party (and proceeds to make an ass of himself, to show us how 'tough' he is and will be), while the movie tries to show us the father is the 'good' parent and the mother is a bitch.  Daddy gives the present to his daughter, she loves it, then rich step dad brings out a horsie for the little girl (she is 17).  Spoiled little rich girl drops daddy's present and runs to the horsie.   I almost cried.  No, make that almost retched.  Daughter is going to Paris and Daddy has to sign a form allowing her to travel out of the country?  Really, could this possible be true?  He's opposed but gets emotionally blackmailed into allowing her to go.      To cut to the chase, once in Paris Daddy's little virgin is kidnapped by Albanian sex slavers and Daddy, ex-covert ops superman, goes on a rampage to save her.  The movie, previously attempting, and failing, to set us up to care about these flat, lifeless characters now goes all out into \\"Die Hard\\" mode.  Daddy finds daughters hotel room, actually talks to the kidnappers (WTF!) and finds a camera.  He takes the camera to a photo booth, inserts the memory card and instantly finds a pix of daughters kidnapper in a reflection in one of the pix.  How does Daddy know this guy is the kidnapper?  Because Daddy is SUPER SPY!  This is the first of many unbelievable plot contrivances that take up the entire rest of the movie.  Daddy now goes to the airport, finds the guy (who is wearing the exact same highly recognizable clothing) and proceeds to chase him through the streets outside of the airport, causing massive vehicular mayhem the whole time.  Bad guy gets away, only to stand on a highway and get smashed by a truck.  No Paris police or airport security seem to care that Daddy is causing dozens of car wrecks while doing this as the movie simplistically moves us on to the next scene without any problems for Daddy, not even a traffic ticket.      A couple of scenes move us forward, one in which Daddy talks to a buddy who just 'happens to know' that it is Albanians who are totally in charge of kidnapping beautiful girls for sex slaves in Paris.  He then meets up with an old French police buddy who gives him some additional info to move the plot forward a bit.  Since Daddy has lost his source to find the Albanians (got smashed by a truck) he goes to a Rue where streetwalkers hang out and talks to one of the girls.  He acts like an a** and of course one of the Albanians is watching, walks up to Daddy to get rid of him.  Daddy places a wireless bug on bad guy (he has an Albanian interpreter with him) and finds out where the bad guys hang out.  Daddy goes to a construction site where he finds the bad guys selling girls to the construction workers.  His daughter isn't one of them so he goes on his first rampage, killing dozens in a stupid and unbelievable car chase, once again with no Paris police caring at all that their city is being shot up.  At one point he is in a car with a girl he taken with him.  A bad guy car is right next to them and the bad guys are firing automatic weapons directly into Daddy's car.  Is Daddy or the girl hurt?  Noooo!!!  Why?  Where did all the bullets go?  Who knows?  Who cares?      Moving forward a bit, Daddy once agains finds another bad guy hideout (how?  don't know and don't care) and presents himself as a Paris detective.  Does Daddy speak French?  Noooo!!!  Do the bad guys speak English?  Yesss!!!!  Does anyone care?  Noooo!!!!  Daddy proceeds to blow away all these bad guys, after recognizingthe voice of one of the bad guys as the same person he spoke with on the phone.  Really?  Who cares anymore.  Stupid plot contrivance abound.    Daddy now finds out his old Paris police buddy is protecting the bad guys (another unbelievable plot contrivance) and goes the detectives house to confront him.  Detective refuses to help (he needs the money the bad guys pay him) so Daddy shoots the wife (sample line: \\"It's only a flesh wound\\") to get the cop to talk.  Of course, the cop's two kids don't run out to see what happened when their mother was shot, they are asleep in bed.  The copy tells Daddy where to go next.  After all, the plot is so thin and stupid that someone is always telling Daddy exactly where to go, or he figures it out himself somehow.      Daddy next goes to a fancy dress ball/party where he once again presents himself with his fake French Police ID, which of course totally gets him instantly into the party without him speaking a word of, um, what is it?  Oh yeah, French.  Daddy spots the bad guy.  How does he know that this one guy in a tux out of hundreds of guys in tuxes is the bad one?  Who cares!  He knows, he just knows.  Follows the bad guy into the basement where pretty young girls are being sold in an auction.  Of course his daughter is there, is the prize of the sale and Daddy buys her (don't ask how) only to get caught.  Bad guys prepare to kill Daddy but he is SUPER DADDY so he proceeds to kills off another dozen guys with guns without him getting even winged.  After he kills all but one bad guy he shoots him a couple of times to get him to say where is daughter has been taken.  Where?  Another actual line from the movie \\"There's a boat, on a quay.\\"  And that's all the info Daddy needs, because this is Paris and after all, how many boats on how many quays can there be in Paris (I'm guessing several thousand on several hundred)?  In typically stupid fashion, Daddy kills another bad guy, runs outside and sees the limo carrying his daughterand proceeds to chase it for several miles through the streets of Paris.  Any cops around?  Don't be silly, of course not.  And how does he know that this particular limo is carrying his daughter?  Who cares, he knows this is the limo leaving the party (out of dozens) which has his daughter.      After more vehicular mayhem, Daddy jumps from a bridge onto the luxury yacht, proceeds to kills a dozen more bad guys without a scratch, then kills the middle eastern sheik who is holding a knife to his daughter's throat.      And they all live happily ever after!!!!!     On second thought, maybe this is the worst movie I've ever seen.  But I'm sure as hell not going to watch TAKEN or JUDGE DREDD again to find out.

I wasn't looking for this, but this is one of my favorite records from way back in the day, I've worn out a lot of tapes and CD's, and the opportunity to pick up an actual record was just too cool.    This isn't an album, but more of an experience, if you were around in the 80's when \\"thriller\\" first came out, it was amazing, nothing like it was ever done before, and while close, IMO, nothing has been sense either.  I'd say honestly that I think this was the peak of Michael Jackson's career.    It's a picture disc, and I don't really know about the longevity of those if you play it, but it does sound good, and I assume most people will not play it, or won't much.    Amazon's shipping was awesome.  It came in a HUGE box full of bubbly stuff, and a smaller record sized cardboard protector in the middle, it may be overkill, but it's definitely getting to you intact LOL    Only disappointment is that it doesn't come in a traditional card stock sleeve with the light paper protector, it's just the record in a clear vinyl sleeve with a thin paper insert to tell about what is on it.    If you like Michael Jacksons stuff, you gotta get this, it's bound to be collectible too down the road.
B004259BMM|5.0|This record deserves wayyy more than 5 stars in my book. I have not taken this CD out of my stereo since I bought it at 8am the day it was released. This album is beautiful--each and every song is a masterpiece. Not a day goes by that I dont listen to Get Closer. Ballads such a Without You and All for You will give you goosebumps while Put You in a Song and Long Summer will have you dancing and singing at the top of your lungs. Keith truly is one of a kind and puts his all into each note--you can hear the passion in his voice. Do yourself a favor and buy this cd--it will be the best $10 you've ever spent:)!!!!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Ayn Rand's work seems to be synonymous with political debates, and warring of the philosophical.  And with good reason.  She was a champion of absolute capitalism, having fled from the Communist hellhole of Soviet Union, she had great appreciation for personal freedom: simple yet powerful idea of being able to pursue our own dream.  This was evident in her odd insistence on vilifying the word, 'altruism'; she believed it to be the dulling to the soul of a man, thus to the society.  What mattered is our duty to be 'selfish', to have the fortitude to reject the mass and transcend to the idea of self-sufficiency.  And the end product of her ideal was her fictional birthchild: Howard Roark.<br /><br />Howard Roark is a caricature example of what Ayn Rand believed a Man should be: stoic, self-sufficient, and objective.  He was at the cause, never the effect, of his life.  Even as the world hated him and denied him, in his heart he knew that only thing that mattered in his reality is the respect he had for himself and his craft.  He felt the pain of solitude and his talents not being recognized; however, he posited that our purpose in life isn't to bend to will of the mass, but to find our own brand of happiness.  He was an embodiment of genuine self-esteem, the kind that was internally generated and could not be taken away by the world.<br /><br />There are many valuable lessons here to be taken, especially for the modern man.  But mainly it's meant to serve as a guidepost to where we should try to steer our lives.  I see lots of readers arguing against his anti-social values; condemning the hypothetical world filled with Howard Roarks.  Truth is we cannot be Howard Roark; we are human beings: we err, make egoist strides, and shamelessly re-commit the same mistakes.  Howard Roark is an idea, a place where we want to be.  The idea that is noble enough to at least consider, if not worship.  His commitment to eradicate all his egos is something to be admired for, and has application in all aspects of life, including business and relationship.  Forget the political implications of the book - and you will get a lot out of this story than any other fiction books you ever read.
B00000JQFM|1.0|Can I give a ZERO STAR??!!!! I cant believe the reviews and the ratings ppl have given to this album which is nothing but total cr@p, complete cacophony, and there is NO talent involved here absolutely...Anybody who knows how to strum and has access to an electric guitar can churn out noise like this. This was a terrible let down given that I had listened to Joe's \\"Flying in a Blue Dream\\" and \\"The Extremist\\" before and this was going to be my third Joe Satriani album. I listened to it and tossed it out of embarrassment!!!
0439023483|5.0|I've read quite a few page-turners before, but none were as compelling as this one! You really feel as if you're in the Hunger Games right there along with the two main characters, Katniss and Peeta.<br />This book takes you into a seemingly post-apocalyptic dystopian society where twelve districts are controlled by one central capitol. Due to a previous attempted rebellion by the districts, the Capitol rules with an iron fist. Each year the districts are required to enter their teenagers into a lottery, in which two (a boy and a girl) are selected to compete in the Hunger Games. These Games are a brutal fight to death where only one is allowed to survive. When 12 year old Prim is selected to compete, her sister Katniss volunteers in her stead.<br />The poverty of District 12, the journey to the Capitol, the lifestyle of the people, and the intensity of the Games is brought to life in this novel by Collins amazing writing. Make no mistake, this is no love story. It is a brutal tale that will make you gasp and cry and leave you amazed, but I can pretty much guarantee that you won't put it down until the final page is read.
B000VH34LY|5.0|An outstanding album featuring the whole spectrum of Clapton's refined and tasteful styles, and arguably Mick Taylor's finest ever solo on the slow blues 'Marriage Madness'. Johnny Almond's sax and flute skills are another reason to buy this.<br />The only negative note would have to be Mayall's self-righteous preaching about drugs and how to live your life, which while in some way understandable, was out of step with the times, and ironic given Clapton's well-publicized addiction. Finally, the handful of updated tracks feature re-recorded drum and piano parts, but with Almond's sax and flute parts inexplicably edited out. Why was Mayall not happy with these? The re-makes are not an improvement.
B00000IM2R|5.0|This Album is part of blues history. If you don't have it, buy one. The experience of open a vinyl and play it for the first time is priceless. Vinyl is the way that old records where ment to be heard.
030745455X|5.0|I loved this book!  I am planning on purchasing the third installment of this trilogy soon :)  I highly recommend it if you like a bit of mystery and danger in your novels!!!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down. It pulls at your heart strings. It has a surprising twist at the end also, you find yourself falling in love w/ these girls, w/ this family. Great book!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie with all it's twists and turns.  Surprise ending.  Locales and people are pretty.  Johnny Depp, as always, makes his character very believeable throughout the whole movie.  I enjoyed the romantic interplay between him and Angelina Jolie.  Fun movie to watch.
B004PR71JC|4.0|Today a 5 yr old boy, a 14 yr old boy, and a 6o yr old man decided they wanted the have the soundtrack to this movie.  Since I am the oldest, I guess I will do the buying.  We also liked the movie very much: hilarious and warm, and of course, RIO during Carnival.
0061537969|2.0|Though the book isn't completely without merit, I didn't find the book to be nearly as insightful as my numerous friends had suggested.  It was a simple story from the point of view of a completely sympathetic narrator who just happens to be a dog (and i assume people enjoy this gimmick, though I felt it ultimately fell flat.  Also, the story often digresses into these subchapters about driving that i just skipped entirely because I didn't find their connection with the story.  Sure, it's a quick read and an easy one, but, in my opinion, not all that emotional or effective.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|... probably the best coming of age movie ever made.  And it has cycling, smart, witty dialogue, and the 70's.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|I really did not care for this movie....just wasn't what I expected...it was ok...my husbnad liked it more then me but he even said it was just ok...sorry won't watch this again...donated it already!!!
B0041KKYCY|5.0|Good acting made it difficult to watch the humiliating, vicious, brutal, seemingly-endless rape scene, but the viewer has to endure it to appreciate the clever and cathartic revenge scenes.  What a great movie!
068817776X|5.0|I read this book two years ago and consider it a very memorable true story of survival.  The true stories of people's lives in Germany during the Holocaust should be remembered.  My book club will discuss it next year so I needed my own copy.
0240815807|5.0|I am hoping to make recordings of my performance in the next few years and am considering building my own studio to do it, so jumped at the chance to read and review this new offering. Initially I felt unsure that I was qualified to comment, but realize that I am close to Senior's target audience, being a professional classical musician with strong skills in traditional folk and swing, an audiophile (\\"low high-end\\" for those who care), a commercial radio operator from the days before everything was digital and an extra-class amateur radio operator, also from the old days. So actually I have enough knowledge to begin absorbing what the author has to offer.<br /><br />What he has to offer is huge! And his writing is great fun to read. I so appreciate Senior's amusing and picturesque way of expressing himself without being too glib. He starts right out telling the reader what concepts to review in order to best understand his advice, and where to find that information. He dives into advice on equipment, assuming the reader is without deep pockets and dealing with the inevitable low end problems. He goes over compensations that might be needed on the raw tracks, then into balance, compression, equalization, sweetening with effects and so very much more. I can't possibly relate how much information is in this book, nor how very thoroughly and thoughtfully the author presents it. For those aspects you must read it yourself. What I can tell you is that he constantly footnotes his offering by telling the reader what numerous audio engineers he knows would do in given situations.<br /><br />Above all, Mike Senior's approach to both his craft and what he imparts to his reader is Totally Zen. This book is so beyond just how to tweak this and that; it shows that the author has both technical expertise and great creativity and can impart these enthusiasms in writing. I can't imagine that there is anyone in the studio recording field who would not profit from reading this book.
B000VZPCN4|2.0|I have bought everything KISS since becoming a fan at age 15. When I saw the album cover with them larger than life, I thought cool more fantastic KISS. I am not a fan of Disco then or now, and I listened to this and was broken hearted. It was some of the worst crap I have ever heard. Charisma is the only decent song on it. I had not listened to this in a long time so I did the MP3 download to see if time changed anything. I still hate Disco and I still do not like this one, but being a loyal KISS fan I own it. The best version of I Was Made For Loving You is on Alive 3. Paul Stanley growls it up so it is not so disco like. I would not recommend this one if you want a taste of KISS. Instead, go back to the beginning, up through Love Gun, and you will not be disappointed.  Pick them up again with Creatures of the Night and beyond.
1881273989|5.0|I love this book!  Anyone who is single should read it.  I have given it to my sisters and friends because it makes relationships so much better when you know others love languages.  Get this book!
0375812024|5.0|A reader of this book will discover that there is more to an airport than planes taking off and landing.  From the time the passenger arrives there are many activities taking place.  A young reader of this book will look for the many \\"helpers\\" that make an airport function.
B004TLM284|4.0|Alright it has now been a month  or so  since  Ms. Spears had released this  latest installament. I wanted to give the album more time  before i  rushed to write  a review.    I must admit  upon initial  listen only half the album got my  thumbs ups. I liked the  the first few songs and then the rest were blah to me.    But now that it has  had time to simmer a bit i really  like them all now.    I think this album comes as a cross between \\"Blackout\\"  and \\"In the Zone\\". Her persona has remained the same and improved in some ways. Which is the reason i enjoy listening to her.    The album is pretty  strong overall. Here is a song by song breakdown.    Till the world Ends- You would think with a title like   that it would be the album  ending song  instead of the beginning  number. It does a  good  job of  getting the party started though. It  is good to have this as the starting number. This gets you ready to have a fun time with the whole  album. It  has that ke$ha feel to it. Which is apparopriate  since  she  did pen the number. There is a remix to this but you won't find it on the album. the original will do just fine though. This was  the second single.    Hold it against Me- This is  well known as the first  single and it  works to pull you deeper into the album and, get you ready for the follow up song that  fits in nicely. Since it was played a lot as a single . I skip this one normally but  do find my self still occassionally letting it play.If it pops up on my  music player. it's still catchy and  fun.    Inside Out-This is pretty much my favortie song on the  whole album. It has a very strong urban feel to it. This  would benefit even more if it had a nice little rap in the middle. This is  where nicki minaj could really come in handy.(seriously) The song talks about  meeting up with an ex again and not being able to fight your  feelings when you are alone with them and that's the  polite way of putting it basically. I often have this song on repeat and will probably have it  this way for the rest of the  year.    I Wanna Go- Is a fun up beat number. Basically talking about  just letting go and  forgetting what others say. Kind of  fully releasing yourself to  express whatever you need to. The  whistling was a unique touch to this song    How I Roll- is a  unique song in that  a guy's voice is used to interlace with ms. spears and it works out well. This is  simply a club sing-a-long about mellowing out. Fun little number that will get you  ordering drinks and getting more  excited as  time goes along.    Drop Dead Beautiful-is  another strong number. It has ms. spears working a little swagger and pretty much  telling a guy that  he is  too fine for words. She has some assistance  from a  a new girl name Sabia.She does a  decent  job of keeping the song  flowing along. She doesn't get to talk too long  before ms. spears comes back on the line. It's a fun number but i found the  verses the  best part of the song. The chorus was actually  okay, in comparison.    Next up you got \\"Seal with a Kiss\\" which is  easy breezy dance  number and one of the best on the album.It  kind of provides a light  different feel from the others. You  may not want to repeat it again and again but  just about everytime it comes on you will want to dance. I love the breakdown in the middle as well.     Big  Fat Bass- this song is  good depending on what mood you are in. On  first inital listen i wasn't too impressed. The piano is a nice touch. and  Will.i.am's rap is  good. but  all the repetition can get a bit annoying. but if you are in a whatever mood then this song can be  great. it is  the longest on the album.It was obviously made  for   the dance floor with the shifting  beats here and there towards the  end.    \\"Trip to Your Heart\\" follows   and is  the closest thing to a ballad (excluding \\"Criminal\\" for now) on the album.It's  very  airy and somber. You could easily  fall into a sleep haze with it on. It is catchy.By the time the song is over you are left feeling clam and relaxed. You kind of need this after all the  power bass of the previous number.    Gasoline. When i  first heard this  i liked  it a lot, but after hearing the whole album it comes off as a low key  \\"Toxic\\".It has a few memorable lines like \\"my heart only runs on supreme, so hot give your gasoilne\\" but beyond that it isn't super memorable.It's kind of serves a way to get to the  last number.    Criminal- is one  of the better numbers and is a ballad of sorts probably more  so then \\"Trip to your Heart\\". This song makes you wonder if she is speaking from  true experience  or  just singing words to a song. She talks of dating a bad guy and all of  his character flaws that scream stay away. The  flute and guitar  are a nice touch and change from the majority of the album. You  will find yourself singing along without even thiking about it.I normally repeat this number. Now i must  admit her  vocals  can get a bit  grating at this point, but if you can overlook that it's a strong  song. It  serves as a soft way to  end the album.    I would give this  album 4 stars. There  really aren't any fillers and  the song writing is pretty strong. The beats are the  best she has had so far and the production is top of the line.    There is sure to be  at least a few songs anyone would like off of this.It is a repeatable  album and I will probably be listening to it for a long time.There are  also deluxe versions. There was only one song i liked from those which is \\"Up and Down\\", but it will not be included on the standard version. Just download it to  get it for yourself. It's worth the time.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Summer because she is very amazing. As a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, I don't think this role is good for him because I don't like the way he ran away after he saw Summer's ring. But this is still a very nice movie. When it was released on cable TV, I never missed it. As an ex-Smiths fan, their songs made me unhappy, but they didn't last that long in the scenes, which was fantastic. Summer and Tom have nice chemistry, and the landscapes are beautiful. All in all a wonderful romantic comedy. The soundtrack goes really well with the movie, so whoever compiled them did a nice job. The score is so amazing. Highly recommended. Thank you Summer.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I loved all the books in this series and have no dobt that the movie will be awesome!!! I cant wait to see it and will buy the dvd as soon as it comes out!!!
B003DT19F0|5.0|A very cute story.  Great for all ages.  My 3 yr. old really likes it when she is in her Tinkerbell moods.
B002I9Z89Y|3.0|3 1/2 stars.  I take a star off for the really HORRIBLE blu-ray case that cracks easily.  There are no 7 case replacement cases only 6 disc are available to the public.  I take off half a star because the access times on my Sony Blu-ray Player that has all the updates is FAR slower to access the episodes than season 1.  I have heard season 3 access times are just as slow.  The episodes should have been displayed on the front of each disc instead of the backside of the front sleeve.  I would have paid more for a collectors edition with stuff like a booklet that describes each episode and a better case that is either crack proof or crush proof like metal or hard cover book cases that are some blu-rays.  I also feel the remastering is very good 4 out of 5 stars but not  excellent like season 1 which I give 5 out of 5 stars on the remastering of the video.  I really can't review the audio because I don't have a fancy audio setup. Please paramount, spend more money on the remastering process on the old effects and some of the shots on some of the episodes that need more attention.  As for the new CGI that looks 1990's Deep Space nineish...I can live with or without it.  Sometimes I watch it with friends that prefer it but I tend to not watch it when I am watching episodes by myself.  If you have a 7 disc blu ray case laying around you are willing to part with...let me know.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I purchased this adapter to replace a very old model with poor linux support. This new adapter worked with my Debian linux system \\"out of the box\\" with no extra tinkering or driver installs required. The PL2303HX chipset is well supported and I use it to communicate with a serial character LCD panel and so far has worked flawlessly. I cannot comment on compatibility with any other operating systems. As long as it continues to function as expected, I highly recommend this adapter.
B003Y5H556|4.0|I have never had this chance before in disliking a movie for so many reasons, but then publicly giving it a high rating - so here goes.<br /><br />The story follows a character called Red Riding Hood that has a completely different plot than I have ever read or heard before, including werewolves, guys with Twilight hairdos, and hundreds of anachronisms depending on which era the filmmakers were actually trying to obtain. I feel it is fair regarding the hatred felt for this movie because of all the Twilightisms - this from the same person who directed Twilight also spun her wares on Red's story. With that comes all of the horrible acting, bad writing, incredibly fake stage sets containing no elements of external reality (snow that never melts, no breath is ever visible, echoes in open air, no skylines, etc) and a \\"provocative\\" ending.<br /><br />But aside from all of that, the entire product is thorough and worthy. The picture quality has some outstanding references, mostly surrounding the color and line clarity of her red cloak, but the opening sequence of aerial vistas made the beginning trick you into thinking the whole film will be beautiful. The DTS is adequate but surrounds you mostly with the score and one or two of the wolf attacks. The supplements are a few stars in themselves:<br /><br />* Each menu selection is given a pic frame once selected that shows a time stamp and further description of what the feature is - wish all BDs did this.<br />* Deleted scenes, 4 @ 4:18 minutes. There is only one reminiscent of the dream theme that should have stayed in, but glad the rest were cut.<br />* Gag reel, 2:37 minutes. Not too funny, but showed they were having fun making this mess.<br />* Music Videos, 2 @ 5:27 minutes. The closing song and the party song - the party/dance song video is actually better than the movie.<br />* Secrets behind the Cloak, PiP at an almost 40% screen fill during film. Hardwicke and cast give their insights intermittently, more interesting than the film and it actually screens better.<br />* Reinvention of the tale, 5:25 minutes. The history behind the real story and how they came to the conclusion this film was actually a good idea.<br />* Men of RRH, 3:18 minutes. Barf. All the girls get to say how enamored they are with each guy actor and how cute they are.<br />* Music score, 10:59 minutes. Thorough depiction of how the music score came to be - worth it for the fans of the music.<br />* Wolf CGI, 46 seconds. Skip this at all costs, shows the stand-ins and rough CGI.<br />* Casting tapes, 3 @ 7:24 minutes. More painful than the movie.<br />* Rehearsals, 3 @ 5:52 minutes. Shows the dance sequence prep, boring.<br />* Red Riding Hood in 73 seconds. Fast forwards the movie for you with several stops as to see apparently the important shots - whatever.<br />* DVD of the film.<br />*Alternate \\"provocative\\" ending. I should have read the back of the case first - as it was rated PG-13 also. Spoilers: they have PG-13 lust and make a wolf baby...oooh wow. Roughly 90 seconds of alternate footage and snow love.<br /><br />I suppose my biggest issue is I made the mistake of screening this at the local high school graduation night not having seen it yet - and literally hundreds of teens commented on how bad the movie was. They all complained it looked like Twilight and the story was horrible.

B00000I41J|5.0|About 40 years ago as a practicing alcoholic, I sold mostly all of my prized jazz collection for wine money. It has taken this long to replace most of my lost gems. I have purchased them in the CD form and have them stored on my computer. This is one of my favorites.
0316069353|5.0|First time I've read Michael Connelly and I enjoyed the story immensely.  The book I thought was well written.  After all, it held my interest throughout its entirety as I could not put it down until the book was finished.  I encourage anyone who enjoys courtroom scenarios to read it.  I am looking forward to reading my next novel by Connelly.
B001EN71HC|4.0|While by now everyone knows what they are getting with an Austin Powers film, I snatched up this bargain due to the terrifically low price. I had read that the AP films had a less-than-stellar transfer, but I didn't find that to be the case. Colors are sharp and strong, the sound is lush, and it was a blast re-watching these films in high-def (well, the first two, anyway; the third one tends to drag a little). Especially for the low price for the whole set, this is certainly a worthwhile purchase if you're a fan of the films, even if you have some of them on DVD.  There's a notable difference in quality, and if you really like the films this small investment in Blu-Ray is worth it.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|I say job well done to those who worked on this film. Finally they got it right when making a film about two women in love. I was so sick of seeing all the other stuff they have out nowadays, which mind you isn't much, so I know quality films when I see one and this is it.    I first rented this film based on the positive reviews on here and found myself buying it afterward. Yes, it was that good. For me, it's right up there with \\"Desert Hearts,\\" \\"Saving Face\\" and \\"Remember Me and You.\\" Definitely worth the time and money.    The movie was never cheesey though some of the lines were but not much. I could definitely feel the connection between the main characters and struggled right along with them when they realized the consequences of their love. I think the movie transitioned very well from one scene to the next.    Don't take my word for it, just go and watch this film. You won't regret it.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW THE END!  Okay, this is the first time I've done this, so please, be merciful.  I have not actually bought the CD yet, but I heard it on YouTube.  Before I did that, I read the synopsis.  Actually, I read several.  I was very sad and angry when I learned that Christine had died.  And the fact that the phantom and Christine...uh, conceived a child seemed ridiculous.  Then I decided to listen to it on my computer.  I quickly changed my mind.  The voices and music was so amazing and beautiful, I actually changed my standard policy of hating stories with sad endings.  Now, I want this. {have to wait till I have the money, though}.    Many Phans {as in the devoted fans of Phantom of the Opera} really, really hated this cd.  They came up with things like, \\"Love should die\\" and \\"The story didn't need a sequel\\"  If you are one of these, I suggest that you don't buy it.  I personally did not really like the Phantom of the Opera.  Now, before anyone accuses me of blasphemy, I'm not saying I didn't like some songs.  I liked the title song, of course.  I actually like quite a few of the others.  But I just found it hard to follow.  Too many times people's voices were overlapping.  In Love Never Dies, they do that too, but not nearly as much, and not in a way that you can't understand what's going on.  The other thing that I didn't like about the first one is that the phantom was so bad, except in the end.  I know he was a bad guy in the book.  But I just wanted to see him be good more for some reason.  He is good in Love Never Dies.  He seems very human.  Actually, when I think about it, the ending was not completely sad.  Yes, things don't end well for Christine, Meg, Madame Giry, Raol {sorry about the spelling} or even the freaks, but the Phantom is not left completely alone this time, like he was in the first one. He has his son, who, at the end, finally accepts him.  The show was redone recently.  I read a review of it.A lot of songs that are on this cd have been taken out, and ALW decided to make the Phantom have more of an edge to him.  But the plot, including the ending, is basically the same.  I don't think it sounds like it would be as good as how it was originally, but I've never seen it.  I think ALW will continue to make revisions.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|Listening brought me back to the future.  A newly released 1960's early 70's sound yet earily contemporary.  At times I heard Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Simon and Garfunkel, and YES,  while maintaining a sound completely their own.  A \\"back to the land\\", \\"back to oneself\\" undercurrent that slowly pulls you downstream to greener pastures and self understandings.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been exercising for more than 20+ years consistently and I must say Jillian Michaels exercise videos are the best!  Her exercise regime is designed to increase your heart and lung activity while toning muscles.  I've purchased this along with the 6 week six pack and am now back for no more trouble zones.  She keeps you motivated and her moves WORK! I use to run 5 miles a day, weights and abs which typically took me an hour and half to complete.  Now I run 3 miles 3x a week and combine it with a video 3-4x a week ~ less than an hour of exercising a day and I look great and feel incredibly strong!  I agree with another reviewer \\"SHE IS A BEAST\\"!! Buy her videos you will not be sorry!

030746363X|1.0|I've been on this diet since the book first came out. Completely followed it to the letter, because I really wanted this to work.<br /><br />Good news, it's an easy diet to follow. I do feel better, it has cut down on the grocery bills because I'm no longer buying grains, dairy or fruits, and I can control costs more easily. Mind you, I wasn't eating an unhealthy diet before; I wasn't eating junk food or monster portions, and I was cooking at home so I knew exactly what I was eating.<br /><br />Bad news, it doesn't work for us. I haven't lost an ounce or an inch in all that time. What's more, my spouse tried it, and got my exact same results; this is a more athletic, active person than me, so I would have expected at least some difference. We've re-read the book and re-read it, trying to figure out what we're doing wrong. We weigh everything and write everything down, so we know what we're eating and how much, and can spot errors. I weigh myself daily, not to obsess on weight fluctuations, but more to track overall trends so I know how I respond to changes in diet and exercise.<br /><br />There's no support. I've gone out to his site forum for help, and get no responses. Everyone wants to congratulate each other on how much weight they're losing, and if you're not losing, you're invisible. Well, in this case I can understand; if we're at sea on what's wrong, and we've tried everything that others might suggest, what else can they say?<br /><br />So the take-away: this may work for you. Obviously it's working for many people. It won't work for everyone. I'm going to continue a form of this diet for the benefits I've noted above, but weight loss and fitness? I'll go elsewhere.
B0004Z33F0|3.0|I spent a long time just trying to figure out what I should give this movie via the 5 star ranking system and i have decided three.<br /><br />While this movie is enjoyable to watch, there are some things in it that make it take a step back from the original \\"First Blood\\" and that is evident when we are watching it. For instance the little kid that takes a liking to Rambo really served no purpose except to get shot in the leg. Which irked me because it was basically a waste of screentime.<br /><br />All the action of a Rambo movie is still here, so if you like Rambo pick this movie up.

Finally, I like this controller.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|On the cutting edge of science, things are now becoming possible that used to be only the province of tales like Dr. Moreau and Frankenstein.  And in the highly authentic-feeling \\"Splice\\", the central question is, as it has been in many great tales from at least \\"Frankenstein\\" onward: with this power, will humanity be able to distinguish between the issues of \\"what can and can't be done\\" and \\"what Should and Shouldn't\\" be done?       Two scientists, excellently played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, are in the field of splicing genes from different species into one another to create new lifeforms.  Though there's a question right and there about ethics, at least the motivations are noble - trying to find cures from disease through new biochemicals, etc.  There's a striking but believable self-contradiction in the main characters right there: though they seem attached and even, at times, almost parental in their feelings toward these hybrids, they have no emotional or ethical objection against just how they use these creatures in pursuit of their goals, or in disposing of them when it comes to that.  It's when the pair goes against all guidelines and laws by adding human DNA into the mix that things get taken to a much higher level.       The result of the human-animal splice is Dren, a strange little creature that in its infancy appears alternately comical and deadly.  The researchers are initially prepared to destroy the hybrid - they never intended to let it get past the stage of an early embryo, then destroy it there and research the remains.  But among Dren's wonderous physical properties is a phenomenally fast growth rate, and by its birth that growth rate is already spinning things out of control.  Finding themselves unable to kill a newborn hybrid with human DNA and some human characteristics, they hide Dren's existance from their peers and begin to study her.  They bond quickly with Dren, with Polley's character first assuming a distinctly mother-like role to the fast-growing Dren.  As Dren grows, she becomes extremely intelligent, and the bonds within the group start to take on very disturbing overtones.       Like the Frankenstein creation, Dren - who contains not only human DNA but genes from a whole battery of creatures including scorpions, birds, amphibians, and heaven knows what else - is both the movie's \\"monster\\" and its victim.  The horror escalates - not in a \\"the world's going to end tomorrow\\" kind of way, but in a manner that sees everything going to hell in a handbasket within the main group of characters, and slowly starting to spiral out to those around them.  Among the movie's most potent fright weapons is the disturbingly plausible feeling it has - that eventually, somebody, somewhere, will go and do something like this, if for no other reason than to prove that they can.  And that the results might be just as unpredictable and ghastly as they are here.       Great special effects and a plot that takes classic themes and moves them into even more twisted territory add to the whole.  Great movie, nine out of ten.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|I adore this movie. It's one of those rare, genre-busting films that you want to talk about and recommend to everyone. Is it a vampire movie? Yes, but only superficially. It's about the end of childhood; about loneliness, made more poignant because the adults are just as lost as the children. Sometimes, it's hard to tell who is old and who is young. But, to call it an allegory is to risk turning away those who just want to see a fabulous story. This is that, for sure. A quiet one, with more chills that frights. And lots to think about.      I'm not Swedish, and I'm not familiar with many Swedish actors. But wow, what a cast! The children are incredible. I won't forget them in this, for sure. And I guess I got the version with the \\"good\\" subtitles, because they were just fine.    I watched this on Amazon Prime on the same day as Triangle, another deep, cerebral allegory on loneliness, love, and duty. Two very different movies in tone, but a heck of a double-feature. I recommend both highly.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|Graphics are ok, sounds are ok.  But game was too simple so I stopped playing after just a few minutes.  When I closed the game, the sounds continued to play.  Started game again and used task manager to kill it.  Game closed, but sounds continued still.  Uninstalled game and sounds continued.  No matter what I did, sounds would not go away.  I had to reboot my phone to get rid of sounds.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Spoilersss~  So after I had to read the first book in this series for school (The Hunger Games), I had to find out what happened next. The second book also kept me entertained with the great drama and action. But this concluding book leaves me highly dissapointed.            I never thought of Katniss as a lovable or relatable character throughout the entire series. Peeta was the character that kept me wanting more. Sadly, Mockingjay ruins this extremely interesting character by destroying his memories and thoughts. Which left only Katniss, who was, the entire time, a heartless vegetable that lost all of her innocent, peaceloving girl morals. Suzanne Collins should have added more detail to her writing, in order to at least make the main characers` deaths such as Prim and Finnick's a little bit more emotional. I still do not fully comprehend how Prim was killed. Apparently she died in an explosion, courtesy of Gale... I think.          Overall, the only motive I possesed to finish this book was to find out if either the capital or the rebels won. After the triumphant winner was declared, I also recieved the pleaure of finding out what happened to Katniss and her friends. Apparently, after reading paragraph after paragraph about what a great guy Gale was and that he was supposedly her best friend/lover, he drops Katniss like a hot potato by leaving for another district. We also never see the full extent of Annie's reaction to Finnick's death. But don't be too sad; Katniss now has a great relationship with a cat! And she marries a not quite sane and depressing Peeta, who has to wait 15 years for some kids.          Honestly, I did not like this book at all. It was poorly written on which looks like a quickly approaching due date. I wish more details were added and less main characters were killed off. Oh well, I'll still watch the movie.
0439023521|5.0|This is an amazing book. I have the other 2 in the series as well but don't want to start reading them until I get through all the other books that I'm reading right now because when I started reading this book I couldn't pay attention to anything else. I couldn't think about anything else until I finished this book either. I've only read a handful of books this good. I myself a young adult I didn't think that there was anything too bad in the book blood and gore wise but I wouldn't recommend this book for people under 10 because there are a few parts. This book is amazing and wonderful in every way if you are thinking about it think no more. Go for it!!!! HOPE the 2nd is as good as the 1st!

If you want to get a good laugh , get it when it comes on DVD , i know i will enjoy it again.

B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Greg (Zachary Gordon) has moved on to the seventh grade. He hangs out with his wimpy friends. The new girl in school is Holly Hills(Peyton List). She has long blond hair and has captured everyone's attention. Greg's friend Rowley (Robert Capron) says, \\"She's as pretty as my mom,\\" in an awkward Freudian moment. Greg's parents are the stereotypical embarrassing parents. Greg and his older brother Roderick bond in this film as they share a secret. Roderick (Devon Bostick) who is part of a garage rock band, \\"Loded Diper\\"[sic] gives his brother advice on how to get Holly's attention. And there is a talent contest in town...Rachel Harris plays the mom. She is made to look like Tina Fey in a non-threatening way. She like movies were the man chooses the maid over the super model.<br /><br />The movie contains pranks. The boys misbehave in ways we wish our kids would only misbehave. Good movie for family night entertainment as it was amusing and palatable for adults.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|TRON is a A Truly Classic `80's Movie! The movie was never given the credit it deserved when it came out in the `80's, but even if you watch it today, the special effects are absolutely stunning! Also, while I have heard that some are not a big fan of the 'story line', I personally like it, even though it is a little predictable.

B004QDNSHY|4.0|Clever modern concept stagings of opera are all very well in the right place and with the right kind of opera.  Sometimes however, it just seems perverse to take them out of their original context, particularly when the opera applies to a specific historical period or event that is explicitly referred to in the libretto.  There seems little value then in \\"updating\\" Poulenc's 1956 opera Dialogues des Carmélites away from its French Revolutionary setting or the historical incident in 1794 where sixteen nuns from a Carmelite convent in Compiègne were executed for resisting the confiscation of the Church's assets and the dissolution of the order.  You just know however that a controversial director like Dmitri Tcherniakov is never going to go down a conventional route.    What he achieves in this production of Dialogue des Carmélites recorded at the Bayerisches Staatsoper in Munich (modern-dress with no nuns in habits) is debatable but interesting.  Poulenc based the opera on a play by Georges Bernanos, which in turn was based on an original 1931 novel by Gertrud von le Fort ('Die Letzte am Schafott'), which itself used the subject as a means of commenting on German social disorder following the fall of the Weimar Republic - so it's certainly artistically valid for Tcherniakov to update the work if it's in the service of throwing a new light on the themes.  What is rather more controversial is that the director radically changes the original and really quite powerful conclusion of the opera.  Tchernaikov's finale, which practically turns the original on its head, is just as powerful and dramatic in its own right, but whether it \\"improves\\" or casts any further light on the actions of Blanche de la Force is debatable.  It could just be that it's the complete disregard of the traditional approach that is what is really shocking about the ending here, and it results in an equal amount of audible booing and cheers at the director's curtain call.     At the very least however, Tcherniakov's staging forces the audience to think about the subject again in a different way, and it's an opera that really does have a lot of deeper subtexts to be drawn out of it.  What makes this production even more worthwhile in this respect is the conducting of Kent Nagano.  The music in Dialogues des Carmélites can be a little strange and unsettling, even with some hauntingly beautiful melodies that evoke Debussy's Pelléas et Mélissande, but Nagano seems to bring out those ambiguous qualities of the opera and its similarities to Debussy even more strongly, with a greater sense of warmth and harmony than, for example the Simone Young/Nikolaus Lehnhoff Hamburg production (also on [[ASIN:B003E113HQ Blu-ray]]).  That harmony and warmth is also more evident in the singing - although not in every case - so I wouldn't necessarily say that one is better than the other, but I certainly find the interpretation here much more intriguing, creating new resonances and opening up the opera in an unexpected way.    Whether the staging works or not in a live context, it certainly doesn't come across well on DVD or Blu-ray.  The majority of the opera takes place (as you can see from the cover) within a boxed room on the stage.  This means that crossbeams frequently get in the way, obscuring the view of the singers, which is further hampered by a gauze screen that softens the image, desaturates the colours and causes hazy netting effects.  The HD reproduction of this consequently isn't good, and the encoding doesn't really help matters, looking rather blurry in movements.  Between the net effect and the encoding, this does appear to be a visually substandard release.  (Although the cover states it's a BD25 disc it is however, as you would expect, BD50 - ie. dual-layer). The audio tracks are better, the singing mostly clear, the orchestration warm and enveloping, but also revealing a good amount of colour and detail.  It's no match for the precise crystalline clarity ofthe DTS HD-MA 7.1 mix on the [[ASIN:B003E113HQ 2008 Hamburg Staatsoper]] production, and if you would prefer a more faithful version of the opera I would highly recommend that release on Blu-ray or the [[ASIN:B000TJBNOE Muti/Carsen production]] on DVD, but there are enough intriguing elements in the Nagano/Tcherniakov staging to make this certainly at least worth renting out of interest.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|300... No doubts about it., Its an awesome movie. Worth to have it your Hometheater Rack. This is been my first purchase from Amazon.com and it took almost 40days to reach me(INDIA) I had purchase it on 05May11. Unfortunately i have received in broken case situation. Packing could have been better. would appreciate if they made it good for my next purchase.
0553386794|3.0|My sister loves this series which is also being shown on HBO.  I will have to agree that the show is highlighting the most interesting parts of the book accurately with great acting and costumes.<br /><br />That being said, I felt like I was drowning in new characters.  Many of the characters had similar names along with 1-2 nicknames and titles/positions.  It took me reading 1/3 of the book to realize that Ned = Eddard Stark = Hand of the King, to King Robert (which by the way, many Kings were also mentioned in the book) = Lord of Winterfell = Warden of the North = Husband to Lady Catelyn of House Tully= sibling to Brandon and Lyanna who were murdered and Eddard was also sibling to BenJen a man of Night's watch.  So if you can imagine being introduced to 50 of these type of characters, you can just imagine how overwhelmed I was even with a poorly written Appendix in the back with most but not all of the characters in the book.<br /><br />Why a 3 instead of a 1?  The few main characters that I could remember were very interesting.  Unfortunately, some of my favorites were killed off.  I liked some of the surprising twists/plots/teasers that thankfully kept me entertained.
B004CIIXC8|2.0|The plot here is much too thin to successfully sustain a 2-hour film, although it does give the viewer some interesting sociological and anthropological insights into an underclass family of tenement-dwellers  in  modern day Britain, whose daily lives and culture are filled with profanity, rap music, alcohol and promiscuity.  Hope lost and betrayed are the central themes of this film, and they actually do elicit some sympathetic reaction.  Subtitles are needed to decipher the impossibly thick Cockney accents.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Very buggy on my tablet. It has a Tegra processor, which is known to be a problem for this game. I can't even finish the first level without the game hanging.

Beware Plants vs Zombies on tablets and Tegra based phones. Sigh.
1439297290|5.0|While I was a child, I first saw Disney's version of Pollyanna with Hayley Mills.  It was a very popular film among my age group.  I purchased the DVD on Amazon and read the reviews.  I was quite startled when I realized the several of the reviewers HATED the Disney film.<br /><br />The general theme of the criticism focused on a comparison of the book to the film.  As in most cases, the reviewers noted that the book was MUCH better than the film.  As a result, I read the book and I must agree.  The storyline in the novel is much more powerful than the film.  The book is much less melodramatic.  The characters in the book unfold in a more realistic manner.  In the book, Mrs. Snow is a secondary character while Mr. Pendleton is vital to the story.  Jimmy Bean's character is VERY minor in the book.  He is not a tree climber as suggested in the film.  Pollyanna is the tree climber and is too skilled to fall from a tree.<br /><br />It is a wonderful book to read to a daughter!  However, watching the film with a daughter is also a good experience.  We can talk about comparing the film to the book!!
B002ZG9940|5.0|This movie was simply beautiful. Dark, but beautiful.     A friend of mine also summed this up:  \\"This is what happens when Bourne/Bond GET OLD\\".    The negative reviews, no doubt, are by people looking for an action flick like a Bourne or even something as stupid as a Transformers.    If you like movies like Transformers, and your basic blow 'em up movies, this is probably NOT for you.      This is more meditative, very little dialog, and the devil is in the details.  You need to be an observant person to get the most out of this movie.  Although totally different, this movie plays more like a \\"Lost in Translation\\" -vs- \\"Bourne/Bond/RED\\" movie.
044024367X|5.0|Wow, I so totally disagree with most of the reviewers here.  This was my favorite Reacher novel.  I didn't think he injected his politics into this, and I found Reacher's views very believable.  In fact, he seemed almost human in this book.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Amazon has been trying to get me to read Kevin Kearne's Hounded, the first book in the Iron Druid Chronicles, for months. At least it keeps showing up on my recommendations list. Figuring from the cover that this was sword and sandal/historical romance type novel, I resisted and silently cursed Amazon for its complete lack of comprehension of my reading tastes.    Then this weekend I was browsing for some light reading and took the time to actually read the book description when Hounded once again turned up in my recommendations. Hmmmm ... it sounded like it might be interesting. It had some decent reviews. I took a chance and downloaded it to my Kindle then spent an entire day getting acquainted with Atticus O'Sullivan, the last of the Druids, who has been around since before Christianity.    Atticus lives in the modern world - in Tempe, Arizona, to be exact - and owns a New Age book and herb shop. He tells people he's 21, but doesn't add that he's counting the centuries, not the years. While Atticus seems to be a thoroughly modern man, he can't help but pulling his past along with him. That past includes a magical sword that he took in combat (or stole, depending on whose version you believe) from the Celtic god or love. The Celtic gods really exist (as do the gods of other religions). In the case of the former owner of Atticus' sword, this is one angry god who sends faeries and demons and witches and all manner of beasties to get it back. But Atticus isn't facing his nemesis alone. He's aided by other Celtic gods, his werewolf attorney and his pack, his feisty senior citizen neighbor, and his loyal companion, an Irish wolfhound named Oberon who has some of the novels best lines. (Did I mention that Atticus and Oberon can communicate with each other via a Druidic/telepathic link?)    Despite having a wee bit o' Irish heritage, I know next to nothing about Celtic mythology. All those tongue-twisting names tended to keep me at bay. But reading Hounded has sparked myinterest in learning more. The Celtic mythology certainly gives the book an original take on the whole urban fantasy genre and it will keep me coming back for more.    The other thing that sets Hounded apart is its humor. It's one thing to be privy to conversations between a 2,100-year-old Druid and his dog; but it's quite something else when those conversations contain references to Star Wars!
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I loved the Fame Monster release and listen to it quite frequently.<br /><br />To hear that Lady Gaga was coming out with a new album was a very exciting day.  Even more exciting when I got it for a mere $0.99.<br /><br />But even at $0.99, I felt that I deserved a lot more than the very pedestrian effort that this album received.  \\"Born This Way\\" was an excruciating cliched positive message that has been beaten wafer thin by so many artists that it rendered this song listless on arrival.  And it only gets worse from there, especially with the somewhat obsequious use of \\"gaga\\" here, there, and everywhere.  Ok, we know who you are...can you please get back to writing music worthy of \\"Paparazzi\\", \\"Bad Romance,\\" or \\"Poker Face?\\"<br /><br />What perhaps is more shameless is the apparent attempt to rake in enough sales in what could only be an attempt at saying that she sold xxx,xxx copies within the first week...not on artistic merit, mind you, but on the basis of it being offered as cheap as it was on Day One.  I can't ascribe any other reason than this and it's purely an opinion on my part as there is the fact that Amazon is touting its Cloud network as well...but it still doesn't excuse the rather poor and abhorrent music that was released.  This isn't the same Lady Gaga who impressed me so much with her debut release, is it?<br /><br />Apparently not.  I will be listening with caution with every subsequent release at best and reserve my purchase for the purely extraordinary.  Because this album isn't.
B002VECM6S|5.0|We love this movie!!!  It's so inspirational, well-written, perfectly acted and--the best part--a true story!  I hope it inspires others to serve others as selflessly as this family did.  It has something for everyone and our whole family enjoyed it.  If you allow your children to watch it (I wouldn't recommend anyone younger than 10 for many reasons), please watch it with them and use it as a way to ask questions/offer information about some of the topics addressed in the movie: adoption, differences, diversity, compassion, community service, faith, and more.  Performing community service as a family not only helps others, but you'll find that you and your family will grow stronger because of it.  Buy this and you'll love it!

0553386794|5.0|I bought this book after watching a few episodes on HBO. I read the reviews before hand and was a bit intimidated by them saying it was long and complex. I don't normally read fantasy so was hesitant. DO NOT HESITATE, it is an excellent read. It very well written and not a challenging read at all. The different characters are well fleshed out so you get to know them and their motives, the chapters are titled by character so you know instantly which character and storyline the coming chapter is about. I couldn't put the book down it was very engrossing and fast going. The book is very life like in that the characters aren't all saints or villans but shades of gray, there is also betrayal, incest, unfairness and other unpleasant human behaviors not just this happy fantasy land or all bleak doom and gloom. Also some of the characters you may like may die just as in life. I can't wait to read the next book and have now ordered the full series it will always have a place on my shelf.
B003K72YZ4|5.0|Not to spoil anything for anyone but this is a must see episode especial in light of Season 6 epsiode #7 \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\"  I like the way the writers have connected everything back together.  Make sure you watch Part 1 and Part 2 of this Season 4 show.

0060191325|5.0|This book was like a bible for me for a long time. Even now I go back to it now & then. So much useful advice about communicating with each other! Highly recommended!
B001POX73C|4.0|It's a nice story, but I got lost in some of the language.  Many phrases I had no idea what was meant, until reading them several times in several different contexts.  I would have enjoyed it more if it was written in a more modern style with touches of the old for flavor.  It took real effort for me to even follow the story at times.  It was nice that there wasn't so much sexual tension and activities throughout the book.Which is why I am giving this 4 stars.      Over all I enjoyed the book and would recommend it - just be aware that the whole thing is written in a very strong style of old English.  More so than Jane Austin's books. In my opinion.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a worthy read for those who enjoy eerie, quirky tales. At first I couldn't decide its genre: Historical Fiction? Horror? Thriller? Fantasy? Rest assured, it is a pleasant mix of all of these and more. It isn't scary per se, but I was on the edge of my seat for much of the time I spent devouring it. The author's use of vintage photographs is nothing short of genius and it would hardly have been the same story without them. My sincere hope is that there is more to the story (it definitely leaves the reader wanting more, but satisfied at the same time). Until then, I will continue to be haunted by Jacob and his friends.    I bought this book for my Kindle. It seldom happens, but Kindle books I truly enjoy I'll then buy in hard copy for my library. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will soon be on my shelf!

B004UQPM4E|5.0|Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict -- \\"Ponder this, whippersnappers: Back in the 1970s, there was no such thing as the superhero movie. Studio executives found the idea of feature films about tights-wearing crime fighters so absurd and juvenile that they refused to bankroll them. That is until, fresh off of their epic two-film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers, French film producing father-and-son team Alexander and Ilya Salkind set their sights on bringing Superman to the silver screen. To be sure, Superman was a massive pop culture icon long before the Salkinds came around. The creation of writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster (both the sons of Jewish-American immigrants), the big daddy of all superheroes had been in comic books and newspapers for nearly four decades, and had successfully made the leap to radio serials in the 1940s and television in the 1950s. Superman was as indelible in American popular culture as Mickey Mouse long before the Salkinds got their hands on the movie rights to his story. Still, even in the wake of the fantasy movie success of George Lucas' Star Wars, no one really believed that a Superman movie would fly at the box office.<br /><br />Back then, when we thought of a flesh-and-blood Man of Steel, we thought of George Reeves changing in the Daily Planet broom closet and leaping from a springboard out of the window of a plywood set on The Adventures of Superman television series. The show had been enormously popular among kids during its six-season run in the 1950s, and was still a hit among kids in the '70s (myself included), who watched it religiously in reruns. The idea of someone other than Reeves donning the blue suit and red cape was almost unfathomable--as was the idea of a Superman movie sans Leon Klatzkin's heroic theme music. In the early days of December 1978, we had no clue what the Salkinds and their director, Richard Donner (fresh off of his success with The Omen), were about to unleash on us. We couldn't imagine or anticipate how swiftly and decisively Christopher Reeve would wrench the mantle of Superman away from George Reeves, or how John Williams' amazing score--as indelible as his previous work on Jaws and Star Wars--would become so entwined with the Man of Steel in our cultural imagination that it's now difficult to even remember what Klatzkin's theme sounded like.<br /><br />Superman: The Motion Picture Anthology is a mammoth eight-disc Blu-ray box set containing all five Warner Bros. Superman features made between 1978 and 2006, including two versions of Superman: The Movie and Superman II, as well as enough extras to choke Krypto the Superdog. It's hard to imagine what more Superman fans could want. If you love these movies as much as I do (and, granted, I love Superman III and IV for entirely different reasons than I do the first two movies), then this set is a must-own.\\" Full 10,000+ word review at dvdverdict.com.e or anticipate how swiftly and decisively Christopher Reeve would wrench the mantle of Superman away from George Reeves, or how John Williams' amazing score--as indelible as his previous work on Jaws and Star Wars--would become so entwined with the Man of Steel in our cultural imagination that it's now difficult to even remember what Klatzkin's theme sounded like.

B000077VR3|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie which is strange because I typically do not like chick flicks or musical. The historical points are fairly accurate and toulousse la trec is a real person in the Bohemian revolution in France. I love this time period and the idea of Bohemian culture. There are parts that are very funny but overall this movie is a tearjerker. Ewan macgregor has a truly majestic voice and plays the role well. I can watch this movie over and over.
B002ZG9760|2.0|Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict -- \\"Beastly is a terrifying example of cinematic trendiness gone awry. For some inexplicable reason, it has suddenly become fashionable to offer new twists on familiar fairy tales. There's nothing inherently wrong with that idea, but Beastly is a film which delivers a concept at the expense of...well, everything else. This is one of the most maddeningly incomprehensible films I've witnessed lately; a movie which plays as if a 13-year-old girl and a sentient copy of US Weekly joined forces to write a screenplay via text message based on a trending twitter topic. Admittedly, I'm not the target audience for this film. However, those who dig this sort of thing really deserve better than the sort of half-baked garbage Beastly delivers. This is one ugly, irredeemable little movie, and no amount of magic is ever going to change that.\\" Full review at dvdverdict.com.

0061537969|5.0|This book is such a great tool for little life lessons. It is a coming of age story in a way we would all like to come of age. It is about striving to me more than what you are meant to be. I have highlighted so many notes and quotes from the book that my edition is practically yellow all over. Even if you don't like dogs or racing when you are done you wish it would have another 59 chapters and I promise you'll have a smile on your face.
B004LQ1XBY|4.0|Hugh Laurie, for anyone who has ever seen an episode of HOUSE, loves music. He often is seen playing parts of songs on this tv show. Well, he finally went into the studio to play songs he loves-blues from the South of the USA. He's quite good, the band is tight, and his selection of songs is interesting. Good rhythms and a CD worth owning. Particularly if you love the Blues. I recommend it to you.
006112429X|5.0|This is a brilliant novel. I don't say that lightly. I mean it. It's brilliant. And I think Lionel Shriver is a genius. Her work is like reading a mixture of Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and Dorothy Parker. She is relentless, fierce, and writes about the underbelly of the psyche. She is also lyrical. \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is not an easy read. The subject matter is daunting (a woman reflects on the signs in her son's life that would lead him to committing a massacre at her school); the voice is ruthless (with lines like when my son was born \\"I felt nothing\\"); and still, the piece is utterly compelling.<br /><br />It leads one to look at the root of evil. Is evil incarnate or is it created? Is a sociopath born or made? Should a child (essentially) be held accountable for his own monstrosity?<br /><br />It also echoes fears every mother possesses from gestation to the adulthood of a child: What if I give birth to someone who is damaged? Is it my fault? How much of a child's behavior is because of the mother?<br /><br />The novel plays on fears, but it also explores our own humanity.<br /><br />A few years ago, I was booked to narrate Shriver's \\"A Post Birthday World\\". It was, like this novel, challenging but in the end, thoroughly rewarding both intellectually and emotionally. I haven't been booked to narrate another of her books (though I so wish I would be), so instead I'm vowing to read everything she's ever written. She is not a writer that makes you feel good. No. She challenges you. She gets in your face and makes you uncomfortable. She demands that you analyze your own life and your own choices. For this reason, I can't seem to put her work down. I'm completely, reluctantly, enthralled.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|don't believe them....anyone (that is...) who rates this masterpiece of a CD less than 6 stars!  I admit I had my preconceptions going into my first listen, but...  I can honestly say that I have not heard a more impassionately brilliant collection of songs recorded well, maybe ever.   If you have a drop of passion in your soul, buy this CD.   actually buy two or three...  give them to friends...  give them to strangers...  it will make our world a much better place. :)
1419364375|5.0|I listened to the audiobook from Audible.com and was totally engrossed in the story. Each character's chapter is read by a different performer â\\" a really captivating way to present their perspectives. I love Jodi Picoult's writing, her characters, her storylines.

B004VUP8WK|2.0|I have been a Morbid Angel fan since Covenant came out.  I have seen them several times, with both David Vincent and Steve Tucker on vocals.  I waited with baited breath for this album to come out.  I can honestly say I am pretty dissapointed to say the least. The only positive I can give is that the sound is pretty full.  Too bad the songs are so damn weak.  After having listened to the whole disc through several times all I can say is I hope their next one is 1000 times better then this.  Also, if I get to see them live on tour for this album, hopefully they will play nothing off of it.
1589949811|5.0|To start off with, I am not much into LOTR.  That said, I really enjoy the game. I bought it after reading some of the reviews about how great of a co-op game this is. After I bought this we opened it up, and started playing. The rules are easy and straight forward. The box itself is decent shape and the quality is well. The ability to customize your deck if you so choose is extremely nice.   Playing through the first time, you will learn it all. We always plan on the first time being the \\"learning\\" curve, where we critique and learn from the mistakes. After that its great.   The only complaint we could really find was the 3 quests and that is it. Granted there is a little variety on some of the quests, but still.... Wish there was some more. There is however several expansions planned, and I can only imagine they will continue to improve upon the quest count.  So for 30 bucks, this is an excellent game, and each expansion being 16, I have paid much more for less.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I never saw the film in the theatre or elsewhere, and never saw the original either. I did not purchase it for the film aspects, but rather, the 3D aspect and 7.1 sound attributes. I guess you could call it a system tester. This 3D Blu-ray is absolutely perfect. The 3D is crystal clear and the sound is off the charts. If you think you have a complete A/V system, you really don't until you have this disc.
0756405890|5.0|I avoided this book (and author) despite the recommendations of several friends.  I hate to climb on an overloaded train and that means - if it's \\"too\\" popular, I usually don't like the book.  Have there been exceptions - yes, an ongoing love affair with the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien.  I prefer the swords over the sorcery.  But...I took a chance after yet another friend said \\"you've got to read this,\\" one more time.<br /><br />What a find.  The characters are well developed, the storyline is well thought out, not clever but engrossing.  In short this is some of the finest writing I have been exposed to in quite a while.  Well worth your time and money.  Whatever they paid Mr. Rothfuss, it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Don't deny yourself this opportunity to enter the world through Kvothe's eyes.  It's a pretty interesting place.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is obviously a classic movie, and a favorite of mine for decades. I was sceptical of what Blu-ray could offer, but am dumfounded as to the new life given to this classic. I have never seen this movie like this presentation, and will never watch it any other way again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Honestly, very good game. To be honest the price is very reasonable and the gameplay keeps you going for hours and it keeps you coming back for more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have enjoyed working out with this DVD. It works the spot you want without spending hours at the gym. Most of all I love doing it at home. After two straight of doing the workout on just level 1, I lost 9 pounds. If you try it, it will work for you. It took me 2 weeks to be able to do level 1 with stopping to rest and I didn't have the weights. The results showed. For fast results do the workout in the morning and evening. I did morning and evening workouts a couple times a week. I was totally satisfied with Jillian Michaels DVD. Highly reccomended!
B0000A4GAK|4.0|This is good blues, often smooth jazzy - even a little sanford and sonny in places. Great Greg Allman cameo on tears.
B000001ELL|2.0|It's a stinking hot in late January, 1980. I had amassed the princely sum of $AU4.95 and was headed to Target ( a Wal-mart type shop) in the Sydney suburbs. My object of desire was Dynasty. It was a late post-Christmas present to myself. I was the happiest kid in the whole world. I ran home and put it onto my parents outdated record player ss I heard the opening notes ... and then the lead break to the smash hit I was Made for Loving You.  You could not wipe the smile off my face. I still consider it cool that the first album I EVER bough was Dynasty by KISS.<br /><br />ABBA ruled supreme in the Aussie charts until I was Made for Loving You and blew them of the charts ... permanently.<br /><br />Clever KISS:  Clever KISS marketing strategy saw the single I was Made for Loving You the number 1 song for 1979 and album Dynasty, a chart stopping album that had longevity.  Unknown to anyone at the time, but there were to be 3 x KISS hit singles in a row !!!!<br /><br />Radio:  Like the US, KISS received little or no air play prior to I Was Made for Loving You. A little known fact to US fans especially was that KISS's whole catalogue from 1972 -78 would not have sold like 40,000 units in Australia.  Dynasty was released in May 1979 in the US and the single and I Was Made for Loving You and album Dynasy, did not hit the Australian radio play until the latter half of 1979. That is why I  was Made FOR Loving You was holiday period hit.<br /><br />Dynasty bought the band supergroup success in the Land of OZ. The second single of Dynasty, Sure Know Something was also huge.  Sure Know Something was a brief Top 10 hit.  They rushed the album Unmasked to Australia and KISS immediately they had another hit - Shandi. Ace Frehley in the extras on the DVD - Detroit Rock City - discusses the Beatles type acceptance and alludes that their 1977 success was duplicated in Australia two years later.  He further adds that they only had to play 10 shows in about thirty days to large Australian audiences and they were treated like royalty.<br /><br />Dynasty, the Album:  Dynasty is a good album and it the band appeared to have itys finger on the musical pulse of the time even though its fand did NOT.  The market had changed and KISS produced a hit album that reflected the market. Dynasty is a well produced album but the problem was that KISS's audience were dinosaurs and they had become extinct.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson gave an interview in the early 2000's where he alleges that Dynasty is the ultimate late 1970's hybrid rock album. It perfectly married the best of disco with hard rock at that time and that it has stood the test of time - I agree. Marilyn Manson refers to I Was Made for Lovin You as the ultimate cocaine disco hit.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|Look, I understand.  PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS:  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a movie for kids.  And the film is based on the books (which I am not familiar with).  And with actors the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Uma Thurman, Joe Pantoliano, and Rosario Dawson (wolf howl) it certainly has star power.  Decent special effects, lots of action. . .so what's the problem here?  Goofiness.  Plain, old-fashioned, I-can't-believe-I-just-watched-this goofiness.  Children's stories should be imaginative and innovative and inspiring and uplifting--not banal and contrived and downright silly.  After watching this predictable mess I felt embarrassed--for the children who have sat through it.<br /><br />I give the filmmakers some credit for at least exposing young audiences to Greek mythology; but the modern vs. ancient Greek worlds never really mesh, and this incoherence is augmented by, again, the relentless goofiness.  Logan Lerman is an unlikable protagonist as Percy, the loser teen who learns he's actually a demigod; and Brandon T. Jackson is merely annoying playing his sidekick Grover, a satyr who is supposed to protect him.  Everything is contrived, much of the acting feels forced, and the quest to obtain Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent the end of the world is pure nonsensical zaniness.  I hope some children got something out of PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS:  THE LIGHTNING THIEF, yet I can't help but feel the 8-year-olds watching were blushing as much as I was.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I love Radiohead and have since I saw them open for REM in the first half of the 90's before Kid A when they simply rocked.  If you listen to them Kid A and afterwards I honestly think it changes your brainwaves.  Their music entertains and soothes my mind like no other.  King of Limbs is no exception to this.  I don't know why people are giving them poor reviews ... this album is very similar to their other albums since Kid A ... closest to In Rainbows which makes sense.  They are still on their game.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|The DVD came quickly, which was great. However, there is a place in the film where there is a bit of damage to the disc, so the movie stutters a bit. I guess a little wear-and-tear is to be expected when buying used discs.
1600108512|2.0|The art in this graphic novel is wonderful.  The job of illustration is split among a variety of talented artists, each with their own way of rendering the characters and using shapes and colors to tell the story.<br /><br />However, the plot itself is almost impossible to follow as it is related here.  I have not yet read the novel, which I hear is amazing.  But in this version of the story, I was thoroughly confused and irritated by the jumping around.  A scene begins to develop, and suddenly another scene begins without explaining what happened in between.  Or characters are presented with no introduction or accompanying narrative.  They just appear and start talking and I didn't know why I should care about them or listen to them.  There is very little narrative, and it seems this story cannot be told properly through dialogue alone.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to enjoy this book, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I'll read the novel to get the real story.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I love the Series, but setting the paperback price at less then $20, while keeping the Kindle Edition at $35 is monstrous price gouging.<br />For shame, Random House.

1932907009|5.0|This book by Blake Snyder absolutely revolutionized the way I view screenwriting.  It outlines structure, genre, and creative approach in such a unique and concise way, I feel like a god among men with the information he provides.  While most of the books I've read previously offered a few nuggets here and there, every page in Save the Cat is gold-plated.  I have to give a shout out to my friend Hope Rosemary; she is the one who brought my this book to my attention and in so doing rejuvenated my passion of writing, Thank you Hope! ^_^    Chapter by chapter, it goes through the process of writing, which by his philosophy is prepping and knowing the whole story before even typing FADE IN.  He goes through the importance of the logline, how it serves at the keystone for the script.  Then he goes into genre, in that there is no such thing as an 'original' story.  a fresh take yes, but never a wholly unthought-of story.  And with his ingenious break down of genre, it makes Alien and Jaws the same movie, Point Break and The Fast and the Furious share the same beats (though that's kinda obvious), and incredibly though Saving Private Ryan and Ocean's Eleven are two entirely different movies for different audiences, they still share the exact same beats.  And those beats, 15 beats all movies share, are outlines and explained in detail what they are and why they need to be there.  Then Blake talks about how using note cards and corkboard work in tightening up and fleshing out the story from 15 beats, to 40.  Then goes on to explain the 'immutable laws of screenplay physics' where if broken, the movie is next to guaranteed to not do as well as it could simply because it doesn't make for good storytelling.  These laws include Save the Cat (the book's namesake), Double Mumbo Jumbo, and my favorite Watch Out For That Glacier!  Then once the script is written, he outlines the mistakes and mishaps that inevitably happen such as having a passive protagonist or too many sub plots orthe focus of the logline, the epicenter of the story, is not fulfilled.    This is a must read for anyone in the business, or anyone for just interested in story in general. The insights are invaluable and Blake Snyder's distinctive vision for story will shape the course of Hollywood for decades to come.
0375831002|2.0|I read this because it was nominated by my book club.  A simple and moving story about a young girl's experiences in a small town outside Munich during the first half of world war II.  The book assumes quite a lot of contextual knowledge which a young reader with little interest in WWII may not have, and i certainly lacked.  The is no explanation of the context, such as why the protagonists parents were sent to a concentration Camp, although we are told they were communists. Other than tracking the protagonists experiences, i didn't feel this book had much to offer by way of story.  Other than uncertainty around what the fate of the protagonist would ultimately be, the feeling of doom and gloom that pervaded the book, with Death as the narrator, led me to expect that pretty much everyone in the story would die a violent death.  And having Death as the narrator, which initially i found intriguing, i quickly found tiresome.  My advice to anyone buying this book is read the first 50 pages, and read on if it grabs you. Otherwise put it down, or skip to the last 50 pages.

B002WY65VU|1.0|This is a great movie as long as you don't care about a story, continuity, acting, directing and story arc. They had to spend more money on the cast and promotion than good scriptwriters or shooting the actual film. All the great ratings logged for this piece of garbage I can only attribute to the bar being lowered for the current generation of filmgoers who are so accustomed to accepting horrible films from Hollywood that they don't know a piece or crap when they see it. I won't go into the story except for one item. If most of the world's humans have been turned into zombies and those few who haven't spend all their time running from said zombies, who, praytell, is still operating the electric power plants since everywhere they go the power is still on?  In reality, every Hollywood movie is a mix of art and commerce. When the commerce side takes control, this is what happens. Amidst the drive of the studio heads to capitalize on the zombie formula, they acquired a name cast, secured several lucrative product placement deals and then forgot to include a good story which would, God forbid, provide some actual entertainment. And when was it passed into law that every Hollywood movie had to star either Jesse Eisenberg or Jonah Hill?  They are tiresome and boring.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|When I first saw this game, I thought, \\"this sounds like a rip-off of Shark! Shark! for the Intellivision\\", and indeed, the basic concept is the same, you start out as a small fish and you have to eat other, smaller fish to grow, and as you grow, you can eat bigger and bigger fish.  It also has some aspects similar to Hungry Shark.  Grow adds a number of new ideas, however, such as puffer fish which change size and powerups.<br /><br />It's a cute game, though not really one that would hold my attention for a long period of time.  My fingertips started to get a bit sore from dragging around my tablet's screen.<br /><br />The game works great on the Motorola Xoom.  The menus and start screens were a bit sluggish, but once the game itself started, it seemed to work normally.

1401923127|4.0|A former medical school professor and resident of San Francisco, California, author Bruce Lipton is a pioneering research scientist who gained prominence in the late 1970's when he pioneered research on cell membranes. This newer field of science is known as epigenetics and it forms the basis of this book: The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, and Miracles.<br /><br />Many people have heard the often promoted belief that our minds control who we are in more ways than we realize. Traditional scientific thought states that our genetic makeup controls who we are as a person and hence there is little we can do to change this predisposition. This belief that our DNA basically makes human beings hard- wired and controls our biological nature was once the common belief of scientists and was generally accepted as the conventional wisdom of the day. But Lipton believes the relationship between DNA and biology is actually in reverse. He believes that our DNA is directly influenced by signals received from outside the cell. Whether or not we have a positive or negative attitude, our personal belief system, stress conditions, and other factors directly impact DNA and thus determine who we are as people.<br /><br />Lipton is not the first person to demonstrate a strong belief that our attitudes influence our lives. Many social scientists, psychologists, motivational speakers, self- help authors, and others are firm believers in the idea of mind over matter; that we can change our environment and improve our lives significantly if we change our attitude. Lipton believes this as well, but he takes this belief to a new level, actually applying this belief to the structure of DNA cells and conducting research to prove that there is, indeed, a direct relationship between attitude, DNA change, and personal well- being.<br /><br />Many books that are scientific in nature are written in a way that makes them either confusing, boring, or a combination of the two. But The Biology of Belief is different. It is written in a way that is not only easy to understand, it also provides ammunition for those who find themselves struggling to prove specific beliefs to non- believers. The usual response from those who do not believe in something philosophical in nature is to demand that proof be presented. When there is no direct proof, the skeptic dismisses the belief outright. This book offers a means to support specific beliefs like spirituality without having any concrete proof, making the book a valuable asset to those who have a philosophical mindset.<br /><br />Thinking positively can have a significant impact on behavior and it can greatly enhance an individual's health and well- being.

But The Biology of Belief is different. It is written in a way that is not only easy to understand, it also provides ammunition for those who find themselves struggling to prove specific beliefs to non- believers. The usual response from those who do not believe in something philosophical in nature is to demand that proof be presented. When there is no direct proof, the skeptic dismisses the belief outright. This book offers a means to support specific beliefs like spirituality without having any concrete proof, making the book a valuable asset to those who have a philosophical mindset.<br /><br />Thinking positively can have a significant impact on behavior and it can greatly enhance an individual's health and well- being.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is the best Woody Allen film I've seen in years! I absolutely loved it! It's part-fantasy, part-romance, part-comedy, and part-time travel. And it brought back fond memories of American literature, film studies, and art history classes I had in college.<br /><br />The star of Allen's film is Owen Wilson, who plays Gil--a Hollywood screenwriter who is engaged to Inez (an awful materialistic blond beauty, played by Rachel McAdams). They are in Paris with her parents (who are as awful and materialistic as Inez). Gil wants to walk in the rain and soak up the romantic atmosphere of the city; Inez wants to shop and hang out in museums, and go dancing and wine-tasting with a couple, with the male an annoying, pedantic fellow. Gil really wants to finish his nostalgic novel and live in Paris, not go back to California and his movie scripts.<br /><br />Somehow, Gil winds up in the Paris of the 1920s--his \\"golden age\\"--with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Salvador Dal&iacute;, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, Man Ray, Josephine Baker, and others from the period. He even spends some time in the 1890s with Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.<br /><br />Wilson is wonderful as our romantic hero, as is Marion Cotillard, who plays Adriana (who has been a mistress of Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani). Also outstanding in other supporting roles are Kathy Bates (as Stein), Michael Sheen (as the pedantic character), Corey Stoll (as Hemingway), and Adrien Brody (as Dal&iacute;). And L&eacute;a Seydoux is charming as  Gabrielle (a love interest).<br /><br />This is a film that I will be sure to purchase when it comes out as a DVD. It is warm, funny, romantic, clever, and entertaining.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga has enthralled her fans, becoming something of an idol within a career spanned over only a few years. She's entranced, and occasionally alienated the public with her outspoken antics, and (subjectively exciting) unusual way of dressing, and her theatrical staginess have made her a voice impossible of tuning out.     In her third studio album, \\"Born This Way\\" does more than you would expect it to. First of all, it's an extremely powerful sound, that, while not new for Gaga, is something you can't easily ignore. Second of all, it's much more eclectic than you would imagine it to be, with songs featuring a Latin beat (\\"Americano\\"), her \\"Evita\\" number (\\"Bloody Mary\\"), her take on female empowerment (\\"Scheiße\\"), and one power-anthem with a vaguely country-western sound (\\"Yoü And I\\"). Incredible songs like these separate her from the Britneys or the Christinas or the Ke$has of the world. As many of you know, Miss Stefani Germanotta writes her own lyrics, and music. Being only twenty-five years old, she appreciates, and takes from the classics much more than you would expect a musician her age to do. She borrows from elements such as heavy metal and opera, without compromising her signature sound.     She also proves to those who don't already believe so, that she is a musician not to be messed with. There's raw, focused talent here. Lyrical talent, and she proves that she has a powerhouse voice, and an undeniably wide vocal range. She can go anywhere with her voice, and she has just about one of the best in the business right now. If she didn't have such an affinity for elaborate stage shows, she could sit on a stage with just her voice and a piano, and could blow the audience away all the same. She's that good.    The one bad thing one could say about \\"Born This Way\\" is that it's not terribly original. Gaga takes alot from music that has already been done, but she takes alot from music that has been crafted YEARS ago. She nods  Whitney Houston in \\"Fashion ofHis Love\\", makes a big, beautiful Queen-esque power ballad (\\"Yoü And I\\"), that you could easily picture a group of fans singing along in a crowded stadium, waving their lighters in unison. There also isn't a standalone single in this album that would be thought of, when anyone remembers this album, a la \\"Bad Romance\\". These 17 songs are a collaborative effort, each one of them bringing emotion, gusto, and something different to the table. Not all of the songs sound the same, which is also something that can't be said for the Britneys and the Ke$has of the world.    Here are the standouts, in my mind, in no particular order.    1) THE EDGE OF GLORY - In my mind, the best song on the record, for many reasons. It's metaphoric, it's extravagant, it's meaningful, and it's damn catchy. It's a song that you could easily picture being played in the clubs of the world, because it has a peppy enough dance beat, but there's a beautiful meaning behind it, which is displayed pretty heavily in the song. \\"The edge of glory\\" means the edge - the cliff - the line between life and death. It's a song she wrote for her late grandfather, after he passed away. The song even begins with a sound of a heartbeat, and ends with that of a flat-line. It couldn't be more beautiful.    2) SCHEIßE - \\"I don't speak German, but I can if you like\\", she squeals. This song will haunt you, and will be caught in your head for weeks, and here is why. It's about female empowerment, and how women feel restricted, and as if they need \\"permission\\" just to be strong in their own lives. Part of the hook is in German, and will be a hard to forget. It's an anthem for female empowerment. One of the best since Helen Reddy's \\"I Am Woman\\".    3) THE QUEEN - This song is a standout because it begins with church bells -- CHURCH BELLS IN A POP RECORD! It begins as a pop anthem about a woman recapturing her identity. \\"I can be the queen you need to be, this is my chance to be the dance, be braver, you'll see\\", she proudly pronounces. The song's last two minutes slow it down a little, becoming a gorgeous ballad, beautifully showing off Gaga's powerhouse vocal range, with a beautiful guitar solo, reminiscent of something Jimi Hendrix might have done.     4) BAD KIDS - A big part of \\"Born This Way\\" is Gaga reassuring her fans, many of whom are looked down upon, seen as freaks, and outcasts. In \\"Bad Kids\\", Gaga claims that she is nothing more than any one of her fans. \\"I'm a brat, I'm a selfish punk I really should be smacked. My parents tried, until they got divorced, 'cuz I ruined their lives\\", she claims in \\"Bad Kids\\". She says alot in this song, which may or may not be true, but either way, it's one of the best on the album.     5) HAIR - This is the antidote to the in my opinion, overplayed, title single \\"Born This Way\\". Both songs portray the same theme, to be proud of who you are, no matter what, and to \\"let your freak flag fly\\". However, in \\"Hair\\", the dance beat doesn't become obnoxious. There's a beautiful saxophone interlude, along with the highly quote-ready lyrics. \\"I've had enough, this is my prayer, that I'll die living just as free as my hair\\", she proclaims. That's a strong thing to say. I can really appreciate lyrics like these.    6) YOÜ AND I - I can't say enough good things about this song. It's a lyrically beautiful anthem about love lost, and wanting to recapture what you once had. It's deeply personal, more than likely about Gaga's relationship with her on-again-off-again relationship with Luc Carl. It has country and western, and heavy metal influences, and lyrics that remind you why Gaga is a superstar. Her voice soars in this song. It's \\"Born This Way\\"'s answer to \\"Speechless\\" from \\"The Fame Monster\\". It's memorable as ever. It's been performed at Monster Balls around the world, and it will hopefully be performed at every tour she does from now on. It's one of my favourites.    HONORABLE MENTIONS: \\"Marry the Night\\", \\"Government Hooker\\", \\"Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)\\", \\"Americano\\", \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\", \\"Judas\\", and \\"Electric Chapel\\".    And, I could go on and on about which songs, in my opinion, are the best, because these aren't all of them. Every song brings its own qualities, and as I said, it's a collaborative effort, and none of the seventeen tracks on the special edition of \\"Born This Way\\" are to be missed. The remixes on the second disk bring their own special something to the table as well. The remixes are great for workouts, and listening while exercising. Every one is a gem in its own way. Oddly enough, the title track \\"Born This Way\\", which we've all heard by now, is probably the weakest on the album. Maybe that's because I've heard it so much, and it's worn on me, or maybe it's not. Although, I predict it's going to be a very long time before I quit listening to this album.
B000AP04OM|5.0|\\"The Sound of Music\\" is one of the best family movies! It is full of fabulous, sing-a-long songs. You are never too young or too old to enjoy this movie. Though \\"The Sound of Music\\" is based on the von Trapp family's life and not a documentary of the von Trapp life, it is still entertaining.
B004XUD762|5.0|\\"The Song Remains Not The Same\\" is a great cd to kick back with your friends and have a few cocktails.  Had the pleasure of seeing Zakk warming up on the piano with \\"Darkest Days\\" during soundcheck and it was amazing.  \\"Can't Fine My Way Home\\" is another one of my favorites on here.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Although it didn't review well, this is a great movie.  I think Hollywood was expecting a more liberal \\"rob from the rich and give to the poor\\" mentality but what they got was kind of the opposite, with Robin Hood fighting against high taxes and protecting citizens from an unjust government. Regardless of your political affiliations, this is a great movie.  The combo pack is especially helpful if you have a Blu Ray player but want to watch the movie at a friend's house on DVD, etc.  The director's cut doesn't add much, though.  I only noticed one short additional scene, though it's a scene that definitely never should have been cut from the theatrical version of the film.
B004Y1QKKK|1.0|This complete collection is missing 29 poems and 19 essays by Oscar Wilde - A far cry from complete.

B003LR5BD0|5.0|It would be easy for overlook this film because it's so quiet. A heinous crime in a sleepy little town in the middle of nowhere. Who cares? But inside this story lies the path to evil. One small gesture, leads to a small crime that suddenly leads to murder. How did we get here? What happened? How did this happen? Detective Dormer is called in to small town Alaska to solve the crime in a town so small that everybody knows everyone. Some things go wrong and now Dormer is on the defensive and the killer is stalking him.    Inside this story is the path to hell. Small things, bigger things, really large things and now murder may be your only way out. These people never saw this coming. And these are damaged people. They all have a dark back-story and they all pretend at civility but there's a reason they're living in that small town. They have secrets.  This is a psychological thriller that while well written is quite deliberate in its pace. The beauty of the Alaskan countryside is breathtaking but never forget that this is a rugged land filled with predators.
B00003IPFK|5.0|True to form...Duvall and Jones come through with great performances.  Great story line.  Loved Angelica Huston's performance as well.  I would buy it again.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Viewed as stand-alone episodes, Fringe might fall into the CSI/horror genre with exploding bodies, viral outbreaks, etc. However, its creators chose to develop Fringe as an episodic storyline about the ultimate reality of our universe. They do have a couple of ground rules: First there are no aliens working behind the scenes, and second there is no fantasy, magical events or people with super-powers. All events are grounded in science - although it sometimes becomes a bit far-fetched.    One of the problems with viewing the episodes weekly is that it's easy to miss the numerous and subtle interconnecting plot threads. This where the DVD set becomes useful: in freeze framing key plot events and scanning backwards to earlier revealing dialog. The series is basically a mystery that is being solved by the heroine Olivia (Anna Torv) which has complex elements throughout. For example, The Observer character, which appears in a few episodes, actually makes fleeting appearances in every episode that are difficult to detect. These appearances are well-documented on the Internet at [...] and also   [...]. Also, the mysterious graphic images that appear at commercial breaks are actually a code that spells out a word for each episode. The decode chart can be found at [...].     Perhaps Fringe's best attributes are it's quality special effects that aren't overly-reliant on CGI and the character development. George Lucas (who was in film school at USC during the same years that I was studied engineering there) remarked that special effects are not enough to sustain a film - you need memorable characters that the audience can invest in. Fringe does well in this regard with quality actors and engaging dialog for their ensemble cast - especially for the characters of Olivia and Walter. Season 1 does very well in presenting Fringe's overall premise, with [[ASIN:B002JVWRD6 Fringe: The Complete Second Season]] sustaining the momentum.
B001C4AFOY|2.0|This movie was not at all what I expected.  It was short in duration, left many important parts of Victoria's life dangling.  The costumes were however, very nicely done.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Not content to rest on her laurels, Stevie has revved up her mojo on her new 2011 CD, \\"In Your Dreams,\\" partnering with Dave Stewart (who co-produces brilliantly with Glen Ballard). They co-wrote many of the songs on the album, Stewart wrapping some amazing melodies around Nick's often etheral, moody, poetic lyrics. The steady guidance of Ballard is felt in the often breathtaking production. Several songs were also written by Nicks solo (the best of which \\"Moonlight, A Vampire's Dream\\" needs to be released as a single NOW!)and another with Mike Campbell of (Tom Petty and) the Heartbreakers (a great ballad, \\"For What It's Worth\\"). Typically, the label decided to release the least interesting tune as the first single (the sweet but slight \\"Secret Love\\"). There's a lot of depth in music here: the percussive title track, the roiling \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" the romantic \\"Italian Summer,\\" a riveting ode to soldiers recovering from the wars at Walter Reed Hospital (a great duet with Lindsay Buckingham, \\"Soldier's Angel\\"). Speaking of which, yes there is much Stevie-signature imagery here (ghosts through fog, ladies from mountains, angels, clouds, dreams) but don't be fooled. This is the work of a mature artist still ripening and stretching her limits. You owe yourself a listen. Live with it a little and you wont be able to stop listening.
B004LWZWEC|4.0|First of all, the movie is great.  I consider Bon Scott to be the best rock frontman that ever lived.  So if you are getting this for the movie, you will not be disappointed.  The extras, on the other hand, are very weak.  All the extra \\"footage\\" is other peoplt talking about AC/DC.  I expected more real video of Bon and the band.  I would have gladly paid $20 for just the movie instead of having to buy this \\"collectors\\" edition.
0143038583|5.0|I read this book slowly for two reasons.  One, almost every sentence is significant; and two, because the richness of Pollan's language invites savoring.<br /><br />I concluded years ago that it is unethical for me to eat the flesh of animals I could not bring myself to kill.  I was raised on a farm, and found the \\"processing\\" of animals I'd helped raise from birth extremely disturbing.  Our animals' lives and deaths, however, were blissful compared to modern-day feedlots and cage facilities.<br /><br />While I don't plan to go back to eating meat, I was grateful for Pollan's insight into compassionate animal husbandry and hunting for food (as opposed to trophy), which helped me understand the thinking and emotion behind it.<br /><br />The effect of monoculture corn farming on our environment is alarming, but Pollan never loses sight of the fact that farmers are merely growing what the commodity markets demand so farmers' families can -- hopefully -- pay their bills, and do it all again next year.<br /><br />I found the writing to be both objective and personally insightful, moving but not maudlin.  If you are deeply interested in what you eat and where it comes from, you must read this book.

B000024IJD|5.0|Otis Redding was born in Dawson, GA. His family moved to Macon  when Otis was five. He sang in a choir there and as a teen won a local talent show 15 consecutive weeks. Hia earliest influence was fellow Maconite (Little) Richard Penniman. He joined Johnny Jenkins & the Pinetoppers around 1960. During one of their '62 studio sessions, Otis recorded a song he wrote called \\"These Arms of Mine.\\" It was a Top 20 hit for VOLT Records but more importantly, this single launched Redding's solo career.<br /><br />After much r&b chart success over the next five years, Otis Redding died in a plane crash in December of 1967. He was 26. Within a few weeks of that tragic accident, Redding's biggest hit, the title song of this collection of twenty tracks, \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\\" reached #1 on American pop charts.<br /><br />This album is a fine compilation of many of Otis's best recordings. Seven of the twenty are monaural. A faint tape hiss is evident in spots, but it's not intrusive (heavy filtering would've been, IMO). NOTE: The \\"live\\" version of \\"Shake\\" was the charting single.

0316056863|5.0|I have only been vaguely familiar with Tina Fey as an SNL character (and Sarah Palin look alike) and didn't even realize before picking up this book that she is also the woman behind 30 Rock.  I didn't realize that she started in an anything but glamorous position after graduating from college, slowly moving on to Second City and then SNL before writing and directing 30 Rock.<br /><br />This book made me a big fan of Tina Fey.  It is one thing to be a comedian, but to be an intelligent one who can write and give candid insight into life as a mom, daughter, wife and boss is quite another.  I laughed out loud while reading Bossypants.  I was thinking about the book during work and whenever I wasn't devouring every last word.  It was a quick read and a relief from the dry read I'd been on for weeks.  It's unlike any traditional memoir I've ever read, but flows together without a hitch.<br /><br />What made this a five star book for me was the way that Tina Fey managed to tackle \\"the big issues\\" for women of all ages - from childhood events like puberty to young mother events like breast feeding and dealing with the in-laws - with humor.  The part on being a working mom is phenomenal.  (Note:  I am not a working mother or even a mom yet, but I loved her insight into the subject and felt like someone FINALLY addressed a tough issue and gave some honest feedback).<br /><br /> I think this is a good read for a woman of any age or a man who has attained some degree of maturity.
B0002KVULG|3.0|i just saw this version for the first time, and it's not bad, but it's not my favourite adaptation of the novel. That honour goes to Bram Stoker's Dracula, released in 1992, as it's the closest to the book. I don't see why this film version is rated R, as there's nothing overtly graphic, except at the beginning, and even then, it's mild compared to crap like Scarface (1983). Frank Langella, Sir Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasance were spot-on as Dracula, Doctor Seward and Professor Van Helsing. Purists beware: the story here has been changed even more so than in the 1931 version, which is quite good, but everyone has their preference as to which version of Dracula is the best.
B004I11VZ0|3.0|If you're a fan of the first installment; you'll like this one, but you won't think that it is better than the first.  Good story line and enjoyable movie, but just not as intriguing and engaging as the first.
0385341008|2.0|Just Like My Momma's Pie<br /><br />Overall, I like my mother's cooking.  She's gotten more creative over the years, and eating what she's prepared gives me a nice, homey feeling.  However, I've always been a bit hesitant about my mother's desserts, particularly her pies.  They always come out far too sweet for my taste, because she adds lots of sugar to berries that are already naturally sweet.<br /><br />This book is a lot like my mother's pie.  It looks pretty, the crust is warm and flaky, but one bite and the filling sends you into a diabetic coma.<br /><br />Juliet Ashton is an English authoress extraordinaire with writer's block.  Through some crazy circumstances (one of her sold books gets into the hands of pig farmer, Dawsey), she gets in contact with the citizens of Gurnsey, an island in the English Channel--particularly the citizens in the Gurnsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society  and learns how they formed and survived the war.<br /><br />I am not opposed to charming, quirky, upbeat books set in small, agrarian towns with lots of charming, cute, quirky characters.  I grew up reading Anne of Green Gables, Laura Ingalls Wilder, and others.  But this book isn't like the others I mentioned.  Instead of feeling like a quirky town, I feel like I am forced into a manufactured artificial sugar mill, having my emotions purposefully tweaked and pulled to suit the authors' whims.<br /><br />The characters are all incredibly flat, boring, and one dimensional.  Our protagonist, Juliet, is flaming Mary Sue Number 1.  I had to suffer through so many over-the-top descriptions of how charming, upbeat, perky, spunky, free-willed, and feminist she is, I was gagging and crying for something salty.  Everyone loves her; she is perfect at everything; she immediately makes friends with everyone; those she doesn't immediately befriend end up being bad, bad, horrible people who all get their come-uppance in the end.  In no way is Juliet a real character; she has absolutely no flaws whatsoever.<br /><br />But worse than Juliet is Flaming Mary Sue 2: Elizabeth.  Everything that goddamn woman did was worshipped by the all the \\"good\\" people.  She was only a servant girl, but OF COURSE, she could do whatever she wanted, slap people around, sleep around, have an illegitimate child, sleep with a German, defy authorities, and be superwoman in FRAKKIN' everything and everyone STILL loves her and worships her and is SO UPSET that she is gone.  This woman, more than anyone else in the ENTIRE cast, drove me up the wall bonkers, and I HATED each and every time she was drug into the story (which was CONSTANTLY).<br /><br />The rest of the cast is rounded out with more flaming stereotypes or boring, one dimensional characters.  We have our ONE AND ONLY GERMAN who is a good guy and can feel pain (because, as we all know, ALL GERMANS in the Nazi army cannot feel pain).  We have our American @sshole who tries to bully our spunky heroine into marriage.  We have our quriky witch wannabe, who LOVES \\"Wuthering Heights\\".  We have our self-righteous prude, who is bad because she doesn't worship the beloved Goddess, Elizabeth and is okay to pick on to people you barely know because she's EVIL.  We have lots of charming farmers, who are somehow ALL trained in reading and comprehending this classical literature and they LIKE IT.  We have CUTE CHILDREN, who are wise beyond their years and OH SO CHARMING to everyone and IMMEDIATELY get all adults to fall in love with them (GAG ME!!).  Oh, and we even have a homosexual just to show how TOLERANT this 1940's crowd is.  There is no one in this entire cast that bears a modicum of resemblance to real people.<br /><br />The letter writing is gimmicky.  Around 90% of the letters sounds like they are written by the exact same person (which, in a sense, they were: the author).  The only ones I could tolerate were the ones written by the lady who read the cookbook (now THAT was brilliance!  I absolutely adored her devotion andlove for cooking and her comparisons to reading) and one or two farmers that ACTUALLY sounded like they were farmers, with imperfect grammar and regional cadences.  Not to mention, I was often confused reading these letters.  Apparently, not all letters were related in this novel, as Sidney doesn't respond to Juliet near enough and some of Juliet's replies indicate she's received letters or sent letters we don't read.  And also, the dates on the letters were COMPLETELY Bogus.  Juliet is complaining a month after Sidney has broken his leg about his injury?  Broken legs take MONTHS to heal.  Juliet can send and receive letters from Australia in TWO WEEKS?!  WOW, that mail delivery service is, in some ways, better than NOW.  Juliet is going to Gurnsey after knowing about these people for a mere few months?  Mark is pushing for marriage after barely knowing Juliet 4 months?  I call foul.  These aren't the actions of people in the 1940's; these are the actions of people in the present day.<br /><br />The actual plot is almost non-existent.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; Anne of Green Gables didn't have a plot, per say, and was more a character novel.  The problem with this book was the character growth was poor or non-existent and the events and revelations were almost bland.  We know almost from the onset that Juliet won't be with Mark; her Romantic Plot Triangle was unnecessary to the T.  Otherwise, Juliet doesn't change at all, and neither do any of the other characters--they are all as perfect and wonderful as they started out being.  By this time, there have been so many books and movies and memoirs about the atrocities of World War II and the Third Reich, I almost say we are immune to it and nothing this book say about this time period is likely to knock us out.  Concentration camps?  Yup, Corrie Ten Boom.  Hiding Jews?  Yup, Anne Frank.  German Occupation?  Yup, pick, your WWII medium.  If anything, the book comes out weak on these areas.<br /><br />And, by the way, why are people in 1946 so keen on writing books about the experience in WWII?  Do people really come out of a war and want to write memoirs and books about how people got out of a war?  Don't they usually wait like 20 years before they write their tome?  I don't know, it just felt odd to me.<br /><br />I don't want to sound like I hated this or I found this to be the worst book ever.  As I said above, there were a few letters that truly did sound unique.  I loved the letter from the cookbook lady (I can't remember her name, she only wrote one letter).  I also found that this novel made me aware of A) an island that I didn't realize existed, and B) the reactions of people to events that have become almost overdone in modern times.  Also, the writing was fairly easy to read, the pace quick, and the story short.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn't in the mood for something so light and frothy.  Maybe I am tired of reading about WWII.  I don't know, but this book was tiresome to get through, and I nearly got cavities from all the sugar in these pages.  Perhaps if you want to read a lighter take on WWII, this would be a good book for you.  As for me, I need to get to the dentist to fill in these cavities and switch to some ruffage.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*farmers that ACTUALLY sounded like they were farmers, with imperfect grammar and regional cadences.  Not to mention, I was often confused reading these letters.  Apparently, not all letters were related in this novel, as Sidney doesn't respond to Juliet near enough and some of Juliet's replies indicate she's received letters or sent letters we don't read.  And also, the dates on the letters were COMPLETELY Bogus.  Juliet is complaining a month after Sidney has broken his leg about his injury?  Broken legs take MONTHS to heal.  Juliet can send and receive letters from Australia in TWO WEEKS?!  WOW, that mail delivery service is, in some ways, better than NOW.  Juliet is going to Gurnsey after knowing about these people for a mere few months?  Mark is pushing for marriage after barely knowing Juliet 4 months?  I call foul.  These aren't the actions of people in the 1940's; these are the actions of people in the present day.    The actual plot is almost non-existent.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; Anne of Green Gables didn't have a plot, per say, and was more a character novel.  The problem with this book was the character growth was poor or non-existent and the events and revelations were almost bland.  We know almost from the onset that Juliet won't be with Mark; her Romantic Plot Triangle was unnecessary to the T.  Otherwise, Juliet doesn't change at all, and neither do any of the other characters--they are all as perfect and wonderful as they started out being.  By this time, there have been so many books and movies and memoirs about the atrocities of World War II and the Third Reich, I almost say we are immune to it and nothing this book say about this time period is likely to knock us out.  Concentration camps?  Yup, Corrie Ten Boom.  Hiding Jews?  Yup, Anne Frank.  German Occupation?  Yup, pick, your WWII medium.  If anything, the book comes out weak on these areas.    And, by the way, why are people in 1946 so keen on writing books about the experience in WWII?  Do people really come out of a war and want to write memoirs and books about how people got out of a war?  Don't they usually wait like 20 years before they write their tome?  I don't know, it just felt odd to me.    I don't want to sound like I hated this or I found this to be the worst book ever.  As I said above, there were a few letters that truly did sound unique.

0375703861|1.0|I was traveling to London for two weeks and saw this book recommended highly as a current composite on British life.  In short I regret the time I spent reading it.  It is a mass of stereotypes, disjointed stories and poor writing.
B003NX76BM|2.0|The last NR books I read were her Wedding series.  This book was another disappointment. Fiona seems to be the typical NR protagonist.....self sufficient, organized, bitchy woman with some major issues or a chip on her shoulder. At least in this case, her issues are legitimate.  Then enter the male character, Simon.....what are his issues?  We will never know because as typical in most NR novels the male characters are never fully developed.  The only aspect of the book I liked was the dog training descriptions and some of the S&Rs. They inspired me to do more obedience training with my dog. Otherwise the book is too long, the characters, except for Fiona - one dimensional, and the sex, lacking romance.  Actually 2.5 stars because I liked Jaws.  I can't wait for the next Lisa Kleypas novel.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It took me a few episodes to get into this show. At first I found the sex and violence a bit graphic, but probably 4 episodes in I got into the storyline and forgot any concerns that I had. I knew I was hooked when I found myself saying 'I can watch another episode, it's only 4 a.m.'    This show has a great campy, horror show-esque feel to it that's so different from other things on TV. At first I found Sookie to be very annoying, but she grew on me and as the series progressed I found her less and less irratating.    The best thing about the show (other than the gorgeous cast) is the way that completely out of this world things are handled on a very down-to-earth manner. Is it completely unbelievable at times? Yes, but it's such a great way to escape your everyday problems.     If you're on the fence about True Blood, I say give it a try...and don't give up after the first few episodes. It's worth it!
0061134007|5.0|That's the spell Nesbo weaves and to which the reader willingly succumbs.  The never-ending confounding facets of human nature and history, paired with the evocative backdrop of Norway and the exquisitely drawn characters that people Nesbo's landscape rise and fall, shift and realign in a kaleidoscopic puzzle of mystery, loss and love.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|19 is alright, but I am real excited to get 21!  Already love 4 songs off the CD.  It should arrive today.
B004EPYZOY|2.0|I don't know but I think this time I learned my lesson. This movie is a waste of money and time, both of which I will never get back. Stupid cheesy 3d effects, terrible special effects (explosions superimposed, being able to easily tell it was shot using the green screen) don't waste the time with this.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|I tried hard to watch this, but I kept falling asleep.  The movie is dark in its filming, but not in its characters.  So the filming puts you into a mood the characters and action does not really support.  And speaking of action, this moving is terribly lacking.  The previous potter movies were action packed with all sorts of jokes and interactions.  This movie has some action, then it goes on some long drawn out hiatus.  The characters blink onto some deserted island or forest, and its totally barren.  And they sit there and look at each other for like 5 minutes.  I just can't get into it.  Seems like this is how they stretched two movies out of this.  By putting in all this dead time.<br /><br />Then the tension between the 3 main characters seems forced and strained.  Its unnatural, based on the previous films.  Even if there is some underlying magical reason for it, it does not come across right.  Even the story.  The way this begins with characters that are not really bad, being in league with bad characters is awkward.  The whole story is not a natural evolution from the previous ones, its totally out of left field.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because it actually has a plot in there.  It had acceptable acting, and good sets.<br /><br />I might have enjoyed it if I did not expect so much from it.  That expectation did not hurt my view on the previous entries in the series.  This one just fails.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I only have used this maybe 15 times. I have it in a drawer under my LED flatscreen that I take out only when I have watched movies from my computer. So around 25-30 hours of usage total. It still works, but you have to jiggle it for it to finally connect. I guess bad wiring. Shows no sign of external damage and it really hasn't had any wear and tear on it. First item purchased on Amazon that's ever been a dud.
B00125WAWS|5.0|The film takes an audience expecting a story about debating and really explores the racism that affected America in the 1930s.  The situations and stark reality of the treatment of blacks in the south and throughout America is really driven home in this Denzsel Washington film; I used it in the highschool class that I teach, and the students found it thought provoking and a source for discussions on multiple levels: specch, history, film techniques.  highly recommended
1416562605|4.0|Fantastically written book. Acidly funny, compelling and beautifully dark. I found it difficult to put the book down as I was fascinated to see how Balram would fillet his next upper-class victim. Adiga has a talent of describing in very plain language the struggles of growing up poor in India. He also does an excellent job of ripping religion, and confronting some of the new truths being defined by an increasingly global economy. Corruption is another theme omnipresent in this novel and Adiga's treatment is raw and in your face. Follow Balram as he leaves behind the Darkness through a web of lies, murder and deceit...the Light is not only for the politically connected, it is also for those willing to break a few heads.
B004XZR63M|1.0|Kiyosaki is the type of author that gives the rest of the modivational and investing group a bad name.  I read parts of RDPD and was appalled at his suggestions.  Lies, fraud and felonies is hardly the way to become wealthy.  For some more background on what a snakeoil saleman he really is, read John Reed's review, it will open your eyes.    [...]    For those who understand, no explanation is needed.  For those who do not understand, no explanation is possible!
B004I11VZA|3.0|Ip Man 2 proves to be an odd bag of goodies.  There is less action than the original, and what action there is tends to be more slow-motion than the frenetic full speed onslaught of the original.  That said, this is a handsome production that certainly looks and feels like its predecessor.  Overall, worthy of a rental, but for me, not a keeper.  I don't see myself coming back to this one with anywhere near the frequency that Ip Man lures me back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the mockingay is amazing, i was gled to it i mean it my mom was screaming at me, my sister was tapping me and i couldn`t hear them and i didn`t even notice my sister tapping me because i was in the part were prim died.
B003UESJEM|5.0|Excellent casting and many heartfelt reality moments.  In this day and age, many unemployed can learn important lessons in leaving your pride at the doorstep when it comes to employment opportunities.  The story line will ring true to many...and yes, the loss of a job is significant, but don't rely on yesterdays income...focus on tomorrows new earnings.  Great movie!
030746363X|5.0|Want to get to the essence of what it takes to make over your body? Look no further than 4HB. Little fluff, get right to the point,and Tim Ferris is a pretty entertaining author as a bonus. Buy the book, buy it NOW!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|OMG great movie and i fell it for quickly i loved how the young boy feel for the vampire girl and he never knew she was a vampire and she walked in snow with no shoes and i knew that she had something not right about her but thats all i am going to say you need to buy to see it cause its great Thanks
0789310627|2.0|I thought this was a legitimate book on London, i.e., Foders, but it was a childrens book.  Be careful not to make the same mistake.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Definitely a solid outing though of unremittingly dour tones. The story has been effectively outlined by many reviewers and needs no further exposition. I like the reference to dustbowl photography as, while watching, it felt like Walker Evans had stepped into hillbilly hicksville to unwind a contemporary plight. The homemade feel of this movie is crucial to its narrative. The actors (though I confess my Aussie ears have difficulties with some of the articulation and regional patois) seem so natural, as if they'd been lifted from the location with uncanny ability to deliver the script. It's a tough survival story and the lead girl shines throughout weathering the violence of kith and kin in this closed community; every bit as gripping and tense as the ghettos of The Wire.
0545265355|5.0|Great story from beginning to end! Collins is a very talented writer who can paint a picture of devastation or loss with only a few sentences.  At times I found it hard to believe this book is technically in the category of 'young adult'.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|My first impression wasn't great. The outer box it was shipped in was fine. But, the factory box was a little flimsy looking. When I opened it though, everything was packed tight and was fine. I am able to hook up my iPod and/or laptop to a speaker and it works fine. When trying to use with those devices and go through a main board though, could have used some more instruction in the manual. Overall, a good product that with more experience or maybe more technical manual instructions, will do exactly what I need it to do. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers, an on/off switch would be very helpful.
630542845X|5.0|This movie is a haunting reflection of how much mankind needs to grow up.    I recommend this for any teenager (or those of like mind) who think they know the answers to everything.    An excellent movie
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Although it doesn't sound very interesting from the title, as who would think plants would male good zombie killing weapons, it is unbelievably fun. I was addicted to this game after the first level.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I agree with other watchers.  This may be aimed at teenagers, but I am no where near that age and (older) and know a lot of ladies that like it that are also older.  I watched it once and was hooked.  bought season 1 and am waiting for season 2 to be released. I also think these kids should graduate high school and go to college....that would be a bit more realistic....considering there is such a large age range watching it.
0316098329|3.0|My girlfriend made a list of five books to pick from, and from the brief overview \\"The Room\\" sounded the most thrilling and entertaining. However, I did not enjoy it as much as I had expected.     I found that reading the book was somewhat cumbersome. It was quite creative to write from the perspective and voice of a 5-year old. But it was hard to really get into because of it. Around the 2nd third of the book, I found myself pulled into the book, staying up late to keep reading. But suddenly, the book became a bore and I only finished it because I felt like I had to.     Bottomline: I was disappointed after reading all the hype.
0312330537|5.0|I'm an avid reader, and this has got to be the best book that I've read in years. It amazes me how some people on here are just picking the book apart piece by piece just to find things wrong with it. People - the book is LOOSELY based on events that have happened in his life. Of course there are some things that are exaggerated...that's what makes for an even more interesting and suspenseful read...just like in the movies. I fell in love with every single character...even the ones that pissed me off, but that's what makes for a good book - one that has you going through a rollercoaster of emotions and then learning from them. And speaking of which, this book is being turned into a movie soon with Johnny Depp playing the lead! In any event, just like with all of James Frye's books, this author speaks in a language that keeps the reader wanting more...hence the reason why we all got through the 900 plus pages...even you nay sayers and bad reviewers. So obviously he's done something right!
1439102724|1.0|This is the first review I have ever written on anything. So sad I can't give it zero stars.    I love most of her books and respect all I have read.  This is so shockingly tasteless....40 pages on a detailed stillbirth miscarriage.  Things about baby in refrigerator at the hospital.  Who would want to read this disrespectful crap? Usually her detail provides perspective but any of the 70% of women who have had miscarriages would find this so painful and the ones who have not benefit none and do not need the gory details to get the point.    The cd is just laughable.    I will never read another Jodi pic colt book.
B003EYVXXW|1.0|it is an attempt to discuss science vs religion; which is a topic that should bode great movie material.  but ...this movie is not realistic, storyline not believable, plot is thin.  especially stupid is a script that repeats the same dialogue over and over; weak effects, and non-realistic make-up where the actors always look clean as if straight out of a salon.  if you want to watch a movie that should have been a television broadcast, this is it...
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Excellent movie.  Steve McQueen did a great job in the roll of Papillon.  I read the book a week before watching the movie and they did a great job, even if they had to consolidate or combine different occurances in order to keep the movie as short as possible and still tell the story.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Having read some of your reviews I think many of you are reacting to a product that still hasn't been released. So far we have very little tangible information about the picture and sound quality of the films, so we are only speculating what comes from different movie freaks sites.<br /><br />I want to read the reasos why we have to forget about our DVDs and take the next step and move on to the Blu Ray saga.<br /><br />I own lots of Blu-Ray discs from movies that date back as early as the 1920's (Metropolis) and I got to admit that Blu Ray is the next big thing in watching movies so I made this evaluation based on my personal experience: If old movies with B class reputation made it to Blu Ray and were completely enhanced in the shiny HD format, what would it be like having the entire Star Wars saga on blu-ray?<br /><br />If anyone can answer that, be my guest and I'll buy it ASAP.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|its a port.  people who give this a five star rating are foolish.  its just a flat port from the ios version of the game.  high end devices can't even run it or if they can the screen looks horrible and pixelated. it doesn't do the game justice.  people should be rating low so they know that laziness is not a good business model.  they also need to dump the wifi only download.  big turn off for the size of the file.  had to mod the game so that it would handle the memory and non iphone sized screen of the droid x.  something the developer could of done in five minutes.  I have it running on all Motorola devices with just about five minutes of work and that was with no knowledge of the app.  the developer should be ashamed to put out something like this.  just a bad hackjob of their own software.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|you won't find fulfillment or the meaning of life by playing this game, but you will find tons of mindless entertainment
B004ZH66XO|3.0|this game is average.  its a port/knock off of other fish games for the phone and pc.  it has horrible controls.  you would need fingers the size of toothpicks to see where you are going in time to avoid a bigger fish.  the level difficulty disparity is really really high.  the first area goes from a learning experience to a zerg swarm.  what it does have is a stable fast design with no forcecloses or lag this is all done thanks to the graphics and physics of the game.  if there was much thought into the controls and the zerg fest, this would be a good game.  too bad that I spend more time on my droid x watching my thumbs when playing this game than actually seeing the game.
0071762345|5.0|I hadn't realized until I read this book, just how much I really do take my friends recommendations into account, especially when they are presented to me at my favorite social site.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is one great fun show. I think Sky needs to go. She is good looking bad news. She will take him down.  He needs to just give her some big money, and then move on. See the kids every other weekend. And get someone new. She is doing her boss anyway. It's time to end it with her, are get back with her. Not this bit like it is.<br />It will be fun to see what happens in season (4). I do wish they would do more then just 13 a season. maybe 20 are so. More Drugs.. Ha! ha! ha!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love the sweeper. It`s light weight and easy to use. It`s easy to empty. It gets around wall and corners easy. It`s easy to empty. The wheels get right up to the wall. A child could even use it. Thank you,
B000YMM3CC|4.0|I think this movie is a better than the book and that rarely happens. Only a few minor problems, James Garner isn't nearly as old as Noah is in the book. The ending is different and I don't like it, but I didn't like the book ending either, so it really didn't matter. I love Ryan Gosling in pretty much anything, and Rachel McAdams holds her own. The movie is very sweet. Yes, there is infedelity, which isn't the right thing for anyone to do, no excuses, but it does happen in real life, and so it happened here. The only thing I didn't like was the online streaming from Amazon. The movie stopped every 30 seconds and was very difficult to watch like that. I watch streaming movies and TV all the time on other sites, this was my first time on Amazon. I didn't like it. Probably won't use the service again.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I had this running on Android 2.2 (Droid X) and it worked fine, but when I upgraded to Android 2.3.3 it stopped working. Now all I'm getting when I open the app is a frozen Amazon Apps store screen that only half loads.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|THIS MOVIE WASENT THAT BAD.IT DID HAVE ABOUT 80% STORY AND 20% ACTION.I GUESS I HAVE A THING FOR A MOVIE FILMED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't loved a series this much since Harry Potter.  It is gripping, fantastical, heart-wrenching, heart-warming, confusing, interesting, edgy, and above all really creative.  I've described it to a few friends as a dystopic version of the Twilight love triangle, and I think it is that but also so much more.  The writing is really well done, the characters fairly well-rounded in their abilities to express a range of human emotions, including the darker ones.<br /><br />My significant other found the main character a little flaky and indecisive and I saw his point... until I thought about it and realized that's probably JUST how a teenage girl would act.  One easily forgets that you are reading about a teen girl, albeit one in extraordinary circumstances.  I found the story just realistic enough to make the scary parts scarier.<br /><br />While this trilogy is obviously of a very different scope than the Harry Potter series, it is similar to me in the sheer amount of thought and creativity the author must have put into this alternate world, how it works, how it is described, and how it is believable.<br /><br />This first book is my favorite of the three but I can't imagine stopping after this one!  It is both an easy read and a hard one: a fairly short book, the language is somewhat simple, but there is a lot to digest, and I really wanted to make it last.  I was sad to say goodbye when I closed the last book.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The new update crashed my phone. The reinstall caused me to now start over ....  from the first level.  WTF
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|It was nice to get to see what happens inside Vogue magazine. It offered a lot of insight to me. Here's what i got out of it:  1) Anna Wintour seemed like an ice hearted woman.  For example, she wasn't even sweet or loving with her daughter. When her daughter said \\"i love you\\" and Anna just walked out like a diva.  2) Anna Wintour is a dictator. Anna Wintour treats her employees like there opinions don't matter  I find it an injustice to have someone like her in power. Everyone kisses her ass just because she has the power. But in reality,I'm sure everyone hates her guts. And how dare she tell her employees to lose weight. What a jerk. She's the one that needs to eat for once in her life. She look like skeletor and the cigarette camel.  3) People can get paid to do practically nothing. Look at Anna Wintour and Andre Leon.     Here's what I hated about Anna  1)She treated Grace Coddington like she was a 2nd rate intern. And then at the last minute in the dvd she says \\"oh grace is a great editor...blah blah blah\\". Well, she may think that but she certainly doesn't show it when everything Grace does is rejected immediately. I began to wonder why is Grace even there if Anna rejects all her hard work? I think Grace is too good to be working for Anna and Grace should come up with her own magazine. Grace is soo taken for granted. And the ironic thing is that I think Grace is more talented than Anna.  2)She seems to contradict a lot of what she says. Anna Wintour said, \\"Fashion's not about looking back, but looking forward\\". HA! Are you kidding me??? All she did was look back at the old issues and old fashions to come up with her \\"September issue\\". Fashion relies a lot on the past.     Conclusion  They did not delve much into how Anna really become the editor-in-chief. Unless it was literally because her \\"daddy\\" had connections because he was an editor himself. I suspect she is the editor of vogue solely for her network from her dad. What are her credentials really?  I don't think a dictatorship shows a breadth of knowledge. How can fashion be defined and credited single-handedly by one person's opinion? Surprisingly, with all that fanfare and ass kissing, Anna seemed miserable. Or was she more concerned about looking cool? Whatever the reason, I think you can place anyone in her position and nobody would notice the difference. Except maybe a person in her position would smile or even treat her employees with respect. She has all these people working for her and she gets to act like a jerk all day. Where the hell is justice??    If you are a fashion student, this is a good movie to help show you the dreadful people you'd have to work for such as Wintour. Do you really want to kiss her ass or something like it all your life?
B0000DBJDM|4.0|I found this DVD is the used bin when shopping the other day, and literally for pennies (ok $3), I couldn't believe my good fortune. I immediately snapped this up of course. I hadn't seen \\"Live at Pompeii\\" in many, many years. I didn't even know that a new \\"Director's Cut\\" had been released, so I was quite intruiged by this.<br /><br />\\"Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii\\" (171 min.) starts off with the \\"Director's Cut\\" (91 min; in 16:9 widescreen). I was a little surprised to see all the additional space footage, I mean how weird is it to see International Space Station footage from (I'm guessing) the 1990s in a concert film that was filmed in late 71/early 72! I also couldn't quite understand the logic behind adding footage (not concert footage, even) from the band messing around at Abbey Studios on various \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" material. All rather strange. The original film (60 min; in 4:3 full screen) is also included, thankfully. While I prefer watching the widescreen \\"refit\\", the original shorter movie makes a lot more sense musically and thematically. \\"Echoes Part I\\" and \\"Echoes Part II\\" bookend the fantastic Pompeii-filmed set.<br /><br />Am I the only one to think that as it relates to the Pompeii-filmed footage, Nick Mason had an inordinate amount of screen time? I'm thinking as much as the other three combined. You can't as much as catch a glimpse of Roger Waters until well into \\"Echoes Part I\\" for some reason. The DVD contains a 15-20 min. interview with the director Adrian Maben, and it's interesting hearing him talk about the intent of making this the \\"anti-Woodstock\\" film, with no spectators instead of the \\"million\\" at Woodstock. In the end, contrary to some other reviewers here, I don't mind all that much that Maben made a \\"Director's Cut\\", since thankfully the DVD presents both the old and the new versions. In all, a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan!
B004Y03LQ2|1.0|Geez, what has been with Maiden recently. They are my favorite band and all but it seems like they can't release a new album without releasing a best of album right after. It started in 1995 with the X-Factor, with Best of the Beast. OK, so that was good, because enough time had passed sinced the self-titled debut. Then Virtual XI, with Ed Hunter, then Brave New World and Dance of Death with Edward The Great, then The Essential Iron Maiden in 2005, then A Matter of Life and Death and Somewhere Back in Time. Now, we have The Final Frontier and this pointless release?!?!?!<br /><br />I'd be lying, though, if I said I wasn't impressed with the fact that they are releasing compilation based solely on the 1990-2010 stuff, because both Fear and No Prayer, X and Virtual, and BNW-TFF have some of Maiden's most important stuff yet. In particular, the Reunion albums are important- Bruce and H are back for good this time and they're continuing to make music. I'm one of the few who prefers the new albums, as they are more thoughtful and meaningful, as well as reflective.<br /><br />But honestly, don't waste your money on this- BUY THE ALBUMS!!!!!! The new Maiden's albums are like symphonies. They require to be listened from first track to last (OK, skip The Assassin on NPFTD). Sure the selection on this is great, but they're only fragments of amazing albums. You WON'T be left satisfied. Furthermore, the live versions of the Blaze tracks have already been released on a 2 CD set entitled \\"Best of the B'Sides\\". As anal of a fan as I am of Iron Maiden, I worry they may become the next Aerosmith with how many compilations they are releasing. If you want a compilation, I suggest you get The Essential Iron Maiden as it pans most of Maiden's career.<br /><br />Like I said, buy the albums. The new material isn't just \\"listen to one song and you're full\\", the entire albums must be heard from the first track to last.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Animation has been used for all manner of cinematic entertainment, from the children-targeted Mickey Mouse to the left-leaning \\"Family Guy\\" or \\"South Park\\", meant not to much as entertainment as it is meant to produce an emotional response. This film was made 7 years before I was born, but I recall not being able to see it a dozen years later during the 1950s because it had still not made it to TV and my family could not afford the first-run theaters uptown. Ads for it showed an excerpt of the \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", since all kids knew Mickey. It went through a brief \\"renaissance\\" in popularity during the mid-1960s when the acid crowd saw its surrealistic scenes as a \\"previous generation\\" antecedent to their \\"trips\\"--\\"Hey man, I had a trip a few weeks ago that was kinda like that. Like, maybe Disney's guys did some mushrooms back then\\".<br />But now I finally got to see it, two generations later, at the age my grandparents were during its '50s run. There's an old saying--\\"Discipline is not an end, just a means to an end\\", and this film is the opposite to that. All other uses of animation in popular entertainment have been but a vehicle for the story being told, whether comedy or social commentary disguised as comedy. Classical music has been used as the soundtrack of choice for animation since forever, but this film is animation built on the foundation of the music. Until I saw this film, I'd never heard an orchestral version of Bach's \\"Toccata and Fugue\\"--only the pipe organ version. Actually I've got a ringtone of an excerpt from that version. The kids might be amused by the \\"Mickey Mouse cartoon\\" of \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", but when it comes to them seeing the dinosaur sequences of the \\"Rite Of Spring\\" sketch, it might help if they've already seen one of the \\"Jurassic Park\\" flicks.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|The film was great and obviously in awesome picture quality being Blu-Ray. I love the collector's items that come with the set. Didn't really need the digital copy... so, meh. I also really liked that even with all the extra content particular to this edition, there were still the special features that come with the standard 2-disc editions. So some old fun with new fun! All in all I was pleased. I will purchase the others!

B002T9H2LK|2.0|Quentin Tarentino could have been a great success as a magician or a con artist. For months he even convinced me that this was a good movie, instead of the strange experiment in recreating the things that make a bad movie a bad movie. It feels like Christoph Waltz, Dianne Kruger and Melanie Laurent(all the serious Euro-actors)set out to do a serious WWII movie. While they were doing that; QT and all his Hollywood buddies got together on another part of the set and decided to make a travesty worthy of Ed Wood! I mean, a WASPy Brad Pitt spying in occupied Europe might be believable(within the script's loose interpretation of reality, that is)but the fact that he sounds like FogHorn LegHorn even when he attempts to speak even one non-English word is ridiculous!!(GRASSY-ASS!! BON-JOR-NEEW!!) QT conned us all with his trailers promising a non-stop, orgy of Nazi-killing! Almost every single action scene can be seen in the trailer. Except, strangely enough, for the clip of the guy in the Bowler hat firing an MG42 on the run down a corridor! I can't even find that clip on any of the extended scenes promised on the covers of DVD packages! The deleted and extended scenes are just more TALKING!! I remember Jamie Bell was on a talk show with one of the stars of this movie. He made a negative comment about his own WWII movie, DEFIANCE, and praised Inglourious Basterds for its action. Obviously, he was kissing ass and hadn't seen the movie!!! Even the violence is a disappointment! All of the characters who had a memorable personality in the Basterds get killed in a shootout with a Gestapo Agent and a band of drunken Germans and an overgrown Girl Scout! The rest, except for Brad Pitt, Eli Roth and two guys who I can't even tell apart from each other, just disappear. Eli Roth, as the Bear Jew(seriously, couldn't the supposedly brilliant QT come up with a better Nickname; Das Golem, Samson, maybe)makes you wonder how he could be Jewish as he is such a HAM!! All he manages to do is convince the audience that he probably does act out his Hostel scenes on his own time(probably on homeless men and unsuspecting co-eds). There have been a ton of bad WWII movies made recently. You can rent most of them for #2.99+tax. QT, managed to con everybody into shilling out $9.00 and more for his bad movie when it was in theaters. Now he wants $29.99 and more for bogus Special Editions!If you want an WWII-action movie with comedic and fantasy touches watch Kelly's Heroes and Where Eagles Dare.

B000001FO4|4.0|The Philadelphia based band Cinderella came out of the shadows by releasing their debut album Night Songs in 1986 which had a prominent Glam-Rock sound that was very popular at the time. Cinderella released their sophomore album in 1988, Long Cold Winter. This second album featured a noticeable change in their style this time around, maybe wanting to distance or distinguish themselves from all of the other Hair bands. From the very first song on Long Cold Winter you can tell than Cinderella is going for more of a different sound than what was on the first album. There's still a strong Glam/Hair element to the music but it's mixed with very bluesy riffs. After this album Cinderella went for an even bluesier approach with their sound. To the band's credit they were perhaps the very first Glam bands who turned to blues once the Hair era was over (Which other Glam bands also did), in fact as Long Cold Winter proves they were hinting at blues since at least 1988.<br /><br />\\"Falling Apart/Bad Seamstress Blues\\" is blues-infused but makes no mistake this is hard rock as well, once Tom Keifer's vocals come in you're in for a ride, a bluesy ride that is.  You can tell right away from the first track that Cinderella is going in a different direction even if it's still Cinderella . Terrific song, a highlight of LCW and I'll give the band credit, they can fuse blues with glam very well, great dirty riff! \\"Gypsy Road\\" is an excellent bluesy rocker; this sounds much more like classic rock to me than Glam. It's catchy, harder edged and features great guitar work. Cinderella are very good at ballads and while their debut album Night Songs featured a great one in \\"Nobody's Fool\\" they surpassed themselves here with the amazing \\"Don't Know What You've Got (Till' It's Gone)\\". I'll go as far as saying it's one of the ultimate rock ballads, it's simply one of the most heartfelt ballads any bands has done (right up there with Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" and others). \\"Last Mile\\" starts out very softly and makes the listener think he's about to listen to a ballad. Then the song kicks in and it never stops rocking, the song has a very nice melodic and mellow chorus. Not only one of the album's best songs but also one of the best things Cinderella ever did. \\"Second Wind\\" is more traditional rock, it's less glam and and less blues as well, this one is a great fit on the album. \\"Long Cold Winter\\" is the title track of course, a rocking ballad that sounds very Zeppelin-influenced, it's a very good long bluesy ballad. If not the album wouldn't have been called after the song! \\"Coming Home\\" is a softer song, an acoustic track that wouldn't be out of place on a country album (and yet has a place on this album). I haven't commented on all the tracks but Long Cold Winter is a solid Cinderella album and an even better album than the band's debut.<br /><br />This is where I feel Cinderella became one of the better Glam/Hair bands of the 1980's instead of being just another band. In my opinion Cinderella were truly one of the best bands out of the whole Glam movement of the 80's, they weren't revolutionary by any means but they knew how to make a good catchy song that was enjoyable. The band had great vocal harmonies (\\"Last Mile\\" is a fine example\\") and melodies, nice choruses and they were always catchy no matter what they did. If you don't like this type of music it's fine, but if you do Cinderella are an excellent band worth checking out. Tom Keifer's vocals are great because they're not the traditionally high pitched vocals that were a trademark for so many bands of that decade. Tom's vocals had an AC/DC mixed with bluesy type of feel to them; I thought he sort of stood out from the other singers.<br /><br />Long Cold Winter was a transitional period for Cinderella. The band still had strong Glam elements to their music but began incorporating a lot of blues to their music; therefore the music here is a mix of both. After this second album the band ditched their initial Glam sound and went more towards a blues sound for their next two albums. To me Long Cold Winter is the band's best album, it has some of the most memorable Cinderella songs and it was the band's most successful album. I wouldn't say Long Cold Winter is an outstanding album but it's certainly a fine one that I think most hard rock fans and Glam rock fans could both enjoy. Very recommended, I'll give Cinderella's sophomore release a 4/5.nt more towards a blues sound for their next two albums.

B001KQIAXM|4.0|In the constant struggle to craft a cohesive album that showcases all sides of an artist's personality, few have ever decided to go the double-disc route. Although many stars have created various alter egos to experiment with sounds somewhat more freely, the trend to devoting an entire disc to each personality appears to be most common among rappers. Thus, when Beyonce sought to separate her album into a dual-disc set to incorporate both ballads and upbeat music into a single album, it was met with mixed opinions. Some fans lauded the novelty of the idea, while others lambasted her for being unable to make a single coherent album, without the need to switch between discs partway through (at least, for those who still use CDs). To further complicate the issue, Beyonce also elected to capitalize on the Standard/Deluxe trend by simultaneously releasing two versions, with the deluxe including additional songs for the fans that were willing to spend a few dollars more.  While Beyonce certainly deserves some credit for taking the risk, the alter-egos are not necessarily distinct enough to merit separate identities. Nonetheless, the album as a whole is surprisingly one of Beyonce's most consistent and believable offerings.      The first half of the album, labelled \\"I Am\\" seeks to give fans a more intimate experience led by Beyonce herself, as the first of the alter egos. This disc focuses largely on ballads and mid-tempos, giving fans of Beyonce's vocals ample material to enjoy. Lead single \\"If I Were a Boy\\" offers a fairly unique perspective on the topic of role-reversal in relationships. Here Beyonce sings about what she would do if she were the male in the relationship, both about what males tend to do wrong and how she'd do better. Although this subject has been done before by other artists, Beyonce's take on it tackles it from a different enough angle that it does not seem played out. Her powerful vocal delivery also adds to the strength of the track. \\"Halo\\" is a beautiful, albeit somewhat overrated, ballad that quickly became a fan favourite. The verses are well-written, but the chorus drags it down somewhat. The song is mostly marred by the fact that the production, while good on its own, sounds far too similar to other Ryan Tedder tracks for other artists (Kelly Clarkson, in particular). \\"Disappear\\" is a track that flies under the radar initially, and takes a few serious listens to truly appreciate. It is far from the best the album has to offer but it is solid filler. The average listener is likely to find it boring, as it lacks the hook and instant appeal of the typical Beyonce track. \\"Broken Hearted Girl\\", on the other hand, is easily one of the strongest tracks from the album as a whole. Written by Babyface and produced by Stargate, this track is Beyonce at her finest. This is the rare track where Beyonce's vocals truly convey emotion, in this case sounding appropriately vulnerable with a tinge of resentment. The track is easily an album highlight, and possibly one of the best of her career.    \\"Ave Maria\\" keeps the album going from strength to strength, re-vamping the classic hymn into a modern love ballad. This track again showcases exactly why Beyonce is at her best when she allows emotion to creep into her vocal delivery. Here she takes a more restrained than usual approach to her vocals, allowing the meaningful lyrics to shine. In fact, the restrained approach showcases how beautiful Beyonce's voice truly is, and it's a shame she doesn't take this approach more often. \\"Smash Into You\\" is yet another highlight, available only on the deluxe version of the album. Once again, Beyonce begins with the more restrained vocal approach which allows her vocals to complement the well-written lyrics, rather than compete for the listener's attention. Even when she does allow her vocals to soar toward the end, it comes across as genuine and fits with the track. On previous albums, these moments often seemed to be forced and a mereattempt to prove herself as a singer. As with \\"Disappear\\", \\"Sattelites\\" is another track that drifts pleasantly under the radar for several listens before it can be truly appreciated. However, it is by far the stronger of the two due to the strength of both vocals and lyrics. It is a more atmospheric track, which for some will toe the line between stunning and merely boring. The bridge in particular is well-done. Unfortunately, the \\"I Am\\" half of the album ends on its weakest offering, the deluxe-version exclusive \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\". While it is obviously a very personal track, it does not fit very well with the sound of the rest of the disc. The track does not suit Beyonce's voice very well, causing the song to sound quite awkward. The lyrics are beautiful, although there is not much else going for it.     The second disc, devoted to alter ego \\"Sasha Fierce\\", was intended to focus more on upbeat dance music to fit the more aggressive personality of the Sasha character.  Kicking off with smash hit \\"Single Ladies\\", the disc gets off to a very assertive start with Beyonce rallying all single women to celebrate their independence. This track was ubiquitous throughout the entire year of the album's release, although this does not necessarily mean it is a particularly strong song. The lyrics, excluding a very strong bridge, are quite mediocre and the production can become quite grating over time. However, it is an enjoyable, if overrated, track. \\"Radio\\" fares much better, offering a believable track about being in love with the music on the radio. It's rare that a song addresses music itself, and even rarer still for it to do so in a unique and enjoyable way. However, with this track Beyonce manages to do both. \\"Diva\\" unfortunately brings the album down several steps, as it is a song that Beyonce (as either alter ego) simply cannot pull off convincingly. Although she gives it her best effort, and places of it do sound good, the track overall comes across as too out of character. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" again fares much better, despite leaking nearly a year before the album was released. Despite this being one of the first tracks recorded for the album, it is immediately obvious why it was kept even after the leaks. Beyonce here gives a very strong vocal performance, and this is easily one of the best-written tracks this disc has to offer.      \\"Video Phone\\" is one of the only tracks that is distinctly Sasha Fierce, which does not save it from being unconvincing. It comes across more as an attempt to get some street cred to be taken seriously as a hip hop artist. The lyrics are lacklustre and repetitive, and the beat is not particularly interesting. It's a decent filler song and an tends to grow on the listener after a few listens, but Beyonce is capable of so much more. \\"Hello\\" seems as though it would be a better fit on the I Am side of the album, although Beyonce may have thought that the beat was a little too fast for it to fit. The verses are excellent, but the chorus could use some work (and the way Beyonce sings the word \\"hello\\" sounds odd at times). Despite being more upbeat, it is quite a romantic track and one of the best this disc has to offer. \\"Ego\\" is an older sounding track full of double-entendres, although fans and critics alike seem unable to decide if this was intentional. Although Beyonce sounds good here vocally, the lyrics are quite weak and repetitive. Although the track is nearly four minutes in length, it begins to get boring around the two and a half minute mark. Luckily, Beyonce quickly switches it up and begins to vocalize over a piano instrumental, which only really serves to highlight how little content the song really had. Although this was a deluxe-version exclusive, it does little to persuade listeners to splurge for the extra tracks. \\"Scared Of Lonely\\", on the other hand, singlehandedly makes the deluxe version worthwhile. In terms of content, this track also would have been more at home on the IAm side of the album, but seems to have been relegated here instead because it is more upbeat. Beyonce once again provides an unusually passionate and emotional delivery, proving once again why she is at her best when she allows her emotions to show. It is a simply stunning track, both vocally and lyrically, and the perfect end to the album.    Overall Mark: 4/5    Although Beyonce had a good idea in planning to separate the tracks by alter-ego, the execution did not go over very well. A large part of this has to do with the Sasha Fierce alter ego itself, which, judging by the material here, is not all that different from Beyonce other than a preference for upbeat production. In terms of content, the majority of the latter disc would easily have fit in among the I Am tracks, making the division ultimately puzzling. The few tracks that are distinctly Sasha (Diva, Video Phone) are generally weak and unconvincing. Alter egos aside, fans are still acutely aware that it is Beyonce singing, and she tends not to fare well on hip hop tracks. Luckily, the vast majority of this album is able to highlight Beyonce at her best, even providing some of the best songs of her career.  Fans of Beyonce's more upbeat music would likely complain that the I Am half of the album is boring, however for those who wish to take her seriously as a vocalist, it gives ample evidence to justify it. Unlike past albums, Beyonce seems to have let go a little more here and just sung the tracks with emotion, rather than focusing on vocal tricks to demonstrate her prowess. It seems to suggest a growing confidence in herself as a singer, where she feels more comfortable allowing the track to speak for itself. When she is able to let go and do this, she shines.

B004RKC4PI|1.0|One of America's most treasured Rock `N' Roll bands Aerosmith is perhaps Rock's ultimate ballads band, they came with some many great songs and ballads like \\"Dream On\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\\" and so on. Some of these ballads are really special and have stood the test of time; many of Aerosmith's ballads are still played live today. Releasing an album of Ballad content only is not a new idea and certainly not a very original one. For Aerosmith you'd figure that with the amount of great ballads they made over their lengthy career that one could make a great collection of ballads. That's what Tough Love: The Best of Ballads attempts to do and fails miserably at. First of all I'm not even sure who this is supposed to aimed at. Maybe the casual fan who only or mostly likes Aerosmith's ballads? Tough Love isn't all ballads, it features Hard-Rock songs as well but this ruins the concept of ballads. If you're going to have a ballad best-of album and include some rockers why not buy a better and lengthier compilation at a similar price with the ballads and the bigger hits that does a better job at summarizing Aerosmith.<br /><br />Tough Love is not a great Aerosmith compilation and while it does have the band's greatest ballads in one place, it falls short of whatever it's supposed to do. Some of the songs like \\"Livin' On the Edge\\" and \\"Rag Doll\\" probably have no business here at all. \\"Love In An Elevator\\" fits the concept of love but is not really a ballad.With only 12 songs, this is a pretty poor compilation that doesn't offer much.<br /><br />It's been a while (and too many compilations) since the last Aerosmith album and it seems that fans are always promised a new album that never quite happens.It's been said before but the amount of Greatest Hits albums and collections with the Aerosmith name stamped on top of it is definitely too many. I can't even tell how many there are, I lost count a long time ago. Get the classic Aerosmith Greatest Hits, Oh Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits or even Big Ones if you're looking for an introduction to the band that is often considered the greatest American Rock'N' Roll band. At the price you're better off with almost any other Aerosmith compilation from which you have many to choose from (my favorites being the older Greatest Hits and the two discs and the more complete Oh Yeah!

0312600844|5.0|sv (short version): This book sure is neat-O!<br /><br />lv:<br /><br />This book is a fun rollicking parade through America's ever expanding Fourth of July garnishment of stereotypes and caricatures. While I enjoyed reading this novel, and certainly found it to be entertaining, I don't believe it holds as much weight as Mr. Franzen's nonfiction essays, which for some reason seem to really produce the ripening scent of truth in society and culture.... One must always prepare themselves for a sort of a downslide into the caves of moral decay and corruption, when reading a Jonathan Franzen novel, these are of course, the provided utensils, and the main course is America. Piece by juicy piece.<br /><br />There may be some backlash regarding the simple red's and blue's of this book; the color scheming seems to be writ in bold letters; though, I found it to be much more of a smorgasbord of stereotypes, than a real true to form red vs. blue book. I've no doubt the author would feel free to disregard my attempts to quell any serious talk of what makes a real Republican (you betcha! (Sorry, couldn't resist!)), as he would no doubt be the expert, there I go again with my own ridiculous assumptions. I suppose, there seemed to be such literal side sweeping of storylines based on media, current events, political statements, or non statements, example, regarding Joey's switch to the other side, that all sense of morality and religion were doves that had long since flown the coop in the red house vs. the blue house, this admittedly, I found to be a bit disturbing, this may be a play on the falling currency of Red politics, more than an actual family of Republicans living next door; I can promise they do much more than spend their free time building game rooms and gaming, some don't buy big trucks, some don't even own trucks. So, that was a bit of a hangnail for me; otherwise, oh yay! - great dialogue, green chiclets optional, and some small pockets of truly crass writing (Richard Katz's dipping things (?) and escapades and Joey's ahem, experiences on the telephone (truly disgusting!!), that could have should have seen the cutting board in my opinion; what this creates as far as reading pleasure, I truly don't know. Maybe any random guy off the street could tell me. Not that I would want to know.<br /><br />Reading this book produced many scattered thoughts, which I thought I might perchance to put down in an effort to try to truly relate to the Berglund's in some manner, and to soak up some of that Minnesota sun no doubt reflecting down through a canopy of green on some beautiful street in St. Paul, Minnesota right at this very moment.<br /><br />Trespasses of the Heart:<br /><br />Yesterday, I heard an NPR reporter use the word brackish limbs and I remembered the beautiful forests of Minnesota and their brackishness, such some hither in their dreamy leave scapes and the way they just stood there like works of art for anybody's perusal and enjoyment, so much better than anything found inside any sort of a building, or an oxygen controlled room of any sort; and so the song of the cerulean warbler calls, I realized that the little girl inside my soul has long since decided to stay at her cabin up in Minnesota and may never return to me, from the likes of some such place much resembling \\"Nameless Lake\\", and it was this sort of loss that reminded me of Patty's feelings of worthlessness despite, all that she had put into her life. The disinterred lives of married folk holding on to nothing.<br /><br />Diving into the benevolent sea of Mr. Franzen's, \\"Freedom,\\" is such sweet delight!--It was around page 313, that the little girl of my soul thoroughly engrossed in this novel became impatient and demanded that I let her out to enjoy some of these Freedom words so that she might find some sustainability from the sheer truths of these Freedom words.  And so she climbed down from the staircase of my heart and sat in my lap where I read to her of Pattyand Walter's true love trials, and of the inevitable love triangle crash that can only come when there is a woman lusting after her husband's best bad boy rocker friend (and when bad boy rocker is vice versa returning the lusting), years upon years of yearning never dissipating only growing like a lone acoustic guitar riff that RK never stops playing inside his head, even when deck  building. The destruction of West Virginia (Rockytop, Rockytop, Good old Rockytop, oh wait, that's Tennessee! (Sadly, Tennessee is disappearing too)), together in awe of the sheer expanse and wickedness of Franzen's Warbler Trust, displacing people to save the birds! Very clever, indeed! A bit like moving the Native Americans to pristine new lands, now, the poor whites can come down from the mountains and live in sterilized pockets of suburbia. Ha! This coupled with mammoth like glimpses of the end of the world, so many different faces of America, a literal card house in downward cascade, capitalism and imperialism unveiled (as if nobody knew this already??? ((sorry, couldn't resist)), demonstrating that greed truly is yowling at the door for all of America--terrible little monster child!--Classism--is here to stay and destroy our country. All of these thoughts and much more, what about the people suffering in India? Asked the little girl on my lap, when Lalitha's homeland came into focus? - Well, that's too terrible for us to worry about,  right now. Maybe later, I told her. And she simmered down. If only, just a bit. For there was Calcutta, looming in the background of Freedom. Then there is the relationship between Corporate America and poor America, fraught with destruction and angst. How to be a true blooded American living in West Virginia when your jobs have been sold overseas and you may never face real opportunity again accept at a fast food restaurant and for a mere pittance of a wage. This sort of digressing takes place when reading about this ridiculous Warbler quest, because, well, it just can't be helped.<br />What makes Freedom such a microcosm of real America culture is the reality of this great nothingness. Even little riffs on songwriting and the ridiculousness of pop culture. That NPR has in effect become an ingestible happy pill a parody of yuppiedom, whose only news seems to revolve around gay marriage, abortion rights, illegal aliens and indie (ok, not so indie) musicians. And yet, how we need the happy pill!<br /><br />Franzen skillfully wields the carving knife while seated at the head of the table - he will after all parody the non profits vs. the big governments all sidling up alongside each other at the end of the meal. He expertly channels the frantic white noise rushing to get up and do anything, anything, just get up and Go! Go! Go! Towards something--whatever you do, don't dare sit around<br /><br />thinking.<br /><br />The minutia of the mundane can truly trip a person up for a lifetime and thus, we have Patty's lifetime motto. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't any news headers carefully placed (see optional fictional news titles below)<br /><br />Minnesota teen moves next door to be closer to girlfriend and mom (after a whole lot of yelling), still says, \\"okay.\\"-- DC Love Nest Interrupted by Famous rock Musician Richard Katz!

Wife returns from the Dead! Mob kills baby-killer in California! Who Will be the Winner tonight on ...? Chainsaw attack in West Virginia! -- And so on and so forth.<br /><br />, though this would most likely be far too clich&eacute; for the writer's taste.

1594202842|5.0|Amy Chua provides a cultural view of different approaches to parenting.  This book IS Chua's memoir and she explains her parenting approaches through a cultural lens.<br /><br />Chua's parents emigrated from China to the US, where they would evenutually have 4 daughters, the youngest of whom has Down Syndrome.  Chua's mother, from her accounts was a Tiger Mother and Chua explains this in terms of generational values.<br /><br />First Generation Chinese Americans, Immigrants - strong work ethic<br />Second Generation - Sino-Americans - strong academic and work ethic<br />Third Generation - Children of Sino-Americans who have seen Western as well as Asian cultures and different cultural values and approaches<br /><br />In this context, we learn how Tiger Parenting comes into being.  The Chua family valued very hard work and exacting perfectionism.  Their daughters appeared to do well as this was all they knew.  Amy Chua speaks of her parents in positive terms which reflects well on her and in turn provides insights to very different sets of beliefs.<br /><br />When Chua's daughters Sophia, (born 1993) and Louisa, aka \\"Lulu\\" (born 1996) enter the picture, readers see the very strict rules the girls live by.  Chua hires a nanny to speak Mandarin to the girls so they will be fluent.  By the time each girl celebrated her third birthday, she was introduced to the piano.  When Lulu turned 3, she was given violin lessons with the idea that she will rack up awards in musical performance.  Both girls do earn plaudits for their music.  At 9, Sophia earned her first award for performance and by 14 she played at Carnegie Hall.  Lulu was 6 when she started receiving critical acclaim for her musicianship.<br /><br />The girls are very different personalities.  Lulu really is a tiger kitten and her roar is every bit as impressive as that of Amy Chua's.  Readers will see the yin and yang in Tiger parenting, as with any other style of parenting.  There is no such thing as 100% smooth sailing.<br /><br />Although readers are gaining a vastly different cultural perspective, there are some things that apply to everyone.  Different personalities and struggles in raising children and making difficult decisions are universal and Tiger parenting is no exception.<br /><br />There are some VERY funny parts to this book, such as when Lulu, then 3 and being interviewed by a prestigious pre-school director refused to count in order.  She was asked to count 4 blocks.  She did, using different numbers with 4 being the final.  She used this approach, knowing full well it angered Amy Chua.  The director recognized an indomintable Tiger spirit in Lulu, an individual who, in the director's words \\"likes to do things her way.\\"  Her sensitivity to this gifted child was really impressive.<br /><br />Like the music which underscored the girls' lives (they were forced to practice for hours on end and did not even get time off for their birthdays, holidays or even for injuries), the universal theme is one of living within one's cultural perspectives while confronted with vastly different ones.<br /><br />Amy Chua even admits later in the book that Tiger parenting is not without its share of problems as with any other approach.  She discloses that her own father was the least loved among his siblings, although he, too was a gifted man who had built a radio at the age of 8.  She has a real tender side, as expressed with her sisters and even the girls.  Her own mother, herself a Tiger, even implored her to give the girls a bit of a break from time to time.  Chua's husband, who is Jewish, is a kitten to her Tiger; he is a whisper to her roar.  He insists the girls be raised in the Jewish faith by observing traditions, yet chafes at some of the more tigrine moments.<br /><br />Amy Chua's father also changes with the times.  When his daughters were growing up, he told them not to marry anyone who wasn't Chinese.  He changes his tune on this when he and Amy's husband, who is not Chinese become quite close.  In listening to accounts of his life and his changing with the times and places where he lives, one sees a cultural evolution.<br /><br />Amy Chua is a brilliant writer and I loved the way her girls expressed themselves and stood up for themselves.  You will want to read her other works as well.changing with the times and places where he lives, one sees a cultural evolution.

0743420373|5.0|I just finished reading an older version of this book. (I tend to buy used) I have to say it was a delight to read and incredibly informative. You learn a lot about people who are millionaires and how they keep their money. It is not just from being frugal but making smart decisions. I personally have never had a high paying job and always dreamed of being self sufficient, I've mostly only worked minimum wage jobs. This book actually makes me feel like I could become a millionairess. One thing I was always nay-sayer again was investing and stocks. I have to say I am excited to explore this area of finances once I am debt free!! (less than a year to go now) A very insightful and uplifting book, especially since I've lived in poverty most of my life.<br /><br />As for the read, the book flows well. I found a lot of the number crunching and facts were a little over redundant but I grabbed onto the concepts fast and did not need the extra convincing.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|If you are looking for a well written story that demonstrates what it means to truly love and care about someone then this is it. I rarely read the same book more than once since I'm constantly reading new books but this is one that I will not only read again but also recommend to others. It is one of those books that can make you smile, make you cry, and is thought provoking about what you would do for \\"the one\\" you love. Loved it!
B003L77GRO|5.0|My first exposure to Dexter on Showtime/Dish Network elicited my lukewarm response.  At least one character must be to my liking, a \\"hero\\" if you will, and there didn't seem to be one.  Certainly a serial killer could not qualify, right?  Not so fast - I allowed Dexter, on second exposure, to appeal to that dark shadowy part of my id that secretly revels in vigilantism.  Now I'm addicted.  I bought seasons 1 through 4 on Ebay after exhausting Netflix's offering of seasons 1 and 2.  But I lacked season 5 - until now.  Thanks, Amazon!

0312323867|3.0|I bought both this and Something Borrowed to read on a trip and absolutely LOATHED Something Borrowed. However, to my pleasant surprise, Something Blue was better.  While the main character comes off as horribly flawed and completely unlikable upon introduction (in Something Borrowed), she does manage to somewhat redeem herself here. Still, this is not what I would describe as a fun read, so if you're looking for a fun, lighthearted escape - seriously, look elsewhere.
0689505698|5.0|Okay so I saw this book when I was younger and liked it and decided to get it while I was an adult. It arrived on time and no problems that I could see. Its a great little book that tells a different story then what your used to. I enjoyed it and the art was also interesting. Its good and not full of cheesy kids humor like most kids books are these days. So im pretty sure adults will enjoy it to.
0823003035|4.0|I found that Anthony Ryder's approach suited me almost perfectly. His instruction is unashamedly detailed and exacting yet I always felt that I was following the approach of someone who understands people, how to draw them and how to relate to them. Particularly, how to relate to someone seeking to improve their drawing skills. The discussions about the elements that make up the Ryder approach are interesting and proceed at a leisurely pace. For me, it was like being in the studio, discussing, drawing, discussing, drawing and reflecting. Needless to say, I loved this book. The drawings are stunning and worth the price of the book alone and the instruction has benefited not just my drawing but my painting as well. I have been painting a commissioned portrait while reading this book and have applied Ryder's approach to the painting as I went along with really pleasing results regarding likeness, form and interpreation.
B0030S860A|5.0|I found the book very good from the beginning. I couldn't wait to pick it up and read it, its funny and you can imagine whats going on in the story. Easy to read, not too many characters so not hard to follow. I recommend it.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|Look, it's for the action-crowd junkies.  It's guns blazing, stuff blowing up, cheesy heroic one-liners, and ridiculous plot holes that just don't make any sense.  Get that straight in your mind, and you will have no problem letting yourself go and just enjoying BATTLE: LOS ANGELES.  I had some pretty grand expectations going into this one, but it was on the second viewing I had come to terms with what kind of movie I was in for, and just enjoyed the heck out of it for what it was.<br /><br />I would still have to say that the first act was my favorite part of the film, a somewhat realistic take on how the United States military would respond to an invasion of the homeland in a major metropolitan area.  Doesn't matter that the enemy is Extraterrestrials, Russians, Chinese, Aussies, whatever.  It's the side of RED DAWN that you never got to see (but always wish you did) in RED DAWN.  Having known so many folks who serve, I can most definitely relate to the characters that make up our squad of heroes.<br /><br />The sights and sounds of this movie are going to make for an incredible home presentation, as well.  If you have a home entertainment setup that you are proud of, this movie is going to make one hell of a demo!

It was so annoying it kept pausing my game. Nexus S 4G Sprint Android 2.3.4 Stock with Root. I assume it was trying to load an ad or it had to load bits of the game. I don't see why a paid app should have ads, and a phone like mine has no problem handling a light game like that. Dear Devs please fix this weird little problem, I will bump you up to 4 Stars. Other then that its a solid game, just really annoying random loading.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|The Proposal (With Sandra Bullock)  Rating: 5 Stars  MPAA Rating: PG-13  Grade: A  In this movie, Margaret Tate, the editor-in-chief of a high-powered publishing company, is about to be deported back to Canada, and she will not be able to work at her job. So what does Margaret do? She forces her secretary, Andrew Paxton, to marry her. Margaret is a cold-hearted, mean woman, so Andrew only agrees to marry her after she agrees to save his job and promote him.They must pass a test to ensure that they truly want to marry one another, and Margaret and Andrew travel to go to his Gammy's birthday party in Sitka, Alaska. Margaret begins to realize how much Andrew's family loves him, and she begins to fall for Andrew as well. Can she keep up with this sham, or will she finally do the right thing for the family that she has grown to love?  I love this movie! The filming is beautiful and the screenplay is hilarious. Lovely movie!
076115728X|5.0|The book has some fragile aspects even if it is a board book. I think it is not good for young toddlers. Also the concept is ahead of what a toddler can understand.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just borrowed this set and all I can say is wow!  Exceptional writing, acting, set design!  I recall watching it when it first appeared in 2002(?) and was extremely disappointed that it had been canceled.  I thought at the time the network didn't give it much of a chance -- did they try airing it on a different day/time?  What a shame! Now that I've seen the entire series, it's maddening because so many tales never had the chance to be told, so many mysteries left unresolved.  This is one of the best written series ever! I was always a fan of Star Trek, especially the original series and the Twilight Zone.  Firefly, short lived as it was, is right in line with these two classics.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I have a collection of about ten tribal fusion DVDs, by far this is my favorite.  Rachel Brice is an excellent teacher, she breaks down moves and simplifies them for ease of learning.  When practicing to this DVD I feel like I am more aware of my posture b/c she gives gentle reminders all along.  The yoga warm-up is amazing.  I've delved into yoga before but until Rachel came along I was never serious about it.  *Changed woman alert!*  I highly recommend this DVD.

0307277887|3.0|Like most reviewers, I saw the show first and decided to give the book a go. I usually don't read first person narratives or crime novels so I am somewhat biased against the style and genre. For most of the first half of the book, the first season of the show is remarkably similar. It's the second half of the book that is interesting and is different from the series. I won't give away any plot, but the differences might be worthwhile if you find yourself bored.    I bought the second book at the same time as the first and am reading it now. I'm actually enjoying the second book a little more. Surprisingly, the second season of the show borrows a few ideas from the book. It's possible that the expectations I had for the first book or the knowledge of the plot spoiled it for me. Either way, it is a great concept and I love the show. Whether or not I continue the series depends largely on the second book.    Overall, it's an easy, mostly enjoyable, read.

B0026GBIB6|5.0|It is truly amazing the way this band continues to stay fresh.  The previous album, \\"Playing The Angel\\" was much rockier than this one.  Sounds Of The Universe is very melodic with slower paced flowing songs.  It was a bit of a change of pace and it did buck expectations (as is the norm for these guys).  After a couple listens I really grew to appreciate all the subtle perfectionist details that is a Depeche Mode trade mark.  Do not pass this one over.  It is a grower, and as brilliant as any album Dave, Martin & Fletch have released.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|I am a big Richard Dawkins fan. I put off reading this one in the expectation that I would largely agree with everything said. Such turned out not to be the case.<br /><br />The book starts out fine. Dawkins refutes arguments that purport to prove the existence of God. He lays out his arguments against God's existence. He attempts to explain in Darwinian terms what survival value religion might have had for early man.<br /><br />He then in my opinion jumps the rails. He becomes rather hysterical making the case that religion in the present day is evil with no redeeming qualities. Here he badly overstates his case. He constantly exaggerates the influence that fundamentalism has on American politics. He frequently compares the Taliban with American fundamentalism. He speaks of incipient American theocracy. No doubt he gets most of his \\"facts\\" from liberal sources. He seems to think that Republican presidents have been diehard fundamentalists when actually Reagan and both Bushes have been conventionally religious; indeed Jimmy Carter has easily been the most religious post war president. The whole chapter comes off as shrill and partisan and undercuts his general theme. One is reminded of charges that the Catholic Kennedy, if elected, would be taking his orders from the pope.<br /><br />The overreaction continues through his chapter where he tries to equate childhood religious instruction as child abuse. Again, he tends to give way to hysteria and by the end of the chapter comes perilously close to flirting with fascism in his desire to protect children from \\"abuse\\". Even the Amish come in for criticism for not raising their children as Dawkins sees fit. Dakwins becomes petty when objecting to terms like \\"Catholic schoolchildren\\".<br /><br />After he gets this out of his system Dawkins returns to form when describing secular substitutes for religious prerogatives like consolation and inspiration.<br /><br />This is not Dawkins' best book; he lets his emotions run away with him. He is not well attuned to the American political and religious scene and swallows caricatures as factual. Nonetheless the book is well written and fascinating and believers and nonbelievers alike can get much value from it.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is perfectly readable but has two flaws, one minor, the other major.<br /><br />The minor one is block quotes. Block quotes in print are an indented block of text usually in a smaller font with blank lines separating it from the regular text. In the Kindle there are no blank lines and the text is the same size so one has to rely on the indentation. Unfortunately, this is very inconsistent. So pay close attention.<br /><br />The major one is the virtually useless index. The index pages are graphics with the print page numbers, useless for Kindle, a huge flaw which limits the value of the Kindle edition for reference. This is especially baffling as the footnotes and references are linked throughout. Would it have been so much effort to do the same for the index? Very disappointing.<br /><br />Recommended. Dawkins is worth reading even on his off days. Make sure you are okay with the Kindle edition's flaws if considering that.with him.

It has multiple versions for online and offline reading, notes section, good search capability, and a recent upgrade added audio.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|Going to keep this short and sweet: Great summer blockbuster movie; awesome character development; set and scenery stunning. Only two problems I had with this movie: 1) Ending could have been better, just seemed way too cliché; 2) ***SPOILER ALERT*** But my major gripe: Was very disappointed to see JJ Abrams basically re-use the same monster from \\"Cloverfield\\", just on a smaller scale. I was expecting more originality than that, for Super 8.

0756404738|3.0|My daughter and I looked forward to this book after reading \\"Name of The Wind\\". Patrick Rothfuss' first book was a wonderful read. My 14 yrs old daughter started reading this book first. She warned me about certain sections of the book and suggested I skip most of the \\"Felurian\\" section. I was saddened to find that Mr. Rothfuss spent large chunks of the book discussing his own fantasy sex life. Another frustration was how the book was organized as I felt that the book was actually five or more books packed into one very long read. The different stories had little to do with each other except they each added one small detail to Kvothe's character. I am still trying to finish the book. I gave it three stars as the author has a gift for writing but he definitely needs to learn to edit, edit, edit.

B000VFGSI2|2.0|I have over 60 CDs of his work.  I would never question his brilliance and talent!  I love his stuff!  It survives, it lives!  He had an impact...  Bach has never been the same after him...  Enough said...    His Beethoven Sonatas - and please note that I am not at all taking of his Piano Concertos (all five of them) - I've listened to and enjoyed as a curiosity.  I will never say that they make fun of the composer and that he should have been punished for it...  But if you want to enjoy the brilliance of Beethoven's Sonatas go elsewhere...  Start with Wilhelm Kempff's mono box and explore...  Then try Gould out!  Appreciate his exaggerations (especially the Appassionata)...
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Excellent movie.  They did a great job of sticking to the facts.  They only embelished in order to connect the dots for the sake of producing a good movie.  However, the facts remained solid.  Even in the short span of 70 years since this movie was made, social issues have changed, and most certainly in the past 95 or so years since the unfolding of these true events.  Women married for different reasons in those days and environment.  A 16 year old girl like Gracie would marry a man in his late 20's or early 30's.  Gracie was in fact 16 years old during this story time frame.  So the movie maker cast a young 16 year old girl of virtue to play opposite a 40 year old man in some romantic but not sensual scenes.  Today, I am not so sure the same casting would have happened.  This movie and life style would be a good study on many levels for some sociology class somewhere......Alvin York, a true hero and great role model for young men and young Christians today.  The man displayed character, integrity, and service to God and country.  Excellent job by Warner Bros.  The support cd was very professional and helped me to appreciate the making of this movie.  All the religous aspects involving Alvin York, his preacher, his ma, Gracie, his military commanders, Warner Bros, the persecution of the jews in Germany, and even his thoughts while seeing American men killed around him were well handled in a short but honest perspective in the movie and suppoort CD.  Excellent marks to cast, crew, and producers.<br /><br />THINGS I WISH I UNDERSTOOD BETTER:  I wonder if Alvin's York mule was really named and scripted as Noah or was that a private joke between Gary Cooper, Noah Berry who played Buck, and cast.  I wonder if Pusher was killed after the capture of the German soldiers as represented or during the charging of the machine guns.  The bar fight on the Tenn/Kentucky state line was really interesting.  George pointing that gun to Alvin.....real or not?  If real, more language and communication than a real threat, I would say.  I also wonder if the turkey call during the assault and capture by York of the German soldiers.....as compared to the turkey shoot.....real or not?  Good stuff.  I just glanced at an article on the internet talking about the view of Alvin York as seen from one of the German soldiers.  I will go back and read more of it.  It might be interesting.communication than a real threat, I would say.  I also wonder if the turkey call during the assault and capture by York of the German soldiers.....as compared to the turkey shoot.....real or not?  Good stuff.  I just glanced at an article on the internet talking about the view of Alvin York as seen from one of the German soldiers.  I will go back and read more of it.  It might be interesting.

0060853972|5.0|Neil Gaiman plus Terry Pratchett equals one hell of a rollicking good time.  Equal parts funny and entertaining this is a study of how Armageddon might look if seen through a lens with a decidedly Douglas Adams' tint.  Highly recommended.
B00006690G|5.0|EMINEM DOES IT AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HE FOCUSES ON SOCIAL ISSUES POINTING OUT HOW HE WOULDN'T BE SUCH A TARGET IF HE WAS BLACK, RECALLING HIS CHILDHOOD, CALLING OUT PEOPLE FOR THROWING THEIR RIGHTS AWAY IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY, CALLING OUT TEENS FOR THINKING IT'S A JOKE, BEING THE WORLD'S WORST SUPERMAN, & BEING HAPPY 'CAUSE HE GOT CUSTODY OF HIS DAUGHTER.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|This cd proves that Morbid Angel are more than your average same s**t death metal band. Thats why death metal heads can be whining morons cause they don't accept a change in a band's approach at writing. This is a brilliant cd. Step outside the box and pretend you never heard Covenant or Altars of Madness. Why is everything compared to what was done previously. Slayer has never technically beaten Reign in Blood but every cd they put out since then is different and unique in its own way. Morbid Angel earn the right to try something different and this is no let down. To the typical dumbass death metal moron-Open your mind for once.
B000P0J09M|4.0|I finally got around to watching this \\"classic\\" and was honestly a little disappointed. The actors are great, and the setting and production is first-rate, but I felt the plot was a little too similar to tons of other gangster crime movies. I prefer crime movies that push the genre in new directions (Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\" are good examples). Still, worth seeing once.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|I have to say that this album will be a cult classic. I widely recommend it to everyone who is a hardcore fan from U2. In this super deluxe edition you can find everything, from two remastered cd's to a special DVD. If you have not bought it yet. What are you waiting for?
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in ages! It is told from a dog's point of view but, this book isn't about a dog. It's about humanity and all the quirky things we do. I laughed, cried, I thought about my dog that died a few years ago, and I developed a whole new outlook on pets (makes you wonder what really goes on inside their head). I learned more about racecar driving than I ever thought I would and although I am definitely not a fan of the sport, I never once found myself irritated when Enzo's thoughts turned to his master's profession. This book is beautifully written and I would not only recommend it but, I plan on reading it again myself (which says a lot because I have never read any book twice).

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I've never been a big comic book and thus never a big Thor fan. I'm just the generic guy that enjoys comic book movies.<br /><br />That being said, this avenger line of comic book movies has been...less than decent IMO. I'm not a fan of the Iron Man movies and the Hulk (Ed Norton Version) was just a hair better than average. And in the greater scheme of things, none of the comic book movies that are coming out these days come close to comparing to the Nolan series of Batman movies.<br /><br />However, Thor was a breath of fresh air. It was compelling, had superb acting (for the most part) and really kept my attention (without having Iron Man pee on fans...ugh). Overall this movie was really good. Thor is the arrogant God of Thunder and to teach him a lesson, Odin banishes him and strips him of his power. He learns how to be humble and care of others and thus learns what it means to be a true ruler.<br /><br />The cons...some of the Thor sidekicks looked ridiculous and some of their acting skills left little to desire. I could have used a whole lot more Anthony Hopkins. He had some awesome moments but I felt he was under utilized.<br /><br />Other than that...it's a great movie when you keep in mind it's a comic book movie. It's a fun time and you should watch it.

B004EPYZPS|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />It sure doesn't hurt to have your film produced by Steven Spielberg and apparently J.J. Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.<br /><br />'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg--he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.<br /><br />The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives.<br /><br />After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).<br /><br />Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.<br /><br />While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.<br /><br />Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically--once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!<br /><br />For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.<br /><br />For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed.Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically--once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie and the best movie soundtrack I have ever heard. The music fits in with the touching story so well.  It's worth the money for sure. I would have payed five times the price for this cd.    Eddie Vedder is talented beyond words.
B00000K0T8|4.0|I would give this 4.5 stars if possible.  This is a must have for Wu-Tang fans.  Technically a Ghostface album, you get lots of Raekwon and Cappa too.  Not quite as strong front to back as  Raekwon's \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\" or GZA's \\"Liquid Swords\\", if you love the Wu, you must have this.  If you don't have all of the albums I just mentioned, get those too.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I loved it and so did my 11 year old neice. She was fascinated by this one. One of the better movies in this series.
B00356CO1E|4.0|I could only do this for 3 days, I was so sore! I can definitely see how you would get results after 30 days, I just never made it that long. Good work out though!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Well of course the movie is awesome and I love spending time with my nephew but I'm also disabled so he climbs into the recliner in my room surrounds himself with pillows and we watch our movies and a 4 year old like to watch thing more then once so being interesting to an adult is one thing but extrodinary when you both want to see it more then once and I don't like spongebob or any of those goofy cartoons so when I first showed him \\"Princess Mononoke and he was in awe I knew we had a good thing. I had 3 of Hayao Miyazaki's film at the time so we watched all three told his parents to leave the room  so he could watch movies with 'uncle duar' ha ha thats what he calls me and so his uncle was soon ordering some more movies . The style of the films animation on this and some other aren't earth-shattering but with the story, in depth characters and some very good voice acting it's just the kind of film everyone can enjoy and the journeys the characters go through in these movies are amazing for the movie run-time without making 'cookie-cutter' types into the line up of characters. The deep respect for the natural world is something else I love. There's just so much good you can say about his films and I haven't seen a bad one yet or even one that I wasn't fascinated with. The well known American actors gives it an extended accessebility for the people that don't like reading sub titles or hearing the same person doing every other voice. These movies are true gems-------
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely love these books. They were so real to life. I could not stop reading them. I fell in love with the characters and really felt their pain. The country of Panem is a realistic version of America in the future. The things that are happening in the world now make the world of Panem believable. I think everything was wrapped up in the end, but I was sad the story was over. After finishing the third book, I just pondered the whole thing for days and days. I want to read the books again soon.
0451149513|5.0|How can one describe a novel like this. One thing I've noticed in a lot of other's reviews is that it is too long and there is too much detail and description. If you can comprehend the ending with the entire story as a whole, it comes together beautifully then. After such epic storytelling for literally almost 1000 pages, I feel that if the ending was all fireworks or too quick it would have truly have been a letdown.<br /> The controversial pre teen love scene that seems to offend and disturb the prude or immature was beautiful and made perfect sense within the context of the entire story. I was at first taken back by it (def wtf moment), but by the end I stopped cringing and understood what it all meant. I finished the novel and got that rare feeling where I just want silence to take in all the buttery, flowing feelings of wonder and happiness only a 1100 page book you've immensely enjoyed can bring. Just absolutely amazing in my opinion.<br />  I don't care how it may sound but this is now my favorite novel. I just loved every page no matter how nasty, because the ending was just so powerful. I cannot possibly see how it could have ended any better. Anyone who felt disappointed I don't know what to say because I thought it was earth shattering and perfect.<br /> Yeah, the subject matter may be hard to read quite often, and the length will put off those who immediately need fireworks every 15 pages, but for those of us are interested in getting to know not only at 10 detailed characters for the duration but and an entire town from whats known of its beginning to its inevitable demise.<br /> Overall though, I'm just so impressed and possessed by how wonderful everything was by the end. If you don't agree and feel the opposite, sorry.
B000286RNY|4.0|I don't know anything about this movie but I bought it as a gift for my brother who loves soccer. It was HILARIOUS. I don't know if it's intentionally campy or not but I definitely enjoyed watching it. On the second viewing we discovered that if you navigate through the menus you can actually change the setting to where the movie is dubbed over in english instead of just showing subtitles, which only adds to the hilarity.
032147404X|4.0|This is the perfect second book in photography. I read an introduction to SLR and photography a couple years ago, and since then been looking for a little more tips and tricks into photography. This book is perfect for that. There's no introduction to shutter speeds and f-stops. Just tricks, what to do in various situations, what kind of equipment to use etc. His jokes are funny, keeps you interested in the book from start to finish. Overall, buy this book if you've already read any book about introduction to photography.    Now a little about Volume 2: Don't set your expectations based on Volume 1. This was more of a disappointment than anything else. Basically, Vol 2 repeats a lot of things from Vol 1 (including the jokes!) and adds a few things about equipment and tricks. But mind you, the equipment gets more expensive as the volumes progress! Most of the equipment suggested in Vol 2 runs into a few 100s.
B003Y5H5KQ|3.0|HANNA struck me as equal parts awesome and utterly confusing. It's a character-driven action movie, but without any real clarity as to why the characters behave the way they do. An OCD villain, a weaponized child, and some random guy who lives inside an amusement park ride all combined to make fascinating characters that made no sense to me. The cinematography and acting are simply stunning. There is a very \\"artsy\\" feel to the movie, as if things were left purposefully for the reader to interpret. However, the lack of understood motivation left the plot wanting. I left saying: \\"Wow!\\" And: \\"What was that?\\" And not always in a good way. (3 Stars)
0307236722|4.0|I got this book from my local public library and tried one recipe (vanilla cupcakes). I was very impressed with how good the cupcake came out! I'm ready to purchase this book now! I can't wait to try the other recipes. It's well written and easy to follow along for even a novice like myself to understand. Oh and the photos are really nice too.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I bought Season Four of Lost because I love the show. You either love it or hate it. I'm not sure if there is a in between! If you decide to purchase this dvd set I will tell you that you do have to watch the show from the beginning. There is no picking up in the middle or anything because then you will be \\"Lost\\"!! :-)
B004ZH66XO|3.0|The game is rather simplistic.  My six year old will probably like it.  However, it doesn't scale to the Xoom properly, overlapping with the controls at the bottom and the hot spots don't line up quite right (you have to click low on the buttons to hit them).  This is probably an aspect ratio issue, if I were to guess.
B002ZG975Q|3.0|One for the saps. Maybe it's my recent break-up talking, but I liked this one. It's ultra-romance, where the bad guy realizes the error of his ways, and the poor-girl hot-chick still manages to look pretty and stay smart despite her severe family troubles - but the film knows what it is and doesn't shy away from it. The screenwriter tried to be \\"hip\\" with the dialogue, creating his own lingo that resembles a sore thumb at times when the actors (young and hip in their own right) stumble on, rather than integrate, the new lexicon.<br /><br />A highlight is Neil Patrick Harris as the blind tutor, whose frequent one-liners give the film a levity it greatly needs in order to stay away from the \\"I love you so much it hurts\\" scenario that a film like this always gravitates toward. Also a huge welcome back to Mary-Kate Olsen as the witch. Her outfits are a character all their own.<br /><br />The plot is simple and stays true to the book. It would be sacrilege to turn Alex Pettyfer into a real beast, so I forgive the producers of the film for playing tame on that account. This is the type of movie teenagers see and swoon over, which brings back plenty memories of a certain Mr. DiCaprio reciting Shakespeare. I love the film for that, so if you don't mind a little sap - and Vanessa Hudgens - give it a shot.

B004VBAHG6|5.0|Everything you love about Peter Murphy is here....the sensual, raw, deep voice of gothic romanticism and poetry, a passing nod to Bowie, Iggy, and others, but deliciously original and the best solo LP he's put out to date.  We love it!! A+
B003Y5H54W|3.0|The movie trailer told you everything you needed to know about this one. Scorching title track (\\"The Wolf\\" by Fever Ray), Amanda Seyfried and those \\"great big eyes\\" of hers, Gary Oldman trying (and failing, yet again) to make this movie cult, and two hot men with miraculously coifed hair despite the fact they live in a farming village, population: 250, location: The Woods. The women too are so packed with makeup I was waiting for the Avon lady to show up at any moment. (Perhaps Dianne Wiest from Edward Scissorhands?)<br /><br />The dialogue is so supremely awful at times you have to hope director Catherine Hardwicke was aiming to make this film as much like a fairy tale as possible. If I remember right, old-time fables are not known for their witty banter. But saying that, Hardwicke failed to commit fully to the fairy tale theme. She's got the imagery down, but the themes cockeyed. This movie tries to be unique, yet stays within the boundaries of a Hollywood blockbuster. As a viewer, you feel like you're watching something that could be great, but somehow misses the mark because it quickly drags the story to fall within your expectations again. I wanted to be surprised - and sometimes I was - but overall, I'm disappointed this film wasn't better considering how amazingly fecking awesome it could have been.

1592536913|5.0|I just received my copy of 1000 Steampunk Creations today and I love it. For the price you can't beat it. It's 320 pages in a stiff paperback/hardback with quality printing (no printing issues noticed).    The book is divided into the following chapters:  Modified Technology  Fine Art and Sculpture  Home Decor  Hats and Accessories  Jewelry  Inventions and Contraptions  and includes and image directory, artist directory and resources.     There is a very very short introduction, and the rest of the book is nothing but pictures and captions. So, at 320 pages this gives you an idea of the amount of material presented (1000 creations as the title mentions).    It's a must for Steampunk enthusiasts, and at this price I'd say if you are an artist or other creative type I would pick this one up. Highly recommended.
B0050PYNN0|2.0|At most, YOUR HIGHNESS is good for one watch. The humor is crude and not all that funny. I can only take so many penis and fart jokes before I get bored. The plot is a spoof on every medieval fantasy-quest story ever made, but that was the point, and the end is loaded with special effects that aren't very special. McBride and Franco tried to add humorous delivery to not-so-humorous lines, and Portman gave us her best buxom badass babe impression. In the end, I only laughed at this because I'm a complete fantasy nerd, and even then I found myself ready for the credits. Some great one-liners, a few good funnies, but otherwise a pass. Maybe if I'd had a few drinks...
B000FCKGPC|3.0|\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is the fourth book in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, and I felt it was a bit of a disappointment compared to the previous books.<br /><br />Martin stated at the end that he wanted to tell 100% of the story for half the characters rather than half the story for all the characters; however, it felt like he came up short on both fronts.  Too many of the main characters were left in cliff-hanger situations and some like Arya were barely touched in this book.<br /><br />Part of the formula I thought was so successful in previous books was the every changing point of view, but Martin departed from that since we don't hear from all the main characters.  I felt I had a bit of an overdose of some characters that I don't enjoy as much as others, and this would have been a lot more tolerable if they were interspersed with other likeable charcters (to me).<br /><br />Despite the letdown in this book, I am looking forward to the next installment, which I think says a lot for the series!<br /><br />!! WARNING !! As with other books in this series, there is sexual content and some brutal, violent scenes.
0061353248|2.0|Contentwisely and qualitywisely this book lies somewhere in between \\"The Invisible Gorilla\\" and \\"Buyology\\"(and this one is the single worst book I have ever read in my life). In each chapter, the author describes his experiments and its implications in tedious and colloquial way which takes up unnecessary number of pages. Moreover, the experiments itself seem to have possibly been contaminated and biased, and sometimes it raises a serious boubt if participants had noticed the intention of the experiments and consciously adjusted their doings in accordance with their feelings about the experiments. The author goes so far as to attempt to draw lessons from the experiments that are seemingly very juvenile and naive and even incredibly ridiculous when considering he had two Ph.Ds and once worked at MIT.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|\\"You never know what someone is capable of.\\"  After the village of Daggerhorn's peace with the warewolf is broken villagers take drastic measures to stop the bloodshed.  After Father Solomon (Oldman) comes to the town and announces that the wolf by day is human and lives in the town the villagers begin to trust noone. One special girl named Valerie (Seyfried), has a unique connection to the wolf, and realizes she is the only one that can save the village.  I have to admit that this is not my type of movie at all.  Not being a fan of the \\"Twilight\\" movies (this movie is directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the first \\"Twilight\\") I just could not get into this movie. I will admit though that being a huge Gary Oldman fan I really liked his character, being so brutal helped me enjoy it a little.  This is totally geared toward the \\"Twilight\\" crowd. If you liked those movies then you will love this one. That's about all I can say.  Overall I didn't enjoy this one, but many, many people will. I say B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I will not<br /><br />*Also try - The Twilight Saga Movies - Twilight, New Moon & Eclipse
0316098337|5.0|Like the others who read this book, I simply could not put this book down. I have thought about Jack and Ma every day since I read the story. It touched every piece of me as a mother...Jack became alive to me, the sweetness of his \\"voice\\" and how he viewed his world, his ability to be so brave and his deep love for his mother made my throat ache with pain and love. I read a great many books each year and up until this point I would have been unable to say which has been my favorite. Now without hesitation I would say ROOM is the most notable, memorable and touching piece of fiction I have ever read.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Dark which is cool. Way confusing had no idea what was going on. Didn't really have a point and the thing I hate the most it just ended. I get it it is artsy and dramatic ok whatever please give me something to follow along to. I love Natalie she is great in whatever she does that is no issue but the movie as a whole was not a must see.
B001POX73C|2.0|I will credit the book with sticking to the jargon and scenery of the time, witty and comical banter, and character development.  However, in so sticking with its time I often didn't understand what was being said, and the hero often didn't put a subject in his sentences which I found quite awkward reading. Moreover, I thought the the bulk of the book rested on the heroine fixing everyone else's relationships and precious few scenes were paid to her own.  No real quality time is spent between the hero and heroine except in the beginning when they agreed upon the fake engagement.  I was expecting their romance to unfold amidst ballrooms and other social engagements whereat they would be forced to show society how happy they were with one another, etc.  I thought that the scenes with Jack would have been a little bit more satisfying.  But I was sorely disappointed when not only was this not the case, but the only real dedication to their romance was the last page.  I thought it was poorly done that Heyer put more thought and pages to side romances than the main characters'.     What's more is that I didn't really see the romance between the hero and heroine.  In a nut shell the hero was nice to her the whole time, helped her with her problems, and ended up being smarter than everyone gave him credit for.  Regardless, there was no mention of his blossoming affection for the heroine nor hers of him other than being surprised at his intelligence or kindness.  No blushes, no racing hearts, nothing.  So the romance part of this romance book really fell flat.      This is my first Heyer book and so if you've always been a Heyer fan, then this book may be right for you.  However, this book is worlds different from my usual romance plot/characters/dialogue and for me, it's not for the better.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I started reading the second book a little apprehensively as I was worried the second book may destroy the excellent first. That was not to be. Although the storyline was a little predictable, it had enough to keep a hunger games fan going. Having said that, I have also decided not to read the final book from the trilogy as I believe the book will have nothing more to offer and will surely leave me stunned and my memories of the first two books famished. so here's the verdict... If you are a hunger games fan, go for it and read this book, it is not disappointing and is on the contrary complementing.
B003FSTN5C|4.0|A great show. My wife and I love it. Bought it use but was in very good shape. No problems.
0670022411|5.0|Take a spin in almost our world, but add some magic, some romance, and the power of Shakespeare. Words dance in this novel, try it! Knowledge of literature and a bit of history will add to enjoyment. If you do not like  fantasy twists in your fiction, this one is not for you. But here there are vampires, professors, witches, high literature, and yes time travel. It made me remember how magical it was when I first entered college and began my studies: how everything had a touch of magic and possibilities.
0670022411|1.0|Not much substance to this book. Way too much brooding over un-consumated love. I felt this book was similar to the love relationship in Twilight series. No action to grip the reader. By not finishing this book, I won't have to turn in my Man card.
0316056863|2.0|Look, I like Tina Fey a lot. I think she's funny and smart and interesting. I just don't think that this book is any of those things. I definitely laughed out loud a couple of times while reading this book, but overall, it felt more like someone threw a bunch of semi-amusing anecdotes together and then hurriedly attempted some weak transition paragraphs. The lack of actual narrative really kept me from enjoying this one. This book is a quick read, but that's about all it has going with it. A perfectly fine airport read, if you kind of want to put your brain on autopilot (ha! airport pun!), but I guess I was hoping for a more insightful memoir.
0394740815|5.0|They don't come any better than this. Absolutely spell-binding with a perverse sence of humor. could not put this book down.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is for readers who like long complicated plots. At times the narratives is slow and dragging, so if you are looking for something fast pace or loaded with action this is not for you. Most of the bad reviews are coming for those who thought this work was similar to \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\" by GRRM or \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by JRRT. When this author is compare to the likes of GRRM or JRRT is not because of his similarity in genre, but his ability to write epic stories.  I personally love this book because is long and quite complex. The writer does a great job keeping his target audience intrigue and expecting throughout the book.
B001FB5634|4.0|I did read this book weeks before seeing the film. The director did an excellent job of putting visuals to the story. I'll agree with most everybody else, Viggo was perfect for this role. The boy was nearly as impressive. They are 80% of this film.<br /><br />Like the book, I think the film is purposely slow. However there's just enough heart-pounding moments to keep it from ever getting boring. It's quite an emotional film. Hard not to think about what I would do in the same spot. I can see how many people would welcome death in this world they travel.<br /><br />Other actors are Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce. However each is in the film only 5 minutes.<br /><br />This is a depressing, even scary story that sits in your head for hours afterwards. I have a small son myself, and was no doubt was moved to tears a few times. Heavy stuff.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Jamie - you did it!  I love Beautiful Disaster!  I have been waiting for a book to suck me in and make me want to read it from beginning to end without stopping. I hated to put it down.  I loved Providence and am starting Requiem, but this is the kind of book that is a perfect read for me.  Travis is definitely obsessive, but every girl wants that kind of love even if we can't handle it!  This was a great book and I can't wait until you \\"write for fun\\" again...I can't believe that we almost didn't get a chance to read this story.  Please provide us with more like this, you are very talented and I can't wait to see more!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Keyes has a way of subtly showing Charlie's change from lower to higher IQ.  The way this book is written makes you sit and think to yourself the genius that went into making this story work.
0316098329|4.0|For a book that takes place mostly in the confines of a small room and narrated by a small child, this book is actually much better than I would have anticipated. Like many others that I have spoken to after reading this book, I was anticipating something juvenile, boring, and incomprehensible but instead I received a startling look at the lives of a child and those around him, including his mother that has suffered so much in her life at the hands of her kidnapper and rapist.<br /><br />I had never actually heard about Emma Donoghue before picking up this book on my Kindle as one of my first Kindle reads, but reading her take on the life of a small child who has grown up and spent his entire life in one small room unknowing of the world outside was dramatic and even unnerving at times. Stuck inside this room, it has become his entire world, and over the course of the novel we see his evolution as he learns about the world outside and has to grow up and take charge at much too young an age.<br /><br />Yes, the writing did wear thin after awhile as we reached the end, but it was still a new and different approach to reading for me, especially since I am a vocal hater of first person literature. I was engaged throughout and couldn't put the book down until I had finished. With some attention issues, that's almost impossible for me. I enjoyed this book for the most part but won't give it five stars because I did find the prose to be unlikable by page 300 and the plot to be wandering off by the end, as well. Still, I would recommend Room to anyone in need of adventure and edge-of-your-seat thrills in a different package.
0316056863|5.0|I bought this book because I love Tina Fey and I really was in the mood for a funny book.  When I first started reading it I kept putting it down because it was so funny.  I wanted to spread out all of the funny because it put me in a great mood!  Of course I kept picking it back up and was sad when it was over.  I have loaned it to two different people who also loved it.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  I thought it was well written and well researched.  It is not a self help book that will improve your memory but an in depth look at the history of memorization and current research with a few questions regarding our current education system.  It was just enough of all of those things to make me interested in finding out more.  I read this book because I wanted to understand if you could indeed improve  your memory and I think the conclusion is that you can.  Anyone can improve with discipline and mindfulness.  I may have to find some how-to books now that I've read this.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|I was looking for an HP12C calculator for my DroidX but they all seemed to be priced arouund $5; this one was around $2, so I decided to try it out.  It uses RPN (reverse polish notation) key entry like the HP12C, and it has multiple keyboard layouts with additional scientific calculator keys not found on the HP12C.  The alternative business calculator layout is not identical to that of the HP12C, so it takes some getting used to in order to use it as an HP12C substitute.  For instance, this calculator has a macro recorder (which I didn't test out), but it doesn't have an easy-to-find \\"PRGM\\" key (It uses a little red circle which is an \\"f-alternate\\" in portrait mode or a \\"g-alternate\\" in landscape mode).  I tested out the annuity functions and they gave me the same results as my HP12C.  All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with this app.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|The humor in this movie never gets old. It's easily one of my top 5 favorite movies. Of course, I work in that type of office environment, and can relate so well to this movie, so that could be a factor.
B004K4GDE4|4.0|Born this way to dance, club, love, and be free. With her third record out in just three years, Born This Way is released under a cloud of controversies - ripping Madonna off on the title track, a seemingly blasphemous second single titled Judas, overexposure of her flamboyant self and a 99¢ Amazon offer. Has Lady GaGa gone mad, gone loveless and done herself in? What is BTW like? Listen to it, BTW is no The Fame or The Fame Monster. Rather, it is a darn good pop dance album. It is everything - electro rock/pop, club anthems, stomping tracks and 80s synth pop. At this juncture, it could easily be construed as stylistically themeless or haphazard but the incredulous thing is that everything nearly always works. There are tracks like Schei&szlig;e, Fashion of His Love, Judas, Born This Way and Edge of Glory that you just need to sing and dance to. There are moments where there's a little more introspective moments on You and I and  Bloody Mary. There is the electro rock glamour of Black Jesus/Amen Fashion and Heavy Metal Lover. At some points, GaGa has indeed drawn many inspirations from Madonna and even Depeche Mode but there's never a doubt she leaves her imprint on every track. The only semblance of her past is probably Judas which perhaps is her least well-received single to date. With BTW, GaGa is yet to be done and while this may still not be her best. Put your paws up...my apologies if you weren't turned on, to the dance floor. (B)
B002BU0DPE|2.0|when i got the headset the right side was noticeable lower in volume than the left side but i didn't mind it as much. then at times the right side was completely silent. but eventually it will come back by unplugging and plunging it back on multiple times. the mic was good and i did like the quality. then wile removing my headset the right earpiece broke of and was hanging by a wire. i would not recommend this headset to anyone.
B004132HZS|5.0|I have been a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles stories since childhood and read them and watched any tv shows or movies about the brilliant but enigmatic detective. For years I thought of Basil Rathbone as \\"Sherlock\\" until Jeremy Brett came along. Now I must admit I am pleased to bestow that title on Benedict Cumberbatch. Imagine if you will that Sherlock Holmes is not some fictional character from Victorian times, but a real living person today. That's the premise of this wonderfully fun and intelligent series. Dr. Watson, Le Strade, Mycroft, and Moriarty are all introduced in the very first season. I happened across this while perusing something to watch on rental. I was delighted that I gave it a chance as it was quite entertaining. There are only three episodes in the first season as this was part of the Mystery Theater Series line up on the BBC. I hope it was successful as I would love to see more series and hopefully enough interest to make it a regular series. The acting, directing, camera, editing, music and effects are all first rate. There is a second season in the can but it has not been released yet. I highly recommend it. We can only hope they realize they have a successful series and air them. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch [[ASIN:B003NF97NA Sherlock Holmes: The Classic BBC Series Starring Douglas Wilmer]] and [[ASIN:B000RPCJB6 Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series (12 DVD)]].<br /><br />CA Luster
0385341008|4.0|I highly recommend this book if you have any interest in historical fiction.  It is told completely in letter format and the characters are diverse and charming (well except bitter ol' Adelaide).  There is sweetness, sorrow, humor, heartbreak, joy, friendship, love, war, despair - I really enjoyed it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|You don't realize how luxurious having no wires is until you finally go wireless. The sound quality on these are awesome.     They fit nicely. I wish they had been made of a softer cloth than the somewhat stiff leather, but if it says anything I've fallen asleep with these on multiple times.    Being able to program the side buttons is absolutely awesome. No longer is it a \\"BRB\\" to get drinks, smoke etc. You can bring the conversation on Ventrilo with you and not miss anything.    If you have been waiting for a good headset, go ahead and get this. You will not be disappointed. :)
0061876755|1.0|Having read Mr. Boyd's  Any Human Heart  and the 4 and 5 Starred reviews of  Ordinary Thunderstorms , I was looking forward to reading THIS BOOK! After my home renovations proved to be difficult and lengthy, I needed a good book to sink my teeth into, but got a silly story instead. Don't get me wrong,  Ordinary Thunderstorms starts with great promise like a Hitchcock film but failed miserably to sustain the intrigue that Hitchcock was known for.<br />Climatologist Adam Kindred has just finished an interview at the prestigious Imperial College and walks off his nervous energy along the Thames shoreline. Suddenly craving Italian food, \\"[h]e crosses the road, having no idea how his life is about to change in the next few hours --- massively, irrevocably --- no idea at all.\\" Enjoying his meal, Kindred nods to the other solitary patron - Dr. Philip Wang - and strikes up a conversation with the Immunologist. But when Wang forgets a file, Adam suspects the other man has left it purposely...an invitation to a tryst, perhaps? Seriously!?!  Ok, I'll bite.<br />Kindred decides to go to Wang's flat and return the file, and finds Wang on the bed with a knife in his abdomen, begging him to pull the knife out. Kindred does and realizes the killer is still in the apartment. Kindred grabs the file and runs. Now, the hapless Kindred is the police's chief suspect and the target of Wang's killer. Adam is sure that a few days underground will prove to be all the time the police needs to find the man who really murder Wang and he can go on with his own life. Highly improbable, but an interesting storyline.<br />But Boyd doesn't deliver a good story. Instead, this reader was subjected to social commentary: Religion and God are irrelevant (God in lower case John the Baptist is the real Christ), the Big Bad Pharmacist company, the weak and stupid CEO, the golden-hearted prostitute, and the obligatory gay son of said CEO. In that commentary, would the policewoman that caught the call meet and fall in love with a suspect the police force is looking for and not recognize the alleged perp? Or that an intelligent man would become a street beggar and then move in with the golden-hearted hooker and son? That he Adam himself would become a murderer himself and callously dump the body?<br />I would have stopped reading this book if it wasn't part of this Summer's Reading Challenge.love with a suspect the police force is looking for and not recognize the alleged perp?

B001MVYUPC|3.0|First of all, I would sincerely thank the movie making team to produce such a good movie on Mahatma Gandhi and History of India. The whole movie would spell bind the first time watchers as long as they are keen in Mahatma Gandhi and the independence of India. There are two great shortfalls of such a huge production though:     - The Blu-ray media does not have Hindi audio, which makes this movie almost useless to the millions of people who understand Hindi. Is this fair or cheating with the Mahatma and the nation on which this movie is filmed. I would like to remind the movie making team that the national language of India is Hindi, and the people of India do have the right to watch this movie in their national language, am I right? What is your though on this Sir Richard Attenborough?     - When Mahatma Gandhi was shot, he remembered his Hindu deity God Ram and said 'He Ram' before dying. Only 'Oh God', the English translation of 'Hey Ram' was kept in light. I am not trying to favor a religion here but trying to be fair with Mahatma. The movie making team at least could keep the text 'Hey Ram' on the screen to keep the last words of Mahatma intact to convey the same to the audience as it is. What is your though on this Sir Richard Attenborough?     I hope such mistakes will not be repeated by other movie makers in future.     Let us live and die in peace. Hail to Mahatma Gandhi.
B001684L0A|3.0|I found this mini-series to be more of a frustrating experience than anything else. I hadn't read the book and certainly will to make up for this. I hated the 60's style 'Batman' camera work with the heavy tilts. I didn't mind the hand held work even though that is so over done nowadays. Laura Linney is a good actress but I hated that a lot of her screen time was taken up by doting smiles and grins. She was so reactionary. I found her (Abigail) annoying most of the time. I look forward to reading the book to get more of an accurate depiction of the man.
B002ZG99IG|4.0|I do not understand all the criticism this movie is getting.  Perhaps it is because I have never seen the often mentioned \\"Single White Female\\" and therefore haven't seen how heavily this movie is plagiarized, but in any event that type of thing is common in Hollywood.  Also I prefer more \\"conservative\\" movies so if SWF was R and this was PG-13, I would inevitably prefer \\"The Roommate.\\"  I have some experience with both mental illness and social isolation and could therefore relate to this movie, although it was certainly not perfect.<br /> I recognized Minka Kelly from the TV show \\"Parenthood\\" but I did not recognize any of the other cast members.  I'm only 28 but I guess I am not that hip apparently.  The Tracy character reminded me of Paris Hilton.  Was that intentional?<br /> It appears that Sara is about to start college and has a very troubled roommate with a very serious case of bi-polar disorder (Rebecca).  Rebecca also appears to be struggling with lesbianism which is possibly in conflict with her religious beliefs.  Rebecca is glad to have a roommate as maybe now she can finally have a friend.  She clearly hasn't had very many.  There seem to be some very genuine BFF like moments.  The point where Sara looks at Rebecca's Facebook page and announces that she is Rebecca's best friend is very touching.<br /> However it was not meant to be.  Although Sara initially is very friendly toward Rebecca, as her mental condition becomes more and more obvious, Sara eventually wants to break off all communication with Rebecca.  This leads to the climactic scene where Rebecca is killed in self-defense.<br /> I found the movie to be thoroughly interesting from beginning to end.  The soundtrack worked well for the movie.  The haunting scenes had very good music.  I had to look away when Rebecca was cutting herself and when she killed Cuddles.  Ironically her murder of Jason was easier to take.  I guess that's the liberal media for you LOL.<br /> The film certainly has holes, such as why Tracy didn't call the police, how the police dealt with Rebecca's death, and was Rebecca a lesbian struggling with her sexual orientation? She did want to date one of her high school classmates, the one \\"she was never friends with\\", didn't she? Also I was a bit confused about the scene where Rebecca catches Sara's design professor.  How did Rebecca know how to trap him so easily?  Why did he think the tape would get him?  Well it got him somehow.<br /> I also don't understand Rebecca and Irene's relationship.  They made out in a lesbian bar restroom and then went to Irene's apartment.  Is that when Irene was tied up or did they have sex that night?  If the kiss was insincere, wouldn't Irene have been able to snuff it out?  Rebecca does not show any interest in a heterosexual romantic relationship in the film. Was Rebecca trying to make out with Sara in the fight scene?  It seemed like she was.<br /> Despite confusing moments, this was a very interesting and compelling film.why Tracy didn't call the police, how the police dealt with Rebecca's death, and was Rebecca a lesbian struggling with her sexual orientation?

B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Buy this CD! It is a collaboration of a one of the best living guitarists and a terrific blues/R&B singer.      Susan Tedeschi adds much better vocals than Derek Trucks ever had before on any of his solo CDs and of course, his guitar playing is supurb.  He does play mostly slide on this CD, but why not?  He's the best slide player since Duane Allman!      The only reason I didn't give it another star is that most songs are slow tempo; they should have had a couple of fast songs to lively up the CD a bit. Otherwise, a great CD.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|Buika has a voice and a vocal style that are so unique and mesmerizing that once heard it is next to impossible not to collect all her recordings.  This latest recording was made with Choco Valdes on piano and the two together seem to sail into a realm of misterioso that keeps the listener returning for more.  Very much in the 'cante jondo' style of flamenco music Buika creates an illusion of magical spiritual seances with her sound.  Her gypsy background in Mallorca is strongly evident in this CD called EL ULTIMO TRAGO ('the last mouthful').  Sultry, sexy, dangerous, and sensual.<br /><br />Listening to Buika sing make this listener want to pair her with the enormously gifted Spanish artist - Lita Cabellut - who likewise came from a background of gypsy life, living in the streets, soaking up the underbelly of life yet pulling those beginnings into her huge canvases - portraits of Frida Kahlo, prostitutes, Don Quixote/Sancho Panza/Dulcinea.  Coupling these tow giant artists would be a spectacular event!  Grady Harp, June 11
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this item based on a review I read here.  I bought a Phil and teds classic stroller and anyone who has one will know it cones with no holders at all, nothing.  You have to pay top dollar for their ones.  I have used this for a few months now and love it.  Please do not think you can use a coffee cup in it unless it's one of the coved carry thermos as it would probably spill, but it's great for covered items.  It also has a zip pocket to secure items you do not want to fall out.
030726999X|3.0|The story, without exception is wonderful as are Larsson's first two novels in the trilogy. I was somewhat disappointed in the condition of the book. It had some water stains on the bottom of the hardcover and the spine. A few pages at the end are somewhat loose. Otherwise, OK.
B00000JXVK|4.0|Besides that this film was made  30 plus years ago it's still fun to watch.  Great video action of off road racing and crashes.  What I particularly enjoyed is the light comic relaxed commentary.  This is a video that one can enjoy viewing more than once and enjoyable for all ages interested in the sport.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|I can somewhat understand the Madonna comparisons to a certain extent. But it is way too early yet to really come to that conclusion. Madonna was a innovator and I personally haven't heard any innovation here. Madonna rarely uses the same beat on every song or same song structure. When I listen to this album I am hearing the same beat repeatedly. Lady Gaga relies hardcore on that steady techno beat which gets boring after awhile. Even Madonna's 2005 effort \\"Confessions on the Dance floor\\" didn't do this. Madonna is a very versatile artist which Lady Gaga has yet to display this on any album. Madonna has done everything from Trans,Techno,Trip-hop,hip-hop, and even some R&B aspects. To be honest Britney Spears has proven to be a more versatile innovative artist than this. And a lot of her work would remind me more of Madonna than Lady GaGa's. \\"Born this Way\\" is a blatant rip off of \\"Express yourself\\" which Britney would have never done that. \\"Bloody Mary-Heavy Metal Lover\\" and \\"Electric Chapel\\" to me are the only songs on this record that I feel is up to the standard of Madonna. There original and have a unique sound too them and  written very well.  They even sounds like something that Madonna would have written without copying. \\"Judas and Government hooker\\" to me were the only other standouts on this album. Which they weren't clearly as good as Bloody and Electric. Heavy Metal lover is a good electroclash song but once again sounds out of place. She needs to find more atmosphere in her albums. It seems like she is trying to please everyone. Its hard to get into it when every song is so different and doesn't blend. And all the other songs it just seems like shes trying to hard. Madonna never screams or tries hard her voice is soothing.She could have done more songs like Electric Chapel, Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal lover. Probably could have had a stellar record.     Commercial music is really at a horrible state right now. Especially with all the heavy weights on hiatus right now. But I honestly think that she just isn't versatile enough to be compared to the heavy weights just yet. She is mostly catering to gay nightclubs which isn't a bad thing. But the music isn't ambient or dark enough to be compared to Madonna. And nor is it creative enough to be compared to any of the heavy weights in the past. I would love to hear her branch out more and try new things. I even think Ke$ha has shown more creativity and only has one album so far. She also wrote \\"Til the world ends\\" for Britney Spears which i feel is better than anything on here. Ke$ha mixes things up and doesn't use the same formula on every song. Lady Gaga is trying to create a darker sound and its just not working. Its almost like she is trying to mix ElectroClash with Techno which is two entirely different sounds. For one.. the styles are different as night and day, one is darker and the other one is a happier style. I am giving this 3 stars because she is better then most conventional artist out there today. And at least she is trying to be different. But in all honesty I don't think Madonna would have chosen any of these tracks. She is way far beyond this style of music. If you go back to her work with William Orbit. It was far more innovative than this and that was over 10 years ago. Not to mention her work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï it was amazing! And this was many many years back so Gaga has some catching up too do. Listen to Evil by LADYTRON and that was in 2004. So basically what I am saying once again, she has a lot of catching up too do. Also if you have time check out there new song LADYTRON-Little Black Angel. Ladytron and Miss Kitten are Miles ahead of Lady GaGa from a production and song structure standpoint. Probably some of the most advanced ahead of their time groups out there. Ladytron's new album \\"Gravity the Seducer\\" will soon be out and its more ambient according too them.

B000005YZM|5.0|Many of those who have graciously commented on this marvelous album have compared the music (favorably) to that of \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  These comparisons, though undoubtedly well meant, do both this and the other two albums a disservice.  To these ears, the influence of \\"Pepper\\" is hardly noticeable, which is to say that the Zombies could well have crafted and recorded these songs before the Beatles album was released.  The special effects, the use of orchestra, the \\"hey let's pretend we are not the Beatles\\" conceit is nowhere in evidence.  Yes, the harmonics on \\"Oracle\\" are gorgeous, but there were gorgeous harmonics even before Brian Wilson - none of the Zombies attempt to emulate Wilson's remarkable falsetto, nor do they develop a concept, say, of the disillusionment of an affair gone wrong. (NB One has to wonder why an album is given more weight if it has a noticeable concept. \\"Pepper\\" does not.  Rarely does one come across a marching band with sitars at the ready)  This is all to point out that the Zombies were no more nor no less influenced by the musical zeitgeist of the time as was any other British group of the mid to late sixties.  Indeed, the \\"music\\" on \\"Pepper\\" (aside from \\"Within\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\") looks back more often than it looks forward.  The music by itself is not groundbreaking (other than \\"Day in the Life\\") but the way in which the Beatles presented the songs was (one could argue that \\"Revolver\\" is more sophisticated musically; but then it was black and white while \\"Pepper\\" was color ((literally and metaphorically)).         I think it may be fairer to see \\"Oracle\\" the same way Wilson's (not the Beach Boys) \\"Smile\\" is perceived - as a lost treasure now found, as an album, that, if marketed correctly, would have made quite a bit of noise back in 68, for, among other things, its beautiful use of counterpoint, its chord progressions and dimunitions,its melodic bass lines, the sheer inventiveness of the craft of the songwriting,the lead vocals of Colin (one of the best voicesfrom that era), the wit of the lyrics, etc.  It holds its own.  \\"A Rose for Emily\\" is not in any way a \\"rip-off\\" or homage to \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" certainly no more so than \\"Strawberry Fields\\" is an homage to the musical experimenting of so called modern \\"classical\\" composers (or, perhaps better termed \\"decomposers\\"), but a sterling and ingenious creation of a twenty-six year old who heard sound others did not.     Each song on \\"Oracle\\" is beautifully realized.  It is as sui generis as those albums it is compared to and certainly loses nothing from the comparisons.  Time has been kind to this astounding album and, after the dust has settled and time tests the music of the sixties, it will hold the same status as other fine productions of that era.  Treat yourself and buy it.  Then spread the word.  Knock your freinds out by simply playing it without mentioning the group's name or the time in which it was recorded.  Your friends will thank you. Each song is a jewel.
0812973992|5.0|Very well written with interesting, well developed characters you can't help but care deeply for.  Out of many stories, one story, that inspires us as we live out our own fragile lives.  Couldn't put it down.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I heard Dr. Taylor's TEDTalk in 2010. What she said resonated very deeply with me at that time. No, I did not have a stroke, but during a Vipassana meditation course early 2010, I was able to successfully suppress the incessant left-brain chatter and experience the nirvana-like feeling stemming from the vibrant right-brain. That experience was somewhat spiritual for me, and being an engineer I was not able to explain the experience through my accumulated knowledge base. Her book explained the science behind it. I loved it! The last two chapters are my favorite where she says \\"that deep inner peace is just a thought/feeling away\\". Happiness is a choice, and it's too sad that many do not exercise this choice. If you read this book, you will realize that you have the power to actually determine how your brain perceives emotions and you can control it at your own will. Also, you can train your mind to react differently to external stimulation and that \\"Enlightenment is not a process of learning, it is a process of unlearning\\". What the great Yogis and Zen masters have told us for eons is elucidated very clearly in the language of science - through the story of brain cells and their fantastic multidimensional circuitry.

0061438294|5.0|In light of shows such as Lie to Me that focus purely on reading the face (which isn't accurate or the best place to read people, as explained in the book), Navarro takes a holistic and comprehensive approach to a complex topic. He writes in an easily understandable manner, and his expertise and proven techniques are excellent resources. I highly recommend this book to law enforcement officers, business people, or just anyone in general. By understanding how people are feeling, you can improve your relationships and interactions with them.
0765326353|5.0|I became a fan of Brandon Sanderson after reading the first Mistborn book and continued to be one after completing the Mistborn trilogy. I honestly believe that The Way of Kings is even better than that series. I am excited to read what will come next.

0451450523|5.0|This story is one of my all time favorites. Growing up with the motion picture as a little child, it had never occurred to me to read the novel that preceded its birth. The imagery in Beagle's words is comparable to the Arabian Nights as well as the Grim Brothers' fairy tales. He spins a world that tantalizes and swells in your mind the longer you leave the book down.    That being said, the product itself was in fabulous condition. The packaging wasn't overly humongous and the bubble wrap around it was more than enough to protect the book from physical damage. It came in new, just as it was sold and the price was more than fair (bought with a prime account).

B002VECM6S|3.0|Nothing wrong with that really.<br /><br />This movie is technically good and in another league than many other films with overt Christian themes (with the exception of the Narnia films) in terms of production values. Michael Ohrer is a role model in how he overcame his poor childhood to the NFL through sweat and determination.<br /><br />Here's the downside:<br /><br />This film misleads people as to how inept Ohrer was on the football field before arriving at the Tuohy's house. He was a 6-5 black kid who didn't know anything about football, you see. It would see this angle was inserted to make it appear that the Tuohy's generosity was entirely based on their Christian principles, when in reality, 100% of the black boys they adopted went on to their alma mater and the NFL.<br /><br />In short, this movie literally vilifies all blacks except Ohrer himself. The problem with race relations in America, this movie teaches us, is black people. A scene where Bullock's character threatens some black thugs by telling them she's a member of the NRA is torn from the white Republican fantasy book of the nature of crime and violence.<br /><br />The Tuohys just might've saved Ohrer's life, but they all don't need to be so proud of themselves about it.
0307739961|5.0|Enjoyed this book, very detailed to connect the characters to the events and pull it all together for a good ending. Have never read a book (500+ pages)in 12 days before. Sad that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us, would have loved to read more stories involving Lisbeth Salander. Have shared all 3 books with many friends,and they were not disappointed.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|While this movie has an interesting/cool concept and a cool, sexy main character; its issues destroy it. Those issues are tons of bad writing, a poorly written plot and bad camerawork in the very few poorly action scenes that this movie has to offer. Overall, this film sucks ass, skip it. 1.5/10

0545265355|4.0|When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Oz books, and there's something about this trilogy that brings that thrill back.  The \\"muttations\\" are scarier than the flying monkeys and President Snow is far more evil than the wicked witch.  But there's something about the imaginativeness richness of the settings that evokes the later books of Oz.  The world view is as dark as Vonnegut's, similar in its take on war, but without the mitigating humor.      I read the books because I teach and want to know what my students are reading now.  I couldn't put the books down myself.  As an adult, my one complaint is of course the wish-fulfillment teenage love story.  Didn't buy it.  And the action in book three is a bit too much like the narration of a video game for me. Still, it's both an imaginative tour de force and one of those books that captures a certain part of the zeitgeist so well you think 'of course.'  Someone had to write this book.
B00012BSHG|1.0|I bought this pool in April. Set it up the end of May and the first day it was warm enough to use, it got a huge hole in the bottom and deflated. We never did use the pool.  What a shame. I hope I can return it.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Live at River Plate will rock AC/DC fans and rock fans in general.  Well shot, well edited and creatively directed. The sound quality, for a live event, is superb! Of course the concert itself was classic AC/DC with a great set list of classics and new tracks. The band (especially at their respective ages) is simply amazing.  But this DVD, you'll want it for your collection.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Why can't Hollywood make more intelligent films like X-Men: First Class? What a powerful story! It kept me riveted to my seat! It proves Hollywood can make a film that is  exciting, fast paced and incredibly inspiring! There is so much that is profound in this movie, I don't even know where to start!<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is: \\"I'm tired of hearing people saying - they are only following orders!\\" Most of us have a conscience. We all know about cowardice and courage. We have all felt the desire for revenge when someone hurts us deeply. But to simply hide behind, \\"I'm only following orders,\\" as an excuse to do what is obviously wrong and cowardly is something we should all think about from time-to-time. We never know when we will be in a situation where we should \\"disobey orders\\" in order not to cooperate with malice or evil. X-Men: First Class tackles this issue head on! It's really at the center of the X-Men universe. How do we treat people who are so different from most of \\"us?\\"<br /><br />If a person's an incredible athlete, that's not a problem in American society. We turn them into multi-millionaires! But what if the person is incredibly intelligent or sensitive or creative or intuitive or talented in some other way? Don't many of us get resentful or envious or fearful or critical around people who are much more capable or talented than we are?<br /><br />It's such a joy to see this as a constant theme running through every story ever written about the X-men. It something we all need to address in our own lives! Because meeting people who are much more talented than the average person is something we need to learn to live with, and respect!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:1903853478 Brilliant Activities for Gifted and Talented Children That Other Children Will Love Too]] and [[ASIN:0316168718 The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain]] and [[ASIN:B00077DPB2 Starting Small : Teaching Children Tolerance]]

B000AMWIVM|3.0|The first time I watched SAW I loved it. All I had seen before were trailers on television for all the sequels which just looked like a bunch of people stuck in not very well thought out traps that were just there to cause as much bloodshed as possible. So, I loved the whole concept of SAW and its portrayal of people as the selfish egocentric people we are. We will do whatever it takes to survive sometimes causing others pain and even death(just think of all the looting and gangs with guns that populated New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina).<br /><br />That being said, when I watched SAW for the second time I found about half of the acting to be really pretty bad. Anytime Lawrence(Cary Elwes) was trying to act sad and almost crying I found it very unbelievable. Also a lot of Adam's(Leigh Whannell lines came off a little awkwardly but that is just my opinion.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed SAW, especially its concept, but some parts were dragged down by the poor acting.
1401223176|5.0|This is easily the best comic book I have ever read. I am a big Batman fan when he is kept grounded in reality (no time travel or extra dimensions). The story is superb and there is a massive cast of classic Batman villains and allies. The artwork stands apart from almost every other comic I have read as well, the effort that was put into this book is unmatched. I bought this not knowing what I was getting into and I will be buying the sequel to it in the next couple days.
1439152780|5.0|\\"The Distant Hours\\" was my first introduction to Kate Morton but it's definitely the start of a long-term relationship. What she has woven is a compelling tale reminiscent of the Gothic novels I used to read as a teenager, many of which featured a brooding manor house inhabited by equally brooding residents with dark secrets.     The setting here is an English castle that has not only fallen into sorry disrepair but also reflects the declining health, spirits and mental faculties of its three remaining survivors, the Blythe sisters. Morton seamlessly cuts back and forth between the late 1930's and the early 1990's, parsing out juicy clues throughout both journeys that are replete with red herrings. A third of the way into the book, I began embracing a smug belief that I had already figured everything out and knew what had probably happened to the youngest sister's lost suitor.     As the plot thickened, however, I realized that this was exactly what the author had wanted me to believe. Like Agatha Christie, she was absolute genius in this story at leaving the real clues scattered about in plain sight where they would be dismissed by the reader as irrelevant. As voracious a reader as I am - and for as many screenplays as I review in which writers try their hardest to surprise me - there were at least two \\"didn't-see-that-one-coming\\" moments in this book that were extremely well crafted and, more importantly, were entirely plausible.    Last but not least, \\"The Distant Hours\\" raises interesting discussion questions about family loyalties and the lengths to which people will sometimes go in order to control those around them. In the case of Percy, we have a presumably strong and unflappable persona who aggressively dreaded the thought of one day being left all alone and felt no remorse to implement that vision. As I read the book, I could easily draw parallels to one of my own relatives, a vain and bitter woman who determined that the most effective way to manipulate the actions of those around her was to threaten disinheritance every time they attempted to exert independence. Suffice it to say, the emotional extortion proved not to be sustainable in the end. She may have held on to every last dime but no one wept tears to see her go.    Christina Hamlett  Author of Eire Apparent
B003XRELEI|1.0|This is an example of a name author being able to write literally anything and be hailed as a genius by the literati.<br /><br />It's also an example of the public buying and praising whatever they hear they are supposed to be buying and praising. (Whether they ever read it is problematic.)<br /><br />But KV's pseudo-intellectual pap offers yet another draw for readers---those who read it can pose as great thinkers merely by praising it with a few big words. Impressive thinkers, they.<br /><br />I must admit that even I saw some deep, dark, hidden meaning in this steaming offal: the large asterisk drawing in the book was obviously the author's self-portrait.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I was slightly dissapointed with the ending, it was left more like a TBC on TV. Maybe that's how she wanted to leave, we would have to see Part 2 in order to satisfy our curiosity.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Some of this may sound disjointed, but I am trying to avoid giving away too many \\"spoilers\\" for those who have not seen these episodes.  If you are familiar with Doctor Who, you know that there are a lot of surprises in store.      In the fifth series, the Doctor has regenerated yet again, and at first, is not sure of himself.  But he does manage to notice what is going wrong around him - eventually.  He first encounters a young girl who is worried about a crack in her bedroom wall.  \\"Box falls out of the sky, man falls out of the box...you're not scared...you're not scared of anything...know what I think...that must be a hell of scary crack in your wall.\\"  It turns out that the crack is no ordinary crack, nor is it unique - identical cracks show up in every episode of this season (or \\"series\\" as they say in the UK.)      He also gets his time periods a bit muddled, and returns 12 years later, after promising to be back in 5 minutes.  The little girl is grown up, but has had a strange childhood, as is later revealed - and that crack in her wall becomes more and more significant as the series goes on.      Finally, in the second-to-last episode, Amy's fiance punches the Doctor - to which the Doctor responds \\"Welcome back, Rory Williams!\\" (Rory had died a couple of episode previously, so his re-appearance is a surprising and happy occasion, despite the violent sock on the jaw he gives the Doctor) and in the last episode, about 2000 years later in the story, Amy remembers the Doctor, and saves him from oblivion.  Of course, he is properly dressed for the occasion.  Although the episode ends with \\"goodbye\\" it is obvious that there are more adventures to follow in series 6.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Just as I expected , nice product , i recommed this product
0312330871|5.0|I just want to start off and say that I think all Agatha Christie novels are astoundingly brilliant. I love them all. I savor every speck of the page. I don't want the end of the book to be the end---every time I hope that by some impossible miracle, there will be more. I can't bear the thought that when I have read all the books...there WILL be no more! The brilliant writer herself, Agatha Christie, has passed on, and, therefore, has the possibility of new books. Meantime, I relish her enchanting plots and twisting story lines to the fullest extent, and as of a result, there has never been, and never will be a book of hers that I will not like. But this book, And Then There Were None, surpassed them all. It was glowing! Radiant! The book contains so much suspense and excitement, and general eerieness that I couldn't put it down. The whole concept of basing a murder story on a nursery rhyme is chilling, and brilliant, not to mention the beautiful language and expressive characters. And Then There Were None sent chills down my spine, and as the victims captive on Soldier Island were struck down one by one, my eyes grew larger. I was entranced by the magical spell Agatha Christie had spun in her book, and always will be. This book is a classic. Gorgeous. Spell-binding. I can't even find enough words to express my awe at Agatha Christie's talent, and novels.<br />If you are reading this, and considering buying And Then There Were None, I highly encourage you to embrace the world of mystery/murder novels which has enchanted me, and always will.
B003LDKUSK|5.0|In 1959 I purchased our first copy of \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" for our 2 year old daughter.   We were living in Boston and so the drawings were exciting and familiar to her, and the  warmth in the Mallard family was a great illustration of family ties.   Back home in Australia this has been a favorite amongst all four of my children.   Imagine my delight to find that it is still available and so can  find its way into more of my grandchildren's hearts.   They pore over the illustrations even though they are not in bright colours, and love the detail.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The Oscars have been hit and miss in recent years as far as Best Picture, but I give kudos to them for this past year's selection. The King's Speech is more than a \\"historical fiction\\" piece. Some dissenters dismiss the film as being typical Best Picture stuff, mocking its relevance, questioning its historical accuracy, or complaining that it was too predictable. I think they are missing the point of the film. It is about a powerful man's journey to overcome an impediment that is common, but one that is a crushing, debilitating roadblock for a high profile leader. It is about suffering through, but overcoming, one's problems, and the humility of that process. It is about the anxieties we all have in life. Moreover, it is about the friendship bond between a common man and the King, and the significance that bond has in the King's life.     There are many moving scenes in The King's Speech, and the casting is superb. The opening scene where Bertie attempts to address the crowd, but stammers awkwardly, is painful to endure but incredibly powerful. When Bertie's frustration hits a peak and he cries out, \\"I am not a king\\" with his wife trying to console him, it is the most powerful moment in the film, and a turning point of sorts. Collin Firth does an excellent job as the man who becomes King and is thrust into the public spotlight when his brother, David, steps down. Geoffrey Rush, as therapist Lionel Logue, really is the most impressive, as he brings humor, wit and edginess to his role confident and coach of Bertie.     The script was also well crafted. As Colin Firth points out in the \\"Making of\\" documentary, in any good writing you learn about the main character through their struggles. Bertie's struggles help you learn about the pressures he faces in daily life. Lionel Logue is multi-faceted, as he has a brashness to him, but wit and passion to help Bertie.     The features on the disc are top notch also. There is an insightful \\"Making of\\" documentary, where the friendship of the two men is explored. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush give insight into their roles. A Q and A session with the cast and director gives thoughts and perspectives on the process of the film. There are even a few audio recordings of actual speeches given by King George, as well as an option to have audio commentary.     The King's Speech is an excellent viewing experience all around.
B000002AGN|5.0|Sonically speaking, the 1997 release (Columbia/Legacy CK 65122, UPC 7464-65122-2) of Time Out is the definitive and best (CD) version of this classic, landmark album. Though it has been suggested elsewhere that the core album (CD1) of the subsequently released \\"Legacy Edition\\" of Time Out is identical to the 1997 version, that is simply not the case, as I can attest, owning both versions myself. The 1997 issue, unlike the Legacy Edition, was mastered using HDCD (High Definition Compatible Disc) technology, though not explicitly annotated on the packaging. (HDCD discs are entirely compatible with all standard CD players, and though their full sonic improvements can only be realized when using a CD player or DAC that has the ability to decode them, the encoding process during mastering imparts vast improvements in sound via reduced digital jitter and noise that CAN be heard when played back on a non-HDCD player.) In comparison, the '97 release has a clarity, freshness, definition, and 'you are there' soundstage that all other digital releases fall miserably short of. As I have reviewed elsewhere, the bonus features (an 'extra' CD and DVD) of the Legacy Edition are cool, but whether you are a true audiophile, or just someone who enjoys this album, buy the 1997 release. (After watching it once, you won't likely ever view the DVD that comes with the Legacy Edition again, but you'll listen to the music over and over!) Even if you already own previous digital versions (or perhaps even the Legacy Edition!) of this album, buy the 1997 release of Time Out now, while you still can - you'll be glad you did!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought this after having a friend recommend this book to me months ago, prior to the HBO series.  Absolutely amazing! While I loved the LoR stories, I never loved reading those books.  This is a completely different story, as it is really about the people and the relationships, NOT about the world around them.  Only bad thing about having it on Kindle, is it is one of those stories that you want to loan to people when you are done, but can't!

B004SKIPXW|4.0|It really is a terrible movie to be sure.  Right up there with Planet Terror, Machete, Shoot-em-up, and Death Race.  Certain to make critic's \\"10 Worst Movies of the Year\\" list.  This, however, puts it firmly in my top 10. I watch 3D on a 120\\" screen with an Acer H5360 projector (using an Optoma 3D-XL 3D adapter).  3D on this system is much better than your regular TV.  I thought this was very well done 3D. Most of the time it gives the movie extra depth, with just the right number of moments of shoving stuff in your face.  You can really tell the quality difference over converted movies.  One very cool 3D effect was the close up of the moon.    As a Christian I really don't have a problem with the plot.  Do bad things and you pay for it in the end. The violence was silly enough that if it hadn't been for the sex scenes I would let my teenage kids watch.  I really wouldn't have missed the sex scenes either.  The women were somewhat past their prime, unlike Piranha 3D.  Overall a great \\"Guy's Night\\" movie.
B000FC0O7M|4.0|Gene Kranz is one of those people \\"who were there\\" and helped to write the history. That itself is the reason why to read this book and it is a must for all of you who are interested in history of the space program. The book covers the Mercury to Apollo period of US space program during which Kranz served as a flight director. I expected more of a technical insight into NASA mission control business of that era but - and here comes the important part - the limited portion of technical details is compensated more than sufficently by expression of the passion shared by all people involved in the program at that time. Truth of the matter is, that passion was (due to my opinion) the most important thing on America's ladder to the Moon. It is very inspiring book, sometimes I felt the goosebumps when I realized how much is this passion missing in today's world. Although it is a clich&eacute;, when I was reading this book I had to ask \\"where the world could be, if all the people think and work in the same way as those Americans did back in that time\\". So, read it. Probably you won't become an expert on 50's and 60's mission control but you will have a lot to think about. For me, it is a mark of a really good book.
0880796863|4.0|In 1909 Aurthur Edward Waite reinvented the tarot. He was a member in good standing of the infamous Golden Dawn, which spawned other notables such as MacGregor Mathers (Sam Liddell), Aleister Crowley, and included William Butler Yeats and other famous personages. He wanted to present to the public an official modern standard of the tarot. previously the tarot had been painted by numerous artists throughout the centuries and it changed from one (artistic) hand to the next. This, his greatest creation, serves as both Alpha and Omega, as it ended the old ways of the Tarot and hit the reset button with a sledgehammer. Inasmuch as critics (then and now) hated the art, it has proven itself in its resilience. The Rider-Waite deck is far and away the most popular tarot deck--ever.<br /><br />Now, as to this particular printing. The original copyright for Pam Smith's art has long since expired. The cards were originally published in December 1909 by the publisher William Rider & Son of London. Today the PCS (Pamela Coleman-Smith) RW (Rider-Waite), or PCSRW decks, are published by U.S. Games who holds the copyrights with a vice-like grip through careful manipulation of art. This is not Pam's original art on these cards. It is Pam's original art with enough delicate changes to be able to re-copyright. On this deck you will find the copyright symbol for US Games on the face of every card. This may or may not bother you, but it is a fact of modern life. If you hunt down a pre-1971 PCSRW deck you may find one undefaced by such marks but that doesn't mean you can copyright it.<br /><br />This particular box splits the deck into two piles so they can fit in a cheat sheet for those who want to read cards but do not want to bother studying. In a society that demands instant gratification \\"at low low prices,\\" this may be the most convenient deck ever packaged. The cheat sheet and accompanying booklet are completely disposable, as is the box, for the only real value here is the actual deck, at least to anyone at all serious about using the tarot. That said, this package is a fine value for the money, as the normal cost of a PCSRW deck runs anywhere from $12-$20 depending on where you buy it. If you just want to fool around and pretend you are reading the tarot for a few minutes, and end up scaring yourself, the convenient booklet (which holds alleged \\"card meanings\\" -- don't be fooled) and the \\"Celtic Cross\\" spread cheat sheet makes it easy to wow your friends for a few minutes.<br /><br />I like this deck overall, and the packaging is of a decent quality. The box is sturdy and convenient. But if you are seriously considering getting a tarot deck I want you to *think* and I want you to know what you are getting. To understand what the cards are saying to you (keep in mind the cards are merely tools, like a hammer, or a pencil; they have no power of their own), you must know how to look at and into a card and listen. This means you are using your visual and auditory receptive mechanisms psychically. Three sentence card meanings in a book are only useful in scaring the bejeezus out of yourself and leading to disappointment. Yes, Waite wrote the book, but don't think for a moment that he didn't spend a lifetime studying the cards and only jotted these down as notes, or guidelines. The \\"Celtic Cross\\" is a decent enough spread, so the cheat sheet is a handy little device, but without proper instruction you will find yourself disappointed. I do recommend this, or many of the other PCSRW variations as learning tools to the tarot, meditation, spellwork, and developing your psychic abilities--including projection and manifestation; but I admonish you strongly not to take the accompanying book with any more seriousness than you would take a graphic novel. It is merely entertainment.<br /><br />As to instructional tarot books, there are many. I have written one, and there are several others on the market that help beginners as well. Additionally you can find qualified tarot teachers at any ethical metaphysical store.<br /><br />Finally, the art on this particular flavor of PCSRW decks is as close as you can get to the original. Key points to look for are tiny details like the Queen of wands mangy cat. The subtle \\"corrections\\" made by later artists distort Pam's under-valued additions. She had an eye for detail and thought long and hard on some elements of the cards, and it is these points, so easily missed, that add a depth of interpretation that cannot be found in clones or later spin-off decks. And the point of the tarot is to transfer information via image to your conscious mind (via your subconscious). No tarot deck does it better than this deck. Some are prettier, but none are more \\"valid.\\"<br /><br />Okay, thanks for reading.y ethical metaphysical store.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|A wonderful film and I was surprised at Claire Dane and her protrayal.  She was super and convincing in the role.  I even let my brother borrow the DVD to watch the film.
B0050XFY4O|2.0|The first 1/3, introducing us to the boys chemistry and closeness during their adolescence, is intriguing. Characters around them question their intimacy and work on their understanding. Perhaps only to expose that the boys are actually half brothers, there's some exploration on the positions of the divorced parents regarding the brothers. The two boys live with mom and second husband, the father of the younger boy. They happily visit the father of the older boy and his new wife with no conlict in the relationships of all of the parents.   Then the expostion of the subject is abruptly abandoned as mom has died and dad number two leaves the house, (a bad set direction leaves the home's interiors EXACTLY the same years later) to the two now adult brothers. The film immediatley devolves into a maudlin, erotic romance piece, with some exposition on separation, lovely cinematography and use of visuals, but making nothing of the controversial subject. Most contemporary human beings in most of the world's cultures are wired not to engage immediate family romantically or sexually. It's an obvious anomoly that isn't explored in these two men's relationship. Even if the intention was to demonstrate it as their normal, or that such a relationship can be accepted, there was no exposition of that point of view. The bad acting also underserves the themes. The two adult leads bear no resemblance, fine they're 1/2 brothers, but as actors they deliver no gravitas beyond their stellar good looks. It seemed to me a lost opportunity to explore the topic in lieu of being an erotic romance piece. It was a frustrating experience for this viewer.
B001CC7PKS|1.0|This movie is about a man who murder a man in cold blood for raping a woman he doesn't know, while not killing - in self-defense mind you - the man who scarred him for life.
0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert may be a liberal, self-absorbed woman, but she can tell a story. I was surprised that I enjoyed this book, but enjoy it I did. Gilbert's descriptive abilities are delightful and complex (I think I drooled through the entire section about Italy and its food), and some of her comical analogies were laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, the India section moved much more slowly, but is that surprising, considering it was time of prayer and meditation, and mostly inward thoughts on her part? The story picked up more momentum in Bali, and I was actually sorry that it ended.     While I probably wouldn't befriend someone like Gilbert in person (brilliant, talented, beautiful, annoyingly transparent about her political opinions, seemingly able to meet equally young, single, beautiful, brilliant people all over the planet), I appreciated the honest, no-holds-barred, take-me-or-leave-me attitude with which she wrote. She may be a liberal expatriot who scorns conservative Christianity and beds down with whoever she fancies, but I still admire her intelligence, her wit, and her creativity.
1594202842|4.0|THE GOOD: This is a very entertaining book, written in a flowing and witty style, enjoyable to read with an arc that brings you from disgust at the author to empathy and finally admiration for her personal quest for excellence and finally to respect for her. Many parts of her memoir recall and sound like the satirist David Sedaris at his most brilliant (her ultimately unsuccessful struggle to raise her dogs using Chinese parenting techniques will generate belly laughs). Buy and enjoy this book for the pure humor in it.     THE BAD: This is not a how-to book on parenting method. In fact, there is nothing in it that would teach you \\"how\\" to raise children with such obvious accomplishments as hers apparently have achieved.  No footnotes or bibliography to theory here.  No coaching on specific techniques.  There are some valuable insights, however: her observation that happiness and self-confidence come through accomplishment and hard work rather than coddling and a focus on \\"self-esteem\\" is thought-provoking. Her rejection of her children's birthday cards for being inadequate is a pearl of wisdom, however grotesque.    THE UGLY: Much of this book seems to reveal a dark side. Chua's parenting method in the book largely consists of brutal and obsessive anecdotes that would make the stereotypical obsessive Jewish Mother seem like June Cleaver in \\"Leave it to Beaver.\\"  Ultimately the motivation seems to be naked ambition -- to be the best for its own sake (or her own). Happiness or fulfillment is asserted as the consequence of this approach, but not its goal.  Page after page includes references to yelling, screaming, disrespecting, and total control of the lives of her children.   It's the parenting version of the Richard Gere classic, \\"An Officer and Gentleman\\", with Chua reprising the abusive, albeit effective, drill sergeant played by Louis Gosset, Jr.  Although she implies that her children are also well adjusted and of good character at the end of this book, we are left simply to take her word for it. She spends little or no time discussing the role of character and moral compass in child rearing.  One can only look forward to Lulu's and Sophia's own memoir and wonder if theirs will be a film sequel to another cult classic film, \\"Mommy Dearest.\\"    IN SUM: The book is worth a read: humorous, thought-provoking, grotesque; you can't help but liking the Tiger Mom in the end, yet most often you wouldn't wish her on the children of your own worst enemy.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I highly recommend this book! Jamie has such an amazing way of writing characters in such a way that allows her readers to connect with them. I enjoyed the characters of this book so much because of their flaws and realistic personalities. Jamie's writing style is addicting and I am looking forward to reading her books for many years to come!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Simple game, eat or be eaten.  Not sure what the problem is with other people's controls.  My 2.5 year old toddler actually have an awesome time with it.  Easy to get into with a lot of depth.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|First at all, I must say Liam Neeson is a versatile actor, the cast who accompanied him (Dianne Krugger, Charlize Theron and Paz Vega are to my mind the three most beautiful actresses of the world, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella) is towering too.<br /><br />But once more, let's remember Hitchcock. \\"The three basic elements of a good movie are First: a good script,Second, a good script and Third a good script.<br /><br />Maybe the hand of Roman Polanski (who is in his element with this material) would have carried the movie for better destinies. But the spectacular chases are by themselves the jewel of the crown, leaving behind the raw material of a script which could have been improved.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the film is watchable but it will be forgotten soon. An entertained movie but never a memorable one.
B004DL5K2K|3.0|This should have been a 5-star review.  I've been waiting for this remaster of this classic for a long time.  However, the new 2011 remastering is really disappointing and there are 2 major audio glitches.  Still, there are a couple nice bonuses.<br /><br />There is a very noticeable glitch at :47 in \\"Dee\\" that ruins the transition from that song into Suicide Solution.  The audio warbles loudly twice as the last chord rings.  I noticed other people have complained about this, and sure enough, it is on my CD as well, so it is likely on every pressed copy especially since I have this remaster from both the box set and the single disc from Amazon and they are identical with their problems.  Did anyone even listen to the master/reference CD before pressing it?  This defect is not on any prior version and is not even in the Blizzard documentary when Ozzy is listening to the end of Dee on the master tape.<br /><br />There is another problem in \\"Steal Away\\".  It starts out a bit muted, then at 0:03 all of a sudden it sounds like a pillow is lifted off your speakers.<br /><br />Like others have said in their reviews here, it is too compressed and the 1995 remaster actually sounds better (jusr compare the middle instrumental section of Revelation of this CD and the '95 remaster and you'll see).  When the levels on a CD are pushed too loud as they are here, it makes the CD sound very harsh and ruins the dynamics of the music.  The soft parts are louder and the louder parts are softer.  The instruments sound blended together, and not in a good way.  My playback system is average, so you don't need expensive equipment to notice this.<br /><br />Even the panning of the effects at the beginning of Crazy Train don't pan as smoothly as on the '95.<br /><br />Note - the mix of \\"You Looking at Me, Looking At You\\" on this 2011 remaster is different from the mix that was on the 1980 B-side of Crazy Train.  The CD mix is the same as what was on the Japan-only releases from 1984 and 1985that had rare tracks.  The original B-side mix was better as it had a great guitar tone like in Crazy Train and there wasn't a cowbell in the chorus.  This track is still a treat as long as you've never compared it to the other mix.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye to Romance\\" vocal/guitar mix is a 2010 remix where they just removed Bob Daisley's and Lee Kerslake's bass and drums, but it is nice to hear more of Randy's playing underneath it all, and it doesn't fade out as Randy ends it with some nice strummed harmonics.<br /><br />\\"RR\\" is a brief, but great solo by the incredible Randy Rhoads.  A must for any Randy fan or guitar player.<br /><br />What happened to obvious bonus tracks like the Mr. Crowley live EP, including the non-LP track \\"You Said It All\\"?  Likely, because there is still bad blood between the Osbournes and Bob Daisley/Lee Kerslake, these tracks were left off as well as the rest of the concert from 1980 that initially was announced as a bonus CD with this one.  There isn't even a single photo of Bob or Lee in the CD booklet.  There is still a war going on.<br /><br />This is an essential album, but stick to the 1995 remaster for the album tracks (the one with the blue border around it and \\"OZZY\\" in big letters on the front and catalog # EK 67235 - make sure to verify the catalog # before buying it used as some sellers use stock photos and mix up versions), get the mp3 of \\"RR\\" and \\"Goodbye to Romance (guitar/vocal)\\" (unless you must have the CD anyway, like me) and hound Ozzy to put out the B-side mix of \\"You Looking at Me, Looking at You\\" on CD along with the Mr. Crowley Live EP.<br /><br />3 Stars (5 huge stars for the music, but - 1 star for the harsh remastering, and - 1 star for the unacceptable glitches, especially the one in \\"Dee\\").<br /><br />If you want to check out more about how loud mastering adversely affects the sound on CD's (Metallica's Death Magnetic anyone?), or you think this Blizzard '11 remaster sounds better than the '95, just type Loudness War into YouTube or Google and you'll see how loud CD's ruin the sonics and dynamics of the music on it.<br /><br />Note to record companies like Sony: if you want to sell more CD's, more people will buy them if you just make them sound better, which you can do since the mastering is completely in your control.  Poor sound = less sales.
B000068QZK|4.0|First off, I actually rate this album 4&1/2 stars, something you can't do on amazon haha. This is Ozzy's last album of the 80's, and a fitting end to his crazy, slick, glamish metal era. After the ups and downs from The Ultimate Sin album, guitarist Jake E. Lee was asked to leave, along with then bassist Phil Soussan. Ozzy was left to find yet another guitarist, only about 4 or 5 years after Randy's tragic death, he released the very fitting Tribute live album featuring Randy's amazing skills on guitar. While searching for another guitarist, Ozzy recalls having a box of tapes, and reaching for the very first one was a cassette tape of a skinny, blond guitarist on his porch, and dismissing the kid as 'another Randy Rhoads look-alike'. But to his surprise when the kid showed up to audition, the then unknown Zakk Wylde. After hearing his great skills, Ozzy recruited him to join the band, with Randy Castillo still on drums, Bob Daisley returning yet again for bass/song writing. But like the previous album, Daisley did not tour with Ozzy, and to many's surprise, Ozzy's old Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler took bass duties for the majority of the tour. This defiantely helped Ozzy's performance, now having half the original Sabbath lineup intact, along with a great, fresh new guitarist, the tour was a success, but Ozzy would still face many demons with addiction and soon to be lawsuits.<br /><br />As for No Rest For The Wicked, it ranks well underrated in the Ozzy canon. There's no real big hit single or stand-out track on the album, but that doesn't make it a bad thing. Starting off with the instantly memorable riff of Miracle Man, Ozzy shows he was back with a hard rock vengeance after the somewhat lighter sides shown on The Ultimate Sin. The video and lyrics were a total rip directly towards the then scandalous Jimmy Swaggart, a long time oppositional evangelist against Osbourne, who was caught doing permiscuous acts with a woman. But unlike the scandal, the song is not dated at all, and ranks as one of Ozzy's great metal songs. Devil's Daughter is next, another good song with a good feel. Crazy Babies, maybe with Miracle Man, rank as possibly the most recognizable songs on the album. It's a pretty decent song, but shows the sign of the times and ends up sort of lacking. But the next song fixes this really quick. Almost instantely hearing the riff, you know that Breaking All The Rules is going to rule(*pun intended). Ranks as possibly the best track on the album, very heavy. Next up is a creepy beggining of Bloodbath In Paradise, and though it states in the liner notes it's about Vietnam, this song is obviously all about the the Manson family murders, a very interesting and great song. Then we have the first sort of ballad on the album, the great Fire In The Sky. Another great song with some great lyrics. Tattooed Dancer features some great percussion work from Randy Castillo, another great hard-hitting metal song. Demon Alcohol is Ozzy's testament to his struggle and addiction, with insightful lyrics, a pretty good song. The original album only listed 8 tracks, but the last track was the hidden Hero, another good song, I think Ozzy informing his listeners not to follow his footsteps haha. The expanded edition features the song The Liar, another ballad song. It's a pretty good song, very 80's sounding which is not a bad thing in this case. The live version of Miracle Man is pretty good, nothing special about it, a better version can be found on the following live EP, Just Say Ozzy. Overall, this is an essential album for Ozzy fans, a great hard-rock album and beginning of a now legendary guitarist.ed at all, and ranks as one of Ozzy's great metal songs.

B004SVM7BW|5.0|Just the type of app i was looking for, can annotate pdfs just as described, so far no bugs! :)
0671027344|5.0|Since I first read this book back in 2005, I have given copies out to friends, read it at least once every year, and praise it greatly. It reminds me of my childhood, I was kind of independent and stuck to underground music and art. I experienced a lot of the same things Charlie had, except for the twist at the end. In all honesty I am likely very biased.<br /><br />But this is my review. I'd say if you can get this book cheap, then do. \\"It'll change your life\\" I used to say when I was younger. Nowadays, I know it won't. But it's still an amazing book. Perfect for any children, brothers, sisters, cousins, or other teenagers you may know.<br /><br />Everyone should read it at least once in their life.
0316098329|4.0|As a teacher, this book helped me see things through a child's eyes.  Loved the innocence; loved the way the mother handled her son in a difficult situation.  The language was beautiful through many voices.  I highly recommend this book if you can hang in there with a plot where humans are abused, but make the best of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is both first person, and present tense. It has a very unique story line and is almost impossible to put down. It is very well written and very well laid out. But, a warning to young readers. This trilogy is very violent and dark. I would recomend it for thirteen year's and older. Despite the violence and dark plot, I loved it. Definently worth your time.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|With eleven members... it's either going to be a complete mess, or an amazing ensemble in which each instrument compliments each other. This record is even more than the latter.. every instrument works in tandem beautifully and the female vocals on the top of everything absolutely shine. It's got a feel of the 70's jazzy/bluesy tunes, a splash of 80's catchiness, a hint of 90's alternative, and a shiny 2000's production value. Overall it is a great album for EVERYONE to enjoy. My parents love it, my friends love it, and I love it!
B004G6009U|5.0|Having been disappointed by many animated films for a while (mostly competent, but lacking in chemistry), was pleasantly surprised by Tangled.  Not the deepest film you'll ever see, but I thought it was fresh and fun.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I had such high hopes for this film, because I usually like adaptations of Jane Eyre, but it was such a disappointment!  It felt as though it was 5 hours long and Mia Wasikowska was incredibly bland and un-spirited, even Michael Fassbender's handsomeness couldn't make up for that.  Further, she looks as though she is 15 and he is clearly in his thirties, which didn't make for good chemistry at all!  I have seen other adaptations(the best being with Toby Stephens, in my opinion), and never hoped it would finally come to an end.  I think sometimes when Hollywood gets \\"its\\" hands on classics like this, a big budget isn't always the best idea.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Found it a fun little movie.  Not going into it with any expectations of it being some type of artistic classic, it met my expectations of being a fun, action flick that doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of violence. Rude and crude.  All in all, not bad.  William Fichtner (\\"the Accountant\\") was a riot.
B004UXUSIM|3.0|I miss Woody Allen. I really do. I think somebody doppelganged him after Zelig and there's been an impostor making the same film over and over and over and, well, now they are all blond with California accents as though the Beach Boys embody the same neuroses that New Yawkahs carry with pride. Having seen this today, I said to the missus that I felt like I was watching a two hour episode of Seinfeld. It's a movie that isn't about anything other than showing you how good Paris looks when you can recite the script as the story unfolds. What this has going for it is that it is infinitely better than Veni, Vidi, Vicki Barcelona. Anyone who makes a movie with Penelope Cruz that sucks deserves to be locked in an elevator with Tom Cruise for all of eternity.    Paris upstages the script here in every frame. The only time it gets it wrong is when Carla Bruni pops in as cemetery tour guide. She's a cardboard cut out that affords Allen bragging rights that he got the ex-mistress of Clapton and now Mrs Sarkozy in a cameo. She's neither funny nor sexy, just there, like the shrubbery. And then there is the way Paris is filmed, it's pleasant and certainly reminiscent of better films shot in Paris, most notably Before Sunset. My guess is that it was shot in Spring.     I tend to think that Owen Wilson is one of the very worst actors in the world. However, he almost takes the role of ersatz-Nebbish someplace other. There are great stretches in the film when he's his own man, and at those points, he rises above what has always seemed to be his stoned and pathetic persona. When the script reduces him to the aforementioned bleached out Upper East side spoiled neurotic, the film misses a great opportunity to break free from the Allen-esque cliches that showcase Woody on auto-pilot. All his basic tricks are still there: superficial references to psycho-analyses and existentialism delivered in opposition to a Tony Roberts stand in; relationships that are flat out wrong; cultural disconnects that vaguely echo the great dysfunctions of Annie Hall's family; prurient interests in wild sexual encounters. Wilson seems ready to take these tried and true formulas out for a ride, but inevitably you hear Woody behind the character Wilson plays, and frankly, that's a shame, most especially for Allen.    Vicki was a film for the daughters of especially spoiled Americans who haven't a clue how good they have it. This film returns the focus to the parents. Not sure it's so easy to relate to the angst of those who can't decide whether to buy, buy, buy, in Paris, crap they have no place for, for the exclusive reason that it's expensive and it's Paris and you can't get this crap back home, even in Crap Depot, i.e. LA. Yes, that's the existentialist point of conspicuous consumption, but those kinda empty calories have been trotted out so many times, they've lost their bite.    Before Sunset accomplished a number of things Allen's film might have taken up and expanded upon, not the least of which is the nature of relationships in a world whose certainties have become fleeting. A long time ago, that was Woody's court. The tricks of time that the film plays with are imaginative, but serve only as tricks, and an excuse for a bit of Marie Antoinette slapstick. Before Sunset ran in real time, and made its points with a whallop you wish Allen could muster again.    One of the other cliches attendant upon an Allen film is that all of the senior citizens in the audience applaud as the credits roll. It's polite applause. The kind of applause you make when you haven't been either challenged or offended. The latter is honourable, the former tragic. Allen is capable of a better and funnier film than this. Maybe he'll make it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Wow it's no wonder why this book is so popular. It has everything going for it. A heroine unlike any we have seen before, a heart pounding mystery, and brilliant writing style. I am rushing this review because I desperately want to start reading the sequel! Take a chance on this one. You wont regret it!
0425242099|5.0|I've waited ten books for this story and I wasn't disappointed. Singh's characters leap off the page and her world is richly detailed and lush. Hawke and Sienna were perfect and, while some may have wished for earlier intimate scenes, I didn't. The pacing, considering Sienna's youth and inexperience and the war building behind the scenes, fit the story. The side scenes with Walker and Lara were the sprinkles on the icing as far as I am concerned. From book one, Walker's odd metal signature has been noted and now we know the answer to why. I was glad to see that no thread was left dangling nor were the details of the world rushed to focus on more erotic aspects as some authors are wont to do. It adds so much more to the romance for me, that the back story is complete and detailed.    Now eagerly awaiting Archangel's Blade...
B002NHBNWW|5.0|For those who keep trying to insinuate that this is a copy of Twilight I'd like to point out that the original 2 books in this series were written in the early 1990's so I have to wonder who was copying who.  The series is better than the books.
B004Y03LQ2|3.0|I make my own various compilations from time to time since I have most of their stuff, minus Virtual and Ed Hack. I am a huge fan of their music from the last decade. I love complexity and originality. They are a band that grows and changes. I don't need to hear stuff that sounds like The Trooper or Run to the Hills. I'm all for change, for better or worse. If I don't like it, I avoid it. To each their own.   My song list would be different since I like overblown solos and noodling, but all these are good songs. Obviously this is for newbies and long lost fans looking for what the band has been doing since Seventh Son. Really I'm glad they didn't add new tracks or rare live tracks, because then I would have bought it and had a bunch of other songs I already have. Though the artwork might be worth it.  To newbies and returning fans, this is good, otherwise no need.
1440503257|3.0|I like this cookbook because it has many everyday recipies and relates them to Harry Potter. I was disappointed with it because it lacked the ultimate Harry Potter recipie that I was looking for the most: Butterbeer. It also leaves out several desserts and candies of Harry Potter.    But it is good for other recipies especially English ones, and it is neat how it is related back to Harry Potter, but not what I was expecting.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|I have seen a few other Queen DVDs and have a penchant for concert Blu Rays in general so I had high expectations going into this. Queen Rock Montreal not only lived up to my expectations but in many areas exceeded them. Not only is the concert filmed just before the synthesizers-period, with the band absolutely playing the hell out of their instruments, but the technical aspects of the concert recording are top notch too, leaving the whole thing great in all departments.<br /><br />The sound quality is absolutely superb, crystal clear and very big, which really brings to attention all the skill and virtuosity with which Queen played the gig, and that's not just the mix but the recording quality itself too.<br /><br />The video, which is of course excellent in the main concert, has been scrutinized and cleaned up on the original 35mm prints before being re-scanned for maximum quality, there is even a fairly detailed description of the process in the linear notes. Consequently, the concert looks amazing and clear in a way no other Queen concert does as of yet.<br /><br />In terms of the concert itself, there is no question of quality whatsoever. Queen are absolutely electric and deliver a wide array of some of their hardest and heaviest material in about as energetic and impressive a performance as has been captured on film, and mix it up with a few quieter numbers for balance and variety, leaving a full and complete Queen concert experience.<br /><br />The band don't even just stick to the big radio hits either, playing material such as 'Dragon Attack,' 'Get Down Make Love,' and 'Sheer Heart Attack,' that you wouldn't necessarily expect in with the 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' and 'Under Pressure,' level songs.<br /><br />The highlights for me were the excellent performance of 'I'm In Love With My Car,' with Roger both singing masterfully and nailing the drum fills to perfection as well as their fast and hard rendition of early number 'Keep Yourself Alive.'<br /><br />The band's performance is excellent, the track listing is excellent and the audio visual quality is excellent. What more could you possibly ask for in a concert Blu Ray ?<br /><br />In terms of extras, you get commentary from Brian and Roger, A hilariously bad 80s TV special on Queen, An interesting rehearsal/interview for Live Aid and of course the excellent Live Aid performance itself, which doesn't even require describing it is that well regarded.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product, I enjoy a lot of Live Concert DVDs and Blu Rays and this is definitely one of the finest I've come across, especially if you like the harder rock side of Queen.g is excellent and the audio visual quality is excellent.

B000068QZK|5.0|Seriously, this is Ozzy Osbourne. Whether he or Zakk Wylde like it or not, this is the way it should be done. It's faster than ever. It's just cool as can be. I mean yes there are some kind of cheesy sounding things in the production which reek of 1988, but other than that, everything rocks. To be honest i love its cheesy 80's sound. It's very catchy at times and just sounds like a good time more than todays metal. Don't get me wrong, this stuff isn't happy by any stretch, but its much less doom and gloom than Sabbath. This one introduces Zakk Wylde at 19 years old, and at that age is still better than anyone else. The only person in my lifetime who was better was Dimebag and he's dead. RIP. Anyway at 19, Zakk had a pretty nifty style, and it's quite amazing to listen to now, knowing what he sounds like now. There are no bad songs on this at all. \\"Fire In The Sky\\" is the least good, but even that Zakk lights up in the later parts of the song. \\"Devil's Daughter\\" Demon Alcohol\\" and \\"Breaking All The Rules\\" are some of Ozzy;s best forgotten tracks. They just rip. This album does. Period.
B003UESJEM|4.0|While the solutions to the problems in this movie are somewhat convenient at times, I thought the movie was quite good and managed to convey, albeit in a generalized way, the series of emotions and situations that a newly unemployed person will go through in this type of setting. Watching hubris and denial fade into desperation and anger, and then transform into humility or hopelessness was an interesting progression throughout this movie, although I think it would have been better to convey those overarching emotional themes in a more tightly focused lens on specific characters within the movie. Overall, a good rental.<br /><br />Here is where I am disappointed, I rented this movie via Amazon's streaming service and was extremely disappointed with the playback. It froze up more than 15x in the first 30 minutes. This has happened to me on multiple occasions while using this service in particular. Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund for one of the movies I couldn't watch, but told me at that time that it is not a common practice for them to do this because they have no control over the data pipes that transmit the feed. While I understand this, I also will say that I am very hesitant to rent another movie with this service until they are able to work out the bugs. Who knows when that will be?
B004H1YH66|5.0|Conan soundtrack, for me and many others, is among the best of all time. This re-recording is absolutely amazing, with arrangements close to the original recorded in Italy. Many previously unreleased tracks turns it, no doubt, a collectors gift.  Personaly, I do not like re-recordings, but the orchestration of this record is brilliant, recorded in just one session, all instruments played together. I do recommend this CD to all soundtrack fans.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I am interested in thrillers when reading, I need something that really sucks me in or it is hard to finish a book. I have never read any of Jo Nesbo's books before, nor had I ever heard of him. I stumbled upon this before going on vacation and thought I would give it a try. I was amazed at how the book never got boring, and I was always ready to turn the page. Even though I hadn't read any of his previous books, I don't feel like I missed out on anything from the past books that made me not understand what was happening in this particular book. It was exciting all the way through and very well written! I will absolutely purchase more books from this author! An excellent read with great twists and turns! If you want to read about a serial killer and the detective that hunts em down, this is the book!!!
1594202842|5.0|Loved this book, as I found it thoroughly entertaining. I was laughing out loud several times while reading it - mainly because the cultural references were so spot-on.  (I also grew up as a first generation Chinese American. ) I am a fan of Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan, but this book updates the genre for our generation. I'll recommend this book to family and friends, but it was initially recommended to me by a non Asian-American, as we were having a conversation about what is the best education for our children. It's a great read in this sense, for the insights it gives on the struggles and questioning that most mothers experience when trying to understand what is best for our daughters, and how to impart a sense of musical passion about being the best we can be.
B001DF68MA|4.0|PRO's:  Very easy to install (Be sure to check out dimensions and that you have a bike that will be comfortable to ride with the WeeRide installed), love the adjustable legs, the front cushion was weird at first because my daughter couldn't see over it but then I realized how nice it was for her to put her head down and she even sleeps on it!  The front cusion is detachable.  You can very easily switch the WeeRide from one adult bike to another.  BEST OF ALL...your child is in front of you in  your embrace and not trailing behind at ground level!    CON's: I do wish the back of the seat was a bit higher but I think that is just a personal preference.  I don't see a safety issue with it.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 was a far more interesting film that I thought. The trailers didn't look very interesting and what convinced me to see the movie were comments I heard on the radio. A comment that I recalled was that the first half of the film was like a Steven Spielberg movie (not surprising, as he was a producer) with the second half like a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.  I came away feeling the film was an excellent tribute to Mr. Spielberg.      The story is set in a small suburb in 1979 and focuses of a group of movie-making kinds (much like Spielberg and writer-director J. J. Abrams themselves) who are making a zombie film.  The characters have their own deep conflicts centering on the death of Joel Lamb's mother (sensitively acted by Joel Courtney). Joel's father, a deputy sheriff (Kyle Chandler providing an excellent performance) has a strong dislike for one of his deceased wife's co-workers Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard). This causes problems in a budding romance between for Joel and Alice Dainard (beautifully played by Elle Fanning).  Everything changes when the kids observe a train derailment, documented on their Super 8 camera that allows an alien creature to escape.      The feel of the movie was closer to ET for me with the kids knowing more than the adults and knowing what needs to happen once they have all the facts about what is going on.  This is a beautifully acted film with some excellent special effects that add to the viewing experience without being gratuitous.  I think Super 8 is the kind of film that can be enjoyed more when seen the second or third times.  It is fun to watch and the details of the story and the performances can be appreciated when watched again.

B00318COS4|5.0|What a fabulous game. I would give it 17 stars if I could, it is so much above the ordinary! Machinarium is a mixture of pure puzzle (such as solving a moving marble puzzle to open a lock) and inventory-based adventure game (such as picking up a flower stem, which later you will plant in a pot in another building).<br /><br />You're in a wonderfully drawn and painted world inhabited by robots.  There are no words spoken when robots interact. Rather you see thought balloons with a little video that moves the story along, or a pictogram or figure of an item that a robot wants.  The way emotions are portrayed without words is inventive. Reminds me of the movie \\"Wall-E\\".<br /><br />The protagonist is just as cute as Wall-E. He's a little robot who's sweet on a little girl robot. Unfortunately, there are bully robots, and their evil plans must be thwarted.<br /><br />I thought all of the puzzles were pretty challenging and some of them are DIFFICULT. Wow - hurt my brain and my family got tired of me muttering to myself, \\"No, that doesn't work. Maybe if I move it this way.\\"  Only one, to defuse a bomb, is timed, and if you don't make it in time, the game dumps you back to right before you started working on the bomb. I \\"died\\" the first time, but what was good (for me) is that what you managed to learn the first time still holds true the 2nd time, so the 2nd time I didn't need as much time and defused the bomb.<br /><br />If you need a hint, there's a little lightbulb over the scene. When you click on it, it gives you a pictogram of what you need to do next.  The lightbulb didn't help me much, because I generally knew what I was supposed to do, I just had trouble finding out how to do it.  What was much more useful, however, was the booklet, \\"machinarium walkthrough\\" that came with this Collector's Edition. The walkthrough is a work of art, itself.  The whole thing is in handdrawn pictures/pictograms, such as the thought balloons in the game. It is marvelous!  And I had to resort to it more than once, though I'm not sure why I couldn't figure out on my own that bringing bees into the oil pub to distract the bartender was the way to get the barrel out the door.<br /><br />There was only one \\"puzzle\\" that I really didn't like and that was the giant one at the end.  It's like a pac-man game where you have lives and after you unlock a gun you have to \\"get\\" 33 red evil robots in order to finish the puzzle, including finding the buggers as you go from one screen to another trying to make your way through a maze.  I don't like games like that and I'm not good at games like that (latter contributes to the former, of course!). Though I could tell that it was much slower, etc., than real pac-man, I still had trouble (reflexes of a slug) and just got annoyed that I had to do this to proceed.  Brain-puzzles I love. Reflex puzzles I don't.  BUT - I'm sure most people wouldn't have trouble with it, so there you go. And fortunately for me, the booklet that came with this edition has a map of the maze, so at least I could figure out where I was.<br /><br />I played Machinarium with no problem on a PC XP.  When I put the disc in, to install the game, I didn't get a pop-up screen. Instead I had to go to:<br />My Computer<br />Click on CD<br />Click on icon to Install-Machinarium.exe<br /><br />After I'd saved my game and exited, to resume the game:<br />Insert CD and wait for it to load (there was no pop-up)<br />Click on the desktop icon for machinarium<br />When a black screen comes up, with the name \\"machinarium\\" in wavy white letters<br />click on the name<br /><br />Happy Readerough I'm not sure why I couldn't figure out on my own that bringing bees into the oil pub to distract the bartender was the way to get the barrel out the door.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|My kids love this movie.  And you can watch it as an adult too. Steve Carrol is a great actor.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took me a chapter or two to become comfortable with the narration and perspective.  Once that took hold, I was hooked.  This is a new modern classic that everyone should read.    I know you will enjoy it.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|She really captures love and heartache in her songs.  Her vocals are unique and unlike any artist out there.  I can't wait to here upcoming albums.  I wish she her tour brought her by Houston.  I'm sure she puts on a great show.
0425241505|5.0|Dragon Bound  By Thea Harrison  Copyright May 2011  Berkeley Sensation    Synopses   Half-human and half-wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful - and passionate - of the Elder races.     As the most feared and respected of the Wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre cannot believe someone had the audacity to steal from him, much less succeed. And when he catches the thief, Dragos spares her life, claiming her as his own to further explore the desire they've ignited in each other.     Pia knows she must repay Dragos for her trespass, but refuses to become his slave - although she cannot deny wanting him, body and soul ...    Review  Pia is essentially a good girl trying to stay out of trouble and off the grid.  Her mother started training her from a very young age in the fine art of hiding in plain sight.  Falling in love with the wrong guy has caused her heartache and problems as he blackmails her into breaking into the Dragon's Lair to steal something for his bosses.      The story is well crafted and the characters have a definite depth of character to them. While Pia finds herself in deep doo doo with Dragos, she also finds him very interesting and even charismatic.  If you are a fan of Urban Fantasies and Paranormal Romance you simply must read this book.  I fully intend to follow this author's progress as the series continues to unfold and Pia, Dragos, and her bodyguards find new ways to get into and out of trouble.     Thea Harrison is a multi published author in the Romance Genre and this is her first outing into the Urban Fantasy realms.  She can be found hanging out at  and also at     FTC Full Disclosure: I borrowed this book from my local library with the full intention of reviewing it online.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I love this CD. I play it all the time. I seem to be driving my teenage daughter crazy with it, but... what can I say? If you love Hugh Laurie and you like the blues... this is a great album to have. :)
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I've enjoyed other Moning books, but this one was boring, boring.  The story didn't go anywhere and I didn't finish.  Maybe someday I'll find out how it ended, but really don't care right now.
B004EBUXSA|4.0|Pros:   - Great Proc.  Handles everything I throw at it like a champ.  Benchmarks incredibly well at stock, don't see why you'd even need to OC much at all.   - Supposedly OCs like a champ too.   - Cheap.  Third the price of the 990x and very comparable to that processor.  Blows anything AMD out of the water.    Cons:   - New Socket 1155.  Didn't affect me as I wasn't upgrading from first-gen i-series, but could see why this would irk some people who were.   - The stock HSF is TRASH.  Almost impossible to seat right with dumb tab system as opposed to screws and coldplate used on aftermarket HSF.  Then, when you get it up and running, temps SHOOT UP whenever you tax the proc a bit.  I prime95-ed mine at stock (Turbo Boost was on, but set down to only 3.6 GhZ instead of the default 3.8 GhZ) and, literally within 15 seconds, I hit 87 Celsius.  Insanity.  I saw no temp stabilization in sight so I quickly aborted the burn test.  I understand that if you're OCing, you should really do so with an aftermarket HSF, but to run a processor at stock or below-stock speeds and hit 87 after 15 SECONDS?!?! That's ridiculous.  The chip would almost be better off if I opened the case and literally blew air out of my mouth onto the processor (exxagerations, of course).    Other Thoughts:   - Intel is basically banking on the idea that non-overclockers will never tax this proc to anywhere near full load @ stock.  I basically have to agree with that tenet, as right now, the highest proc % usage I've seen in non-benchmarking regular use is probably 25 if that.  But still, I find it a bit dishonest to make a HSF that allows your own proc to hit dangerous speeds at STOCK within SECONDS.  I even tried replacing the stock thermal paste with AS5, still no luck.  I'll probably deal with it for now, and only hardcore game after obtaining an H70, H80, H100, or other such aftermarket cooler.  All in all though, amazing proc, laughably horrible HSF.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Having considered Lowepro Fastpack 300, as I have added more gears, I have chosen it for the price, design and lightweight. Here are things I can easily pack: Canon 60D body, 3 lenses: 18-135, 70-300mm and Tamron 28-75mm, flash Canon 430II, cleaning kit, lens hoods, backup battery, VC & CPL filters and cards. There are rooms for 1 or 2 more lenses. While I still use Lowepro topload if I only carry 1 or 2 lenses, it's nice to have a backpack for all camera stuff. This is by no means a professional bag, and I take photos for fun, so this is just what I need.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The AmazonBasics Protective TPU Case with Screen Protector for AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4 only comes with instructions on how to apply the Screen Protector but the Protective TPU Case is easy to figure out.<br /><br />I always get nervous about applying screen protectors of any kind however with the enclosed instructions along with the screen applicator I found this one very easy to apply. So easy, I was able to get the screen protector on the first try. But there is one downfall to the screen protector, it shows fingerprints easily and it takes some work to remove the smudges.<br /><br />The Protective TPU Case was easy to dress my iPhone 4 in by aligning the buttons with the correct/like openings in the case. At first glance the case looks slippery, hard and unyielding but it's just right bendible and easy to grip. The feel of the case, gives you enough traction that the iPhone doesn't easily slip out of your hand, which gives me a secure feeling while walking with it in my hand. I was also able to slip the iPhone with the case on into the [[ASIN:B002UVACP0 Black Mesh Gym Armband Case Cover]] (which was my son's and made for an iPhone 3) that I have been using for exercising.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with the case even though I'd like a screen protector that didn't show smudges so easily.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|this app is extremely well made. I'm personally into games with more complex controls. glad to see such quality coming to Android though!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I'm watching this opera on TV right now, and  i will definitely be getting it! Nick Jonas is in this opera, and i think it is a good fit because he was in an opera just before he started his career, and is a good fit in the 25th anniversary of the best-selling opera! LOVE IT!!!
0452289963|5.0|I read this book two years ago or so and it changed my life forever. Though reading it created a massive paradigm shift that took about a year to adjust to, my life has never been the same. I've been able to live, and though I was living before, I now live without fear, which equals more living. Or rather:    life + fear = life/2  life - fear = life^2    If the ego is recognized for what it is, fear goes away, and that means being willing to take a lot more chances and experience what you currently have to a greater degree.    This book isn't the end-all in spiritual teaching, but it has truth in it that I think everyone can benefit from. It jump-started a tremendous period of growth for me, as I think it has for millions already, that I was able to build on to increase my understand of How Stuff Works that I don't think would have been possible otherwise (or would have taken a whole lot longer).     Also, Eckhart Tolle is a very unassuming man you just can't help liking.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|It is tough to describe a good iPhone case it is kind of like art work you just know when you like it. In the case (no pun intended) of the AmazonBasics Protective TPU case - I really, really like it. The case fits on the iPhone 4 perfectly, it fits snugly but it is easy to put on and take off. The AmazonBasics iPhone case is relatively inexpensive but compares very favorably to more expensive cases.<br /><br />A few other notes-<br /><br /> - Feels great on your hand - not too rubbery, yet it is still easy to grip<br /><br />- Nice look to it - it certainly does not look cheap<br /><br />- Comes with a protective screen and cleaning cloth<br /><br />- Offers a nice amount of protection, while I would not recommend dropping your iPhone it will offer you some protection<br /><br />- Double protection on the screen, both from the protective screen and the fact that the case does not fit flush to the screen, so you have some protection for the face of your iPhone.<br /><br />Final Verdict - a great case that provides a nice value. Highly recommended<br /><br />5 Stars
B004K4AVAG|1.0|except copy this way from great madonna and judas, this album is a holy crap.  far away from the fame monster.  I don't understand why some monsters(most of them are 14 years old around) like GAGA because she is unique?  really?  dresses like a drag queen? talk like a moster without mind? Is this these little moster fond of her?  Unlike the fame moster, this album is a crap, GAGA now mainly focus on how to sell albums, how to make the numbers good, how to attract people's attention with worse dressing, is this really fashion??? ugly, only this word can describe what GAGA has done now.  Some may say GAGA has many followers on facebook, oh, come on,then why so many of them don;t buy her music?  just because they add GAGA because people are curious about why many people add her.  GAGA;s team now work on internet, hire some people to write articals to praise her,please keep your eyes open monsters. Don;t just be a fool.  Songs  in this album mostly sound like noise, come on you guys ,you must admit that. I see some compliments on amzaon, just can`t understand. Must admit the fame monster is good, but this album? oh no.I think amazon's compliments contain some GAGA's hard core,so whatever this crap is, the result in their eyes is good. Poorly sad,you monsters always said you have your own ideas,but this time, you are misled,really indeed.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|Not just Blu-ray with all its bells and whistles of good sound recording, but the blessed quality of the performance itself. I've never been a great fan of Abbado, but here, and reading all the related material of this great orchestra [Orchestra Mozart] with its slew of brilliant young artists - what a wonderful sight to behold, these youngsters carving for themselves this niche of high quality performance. Why, he is so secure and excellent in reading these concertos. This has made purchasing the Brandenburg Six all the more worthwhile.     I've had recordings in all formats - from vinyl, audio casette and CD [all by the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Von Karajan], and to have a visual presentation of it now, by such a consummate group of performers, makes me want to get Beethoven's \\"Missa Solemnis\\" in Blu-ray.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|Okay, highly, highly (over) anticipated this 1... Listened to it a couple of times now & altho' I don't really find it fantastic or anything... it ain't really *that* bad. Been a follower of them ever since BATS & of the opinion that they reached their peak with GTA & their low with Heretic, this 1's lyrics really, REALLY suck & the opener should have been 'Existo Vulgore' instead of the weird 'Too Extreme' (which I actually like). About 60% of the album's to my liking & I don't find the 'techno' influences all that overbearing...  Altogether not an album that I'd repeatedly listen to & that's a shame !
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I read the other reviews, and had to comment on some of the complaints about this movie.  First of all, it is one of the best movies I have watched, and trust me, I've seen some awful movies.  Including, Nicole Conn's \\"Claire of the Moon\\".  If I would've known that she did this movie as well, I would've probably missed a great movie and story.  For the complainers about this movie, I would suggest they buy/read the book.  It really builds the background for these characters, and is a wonderful companion to the movie.  It's not just a rehash of the movie, but stands alone.  It answers all of the \\"why\\" questions that reviewers tend to have posted.    And if you thought the \\"kiss\\" scene was either wonderful, or too much (I tend to lean towards the \\"too much\\" side), read the same scene in the book.  They kissed for hours in the book! The 3+ minutes on film is nothing!
1594202710|5.0|As is to be expected -given the background of the author- this book deals primarily with aspects of Chinese foreign policy. Again, as is to be expected from the author, the books deals with the subject superbly!    The first 200 pages deal with the history of China (and mostly of Chinese foreign policy) up to the secret visit of the author to China in 1971, balance 400 pages from then on, until 2010.    One should not expect a history of China, covering all aspects equally, nor should one expect a complete biography of Mao. This, I think, was not the aim of Dr. Kissinger. As the title indicates, the book covers one area of China, and this is its relationship with the outside world.    And this aspect is treated with great competence, impeccable logic, and in a very interesting style!    Full marks for this important book!!
1600610234|2.0|While it isn't necessariy a bad book, it's appearance is in line with more intermediate-advanced tutorial books.  In actuality, it's simple a paint by the numbers setup to replicate an existing drawing.  Pretty much useless in developing your own working method or gaining any real understanding of the technical illustration techniques required to actually create original artwork along the same lines.    What really made me dislike this work is that a majority of designs are roughly the same, crab or spider like lower half with what appears to be an alienware computer tower glued on top.  The author frequently claims that it's not important to create working designs as long as they look cool and that photoshop is an adequate painting program.  This made me cringe as an illustration student.  Photoshop was never intended to be used for digital painting, and there are far cheaper and better alternatives out there for digital painting and illustration.    Everyone has their own view on the subject, yes, but I believe that striving to create believable fantasy is better than just creating something with the \\"deal with it\\" attitude.     I was expecting a technical manual geared towards working creatives and instead got the how to draw manga equivalent of science fiction illustration.    Less like this and more like color and light by james gurney please.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|As the title says, cute and easy to grasp.  I think this will be a hit with my young ones in the household.  I have an issue with the non-joystick method of control, but other than that it plays well on my Motorola Atrix.

But if you are looking for a full sized study bible that has a beautiful well made cover.  You will be pleased.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag because I was shooting and videoing a 50th birthday party. I am an amateur photo hobbyist, whatever you want to call me. I carried in this bag, a slik tripod, Nikon D5000, Nikon D80, Canon EOS 1V, Nikkor 50mm f/1.4g, Nikkor 18-200 f/3.5-200, Canon 85mm f/1.2, Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6, 3 rolls of Kodak film, SB400 flash, a macbook cleaning cloth, flip video camcorder, a battery grip for the EOS 1V, and extra batteries for the D80, D5000, and EOS 1V. If you can tell, this bag does wonders. It is able to reformat its interior so your cameras can stay nice and snug, as well as being packed like a pregnant woman. It is sturdy on your shoulders, but beware, the straps are not as comfortable as they seem. the straps that go horizontally as well are not that great. I wouldnt say im large, but im 5' 9 and weigh 185. my body is athletic; the chest strap is at my neck. the waist strap is good. I would say this bag is unbeatable. it protects the equipment efficiently from minor hits (i never want to hit it hard!) and it fairly weather proof, i walked the high line with a pentax 67s medium format and canon eos1v and my d80. i had my new 28mm f/2.8 and 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 as well as my 50mm f/1.4. the mist and ran only hit the exterior and protected my bag despite me not using an umbrella. if people would like to see the different ways i have packed this bag, please let me know, i have one time fit a Polaroid Sun 600, D80, Canon EOS1V, and Nikon D5000 in there with 3 different lenses. It's a lot, but makes the packing job easy. Enjoy this bag!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This is an good little plastic case for the iPhone 4.  It provides limited protection, covering the back and sides but not the screen.  It is light, easy to put on and has a tight fit.  It did come with screen protectors.  It might be useful for avoiding scratching of iPhones kept in a purse or pocket. It provides basic protection at a good price.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Plays well on my phone, slows down at times but is still very enjoyable. I have played this on PC and on the 360, and this version is just as addicting. Load times could be improved but are not horrible, sound and graphics are good.
B00466HN86|5.0|I was able to see a free viewing of this movie thru LifeWay ministries through our local church. AMAZING MOVIE!!! Just like with FLYWHEEL, FACING THE GIANTS and FIREPROOF these brothers have made a movie that can change peoples lives. This movie is about fathers and their role in the family. What would happen if fathers actually connected with their wives and kids......what a diffrence they would make! I would reccommend this movie to everyone!!!!Comes out in theatres september 30th, 2011.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Leonard's mission to find the man who murdered his wife faces a big handicap. With his total loss of short term memory, he can't hang on to the clues he finds.  The movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative. This technique is not just a gimmick. The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes. Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right. The experience is strange and disorienting, rare and uncomfortable.  The best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie. We are abruptly cut to a junk yard, and we hear Leonard thinking to himself \\"Am I chasing him? Or is he chasing me?\\" And at this point, we don't know. Despite everything we've seen and heard, and figured out so far, we have NO idea. There is simply no way to make it fit in. And no time to sort it out. We are very much in Leonard's skin.  Even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line. Beyond the story line about Leonard's mission, we see how life delivers rough justice:  What happens to Leonard is rough justice for what did to someone else suffering from memory loss. The stranger we see Leonard murder at the beginning of the movie has received severe judgement for his crimes. Also, everyone who interacts with Leonard takes advantage as soon as they discover his shortcoming. A pretty dark take on human nature.  \\"in medias res\\" starting the story in the middle is an effective to tell a story. Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things. The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it. It's also the reason it's not a big commercial success. Watching Memento again, you can't re-experience what you experience seeing it the first time, and you may find the initial experience so disconcerting you don't recognize that that's the payoff. I'm glad I rented it. It gave me a rare, disturbing experience that I couldn't recapture.
0307473465|4.0|One day fifteen year old Michael is on his way home from school when he becomes violently ill. A 36 year old woman named Hanna spots his distress, cleans him up and walks him home. Michael lands in bed with hepatitis for several weeks and when he recovers his mom asks him to personally thank Hannah for her kindness. And boy does she ever.<br /><br />The two become bed-mates for a time and she enjoys listening to Michael read to her. Michael fancies himself a little in love with Hanna despite her odd, aloof behavior. He also struggles with keeping the affair a secret and behaving like a normal teenager. The affair comes to an end when Hanna spots Michael swimming with friends and doesn't acknowledge her. Hanna then disappears.<br /><br />Years later Michael is a law student sitting in a courtroom and learns that Hanna is on trial for murder and that she spent time as a concentration camp guard for the Nazi's. As the trial continues Michael realizes he knows a secret that can significantly reduce her sentence. But it's a secret that Hanna has kept to herself entire life and he's unsure if he should speak out when she refuses to defend herself.<br /><br />This is a story with some heavy moral dilemma's but it's ultimately a story of regret of wasted lives. It's a quick read but not one, I think, I will easily forget.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is WONDERFUL.  I listen to it at night to wind down after listening to it several times on a car trip - I had a hard time not nodding off on the road or just getting caught up in the beauty of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised by this book - it was amazing!  I finished it within a day because I simply couldn't put it down.  The story just grabs you, and the plot is quite creative, unlike anything I've read before.  I especially enjoyed the intricate relationships between the characters.  I think the author did a great job of making their interactions seem natural and true to what 16-year olds would say or do.  I finished the trilogy in a week and I can only recommend it!
B00004R99F|5.0|My sister and I are in our 20s and haven't watched this movie in awhile, though it was one of our favorites as kids. We watched it again last night, and found that it definitely holds up over time. What really impresses us is for all the outrageous \\"goofy\\" ;) antics and general silliness, the movie presents a real life situation of a father/son disconnect in a genuine way, without taking sides or pandering to either parents or children. To elaborate, Max is a stereotypical teenager fighting gracelessly and sometimes cruelly for his independence (and displays an incredible lack of foresight throughout), but he isn't \\"shown up\\" at the end by an omniscient authority figure a la \\"Freaky Friday\\". Goofy is overbearing and clueless, but his concern is genuine (rather than pasted on for the sake of annoying Max, as you often see in shows aimed at kids/teens) and eventually appreciated, rather than played for laughs throughout. One of the highlights of this dynamic is the fight between Goofy and Max in the river. It's surprisingly visceral for this genre (\\"I am not your little boy any more, Dad! I've grown up! I have my own life now!\\" \\"I know that! I just wanted to be part of it.\\") and actually genuinely saddening. It makes their reconciliation even more touching and satisfying.<br /><br />I also want to tip my hat to the soundtrack for having *extremely* memorable, clever, and overall impressive songs (I always take note of the short section of \\"On the Open Road\\" where Goofy and Max sing in counterpoint; it's not much, but you don't see a lot of counterpoint outside of musical theatre, and don't really expect to see it in something like this; it was a nice touch.)<br /><br />I do get the feeling that the ending is a little rushed, if only because the rest of the storyline was really well-developed. There are some errors in animation (watch when Max and PJ are leaving school on the last day; two students remain frozen behind them) but they're not horribly noticeable or intrusive.<br /><br />TL;DR I love this movie. It's funny, touching, and well-crafted, and you will be a better person for having watched it.love this movie.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy does not disappoint.  It further explores the relationships forming between the characters, and the twisted way of life in the capitol and the districts.  If you liked the first book, you'll want to know what happens next, and you won't be disappointed.  This is another book you won't be able to put down!
0312323867|4.0|It takes a talented author to create a villain we hate. It takes an even more talented author to create a villain who gets a happy ending- and make the reader happy that said villain got one. Emily Giffen pulls this off admirably well in her sequel to the popular \\"Something Borrowed\\", a story about good people who find themselves doing bad things... such as sleeping with a friend's fiance.     As you know, it's pretty unusual for a novel's sequel to be better than the initial installment; but I can assure you that \\"Something Blue\\" is one of those unusual occurances. The premise of \\"Something Blue\\" is simple: continuing the story from the end of \\"Something Borrowed\\", the villain Darcy Rhodes is pregnant, no longer friends with Rachel and Dex (main characters from the first novel), and plans on marrying her recent flame, Marcus, who is the father of her baby. As far as I see it, the novel is divided into two sections: before London and after London. After a series of unfortunate events (ha), Darcy finds herself utterly friendless and alone in New York, and so she does the only thing she can: she goes to the very last person on planet Earth who can deal with her, childhood friend Ethan who now lives in London (who made brief appearances in the first novel). It takes about half the book before Darcy gets to London, and the story of her background with Marcus and the troubles with him in the present may drag a bit at first. But when Darcy goes to London, the story considerably speeds up.     People who have only read the books and have not seen the recent movie adaption of \\"Something Borrowed\\" may not have any feelings towards the character of Ethan at first, but I suppose my feelings were bias from the start because I saw the movie before reading anything. In the movie, Ethan's character was expanded and portrayed excellently by John Krasinski, who I've loved for a long time (any Office fans here?). So when Ethan was re-introduced in \\"Something Blue\\", I was ecstatic. Ifyou aren't already in love with Ethan's character, I promise you that in \\"Something Blue\\" you will fall head over heels for him. Emily Giffen does a perfect job of slowly blossoming the relationship between Ethan and Darcy from icy roomates to very close friends- if that's the right word for what they become. Their friendship is very fleshed out and believable.    For me, I was never really a fan of Dex; he was the \\"perfect guy\\", and yet seemed shallow and boring compared to other guys in the books, such as Marcus and Ethan. I believe that is what makes this book so much better than \\"Something Borrowed\\"; the love story that slowly blossoms is beautiful and gripping, somehow more exciting than the forbidden romance of the first story. Another thing that makes this book far better than the original was Darcy's growth. From a villain we loved to hate, to a woman who takes responsibility and realizes just how shallow she really is, the change in her character is stunning. At some point, I had to check the cover of the book, just to be sure I was still reading a novel narrated by Darcy Rhodes- the selfish, vain, and childish \\"villain\\" from the first book. The growth of her character is admirable and completely believable, and truly heart-warming. The whole story is just that: heart-warming. I closed \\"Something Borrowed\\" with a smile, and I ended \\"Something Blue\\" with a part laugh, part cry.     Now, as much as I loved this novel I noticed a few drawbacks. Firstly, if you were a fan of \\"Something Borrowed\\" because you loved the story of Rachel and Dex, and thought that \\"Something Blue\\" cotinues their story- well, you might want to just re-read \\"Something Borrowed\\". The sequel does a full 180 and changes perspectives from Rachel to Darcy, a risky move (I mean, who wants to read a book from the loathed villain's point of view?). Rachel and Dex become absolute strangers, making brief cameos and only appearing shortly in the backdrop of Darcy's eventful life after she leavesNew York. This shows the power Emily Giffen has as an author; the fact that she can leave characters she knows as well as her children, and enter the mind of Darcy- who honestly, didn't have much action in the first novel.     Secondly, this book is ridiculously Cinderella-gets-her-prince-and-lives-happily-ever-after, with a few tweaks here and there. After the birth of Darcy's offspring, the story moves quickly in a blur, before jumping ahead two whole years. The ending is very happy, with everyone- and I do mean everyone- ending up with either a lover or a child, and in the end Giffen ties things up very neatly with a bright blue ribbon. I'm not against a happy ending, but I'm more for realistic endings, and I feel like Giffen could have ended the book in a way that paid more respect to every character and fleshed out a few unanswered questions. For example, the characters that arrive in the second act of the story (mainly foils that attempt to sabotage the relationship between Ethan and Darcy) feel hashed-out and thin as the pages I turned, as if their only reason in the novel was to be a foil. Which, I suppose, *was* there only reason. And as a note, at some points in the novel it was almost unbearable to read, as Darcy's character made me cringe and want to skip a few pages. Thankfully, she isn't like this throughout the whole novel.     But other than those things, the book is absolutely perfect. Seeing the world from Darcy's perspective was very amusing, especially a few fantasies that Darcy conjured up (including a recurring prince named Alastair and a rather amusing one about a nursing-home woman called Gert). Giffen is an excellent author, and the writing is flawless and enjoyable every step of the way. If you were at all a fan of \\"Something Borrowed\\", or just happen to enjoy adorable love-stories about pregnant woman, then this is your summer read. It put me in an excellent mood after finishing it (in just two days time...) and I'm sure it will do the same to any reader. I am now pumped for the movie adaption of this sequel, which is in the works as I type this.    So in conclusion, these were two dleightful books that I hope recieves a threequel one day, and an author that deserves far more fame than she's getting, and I plan on reading more of her books. Buy them, read them, but I promise that \\"Something Blue\\" is the best, the one you'll prefer to read again while leaving \\"Borrowed\\" on the shelf for next summer.
0811879542|5.0|What a delight! This book is purely wonderful. It has such a playful sense of fun. The book begins by directly addressing the reader \\"Ready? Press here and turn the page.\\" Readers are instructed to press a yellow dot, sitting lone in the middle of the page. One dot soon turns to three. Three yellow dots soon turn different colors, and soon, after being invited to rub, shake, tap and tilt the book, viewers are given a visual treat as circles appear to magically move about.<br /><br />When I read this aloud, my listeners loved that they felt \\"in control\\" of the book. You tilt the book... and on the next page, all the circles are on the other side of the page! Blow on the book, and on the next page circles are scattered about, clap and the circles grow bigger. What I loved about this book was the constant sense of positive reinforcement. Readers are constantly being told, \\"Great!\\" \\"Perfect!\\" \\"Well done!\\" and \\"Excellent!\\"<br /><br />In an age of digital books and games, this book hits exactly the right note of engaging the reader and creating a non-narrative story that is really enjoyable. I thought this book might be perfect for one-on-one reading, or even for a young reader to read themselves, but I'm told that several librarians and teachers have read this with groups with great success. Perfect for ages 2 to 5, or for anyone with a youthful heart.
B004FLKV5O|5.0|This recording has it all. Great overall performance, start to finish. It has aspects of both the best studio as well as live recordings of this work. Recorded \\"live\\" in the festival hall (no audience was present), you get the experience of hearing a live performance. You can actually hear the onstage action, but unlike many real live recordings, it is not obtrusive, and there is no coughing and hacking! Like a studio recording, the sound is exceptionally clean and detailed. Barenboim and the orchestra are superb. You get the best of both worlds, with possibly the best modern cast. Possibly (but hopefully not) the last truly great festival cast ever; putting together an ensemble of singers of this calibre is going the way of the dodo. Jerusalem (Siegfried) is fantastic. Tomlinson (Wotan) is awesome. Clark is my personal favorite Mime of any recording I have; suitably avaricious and cranky. All the other roles are filled exceptionally. I give this 5 stars because I have so many \\"4 star\\" modern recordings - Janowski, Solti, von Karajan, Sawallisch. And this one is easier on the ears than some of the 5-star mono classics - Keilberth, Krauss, Knappertsbusch, Furtwangler. The best place to start for Ring newbies, and a fantastic addition for the seasoned Ring addict!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I didn't expect much and was very pleased with this. Many free books by big-name authors available,  with as many as 75 new ones a day (some days 0, 1, 2 etc.) sometimes there is plenty to read,  free or to buy at good prices. Works well, although mine on a DROIDX run sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason. Only capable of using kindle files. Overall, probably my most used program. NOT AS GOOD AS AN ACTUAL KINDLE ! YOU CAN'T DO VIDEO BOOKS, ETC. Limitations. They won't make it much better as they want you to buy a kindle.

B001NXDSLQ|3.0|I was just in high shool at the time and first saw Woodstock at the drive in. Bought and loved the VHS and the orginal soundtrack. The problem is DVD. I bought the directors cut and found the sound quality superb but it was nevertheless not the orginal. I keep looking for the orginal in Blu Ray but can only find the directors cut. Id the VHS version is out there on Blu Ray, I'd buy it in a heart beat. many thanks for any help in my quest.
0123694965|5.0|First, I find it hard to believe the people saying this book is primarily refering to video games actually read this book. Every chapter had valuable information for any game designer. For example, I am working on a tabletop RPG design and I found good insights even in the chapters on Technology and Interface.    The book covers almost everything I would have wanted to read about on game design. Its real strength comes from the application of some philisophical ideas to game design. Some of the later chapters of the book were a bit short and possibly could have been elaborated on, but the author does not give you any useless information. The only chapter I really wanted more out of was the world building chapter, but there are numerous online sources to read regarding that subject.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Nina (Natalie Portman) is your typical New York ballerina who would do anything to be the swan queen for the big production of \\"Swan Lake\\". She gets the part until the original player (Wiyona Ryder) gets in an accident, after that she wants to be perfect just like her until a rival named Lily (Mila Kunis) pushes to the edge. She goes on hallucinatory trips that brings her to the very brink of insanity.<br /><br />A solid psychological horror thriller from Darren Aronofsky is one of his best movies and one of 2010's best movies. What really sold is that this movie is an artistic mind-screw in the tradition of David Lynch, Dario Argento and Alfred Hitchcock with brilliant acting from Portman and others, quality directions, imaginative yet disturbing hallucinations such as the cringe inducing cuticle pull sequence and a classical score to the soundtrack of the timeless classic ballet known as Swan Lake. I also like that it takes us on a dark journey into the depths of the subconcious as it includes a rousing girl-on-girl scene between Portman and Lily. I must applaud Darren for giving us one of 2010's best films.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives us very flawless picture and sound quality that makes everything look terrific and sound quality. The extras include 4 featurettes and interviews.
0937381888|5.0|This is the best book around to learn how to brew. Even if you know nothing about brewing you can learn everything you need to know to start your first batch. It includes a few recipes to get you started, and a scientific explanation about brewing, very detailed information on different grains, yeasts, additives and other equipment you should learn about before brewing beer. It's recommended to read the first section of the book before starting your homebrewing, and I agree, it definitely helped my first batch come out successful. I'd recommend it to anyone learning how to brew.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its perfectly designed for a phone. i love its design and has plenty of content.  its worth well over $2.99.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love these guys!!!! There is just something about their music that is really awesome and great to listen to. I highly recommend this album.
B00005N6KG|3.0|It was cheap. It came quickly. It works good for spoken-word audio like listening to my favorite Rush Limbaugh station. But for music it sucks! There's no bass.  I'm' a kind of an audiophile, so this feature is important to me.  And also, the earpieces don't stay in my ears while I'm doing anything active.  Bottom line: you get what you pay for. Next time I'll pay the extra ten bucks and get some bass.
B004K4AUZW|2.0|It was nerve racking enough when I heard she worked with Madonna...now to actually listen to it is sad. Her first album was fantastic...this album not so much. Out of the 21 songs I only like 4 or 5 of them...and that's because they stick with her old style. This album makes me think of her as a Madonna wannabe, which is sad because she was so unique and out there. This album makes me think of a horrible Christian band gone totally wrong..there's a lot of Jesus in her music, not that there is anything wrong with that, but I don't think it goes with the whole Gaga thing...if this is the future of Gaga, leave me out of it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|When movies like this come out I am often hesitant to watch. I am not an activist and I do like to eat meat. I do believe that animals can be humanely slaughtered and brought to market which often times some cultures say is not possible. This movie was not preachy, but informative. By starting small, making minor changes we can eat healthier and help our children live healthier. It only takes the desire to feed our families well to impact the entire food culture. Definitely a must see movie.

B001EAWMGA|3.0|In OUTLANDER Jim Caviezel plays an alien hunter so utterly deadpan he makes his PASSION OF THE CHRIST role seem flighty and vivacious. Somewhen in the Viking Iron Age, an extraterrestrial named Kainan (Caviezel) crashlands his space ship, sends it hurtling into the Scandinavian drink. His crew all dead and now bereft of his hi-tech weaponry, the stranded Kainan sets out on his mission to capture the man-eating alien predator called a Moorwen. But, while tracking the monster, Kainan is captured by a group of Vikings and taken to their compound. Not too long after, something begins to make raids on the Vikings' home and territory. Prevailing theories offer a dragon and a bear, and, oboy, does that ever get these doughty Vikings all fired up. Off they go, a-huntin', with their clean-shaven captive in tow.<br /><br />OUTLANDER, when broken down, is essentially PREDATOR reimagined in old Norway and peopled with medieval, bearded, grog-swilling Norsemen and an intense spaceman. Some bells and whistles are thrown in, like John Hurt as King Hrothgar, Ron Perlman as a bald-headed Viking, and Sophia Myles as the Viking princess, Freya, who knows her way around a sword and isn't shy about baring her midriff, never mind that the near freezing climate seems to dictate bundling up in layers.<br /><br />Early on, Kainan's computer indicates that Earth is an abandoned seed colony, and it would've been nice if the film had touched more on that. And for someone coming from an advanced culture and superior technology, Kainan isn't allowed a lot of chances to flaunt his stuff as such. Heck, the gent from A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT exercised his futuristic expertise more. Instead, Kainan finds himself immersed into the Vikings' hardy way of life, gradually celebrated in King Hrothgar's mead hall and romancing the king's feisty daughter. However, the best relationship here is the one that develops between Kainan and his warrior rival Wulfric (Jack Huston).<br /><br />OUTLANDER is better than PATHFINDER (another recent film about Vikings), but it's sort of like saying that a paper cut is better than a poke in the eye. One's marginally preferrable but, mostly, you'd still rather not have both. OUTLANDER's achievement is that it combines Vikings and space aliens and still manages to come away with a story that is predictable and tame. Character development is nil, with these stock characters simply refusing to stand out. Sorry to say, Jim Caviezel, as an action hero, comes across as bland.<br /><br />Not the acting, not the plot, but there are some saving graces. I thought the CG work is well rendered on the Moorwen, and I especially liked the bioluminescent touch. The several shifts in venue - the dark woods to the mead hall to the hellish caverns - serve to infuse energy, help to fight off that sense of staidness (but it's a losing battle). And I thought that the game of balance on shields (held up by drunken Vikings) was pretty cool.<br /><br />A slightly better than average 3 out of 5 stars for OUTLANDER. I recommend it mostly for the well-done sci-fi action sequences. Hopefully, the writers of the upcoming COWBOYS AND ALIENS view OUTLANDER as a cautionary tale and learn from it.LANDER is better than PATHFINDER (another recent film about Vikings), but it's sort of like saying that a paper cut is better than a poke in the eye.

0393035158|5.0|I picked up a copy of this book when seeing the author on a documentary and being impressed with his eloquence and logic.      First of all I really liked the book and I think it helped to ferret out and dispel some lingering self-doubt in my own mind regarding God and sin and the possible consequences to being wrong (Hell for example).  I have found after reading this book that I have (amusingly) started substituting (in my mind) \\"invisible magic man\\" for the Holy Spirit, \\"space aliens\\" for Jesus and \\"unicorns\\" for God when I hear people referring to them. I never really thought of religion before as a shared delusion of enormous proportions, but now I feel like it in incredible that so many people run their life based on made-up drivel.    I did find his chapters dealing with death a bit hard to take, as I hate to contemplate my own mortality and this book of course offers no solace there.  It hammers home that our desire to exist causes craving for a belief system that offers promises of eternal life, even though that is preposterous.    One of his main points is that we should not be \\"tolerant\\" of religion in as much as people use religion to make decisions that could effect us all.  Even though he makes a compelling case for this, I think it is going to be a long time (never?) that it will be acceptable to openly challenge someone when they state religious opinion as if it is a fact and to demand proof of their claims.  Right now it is impossible to openly treat religion as the same thing as delusion because more people embrace it than reject it.  I am pretty sure I can't refuse to hire someone because they are a delusional \\"Christian\\" right?  Even if I feel it demonstrates a lack of judgment? So while I get his point, I am not sure what we can really do about it right now.  It is almost like saying \\"I wish people were nicer\\".     I do think that people are social creatures and that morals and ethics are created within that context.  I am not as hard line as the author in regards to people identifying themselves with a religion, or congregating together.  As long as we are not basing our decisions on myth and delusion but instead on social contracts then there is of course comfort in belonging to groups who support each other.  That being said, your book club, AA meeting or PTA can all offer that experience without the background of religion.  I am just staying that even if someday we govern ourselves with reason and practicality we might still congregate as Jews, Christians and Muslims for our shared history and culture, and think back fondly on those texts we used to take literally as just a relic of our shared past.    P.S. I find it funny that people (Mr. Bruce Bain in particular) are trying to paint this book and other like it as an Atheism text and then try to lump Atheism into the same category as a \\"faith based belief\\" system.  This book goes into a lot of logical detail to explain that we have evolved to accept and reject a premise based on personal observation, consistency with other knowledge and trust in research by subject matter experts.  Why should we reserve belief in God(s) as a special case?  To systematically challenge false and errant statements and assertions and insist that we govern our worldviews using logic and hard fought knowledge is *not* a religion.
0553386794|5.0|There are countless reviews, but I cannot help but praise this series. It is the *only* series of fantasy novels - no fiction novels altogether - I've ever read that kept me up into the wee hours of the morning. And I'm who grows very bored of books easily. I first got into A Song of Ice and Fire in 2007 and was skeptical. Tired I was of cliche fantasy novels to the point I felt I had outgrown the genre. I decided to pick this one up after reading countless positive responses. A Song of Ice and Fire offers a rich, gritty fantasy world more grounded in reality then fantasy and one that isn't overloaded with magic to the point it feels ordinary and boring. In this world, magic is more supernatural and mysterious. Grey, complex characters that surprise you frequently will keep your eyes glued to the pages. Even characters you initially loathe grow into ones you come to sympathize with or even root for. Nothing is what it seems and the story folds in an unpredictable, throughly engaging fashion. This is one fantasy series I'd recommend to people who aren't even into the fantasy genre. Yes, it's that good.
B000E1ZBIQ|5.0|Over the years, I have sat spellbound and amazed by incredible performances by the likes of Frank Langella, Anita Morris, Patti LuPone, Judd Hirsch, Diahann Carroll and even Patrick Cassidy on Broadway, and have been mesmerized by stellar, live performances of Aida and Nabucco in the San Francisco Opera House, but I don't remember ever being so completely transported by wonderful singing on my own big screen television than I was as I watched the wonderful performance captured on this DVD. Jose Carreras was astounding and Eva Marton and Peiro Cappuccilli were in top form for this nearly flawless opera.<br /><br />For more than 3 decades I have owned and enjoyed my cassette tape boxed set of The Met production with Domingo, Scotto, Milnes and Levine. The music simply transports one to a higher plain. Finally, an Andrea Chenier worth watching on DVD! Thank you La Scala!
B004G6009U|3.0|To get to the point. What worked: the look. This film is gorgeous, particularly on Blu-Ray! The villain: Mother Gothel is the most manipulative of any Disney or Pixar character, awesome. You WANT to see her go down and it's satisfying when she does. The female empowerment stuff: Rapunzel is definitely the hero of this film, and only rarely is she annoying. The ending: excellent, surprisingly emotionally affecting. The Blu-Ray version is beautiful, but animation isn't the best place to show-case HD.<br /><br />What didn't work: the songs. A grand total of only two songs were firing on all cylinders, the best of which is \\"Rapunzel Knows Best\\" about 58 minutes in. Almost none of them came together that well, a real disappointment in an integral part of any animated Disney movie. The humor: intermittent at best. You'll chuckle, but don't expect consistent laughter if you're an adult viewer. The plot: incredibly simplistic, don't worry about having to use your brain at any point. The sidekick: that stupid, pointless gecko. You can always rely on Disney's dogged determination for every protagonist to have a sidekick. He gets kicked at one point by the villain, and it made me so happy! Tangled also tries to be a bit too modern, particularly with the dialogue--it can pull you out of the fairy tale. Overall this film is certainly entertaining, but doesn't have the magic to be a classic like the old Disney or the earlier Pixar films. Definitely worth a watch, you'll absolutely love it if you're a teen or younger, I think adult viewers will not be quite as enchanted. 3.5 of 5 stars.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|I waited 12 years for this album and it is far from a disappointment. I believe those that gave this one star can go listen to Kid Rock, KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson, new Metallica, and Rob Zombie. the song titles are bit out of touch for Morbid Angel, but I still like them. my question is, did anyone give Kreator one star when they were experimenting with industrial and goth? the second song on this album sounds a bit techno, but the rest of the album definitely slams, albeit at a slower pace. Tim Yeung is a talented drummer, but he still cannot fill the shoes of Pete Sandoval, who will be back for the next album. I do remember David Vincent being more guttural in the past, as I saw the videos for \\"Rapture\\" and \\"God of Emptiness\\" back in the early 1990's when he was doing the vocals. (LOL at Beavis and Butthead, who were supposed to be metalheads, critiquing the video for \\"God of Emptiness\\"). song no.7, although the blast beats are absent, really slams, and then the blast beats come close to the ending. song no. 8, entitled \\"Nevermore\\" is worth the wait.
0316069353|4.0|the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" books are always good.  and although this one focuses mostly on trial strategy, and misses alot of the \\"drama and action\\" of previous books, it's still a page turner that makes you want to finish.
0679805273|5.0|My Grandaughter was very happy and surprised to receive Dr. Seuss book as part of her Grad presents. She had everyone sign the book for her. My teacher friends are the ones who recommended this book \\"Oh The Places We'll Go\\" as a present...GREAT IDEA....
B004EPYZUI|1.0|While I was indifferent to \\"300\\" and loved \\"Watchmen,\\" I was sort of looking forward to Sucker Punch, until I started hearing the details of the plot. Such as it is.  Saw it at an Imax, and some of the scenes LOOK spectacular, but there's no danger. There's a lot of stilted dialogue. Somehow, they managed to make hot chicks fighting steampunk nazis actually boring, and I would have thought that impossible.    Skip this one. Rent it if you must, but don't buy it till you're sure.
B004GJYRFA|5.0|I have nothing to say but wonderful things about \\"Everwood\\".  It is a wonderful series with drama, humor, terrific character development and story arcs... I only wish that it lasted for more than 4 seasons... I'm eager to see the 4th season when it's released in August!!!
0307946711|4.0|This was a book about relationships but not the standard fare that we sometimes become accustomed to.     It is the story of Emma and Dexter, and follows them over a period of time, but focusses on just one day per year, and what they were doing on that day.     Sometimes they would be spending that day together, other times, their lives were separate, growing up, having relationships, work issues, family problems.    So as you read about them over the decades on that one day per year, the reader gets a surprisingly good insight into who they are and what their life is like.    I enjoyed the character of Emma very much - she is the no-nonsense, down to earth character, compared to Dexter, who leads a very different and more shallow lifestyle.  The author portrays these 2 people in a very believable and likeable way, and the interaction between Emma and Dexter is witty and clever.   Near the end, the book changes direction - successfully?   Not too sure about that, but by this time, you are so involved with Emma and Dexter, you read on.    Friendships do have their ups and downs and I think this book covered that side of friendship in a very interesting and well thought out plot.    It was a light read, and one that would suit those who just want something quick and fun.
B001QWBM62|1.0|Although this recorder may be the finest piece of equipment at this price, it is not for anyone who is not tech savy.  Just getting the driver necessary is a hassel.  Because it can do so many things, one needs to be patient just to get to the simple stereo recording mode where the machine does all the work.  I have not been able as of yet to get the machine and my computer to communicate.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I have been a huge fan and supporter of the Veronica Mars series since 2004 when the show first started on UPN.  One of the things I love the most about this show has to do with the unpredictability of the mysteries each season.  The show is able to leave its viewers in complete shock.  To be frank, it's impossible to figure out what really happened until the season finales because of the brilliant writing.  Rob Thomas is able to craft together a mystery that does in fact have some clues sprinkled throughout the season, but viewers are not necessarily able to pick up on all of those clues until they watch the series multiple times.  To this day, I still find little things I previously missed that were &#34;red flags&#34; along the way, but by no means is a viewer truly able to figure out how things go down until the end.  The mind of Rob Thomas is one of vast creativity and intelligence.  An additional note, one big distinction that people seem to miss is that while this show is about a teenage girl, the show is definitely not targeted specifically for an adolescent viewing population.  This a show that anyone can enjoy, and I can't think of many other shows that I would equate to Veronica Mars.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Garrett's playing brings tears to my eyes. He has the talent and virtuosity of Heifetz of Menuhin with a fine sense of how to make classical music live for contemporary listeners and to make contemporary music classical. I definitely look forward to my next purchase of his work.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It's a been a while since I've picked up a book that I didn't want to put down. This book was a wonderful adventure/fantasy about a boy who's life isn't as normal as he was led to believe. The characters are colorful, the location is spot-on & the imagination of the writer just compel you forward as you read. The pictures in the book just add to the experience. I read it on a Kindle, so some of them- the letters in particular- were tough to see without looking at them on a larger screen (my computer) or with a magnifying glass, but most of the pictures were fine on the Kindle itself. It definitely didn't take away from the reading experience. One of my favorite books so far this year
B00486070K|4.0|Item was bought to support moving large files to a MacBook Air.  It was easily connected and worked flawlessly, but at the reduced 10/100 speed that was advertised for it.  Still, that is faster than the WIFI that is the only interface included with the MacBook Air.  In the end, I used a USB 2.0 desktop hard drive as an intermediate and transferred the large files using that, as it was much faster. The drive is also used as a time machine backup periodically.  Best of cases would be that Apple or some other manufacturer would come up with a Gigabit device that would be as fast as the adapters on the iMac's.
B00113XKV6|5.0|This is the only version of \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" with \\"The Evolution of Nicky\\" on it.  Everything that needs to be reviewed about the movie you can find under any other version.  I'm posting this review for those who have been searching for this really really hard to find extra.  If you want to read a review of it you can find my review in IMDB.
031261246X|5.0|ZERO DAY is as good as five star reviews here tell you.     I happened to have finished reading [[ASIN:B004NSVENM Fatal System Error]] a few days earlier.     FSE gives us plenty of factual background on Russian (and US) hackers and their multiple successful attacks against the US govt, hi-tech corporations, and financial institutions. We get lots of technical details and true stories about the personalities involved and their Soprano-like operations. This is scary enough. But it's in the context of the fumbling FBI, the inept CIA, and the nineteenth-century mentality of the DHS. These dozen-billion dollar agencies sustain the terrorist's ecosystem by frustrating the good guys not in their employ and thwarting anyone among them who happens to be competent. It's not fiction. It's failure at every turn.    If you want a really intense experience, read FSE first. It fills your mind with actual persons, places, operations, and technical details that slide beautifully into the ZD narrative. FSE adds a detailed verisimilitude to your imagination. ZERO DAY reads like FSE, Part II, magnified to its logical conclusions.    Mark Russinovich is a Microsoft Fellow who deeply understands the technical issues and the real-world consequences of hacker attacks. Especially since a great portion of them are directed against flaws/vulnerabilities in MS Windows. He clearly has been involved in the gory aspects of dealing with these consequences, which he brings to ZERO DAY. It's a marvelous page turner for sure.     The plot is fiction. The bungling incompetence of the three-letter US agencies sadly is not. And the technical details are all too accurate.

I hope the auther makes another book just like this.
B004MNO0BQ|2.0|Does not work on my Asus Eee Transformer tablet -- it runs but the screen does not display properly! Love this game on my phone, please make it work on tablets!
B000RZIGVS|2.0|Let me preface this review by saying a review should include all aspects of the DVD, from content to quality of packaging to digital transfer.  The fact I think Next Gen is one of comprehensively best Sci-Fi shows possibly in the history of television is the only reason this piece of crap set even gets two stars.  So, as a disclaimer, if you've never watched the TNG, then you owe it to yourself to wade through this junk if for no other reason the fantastic content of the show.  Especially towards the end of the series, this matured into a show that is near and dear to my heart, and I love the characters and the universe they inhabit.<br /><br />So, as for the rest: pure, unadulterated horse manure. I'm not kidding, I have old episodes I VHS taped from basic cable on medium tape speed that look better than the transfer they've done on these.  Its horrid.  Artifacts abound, the Dolby 5.1 is all over the place, there is more ghosting than a reality haunted house show...I could go on, but the summation is, they put little to no effort whatsoever into making this even digital quality (except for the menus).  Speaking of reality TV, it is insulting that reality TV drivel get regular Bluray releases and this, an 8 season series with history on both ends and a huge fan-base, get what could possibly be the fastest production mastering of any DVD release to date.  I think they stuck the interns on this project.<br /><br />The packaging, while getting regular blasting on the reviews, seems ok to me - its not great, but it'll hold em all, in a compact way, which if you have an extensive DVD collection, you know already takes up WAY too much space.  Searching for a disc is a pain, I'll give you that.  I'll use TNG Companion to help navigate to the episode(s) I'm looking for, but they could've made it easier on us.<br /><br />Don't be surprised, buyer, by the quality of the video though, I know many complain about imperfections on DVDs, but seriously, I thought I had gotten a bad Chinese bootleg copy.  Apparently, this is as good as it gets.Apparently, this is as good as it gets.
B004N0PZNK|3.0|When I opened the package, I was surprised to see only 3 CDs.  However, after listening I understand.  It's like listening to legaleze at the end of a car commercial.  Really fast.  Frankly, I'm surprised Sounds True released this.  While the content is superb, the author reads the book so fast that if you cut the speed in half, it would still be too fast.  It requires you pay very close attention, because if you blink you've missed an important piece of the audio.  I drift for a minute and have to rewind half a chapter.  Like I said, the content is truly excellent, I just wish the audio was read much slower.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Rented it from a red machine, and it exceeded my expectations in part because I read the comments here first and was expecting worse. I can understand anyone's opinion that the movie is lacking, if more was paid.<br /><br />There are enough in-depth reviews, so I'll spare mine. But, I will definitely check out the sequel because I liked the story line enough.<br /><br />And, where can I get my own dog like that? :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 14 year old daughter was doing a book report on this book, and I only started reading it to help her out, because she hates reading (completely unlike her mother)  I could not put it down.  Every chapter ending left me hanging & I just had to know what happened next - don't start this book at bedtime like I did!  I loved all the characters, but especially the strong female heroine. The story and the futuristic setting, which, although unsettling, was fascinating.  Suzanne Collins has a wonderful imagination.  I highly recommend it (although probably not to anyone under 12 - I'm a little surprised that it is sold by Scholastic) and cannot wait to read the next book in the series.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A wonderful movie.  I had seen it at the movie theater twice.
B003V5PQ1E|2.0|When I was creating this review in my head earlier this morning, I was somewhat torn about how I should approach it.  There are things about this album that disappoint me a lot, and yet, I still enjoy the music and will likely listen to it in medium rotation with my other Ipod music.<br /><br />As a big fan of Linkin Park's (LP) Hybrid Theory album (HT) and Meteora album (M)and a mild fan of Minutes To Midnight (M2M), I was disgusted when I first heard the song, Catalyst, on the radio.  I mean, M2M was a fairly significant change in style on which the band experimented and mellowed a lot, but it also showed they could still rock out as shown in the songs Given Up, Bleed it Out, and No More Sorrow.<br />On A Thousand Suns (ATS), with songs like Catalyst, the rocking out is no more.<br />Catalyst, the first single from the album, is an electronic dance song, not the hard rocking LP I had come to love on HT and M.  M2M had disappointed me, but there were still enough songs on that album to keep me interested.  But after hearing Catalyst, I was determined that ATS was going to be awful and I wasn't going to like it.  So when it was released in stores I basically ignored it.  Until yesterday, I passed it over for months and just forgot about it.  Then, in the library yesterday, I saw the CD sitting on the shelf and thought, 'aw what-the-heck'.<br />What I heard when I listed to it wasn't terrible as I had expected.  I actually kinda liked most of it.  Now I'm not a lyrics guy, so I'm not going to tell you how artistic or deep or intelligent the lyrics are or are not.  I also don't play guitar, bass, drums or spin music on a turntable, so I cannot describe how technically adept the band members are at their instruments.  What I can tell you is that, while Linkin Park seems to have lost their original late 90's rap/rock electronic-infused nu-metal sound, the music they've created here is actually still pretty good.<br />I do prefer more upbeat music or even heavier rock and metal, but I know a good mellow song when I hear one, and these are good mellow electro-rock songs.  If I had to pick one song that reminds me of past heavier LP songs, I would probably say its track 9, Blackout, simply because there's some screaming.  But even that comparison is a pretty big stretch.<br />My biggest complaint about the album is that 6 of the 15 tracks are filler with ambient sounds and random notes.  They don't count as songs.  If you get the album, expect only 9 songs.<br /><br />My reason for the 2 star rating after saying that the album isn't really that bad is because of their past work.  I think that Hybrid Theory and Meteora were almost flawless albums.  In my mind, this had set the bar very high for subsequent releases and, while I liked the songs here, overall its pathetic in comparison.  If this was any other band besides Linkin Park, or perhaps if they had released this under another name, I would probably rate it 3 or 4 stars.<br /><br />EDIT: I wanted to add that I really don't care for the final track on the CD, which is an acoustic ballad sung by Chester.  By skipping that song, I'm left with only 8 songs on the album to listen to.... so sad...d metal, but I know a good mellow song when I hear one, and these are good mellow electro-rock songs.

B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I always questioned myself wondering if Hugh Laurie was really playing all those instruments. But after while of watching him on house I figured out he did.    And he produced and created some of the music on house. So I when I found out he had a album out, I had to get it.    The album:    This is some fantastic mix of old style blues, bebop jazz and just good old pop jazz.  Laurie's voice is present and bold, but often changes into different tones and give a more refreshing taste to the album. I find the hard turns and hooks in the music amazing.  This album is: The darker side of Sinatra, with Blues hooks and a cool feel and off beat of bebop with Hugh Laurie's mix of dirty English and raised american accent. The throws of a good old classical guitar turned to blues, big band drums, singing pianos, orchestras, biblical references and anything you can wish.    5/5 for this because I can't give Amazon 4.75/5. I wish this was recorded a little better and maybe a little more polished to the point of an absolute shine.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|These two old Detroit pal's got back together and delivered a fierce lyrical master piece! From start to finnish this is pure genius. I have heard rap duos complete each others sentences while rhyming but these two complete each others words on certain rhyming! I have been a Em and Royce fan since day 1 but I believe that my opinion is not Bias when I say this is a excellent album and a blueprint to rappers to follow this is how you do it !!!! CLASSIC!

Now, I get to see everything that happened with these friends, in the order that it happened.  Despite its racy title, there is more to this show then sex.  There are relationships, friendships, fashion and just day to day survival in a big city.  I have the entire series, plus the two full length movies.  The best thing is, you can watch your favorite episode as many times as you like!

B003L20IJM|5.0|Nanny McPhee really returns in this sequel.  I don't know why anyone who liked the original wouldn't love this one.  The special effects were great, the ending really made it happen.  If you haven't watched it yet, pay attention to the ending. Of course, Nanny makes some real life changing suggestions for all the people around her which is why we loved her the first time.
0316010669|1.0|I keep wanting to like Gladwell's books, but they're just so... pedestrian. That may sound pretentious, but I believe he talks dumbly to his audience; it's insulting. And there's a serious lack of research to his musings. It's faux-social science at it's most mediocre.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|This movie was funny, but predictable. I love Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. The chemistry between the two was great.
B001EN71DG|1.0|Haven't seen or owned the films since my old VHS tapes, and this DVD set is almost identical. I was excited that each film has the original theatrical cut included, but I should have known better than to hope that Lucas would have succumbed. The original theatrical is there, but it's not remastered to fit a larger screen, so it's only 1.5'x1' on my 42&quot; screen.<br /><br />Damn it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love this movie.  It was very well done.  The writing was terrific. And the acting was awesome.  The whole story was a very interesting little history lesson. Definitely didn't deserve the R rating. I highly recommend.
0312945973|5.0|River God is a splendid story. This historical fiction is a piece of brilliant story telling by Wilber Smith, rendering it a favorite re-read again and again. River God has proudly topped my favorite novel list for over 5 years and running and this humble review has been long in coming. How does one review such spot-on emotional delivery?<br /><br />At its core, River God is a love story and as such, has all the requisite components. Our hero is tall, hard, handsome and honest, so unrealistically splendid that a few pages of my well-worn book have dried marks of drool. Our heroine is in equal measure brave and beautiful, and our point of view narrator tells the story with humor and narcissistic flair. What then is the difference? What turns elements found in any cheesy romance novel into something dynamic and so much larger-than-life that it lingers, long after you put it down?<br /><br />The obvious genius of River God is the lyrical, readable storycraft. This story carries itself beautifully. The backdrop of ancient Egypt is vivid and the adventures packed with fist-pounding adrenaline. With every chapter, Smith draws his characters from the pages, crafting them until they are flesh and blood, transporting you into their Egypt, turning their struggles into yours, until you are reading, breathing, yearning for them, loving with them.<br /><br />Subtler yet, is the real secret. Wilbur Smith tells a perfect tale of the human condition, a story about what really matters at the end of it all. What small portions of our lives mark our best memories? Moments where we we truly loved and had the courage to express it? Times where hardship only strengthened our hope and pain left no bitterness, no ill will, but in its stead fortitude, strength, and the best we could be? Enter the story of River God. I could recap the story, give you a review of where they went and what they did. But let me end with this.<br /><br />This story is how we all wish to live. When they loved, it was with every breath, when they kept their honor, it was until it almost destroyed them, when they embraced the turns that life gave them, I wished upon myself the same courage and levity. This is a story of Tanus, Lostris, and Taita, and this is how they lived.<br /><br />5 Stars.hey kept their honor, it was until it almost destroyed them, when they embraced the turns that life gave them, I wished upon myself the same courage and levity.

B004VUP8WK|4.0|MA has  strived on every album to reinvent themselves  while still maintaining a solid and recognizeable identity. i think this album accomplishes that pretty well, actually. however, some of the anthemic hooks on this slickly produced effort seem rather adolescent.  they were probably intended to be a bit tongue in cheek, but sometimes i wonder
B004289ZW0|2.0|It is a nice unit and works with many iPad apps.  HOWEVER, the claim that the unit is WAAS enabled is misleading - The best accuracy the unit will produce is 30 feet.... I contacted the manufacturer and was told this is the best accuracy I should expect.  NOTE: works with many Apps, but generally WONT work with apps that say they are only compatible with 3G units.

This is an objective view of the status we now have in our current world and why the distribution of technology and development has evolve as it has.Hugely broad and a challenge not taken by many before.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|With any Blu-ray you expect it to be jam-packed with additional features and this Blu-ray set does not under-deliver!  TONS of extra features, I especially love the option to have a historical information box pop up throughout the series in certain scenes.  I definitely recommend this product to true Spartacus fans!

B001CEE1YE|4.0|Well, popluar films you'd never felt the same as you first watched them. However, agreed with one reviewer that the picture quality and the sound decoding of the second and last Discs are phenomenal. The first disc's storyline still presents far surperior content then the rests, thinking if only the Matrix Blu ray disc can be retouched to match the others. Overall, I'm please with the purchase. By the way, there are no titles menu on any discs, just straight movies.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Purchased this CD specifically for the track \\"At Last\\" since I have never heard a better version. It was, as expected, an excellent experience. Quick service, no problems, smooth transaction.    MK
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Yes this item is expensive. If however you are a long time Beatle fan with audiophile leanings and 24bit audio playback capabilities this is a must have. I was a bit skeptical of my ability to differentiate the FLAC recording from the 320 mp3. I was pleasantly satisfied. I played it through a Creative Fatility 24bit capable soundcard; connected to Klipsch Promedia 4.1 computer speakers .The difference is discernable when you (personally) are in audiophile mode. If you are in party mode or just doing something else you can't tell the difference.
B0043KK4N6|1.0|The one song on the cd that I really wanted has a flaw in it.  The rest of the cd is fine.
B005342N58|4.0|I can see why some might not like this one. \\"Suck It And See\\" is completely different than the Arctic Monkeys first two releases. Except for \\"Brick By Brick\\" and parts of \\"Library Pictures\\", this album is pretty tame. If you're more into the fast paced A.R., you may be disappointed. However, there was evidence that they were capable of pulling off this kind of album too with \\"Florescent Adolescent\\", \\"Only One Who Knows\\", \\"505\\", and most of their last album \\"Humbug\\". I'm hoping that their next album is a better mixture of old and new seeing as this one plays from beginning to end on the same mellow note. Either way, I think they did a good job and are growing as musicians with each new release.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was a very good read, despite some (but very few) translation issues.  None of the names of the Sweden locations were changed, so you needed to get used to strolls down \\"Brannkyrdagatain\\" street and the like.  But regardless, the book grabbed and held my attention from about page 25 to the end.<br /><br />The only shortcoming of the book's plot was the ending of the \\"Vanger\\" family part of the story, which was a bit of a stretch, but the book in total was excellent.<br /><br />Character development was fantastic, you really got to know and like the good guys, even the weird star of the book, the now famous \\"Girl\\".  One of the odd things about the book was there was no character development of the main bad guy in the book.  You kept hearing about the nasty things business dealings he was involved in, but you never actually \\"met him\\" in the book.  Oddly, this ploy worked very well and enhanced the book's plot rather than subtracted from the story.  The author really make the whole thing work.<br /><br />I finished reading the book about 4:00 am this morning, and am downloading to my Kindle the last two.  I guess that's the biggest recommendation of all, money talks.
0670022411|5.0|This book was recommende by a friend. I have been an avid Anne Rice fan for so very long, and I read the Twilight Series as they were published all those years ago (Long before it reached cult status!). I love all things vampires, and this book fed my need for them! It was historically accurate, entertaining, and I loved everything about it! I can't wait until Deborah Harkness publishes the final two books in the trilogy!!!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Installed and plays perfectly on a rooted nook color. Fun game for one or two players. Simple timber killer with nice graphics.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I was appauled by the thought of watching this shown for the longest time. There was seemingly nothing about it that sparked my interest. It just seemd like junk. However, I stumbled upon an episode by accident once. That's all it took! It was fun, provocative, and so well written! I couldn't help myself! What a great thing to curl up to with a bowl of popcorn while my husband was deployed! It might've taken me a long time to jump onto the Sex and the City Bandwagon, but I'm so thankful I did! Amazon provided a great price and quick shipping to feed my newfound need for this show!
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|I was always interested in this game and when I saw it on amazon for free, took the chance. Game takes a while to load and plays well at first. Started to lag and stutter a bit after a few plays. I can't get used to not seeing my player puck as my finger or thumb covers quite a bit of the playing field.
1609419693|5.0|Laugh-out-loud funny!<br /><br />Tina Fey narrates her own audiobook - and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.  Bossypants was already on my TBR list, but when I heard Tina Fey was reading the audio, I knew that I would be listening to the book instead of reading it.  Let's be honest, there is no way I am going to deliver Tina Fey's words in my own head better than Tina Fey herself.  (Great move on my part.)<br />Sitting in Tunnel traffic heading into Manhattan has never been so entertaining!  My traffic mates probably thought I was a crazy person, but I didn't care.  When my commute didn't allow me to finish the book, I found myself taking the long way home from little league baseball games and parent-teacher conferences just to listen to more!<br /><br />Tina Fey talks about everything from the awkwardness of puberty to working for the Improv group, Second City;  from the thrill of her years working for Lorne Michaels at Saturday Night Live to the Internet haters (to which she responds!); from the 2008 presidential election that catapulted her to celebritydom, to the Teat Nazis she encounters after becoming a mother.  (SNL allowed the rights for her to use the audio clip of the opening with her as Sarah Palin and Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton.  I don't care who you voted for, this clip is HILARIOUS.)  I have tried to come up with which chapter was my favorite - but I can not.<br /><br />My only warning:  Don't listen while the kids are around, or download onto your iPod for your own personal enjoyment.  Tina Fey does not censor herself...nor should she!<br /><br />Tina Fey is honest, insightful, and funny as hell.  I am so glad I listened to this book, and highly recommend Bossypants!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Never been a great fan of Udo Dirkschneider's voice, always got bothered by his Donald Duck with ashtma voice. But when I heard about a new Accept album with a new singer, I decided to listen and WOW!!! Blood Of The Nations became my favourite album in the whole of 2010 (including beating Maiden's The Final Frontier). For me it's a lesson in how a metal album should be. First there is the astounding energy, power and attitude emanating from every single song, just like a teenager metal band in early 80's in their first release. Including the guitarrist said in an interview that was his mindset when he wrote the songs. And it shows...    Second, although it's german power metal disc, it's not one of those all-songs-sound-the-same discs so common in so many German bands. You have the kick ass opener Beat The Bastards, the fast ones like No Shelter, Locked and Loaded, the denser and longer The Abyss and Shades Of Death, the hard rocker New World Comin, the power ballad, the Judas Priesteans Pandemic (best one in my opinion) and Rolling Thunder, and the heavy as hell Bucket Full Of Hate, among others. But what's common is that the riffs are completely insane, hooking you up and making you raise your fists and bang your head. The chorus are just like they should be, powerful yet sticky sing with me. And the solos are precise, not a single note missing, not a single note in excess, perfect for air guitarring.    And finally, there's Mark Tornillo, the new singer. Yes, UDO fans, he can sing like Udo easily. But he brings a lof of other possibilities there. Just listen The Abyss and Bucket Full Of Hate, and you swear it's Savatage's Jon Oliva. In other places, he reminds me of Saxon's Biff Byfford or of Grave Digger's Chris Boltendahl. The energy with which he sings Beat The Bastards, Pandemic and Bucket Full of Hate is astounding, contagious.     I am just sad that I've missed their show here in Sao Paulo...but I hope they come up with a live album from the tour and come back with a new disc soon. If it's half as good as Blood Of The Nations, it will already be a blast.
B004X75RK4|2.0|This is a typical Sandra Bullock movie which is a little tiring. I love Sandra but she needs to have better roles; she's getting older. Give her older roles; she's not a spring chicken anymore. Same plot over again. Give something new and refreshing. Would not recommend this movie!
0307887960|5.0|I really like the diet.  I am not hungary on this diet and for once in my life I am not graving carbohydrates. It is not hard to follow the meal plan at all.  No counting calories or points is a big plus.  My husband and I have been on the diet for 3 weeks.  He has lost 14 pounds and I have lost 7 pounds.  We are still in the cruise phase.  We both think this is a way of eating for life.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I don't have HBO. I watch vampire diaries on tv. Found it to be colorful and different. So when I saw a HBO series filmed in the bayous of La., with the main character's name Anna Paquin, I had to see it. Never heard of any Paquins down here just a lot of Naquin's. Well I bought the 1st season to watch during the summer time reruns. Wow, deffinetly rated R.      Good story twist on the vampire sega. True Blood is believable in the fiction catagory. The actor that learn to speak in a cajun dialect did a real good job. I was convienced he could have grown up here. The only thing is that all though most cajun people do keep to themselevs, they are the most freindliest people you could meet. I wished they could have potrayed that aspect more. I guess it didn't fit the story line.     All In ALL I've already bought season 2 and I'm about to get season 3.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Great game, two player is awesome. It's nice to be able to customize the appearance. Single player mode is not too hard but still  challenging. It's not that laggy on my htc thunderbolt but You definitely need a high end phone to play this game smoothly
B002JVWR9U|3.0|I watch the very first episode and deemed it another 90210 remake with vampires. However, with nothing on one night I watch episode 14 of the second season and was hooked. After the 2nd season ended, I had to see the 1st season entirely. Hence forth I bought season 1. I actualy thought that season 2 was better.      Here's my issues with this show. How many high school kids are allowed to go out every night of the week???  How many bar rooms or pool halls that serve booze allow MINORS inside?????  Hey I live in the big easy. There's a bar room on every corner. Drinking age in America is still 21. Even still the story would be a little more palitable if the story takes place with everyone in college. All of the actors are in their mid 20's if not their early 30's. Some of the parents of the kids look like older sisters and brothers. Well ok vampires don't age. So when they show scenes from the 1860's why do they try to make the actors look like ahhh younger. Stephen and Damein. There's noway Caroline passes for a teenager. By the way she has to be, in my opion, the worse actor in the play. One minute she the dumb blonde,that apparently all soaps must have, then she's the poor me no-one likes me, then mis mystic and the most bubbly girl in town. Then she that depressed girl that feels compelled to throw her self at Elena's X boy freind. Who, If he was really a high school kid he would have jumped that a couple of times then thought to get her name.     I realize by now you think I hate this Show, however I do find it interresting, once you can get passed the added fiction, since it's really about vampires, witches, and warewolves. Looking forward to season three.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|UPDATE: THIS IS A REVIEW THAT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON EMINEM'S OUTPUT ON THIS RECORD (THOUGH I DO ADDRESS THE BAD MEETS EVIL PARTNERSHIP AND ROYCE SEVERAL TIMES). DUE TO COMPLAINTS FROM TROLLS, I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS REVIEW IS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO BE A SLIGHT TO ROYCE DA 5'9, A LYRICAL BEAST. WHEN I DO TALK ABOUT ROYCE IN THIS REVIEW I HAVE NOTHING BUT LAUDATORY THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HIM. THIS IS JUST A RIDICULOUSLY LONG REVIEW FROM A DEDICATED STAN'S POINT OF VIEW. MUCH RESPECT TO ROYCE DA 5'9 (ONE OF THE BEST MCs IN THE GAME TODAY), DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS IS PRIMARILY AN EMINEM REVIEW.<br /><br />Alright, let's just air out the facts here: \\"Recovery\\" was a great album because Eminem had \\"recovered\\" from his rap-slump and gained his old skills back and also developed new techniques such as brilliant double entendres, double-time rhyming over beats, and metaphors that were out of this world and even better than many metaphors we've heard from him in the past. After his rehab, Em said that he had to \\"learn how to rap again,\\" and \\"Recovery\\" showed that he had in fact gained back the lyrical magic that laced the music on his early efforts, along with gaining some new impressive skills.<br /><br />But, \\"Recovery\\" seemed to be targeting to a new audience with tracks like \\"Love the Way You Lie\\", \\"Space Bound\\", and \\"Not Afraid\\", which many old-school Shady fans resented, and I can see why. \\"Recovery\\" wasn't hardcore like most old-school Eminem fans are accustomed to, and the inevitable cries of \\"sell-out\\" or \\"soft\\" began to ring out from some hip-hop fans. I can't count how many times I've heard, \\"Recovery is great, but I miss the old Slim Shady.\\" To tell the truth, I liked \\"Recovery\\" a lot, but basically just because Em had truly \\"recovered\\" his lyrical prowess that he's always been known for. The pop sound of the album was different from his past records. The reason that \\"Recovery\\" had ME excited was that I knew that Em's next album would showcase an even more improved lyrical flow.<br /><br />That album has arrived, and this is NOT a \\"soft\\" album in any sense of the word. \\"Hell: The Sequel\\" is hard, misogynistic, raunchy, raw, very vulgar, funny (but not in a corny way) and controversial all the while (There's even a track about drugs, which I never expected to hear from Slim again.). Now THAT'S the Slim Shady I remember and love. With the exception of one track (\\"Lighters\\" featuring Bruno Mars, which sticks out like a sore thumb on this record), this album contains hard beats and hard rhymes from beginning to end. No bubble gum stuff here, so \\"Recovery\\" fans, brace yourself for a return to the glory days of Eminem.<br /><br />Now, to address the partnership of Royce da 5'9 and Eminem. I've followed Eminem's career from \\"Slim Shady LP\\" till now, and I've never heard anyone trade verses with Em better than Royce. Royce is an absolute lyrical beast. I was upset when Royce and Em fell out several years ago, b/c they had been boys for a long time, and their chemistry as rappers was uncanny. Now they are reunited, and they haven't missed a beat and share love for each other throughout the record. These guys are rapping INCREDIBLY fast and going back and forth on verses similar to Method Man & Redman, or like Em and Dre on \\"Say What You Say\\" from \\"The Eminem Show\\". The rappers have stated that when they are in the studio together, they motivate each other to step up their game, and it shows on \\"Hell: The Sequel\\". When listening to this album, there is no need to try to figure out who spits better on each track, because they are rhyming almost as if they were born to rap with each other. This isn't a competition, it's a partnership, and both members of Bad Meets Evil are so on point it would make many of today's rappers' heads spin.<br /><br />Before I talk about the specific tracks, there's a warning I feel I should let the ladies know about. When \\"Recovery\\" was so successful, I read a magazine article (I believe it was in Spin Magazine, but I can't be positive) where they attributed Em's newfound success to catering to women. Perhaps Em read the article and took it personally, considering he's very bitter towards women. I'm afraid this album is so misogynistic that the new younger female crowd is going to be quite offended. If you are a female who loves rap music though, this is nothing new, but brace yourself, because Em and Royce go hard on the ladies on almost every track. Just something for you ladies to keep in mind. If it doesn't bother you, then this album is a real treat.<br /><br />Individual favorite tracks are hard to pick on this album. They are all fire. So, I'll address each track:<br /><br />1.)\\"Welcome 2 Hell\\" - 9/10 - No time is wasted on this album. From the first beat to the last on this song, you immediately know what you're in for:  an all-out assault of lyricism. If you ask me, Eminem has developed his lyrical techniques even better than the \\"Recovery\\" album. I'm going to include some lyrics, even though it's hard to do so here on Amazon b/c of the vulgarity of this album. I'll replace any dirty words with substitute clean words in parentheses. Em spits: \\"You has-beens are duller than / coloring books that ain't colored in / Second and third, fourth wind, got another win / Here they come again, none other than, / Bad and Evil, also known as Saddam and Osama Bin.\\" Hard beat produced by Havoc (of Mobb Deep). Great album opener.<br /><br />2.)\\"Fastlane\\" - 10/10 - The first single from the album is on fire. Produced with a bumpin' beat by Supadups and co-produced by Em himself, this song is off the hook. In case you haven't heard it, Shady talks about how he wants Nicki Minaj in a very dirty way that I can't print here. Here's my favorite lyric from this track: Em spits: \\"Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics / Cause when I rip this mystical slick (ish) / You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this (ish) / Cause after I spit the bullets / I'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball / I'mma kick the ballistics...\\"<br /><br />3.)\\"The Reunion\\" - 8/10 - The most hardcore misogynistic track on the album (perhaps). The theme of the song is that women fans say that Eminem's recent \\"anti-women\\" raps have been just for show, and on this track Em is saying that it's not a show at all, this is how he actually is. And he's very convincing, calling women every name in the book. Also, Eminem is ripping on \\"Relapse\\" again on this song, making fun of his accents in a hilarious way. Em: \\"In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates / No (chick) rides shotgun, what taxi? / Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up? / Is that what you actually 'aksed' me?\\" Produced by Sid Roams.<br /><br />4.)\\"Above the Law\\" - 8/10 - Produced by Mr. Porter. Good track. Not exactly my favorite on the album, but it's still got fire lyrics and a great hook and beat. This track is laden with explicit lyrics. Royce goes H.A.M. on this track: \\"I stay violent / ya'll go the peace route / You got a mouth like Kanye / I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out.\\"<br /><br />5.)\\"I'm On Everything (f/ Mike Epps)\\" - 10/10 - Perhaps my favorite track on the album. This is Mr. Porter's best beat ever, IMO. Hardcore and bumpin'. Eminem gives old school fans what they want, a track about drug use. He is just rapping, he's not actually back on drugs. He's just making a song to appeal to the crowd that \\"misses the old Shady\\". There's a sample from Mike Epps (comedian) that is off-putting at first, but grows on you quickly. Em spits: \\"Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E, yep / It's wrong, other words I just (messed) my RV up.\\" Classic track, IMO.<br /><br />6.)\\"A Kiss\\" - 10/10 - Perhaps the hottest beat on the record, produced by Bangladesh (producer of Lil Wayne's \\"A Milli\\" and \\"6 Foot 7 Foot\\"). Loaded with bass and staccato drums, this is a track to blast the bass on your system. This is another misogynistic track, not for the ladies really,except die hard female fans. And of course, I can't write about this song with addressing the Lady Gaga \\"diss\\". Gaga fans, take it easy. All he says is one little punchline and the outrage that has ensued over the line by Gaga fans is just silly. Here's what Em says:<br /> \\"Shady, he'll tell it like it is / So tell Katy Perry he's on the tail, he's tailgating / These bells are  my mating call and I'm here, / Bells waiting and tell Lady / Gaga, she can quit her job at the  post office / She's still a mail (male) lady.\\" Advice to enraged Gaga fans: don't take it so  seriously. In fact, from what I know about Gaga, she would probably think it's funny and  definitely wouldn't encourage hate towards anyone. Besides, it's not like he's beefing with her.  He's always been opinionated about certain artists, and in this instance, he's not making fun of  her music like he has other pop stars in the past, so Gaga fans, just chill out. It's all in good fun,  and this has been blown way out of proportion. A killer track.<br /><br />7.)\\"Lighters (f/ Bruno Mars)\\" - 7/10 - Like I said earlier, this track sticks out on this album like a sore thumb. It just doesn't fit in AT ALL with the rest of the album. The whole album is hard and vicious with no bubble gum junk. There are touching verses from Eminem and especially Royce da 5'9 on this track, which is why I rated it higher than I should have. I know this is the second single from the album, and I think if you are reading reviews for \\"Hell: The Sequel\\" because you like this track, you should know that \\"Lighters\\" doesn't represent what the rest of this album sounds like. This track would have been much more welcome on \\"Recovery\\". I skip the Bruno Mars parts of the song and listen to the verses only. The most touching lyrics here come from Royce da 5'9:  \\"I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute / to tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic / Tell him how real he is or how (messed up) I am / Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it.\\" Produced by Eminem, The Smeezingtons, and Battle Roy.<br /><br />8.)\\"Take From Me\\" - 9/10 - A bold and deep song about music piracy. I won't lie, I downloaded this album when it leaked, because I knew I was going to buy it no matter what, even if it sucked terribly (hey, I bought \\"Relapse\\" twice). I like Eminem's records that much. Unfortunately, that's not the case with illegal downloaders 9 times out of 10, and Em and Royce have had enough. They aren't as mad in the song as they are hurt. This track almost has a bubble gum hook, but not quite, in fact it's quite catchy. One of Em's most touching lyrics on the album: \\"When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away / To people who don't even appreciate flows / (man) I'm livid today / 'Cause I break my back to give you my art / You steal my thoughts / It's like driving a spike through my heart / You might not think it's a big deal to steal from me / but music is all I got / Aside from my daughters / not tryna sound like a martyr / But it's getting harder than I thought / to just not go crazy / trapped in this house, I'm about to snap / Am I not deserving of what I got? / Did I not work for it?\\" Even knowing that I was going to buy the Deluxe Edition, this song made me feel guilty for downloading it in the first place. So if you care about Eminem, please, BUY the album so Eminem doesn't quit the game, which he basically hints at in the song. Produced by Mr. Porter.<br /><br />9.)\\"Loud Noises\\" (featuring Slaughterhouse) - 10/10. WOW. These dudes can spit FAST! This is the Slaughterhouse track that will grab the attention of all Shady records fans. All 5 rappers (Em included of course) TEAR THIS TRACK APART. Ortiz from Slaughterhouse absolutely KILLS this track. If I were to type lyrics from this song, it would take too long. Just listen to it and sit back in awe at the lyrical skills of the MCs and be blown away. Produced by Mr. Porter.<br /><br />10.)\\"Living Proof\\" - 8 / 10 - ABonus track on the deluxe edition. This track leaked a while back, and Royce said it was cut from the album due to the early leak. I'm so glad they included the track on the deluxe edition, because it turns the EP into an album and it's a hot track. Em cracks on himself for having bitter feelings towards women and spits: \\"... the day that I don't straight shoot / I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group / Say I'm a sissy (homosexual) / record it play it back and put it on a straight loop / you haters look like you ate a grapefruit!\\" Produced by Mr. Porter.<br /><br />11.)\\"Echo (f/ Liz Rodrigues) - 8 / 10 - Another bonus track on the deluxe edition. The track was also cut from the standard version due the track leaking very early. On the early leaked version, Royce's verse is first and Em's verse is second. This version has Em on the first verse instead and Royce second. This track is produced by DJ Khalil, one of the hottest producers around right now.  The production is good with a catchy and impressive hook and beat. Em spits: \\"Diabolical to my last molecule / down to my last hair follicle and cuticle / Rotten to the core / to the (bottom) all the way down to my soul / from my hair to my toe.\\"<br /><br /> I highly encourage old-school fans of Eminem to buy this album. Shady is back and delivering what his original fan base has always loved about him: Hardcore controversial lyrics, hard beats, and unbelievable talent. I give lots of credit to Royce for motivating Em, and vice versa. Royce is an absolute beast on the mic and together with Em they have brought true lyricism back into the spotlight in hip-hop. Buy this CD and you will be pleased. Guaranteed, unless you are a female fan that is disappointed about Eminem going so hard on the ladies. For me, this album represents everything I've ever loved about Eminem. Personally, I like \\"Hell: The Sequel\\" better than \\"Recovery\\". I think \\"Recovery\\" was a necessary step for Eminem to regain his lyrical prowess and get back into the public spotlight. \\"Hell: The Sequel\\" should dispel any talk of Eminem becoming a \\"sell-out\\" or \\"soft\\". Even haters won't be able to deny, this album is fire. 5 out of 5, all day long. BUY it now!Lady Gaga \\"diss\\". Gaga fans, take it easy. All he says is one little punchline and the outrage that has ensued over the line by Gaga fans is just silly. Here's what Em says:     \\"Shady, he'll tell it like it is / So tell Katy Perry he's on the tail, he's tailgating / These bells are  my mating call and I'm here, / Bells waiting and tell Lady / Gaga, she can quit her job at the  post office / She's still a mail (male) lady.\\" Advice to enraged Gaga fans: don't take it so  seriously.

Even haters won't be ableto deny, this album is fire. 5 out of 5, all day long. BUY it now!
0743497465|3.0|I am an avid Dan Brown fan and I read his Robert Langdon books before reading any of his other works.<br /><br />There is huge distinction between the two types of works and I'm not sure what I thought about it.  I really liked Deception Point.  Unfortunately for me, I compared the two different books while reading.  To say the least, I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />I really liked that this book got straight to the point and was the epitome of a fast paced book.  It had all the action you could ask for.  It was original, it was cunning and I loved this aspect.  But it just didn't have the true Dan Brown spirit.  Yes, it was original, but it just wasn't complicated enough!  It's why I read Dan Brown; to keep guessing, to keep my mind busy.<br /><br />The characters I had little interest in.  There wasn't any particular character that I absolutely adored.  I didn't know the character for one and I didn't feel a desire to understand them.  They were simply a backround for the actual plot.  They didn't enhance nor degrade the book at all.<br /><br />The plot itself was incredible.  I don't know how he thinks of this stuff, so long as he keeps doing it.  It seemed more fit for a movie, however. He wrote it as how I would imagine a script to be.<br /><br />It's still a great book, just don't make the mistake I did and compare it to his Robert Langdon books.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|my only problem with this app is that it is sometimes inconsistent with the items shown daily on the front page of the store. the free song &amp; the sale album should, in my opinion, always be there. a featured 69 cent song is a nice addition, but shouldn't replace either &amp; the same goes for a featured $5 album.   i don't use the cloud player from my phone often, but haven't had any problems yet. i love that my purchased songs from the site or the app go immediately to the cloud. way better to have this than some other cloud players i've tried, like the one that requires your computer at home to be on so you can listen from your phone while you're out... wtf?
B00275EHJG|5.0|I was upset that it was the last one, but I can't say that I didn't love it.    This movie didn't lose it's charm as many movies do when they reach their third.  It retained it's spirit and personality.  The characters were still loyal, still versatile.      What I can say about this one is that it was somewhat depressing.  I don't say this simply because it's the final movie.  There was a lot of change and a whole lot of reality in an otherwise fantacal movie.  There was loss for all the characters.  I'm not saying that this didn't enhance the movie, but it was somewhat bothering to look it in the face.    The movie was very good and very happy, not too mention hilarious.  All the Toy Stories have been classic.  Highly recommended.
B002DOSBMK|3.0|I love this series and recently repurchased it for the kindle so that I can always have a copy with me to read.  However, there is a typo every few pages which I find absurd given that the hard copy I own contains none of these mistakes.  I hope that eventually someone will take the time to go back through and fix them as it becomes quite distracting when words are missing, capitalized in the middle of a sentence, or random punctuation like an apostrophe appears in the middle of a line.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|Thank you very much!!I am very satisfied with my purchase. I got it very fast and dvd in great condition. I highly recommend you. Hope to make business with you again !!
B004VFYOA2|1.0|THIS MIGHT BE THE WORST CONCERT DVD EVER..I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMENTS, MUST BE A BOOTLEG. IF THIS IS THE BEST THIS RECORD COMPANY CAN PUT OUT THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! THE VIDEO IS DREADFULL AND THE AUDIO IS BAD. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. DAVID COVERDALES VOICE SOUNDS TATTERED AND TORN, LIKE A SHREEKING CAT. SIMPLY A WASTE OF MONEY......
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|I would have never thought that the real world and the digital world could be meshed together so well. This will make you think twice about the way you live life today and how technology is so intertwined with our lives. One hex of a ride! [[ASIN:B002VUFKDY Freedom (TM)]] here I come!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|this headset is great for online play, and you can hear the game and people talking clearly without missing a sound.
B0034G4ORM|2.0|To be clear, I am only reviewing the film itself, not the blu ray. In my opinion unless this is priced at $12.99 or less, its not worth purchasing. I saw this film in the theater was disappointed. I did not go to see it with overly high expectations, just wanted a good sci fi action film. However the film's weak plot, and corny dialogue constantly drown out all the cool action scences, and the film quickly became annoying. I am in the military and have served proudly for over 8 years, so I enjoyed the fact the movie was specifically about one marine unit trying to survive this alien invasion. Unfortunately, I feel that the movie was geared to be more of a marine recruiting film, than an epic sci fi action film. Overall, not the worst film, but nothing that left me with a wow. Its an average film, that you as the buyer have to ask yourself if its worth purchasing
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I spent a lot of time reviewing this watch before deciding to purchase it.  Here's what I took away from the reviews before me: 1. The bezel is NOT an iPod and I shouldn't expect it to respond like one. 2. I may have some trouble using the bezel if my fingers get sweaty.  Other than that it seemed like a really great watch that will work to help me pace my runs as I prepare for my half marathon in September.    The watch was delivered by an overnight courier and looked great.  I loaded the software, charged the watch and two days later sat down to set it up.  First thing I noticed is that the bezel does take some getting used to.  It's not bad, just different.  Very different.  I noticed that as I was setting up the watch certain screens froze for a few seconds.  I was a bit concerned but decided to let it go.  I got everything set up and then left it in the charger til the next morning.  I woke up in the morning and put the watch on, ready to go for a run and it was not responsive.  The bezel would lock and unlock but other than that it would not change menus or work.  I called customer service and they walked me through a few steps and came to the conclusion that it was malfunctioning and would need to be returned.     The good news is that calling and accessing a customer service agent at Garmin was very easy and straight-forward.  The agent I spoke to was very nice and helpful.  The return process (so far) at Amazon is as easy as it could get.  You just go to your account, find the order, print a return label and ship it back to Amazon.  As for the replacement watch, I will have to update this review as it goes on.  As I continue the process I will update the number of stars I've given this product as appropriate.    UPDATE (6/20) I received the replacement watch in the mail today.  I can't tell you how easy the return process way.  5 stars for Amazon.  I opened the package, charged the watch and once it was 100% charged I decided to cross my fingers and try setting up the watch.  It was easy as pie.  As mentioned before, the bezel is definitely NOT an iPOD but who cares.  It's super easy to get used to and functions just fine.  The set up was complete in less than a minute and I didn't have any problems with freezing or malfunctioning buttons.  I was so excited that everything went so smoothly that i decided to strap up and go for a run.  It was a quick 3 mile run and during the run I tried speeding up, slowing down and changing screens on the watch.  Nothing to it!  Here's the best part.  I walked in the door, went to get a bottle of water and when I came back to the living room there was a message on my computer that the data had been transferred.  REALLY?!  That easy?  I didn't touch anything or do anything.  It uploaded the data and when I sat down at night to analyze it online it was there.  ALL of it.  It calculated elevation changes, speed changes, splits, heart rate....everything.  It was presented in tables and graphs, could be exported to excel or printed out.  So far, I am beyond impressed.  I'll give another update after I've used the watch for a while!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It wasn't my favorite of the three, but I really liked it.  I'm curious to see how the rights to the rest of his work turn out.  I hope we see more soon and that Eve is able to help get them published.
0307719774|5.0|I write in this little book every night right before bed.  It is nice that I can write a little something without having to go into long details.  It will be fun to read my answers a year from now.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|The film is about basically about an alien (and military knowledge of it) and the small-town heroes who want to solve the mystery and save the town (and ultimately the alien, too.) Sort of a mixture of Gremlins, ET, Jurassic Park (lots of Spielberg-style in this movie), the Goonies, Predator, with a little zombie stuff and Dazed and Confused thrown in. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it is very tension driven, not gory (which worked well for the hard-to-please tweens in my house...not kiddies, but not ready for R-ratings.)<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more of the character development between the boys (even if the action sequences were a little shorter) but that is just my preference and that doesn't fit with the \\"summer blockbuster\\" type of genre. Still, it seemed to ride the buddy movie/action movie line very very well. I WANTED the protagonists to win...which doesn't always happen for me in some movies. There were also a few little moments of that-doesn't-make-any-sense and corny stuff, but the movie was so enjoyable, you just let the few go.<br /><br />Overall, it was quite good. I remember walking out and thinking \\"I wanna see that AGAIN!\\" which isn't a frequent response I have to most movies. I often judge movies by the amount of popcorn I have left...if it is gone, it means I was kind of bored/not engaged, but I had half a bag left after this one!! Be sure to stay during the credits to see the Super 8 version of \\"The Case.\\"<br /><br />I hope people are reading these reviews before the DVD is released, because this one really should be seen on the big screen. It has a nostalgic feel and being in the theater (or better...the Drive-in!) really makes the experience more whole. A dark room at home with lots of popcorn will likely work well, too. I WILL find out because I have to own this!
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Batman was always about truth and justice. This film turns him into a liar and a conspirator. That just ruins it for me. (When does the film about Ghandi come out shwoing him as an axe murderer?) Forget this film - if you haven't seen it DON'T. This is just another \\"Battlestar Frackedenema\\" - a complete an total destruction of the original for some sort of genereation-why drug trip of a re-write. Nope I cannot recommend this to anyone unless you like the remake of Battlestar Galactica and \\"Star Trek\\" (the recent feature film by that title) where they completely destroy everthing that made it good in the first place. Forget this as it makes Batman no better than the criminals that he is hunting. Thanks to the producers of this film for ruining the last of my childhood heroes. I don't care what anybody sels thinks about this. I will never watch another Batman film after this piece of dren.
0439023513|2.0|I absolutely LOVED the first two books of this trilogy, but I felt like Ms. Collins rushed through this just to get the third book out and done with.  It seems like Collins just had Katniss pass out as action was about to happen so that she wouldn't have to come up with what was going on.  I had very very high expectations for this book especially after the first two were as brilliant as they were, but this book was a huge disappointment.      That being said, I don't regret reading it, and I still recommend reading it but don't think that it's going to be anything like The Hunger Games or Catching Fire.
1423101502|5.0|It's a week before Percy Jackson's sixteenth birthday; the day that he will fulfill a prophecy he has only heard part of.  But Percy has other things on his mind.  The Titans are attacking all over the globe.  His father, Poseidon, is fighting a giant monster under the sea.  The majority of the other gods are fighting in the middle of the country, leaving Mount Olympus undefended.<br /><br />Somehow, Percy and the other half-bloods must find a way to protect the seat of the gods' power or civilization as we know it will unravel.  Nico has a plan, but it seems dangerous.  Should Percy follow it?  Will they stand a chance even if Percy goes through with it?<br /><br />While the other books in the series have been fun, I've felt they were also formulaic.  That's definitely not the case here.  The action starts early and keeps going the entire way through the book.  I always had a hard time putting it down.  The characters are well developed as well.  I was very sad to say goodbye to them.  So much that we have seen before comes into play here that it feels like a great conclusion.<br /><br />If you've been enjoying this series, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  If you haven't discovered these books yet, I recommend you start with the first one so you can full appreciate what happens here.
B001EN71CW|5.0|First, regarding the format, the blu-ray quality is excellent.  It's definitely a big step up from the DVD version.  I have yet to watch the special features or watch episodes with the included commentary.    As to the show itself, it's hard to describe it fully.  There's a reason this show has developed a cult following after its untimely demise.  Like so many great shows, it was a victim of poor timing and bad handling by the network.  I know I was only vaguely aware of it when it was on, and only came to know (and love it) long after it had been canceled.     The show has a great balance of action, drama and humor.  The character development is top-notch.  I'm not sure I can think of any other show in which I was so actively engaged in so many characters' stories.  Each episode gives you more of a look into these interesting and unusual character's histories and lives, though generally small enough that it keeps you wanting to know more.  Sadly, the show ended before it was able to explain many of the questions that it introduced.    The dialog is snappy and well written, and the plots of each episode are always fun and exciting.  The show does an excellent job of weaving in series-level elements (plot points which span the entire season) with individual episodic stories.  Some shows do little to tie episodes together, and some spend so much on making everything on a season level that each episode has little value in itself.  Firefly is definitely not one of those shows.    All in all, this is a great show.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi (or maybe even westerns, with its unique western-sci-fi combination, which works surprisingly well).  This blu-ray is a great way to enjoy the show, and it often goes on sale for around $35.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|LOVE it. Saw them at the Moore theater the day this album was release and the show was absolutely mesmerizing. Over the next week, I listed to the album over and over again, digesting it's subtle and well crafted mastery. You are in for a real treat with this one. :)
B0030IG0C6|5.0|It's the lllllaaaassstttt. Remember that film? Remember wanting to have one of your very own? If your girl or boy loves the mythical creatures they are going to love this. Her mane SPARKLES, right there it's a win-win. Needless to say this is the new favorite of our youngest; who if you didn't know is a bona fide empress (she thinks big). These toys are great representations for a child's imagination. It's a bonus that the unicorn still possesses it's horn and that's no easy feat, not belonging to one of mine anyway.
0385341679|4.0|I enjoyed reading the fever series and could not put it down.  This last book of the series, Shadowfever, is not my favorite of the series, nor is the ending as good as it could have been, but it is still good to finish the series.  I highly recommend reading this entire book series.
B004N8CP8K|1.0|I downloaded this app to install on my Velocity Micro T301 tablet, but, apparently, it's not compatible with the hardware underneath. I sent an email to the developer (the same day)to let them know.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow. I think that completely sums it up.    This is the first Jillian Michaels DVD that I have purchased, and I highly recommend it. I love it!    When starting this DVD, I was 5'4, 211 lbs with 38.5 inches in my waist and 47 inches in my hips. Needless to say, I was/am overweight and not healthy.    So right now is my 14th day. I am doing the workout right after I get done. 4 days on level two.    My results so far: 206, waist 34.5 inches and hips 44.5 inches. That's 5 lbs gone and 4 inches off of my waist and 3.5 off of my hips!    I love her 3-2-1 system, it was hard for me at first with a lot of breaks but well worth it in the end!     I highly recommend measuring yourself before starting and keeping track!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|That's what this film was to me. The similarities to Saving Private Ryan were striking. First, a small group of soldiers are sent out to find survivors, only to encounter the enemy on the way. It gets more specific than that. Remember the scene in Saving Private Ryan where the nazis bring up the 20 Mil and turn it on the Americans attacking the Tiger? That scene is replicated in this film - only the 20 mil is some sort of alien weapon. This was an excellent beginning to what will hopefully be a trilogy. I just bought the Blu-Ray today and hopefully the quality of the transfer will be high.
B000002LBH|5.0|It's all been said below, just a perfect record. If you are not aware, Belle & Sebastian's \\"Push Barman To Open\\" ranks pretty close to this. Look it up, it's wonderful.
B0000019P9|5.0|Okay, let's face it.  By now anyone who's at all in touch with the indie/underground/adjective-here music scene will have heard of this record.  It's frequently hailed as one of the greatest records by your typical folk-rock obscurist hipster indie snob (traces of which I am guilty of having in my blood, to be fair).<br /><br />That doesn't mean it's not a great record.<br /><br />It's unusual, it's noisy, Jeff Mangum's voice will probably not appeal to anyone who is mostly accustomed to slick high-budget produced vocals, the lyrics are so dense and obtuse that they're nearly impenetrable on a first listen, and for these reasons it will not be very accessible to most people.  But if you have the right mindset to sit down and listen to Aeroplane all the way through, you will be pleasantly surprised, possibly even blown away.  And if your reaction is considerably more mild, I guarantee you that if you can find anything at all to like about it, you will catch yourself humming the melodies nonstop days later.<br /><br />In short, give it a listen.  You can't be promised anything about how you will react to Aeroplane, but to the right ears it is definitely an awesome record.
B003UESJHE|5.0|`The Kings Speech' is a gentle drama following George VIth as he comes to the throne of England and works his way through his speech impediment with the assistance of a gregarious Australian speech therapist.<br /><br />George, otherwise known as Bertie, is played superbly by Firth and whilst his stammer is portrayed very authentically, it never hinders the flow of the film or becomes annoying to watch.  Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Lionel Logue, the therapist, and his unorthodox methods rub Bertie up the wrong way, but soon get the desired results.  Bonham-Carter is also good as Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) whose support for Bertie helps him through the tough times of his brothers abdication and the outbreak of war.<br /><br />This is set in the lead up to the second world war and also features such people as Churchill (played by Timothy Spall) and has newsreel footage from the times which enhances the overall feel and helps submerge you into the story and period.<br /><br />Everyone acts very well in this film and whilst it has a gentle pace, without any need for special effects or other Hollywood tricks, the story is engrossing enough to keep you enthralled for the duration.  Firth has been especially lauded for this film and after recently seeing him acting excellently in `A Single Man', one can easily say he is at the height of his acting abilities at the moment.<br /><br />It is fascinating to get another view of the abdication and inner workings of the royal house during this tumultuous time and the story of Bertie's struggle with his stammer adds a human element to both the royal family and film.<br /><br />This is well written, acted and directed and I enjoyed it immensely.  This has received many recommendations and much deserved praise and I can only add my own recommendation and praise to this.  Check it out at some point, you shouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|After hearing much hype over this series, thanks to it originating from a comic book series, an ex of mine introduced me to this. Thank God he did!    Not much to say about this series other than its beyond amazing. From the writing, to the acting, the make up for the zombies. This show is brilliant. My only complaint would be that season one only have 6 episodes. I want more!    Eagerly awaiting season 2.
B004XUD762|5.0|overall I think that this was very well put together album and had great unplugged versions of songs from order of the black along with other additional other songs like Helpless and bridge over troubled waters. When i get the chance I recommend this to friends that are asking for a good unplugged album to listen to. overall, glad i bought this album. SDMF!
B0019NG73G|3.0|I was looking forward to the Blu ray version of Gettysburg, already owning the DVD version. First, the pluses: beautiful 150th Civil War commemorative packaging and features (standard definition DVD) and the DTS Master Audio with low frequency bass channel (great for the cannon barrage)! Now for the spoiler - Picture quality! You would think that a premium priced Blu ray would deserve a pristine transfer, but no way. Yes, the picture is sharper and with more detail and vibrant colors, but the problem is gamma (dynamic range from light to dark). The picture is contrasty (no shadow detail-actors faces obscured under brims of hats) and murky in other parts. Who engineered this and authorized its release? I watched the same scenes from the DVD and the picture quality is far superior (except for fine detail and sound). Even though this entertaining historical epic has been expanded to 271 minutes, it still deserves better treatment. If this is released in the future, save your money until you can find a trusted review that covers picture quality in depth.
0307595579|4.0|Stieg Larsson, who died in 2004, wrote this trilogy that concentrates on one strange character-Lisbeth Salandar. One minute you catch yourself saying \\"You go, girl,\\" and the next you are wondering if you may have been a bit premature with that attitude.<br /><br />It would be a huge understatement to say that Lisbeth Salandar has been abused by the system, over and over! Her father is a is a mean SOB who defected from the former USSR secret police to Sweden during the Cold War (which I hadn't even realized took place anywhere but the USA!). So, what do the Swedish Secret Police do? They form a SECRET DEPARTMENT that no one in the SECRET POLICE seem to know anything about.  Sooo, cold war era, but not impossible for those times! This department not only gets \\"secrets\\" from the new defector, they also protect him and his Swedish identity, no matter what law he decides to break, and he breaks plenty.<br /><br />He abuses Lisbeth's mother until she is completely incapacitated and has to be institutionalized, which prompts a 12-year-old Lisbeth to set his car on fire with him in it. This after she has tried to tell the people in authority what is happening and has been ignored. The short of it is that Lisbeth is institutionalized by a psychiatrist working in cahoots with the secret department protecting the b****** that is her father. Once out of the institution Lisbeth is declared incapable of handling her own affairs and is required to have a guardian. This works out well until her guardian becomes very ill, then she is turned over to a guardian who works for the secret department and who physically abuses her. What she does to this guy is one of the \\"You go girl!\\" moments, believe me. Get the picture?<br /><br />The three books tell what is happening to Lisbeth after all the awful stuff. I could not put any of the books down; they lead you on a dark journey through Lisbeth's adventures. She is still being harassed by the people in the secret police who are still protecting her father even though he has lost his usefulness because, after all, it's secret! Along the way, she makes some powerful friends of her own, even though she has become at this point almost incapable of trusting anyone.<br /><br />4 stars for this one!ough he has lost his usefulness because, after all, it's secret! Along the way, she makes some powerful friends of her own, even though she has become at this point almost incapable of trusting anyone.    4 stars for this one!
0451228375|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth, but World Without End is even better.  Follett's description of a main character surviving the plague in Florence was amazing.  The characters are compelling and the historical information covers SO much (warfare, society, class, commerce, inventions, medicine, and especially the plague), but as story you can't put down.  I feel bereft having just finished it that I don't have 1,000 more pages.
B004E547D8|5.0|This is a great movie and a bit of fun. As some of the other reviewers have said, don't take it to seriously and you'll love it. I didn't see a bad performance in it, great cast.
B004WJRDN2|1.0|So many deluxe editions popping up...and hardly any are worth the money.  Paul's debut album was fairly good...but certainly not deserving of the \\"deluxe\\" treatment given here.  You'd think that Paul already has enough money and wouldn't feel the need to delve into his fans' bank accounts during these hard times.  A deluxe edition of Ram might be better than this...who knows?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved this book. I'm a fan of The Running Man by Stephen King and this is similar. But, this is about teens batteling it out til death in the woods so it's much more entertaining for today's YA crowd. I hear they are making a movie about this book and Hollywood's hottest young actors are fighting for the roles. I can't wait to see how they adapt the suspense and characters to the big screen. I read this in 3 days and immediately ordered the second book Catching Fire and pre-orderd the third, Mockingjay. There are certain parts that are gory which is a necessity for the story since it's about killing for survival but not sure it's appropriate for a young child to read.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|I read my first Heyer in my earliest teens, more than half a lifetime ago. Over the years, I have felt my preferences for Heyer heroes and books change drastically. Through the years, Venetia has been a constant. I loved it then and I love it now.    I must have read this book about 30 times or so and I still laugh out loud.      Venetia is an older heroine who's always lived in the country. But she's not a woman who needs trown bronze. She's confident, knows what she wants, and she's very self possessed.   And then she meets her next door neighbour, the Wicked Baron. They become very fast friends to the dismay of almost all of Venetia's relatives and friends. (Her brothers don't really care). And so they (the relatives and friends) conspire. What happens next? Read it yourself!    What I like:  1) Venetia has enough sense to know that there's a chance that Damerel may not remain loyal to her (physically, at least). And she accepts that.  2) Under her very proper deportment, Venetia is quite prepared to lead the life of a wife who partakes in her rakish husband's lifestyle. (I think Heyer hints at this by showing us what a shocking mother Venetia has.)  3) I really like how well the plot moves. Esp in terms of the guests Venetia suddenly has to hosts and how they become excuses for Venetia's uncle to step in and take her away.    What I don't like:  1) The only problem I have is that I really do not like Damerel's whinging in the very end. But I suppose we're shown that Damerel really is a very sensitive man under that rakish hard shell. So maybe some alcohol does make him mopey.    This book is interesting, because I love the story even if I don't fall in love with Damerel, I can see how Ventia does.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|bought this for my brother and he loves it, he couldn't wait for it to arrive, came in great shape and condition.  Thank you!
1402210086|5.0|The first Georgette Heyer I read was \\"Devil's Cub\\", and I fell in love with Dominic. I was 13 at the time. Years later, I realized how reprehensible he was. And so I moved on. Mostly to the likes of the Earl of Worth, and Lord Damerel.     I read Cotillion when I was in my twenties because it was deemed too boring by the lot of teenagers I hung out with in the old days. And wow! Was I surprised. I LOVED THIS BOOK.    The great thing about Heyer is that you can re-read her books over and over and discover something new. I've discovered that I can no longer fancy Vidal or Robin (Masqueraders). The hero here, on the other hand, is a wonderful hero.     The plot here is simple, and it's been used before: Kitty needs to agree to marry one of her guardians great nephews. The one she wants, Jack, never shows up. So she hatches a plan with the empty headed Freddy to fake an engagement and head to London. There she can sample town life, meet new beaux and maybe land Jack as well.    The best thing about this book is the simplicity of the plot and the apparent ease with which the characters develop. You start to have definite preferences much before there are any declarations or feelings of love expressed. You SEE the love develop. You are never told that the characters are now in love. Absolutely fantastic.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Very rarely do I hear a cd in which I could listen to every song all the way through on it and enjoy myself, it's truly a rare treat when you find one as such and also a true masterpiece, and that masterpiece is 21, by Adele.  I work at a place that sells cds and I kept noticing people coming in and buying this cd from an artist named Adele whom I had never heard of and I didn't understand why she was so popular, I mean, I'd never heard any of her stuff on the radio.  So when I got home I went on Amazon and found her album and had a listen, the very first song, \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" simply blew me away, and its definitely the most powerful song on the album.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it sounds like a bluesy kind of gospel song about heartbreak, simply amazing, I was speechless.<br /><br />Next I went to \\"Rumor Has It\\" a more upbeat song with catchy lyrics and music that really makes you want to get up and dance.<br /><br />As I kept listening to each song on the album, I was more and more shocked at how much I enjoyed each song, each one is unique yet has the same power over me.  I instantly fell in love with Adele and ran out to buy her cd.<br /><br />Every song I would give a 5 out of 5 so I'm not gonna make a list of each song but I will tell you the most remarkable ones in my opinion, and those are, in order of my favorite:  Rolling In The Deep, Someone Like You, One and Only, Take It All, I'll Be Waiting, Rumor Has It.<br /><br />All the other songs are great too but these are the ones I find myself listening to over and over again.  \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" is so exceptional that anyone I have introduced this song to, male or female, have always loved it and asked who sang it and what was the name.  That's very rare for a song to do, especially for a woman artist, I hate to say.<br /><br />Adele has made her mark in the world and it's becoming quite a big one as she has already broken several records for most weeks at #1 and such.  I read somewhere she is already planning a 3rd album, I can't wait.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you haven't heard this artist yet, you need to check her out, no artist has been able to send shivers down my spine like Adele, and I think she is now my favorite artist of all time.I can't wait.     So in conclusion, if you haven't heard this artist yet, you need to check her out, no artist has been able to send shivers down my spine like Adele, and I think she is now my favorite artist of all time.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|This is an easy one.  \\"Hangover II\\" is essentially the same story as the original only it's set in Thailand.  The team has a huge night out, can't remember a thing and then has to undertake detective work to find out what the hell happened.  It's all good fun.  Forget the wowsers and fun police.  \\"Hangover II\\" is good escapist fun.  Just see it.  There, I told you it was easy.
0439023521|5.0|All I can say is that I really wish these books had been around when I was a teenager.  I hadn't even heard of them until I started seeing all the movie casting news recently.  The subject matter intrigued me so I bought this first book and I was instantly hooked in as if it was crack and I was a junkie.  My favorite books/movies/t.v. shows are always the ones with a strong female protagonist, and boy did this deliver on that.  I haven't read the Twilight books but I have seen all the movies so far (don't ask me why) and wow ... I have never seen a WEAKER female protagonist in my life.  I can't stand that.  This is the antithesis of that crap!!  What a breath of fresh air.    I just finished Catching Fire too, now onto Mockingjay.  I heard that one is a bit disappointing so I'm a little worried, but gonna dive into it.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|It looks nice; my daughter liked the way the bumpers light up.  That being said, it practicality has to be the only app running otherwise it stutters a lot on my Thunderbolt.    Glad it was the Amazon free app today as it want worth $2 to me.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|Sledge presents a great insight into the Pacific War as a marine at the sharp end in two campaigns.  Reading this book is a better view of the story than the TV documentary \\"The Pacific\\" which features part of this book.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Almost as good as the 10th. The Jonas brother being the only weak link. Still worth owning, but not unless you get the 10th Anniversary edition first.  There is NOTHING as good as that one.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is just stinkin' fun. I love Angry Birds and all, but this game has far superior game mechanics and touch of wry and wacky humor. It is easily the best game I have played on my Galaxy S phone. Popcap just makes quality games. That said, I have had maybe a handful of minor issues that will probably be fixed soon, but it does not effect really the amount I enjoy the game. Get it. Its worth paying for.

B0055JP7EU|5.0|This was an excellent round up of a lot of issues.  They left us clues in all prior episodes to what was coming.  I am very pleased.  So much action.  In this episode, you get to see a lot of the old characters from Season 5 and 6.  But the ending?  Ah!  Delicious.  Who is River Song?  What an amazing ending.  Nope. Not saying more.  Spoilers.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Superman finally gets suitable (no pun intended) treatment with this Blu-ray Anthology boxed set. All 5 feature-length films plus extended part 1 and The Richard Donner Cut of Part 2 all in top quality 1080p, every special feature ever produced that you could possibly want, every classic Max Fleischer cartoon and \\"making of\\" special, galleries, commentaries, even the \\"Super Pup\\" pilot and \\"Superman & the Mole Men\\" starring George Reeves. We all know parts 3, 4 & \\"Returns\\" weren't as good as parts 1 & 2, but I've always enjoyed them nonetheless, and now even more so... they just look so fantastic on my 52\\" Sony Bravia! Even the box's slipcase design is super (pun intended) it's as if you're opening a holy relic or lost artifact... which for me, it is! If Amazon allowed for it, I'd give this release 10 stars right down to the last molecule of cardboard that the box is made of, it's that SUPER!!!
B004SBQALA|4.0|Comment: How do I rate this movie... the best way I can describe this movie is to compare it to music. I am from the generation of Led Zeppelin, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Yes and Black Sabbath. When I compare \\"my\\" music to the newest music I say the new music is fluff, light on talent... full of pretty faces but no sole. (no hate mail please) Some of the newest films are the same way. Lots of pretty faces and bodies. That is how I see this movie. When I watched it, I gave it a solid 3 Amazon Stars... that is , for the first two thirds of the film. The last third came to life with some good action. This bumped my rating to four stars. It is obvious that this is the first of a \\"few\\" films to follow. I can see now that the first two thirds of the movie was to set up the characters and story line. I am convinced that the films that follow will be along the lines of X-Men. To get the best from this movie you must be a younger viewer.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|For me I have always been a little indifferent towards the scorpions until I heard thier 70's stuff and particularlly this album which blew me away. I know most Scorpions fans will prefer the albums and songs that come later, which is fine for them, but for me this is thier masterpiece
1439152780|1.0|I've read all of kate Morton's books..my favorite is the Forgotten Garden. This one is just horrible. I had to skip major chunks of the book and it didn't matter anyway. Just read the first few chapters and the last few chapters and thats all you need to know what happens. Terrible terrible book..way too long. Read the Forgotten Garden and House at Riverton, but don't even bother with this one...unless you want to check it out from your library because you like that kind of torture.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller has the best fit and easiest button layout out of all the current-gen controllers on the market. Seeing that the design hasn't changed much at all since the original PS1 controller is a strong statement for it's greatness.<br /><br />The battery lasts a surprisingly long time, and charges up pretty quickly.<br /><br />They have decent range, and I have rarely been disconnected during a game. (It's been at least a year since it's happened)<br /><br />While I don't beat mine up, they're quite durable. My non-dualshock controllers have lasted me since the PS3's launch date, and I assume the DS3 has the same build quality.<br /><br />Finally, don't go for the 3rd party knock offs, they're just not worth it. Ever.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|Ordered this Lp from Amazon supplier Go Hastings, and despite being beat to crap on the way, the LP itself arrived undamaged. The quality of the 180 gram pressing was supurb. The defintion and clarity was 1st class. On \\"Cars Hiss by my Window\\" the vinyl is so quiet I thought I was playing a CD. Morrison's voice was made for analog.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|I was expecting this film to be marginal, either marginally OK, or marginally bad, and somewhat exploitative, given the subject. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't seen the trailer, which looked quirky enough to make it worth taking the chance.    I was genuinely surprised that they didn't take the easy way out at a number of points. It's a pleasant romantic comedy that remains true to the characters, and has a credible ending. I enjoyed it, I laughed out loud, and I will watch it again.
B00275EGWY|2.0|It's been awhile since I last saw this movie so I'll remember the best that I can during this review. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I won't say that THE HURT LOCKER is a terrible film, but Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay of 2009? Give me a break. If this was directed by a man instead of a woman, it wouldn't have been NEARLY as successful as it was. The one thing people keep praising about this movie is how realistic it is. I must be missing something here because I did not for one second believe anything that was happening onscreen. A lot of it has to do with that God-forsaken shaky cam technique that tries to make the movie seem like a documentary but just gives me a headache. Here's a crazy idea: if you're going to shoot it like a documentary, why not MAKE A DOCUMENTARY?! I'm sure it'd be better than this! The other thing that really bothers me is that I never felt like the filmmakers actually understood anything about what it's like serving as a US soldier in Iraq, aside from the battles. Everyone acts and talks in a contrived, Hollywoodesque manner. One line in particular makes me cringe. It's the scene where Jeremy Renner's character (Sgt. James) is about to defuse a bomb, but he starts to take off his protective gear that shields him from the explosion. One of his colleagues asks him, \\"What are you doing?\\" Sgt. James replies: \\"If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortably.\\" Did I accidentally put Die Hard into the DVD player? Oh no, it's a movie about DEFUSING BOMBS IN IRAQ! Or how about the scene where James talks about things that almost killed him? \\"That's my wedding ring. Like I said, things that almost killed me.\\" Bleh. Little moments like that really add up in the long run.    Despite all of that, I think THE HURT LOCKER does have a fascinating premise: War is a drug. That's something I haven't seen in a movie, a war movie no less, but there's not a lot of interest to really explore this idea. Sgt. James just acts like a wannabe 80s actionstar most of the time, and the plot is all over the place. It's just this happens and this happens and this happens for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind except that these sequences of events don't add to the overall idea of the movie. They simply happen and then vanish without actually affecting the story. I guess you could argue that it was just trying to show what life was like in Iraq, but Iraq War veterans have already dismissed this movie as inaccurate Hollywood trite. So what's the point? The only thing that was interesting was at the end when Sgt. James is sent back home, gets sick of his routine civilian life, and returns back to Iraq. That's where the movie should have started because at least everything that would happen would somehow relate to the idea of \\"War is a drug.\\"     This could have been something meaningful and substantial, but THE HURT LOCKER just settles for mediocre. I really want to like this movie because again it's a great idea. I feel like the movie is getting at something that I simply can't see because I'm probably too stubborn. Well, until I can see what it's going for, I still give this 2/5 stars.     PS: If you want a great movie about the War in Iraq, check out THE MESSENGER. That should have earned THE HURT LOCKER's recognition and accolades.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Superb Blu-ray DVD. HD is fantastic and all the extras on the additional disc are just great! You can't possibly be disappointed with this package.
1439156816|3.0|There is no denying that this book is incredibly entertaining and inspiring to any of us who are willing to put in the time and effort at improving our craft. That said, it should be acknowledged that his process is not going to work for everyone. For instance his stories are all based on \\"What if...\\" -all situations where the story starts on page 1. Some of us like dark secrets lurking in our stories. He also feels that characters are added to fit the plot. Many of us start with a character and go from there. He's very big on description, advising us to cut 10% from our rough draft. I'm a sparse writer who adds description after the first draft. May not help me but still worth the read.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|If you missed the first movie, don't worry, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) tells us the plot in the beginning as he describes things to his son, a skeptic of his world. Dad goes missing. The company is taken over by the \\"evil\\" partner who actually wants to sell software than give it away, which on the surface is a better business model, but in this movie it is a terrible evil. Years later Sam Flynn, the son (Garrett Hedlund) discovers his father's secret lab and accidentally crosses over into Tron land. The reason why we watched the first movie was because of the graphics. No one really cared as much about the plot as we did the cycle races.<br /><br />During said cycle races, Sam is rescued by a girl Quorra (Olivia Wilde) in a Batmobile and is taken to see his real father. Quorra has the ability to wear her hair slanted to either the right of left (shades of Tina Majorino in Napoleon Dynamite!)<br /><br />Like the first movie, the graphics are great (amazing what a little strip lighting will do) and the acting was bland as was the plot. The plot is at times metaphoric. The user, or program creator (humans) are gods. Sam is the son of god and is also a god. The programs want to revolt against the gods and take over their world. Meanwhile Jeff Bridges has discovered ummm, bio digital isos that will change the world. The plot is overwhelmed by the graphics.<br /><br />The movie is more about Clu than Tron, but \\"Clu\\" movies seem to bomb.<br /><br />The film is programed for the younger crowd.
0345505387|4.0|To say I approached The Exile with trepidation is an understatement, since Outlander by Diana Gabaldon is one of my favorite novels. I was afraid that a graphic novel might interfere with my mental images of Jamie and Claire and that it might not be able to do justice to the story. But from the first pages, The Exile brought the characters to life and gave a new dimension to my enjoyment of my favorite literary supercouple. .If anything, The Exile reminded me of why I fell in love with Outlander so many years ago.<br /><br />The Exile gives us a bit of background on Jamie's early life and shows us his first encounters with the time traveling Claire. As with any graphic novel, the pictures are the main attraction, but the dialogue and thought bubbles provide even a novice to the story with plenty of substance to keep the story flowing. The illustrator, Hoang Nguyen, does a terrific job giving visual to the story, and while Claire is often shown as more buxom than I'd imagined, all the characters are very similar to those living in my imagination. Nguyen captured Jamie's delightful sense of humor in his features while managing to keep him realistic. The author also includes a chatty section at the end that describes the journey of The Exile into print, all of which adds to the enjoyment of the book. The book stays true to the story of Outlander, though it ends with Claire's decision to stay with Jamie rather than returning to her own time. Overall, The Exile, while adding no additional  insight to the series, is a fun supplement and can be highly recommended from this fan.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have found this to be one of those items that become indispensable. I carry the sharpener in my pocket secured by a long nylon shoelace that attaches to the belt loop on my Leatherman Surge multi tool.   The shoelace may seem a bit childish (that's me!) but it prevents laying the small tool down somewhere and not being able to remember where it was left or worse still, having it picked up by someone else.   I wouldn't recommend attempting to sharpen a machete with the pocket pal, nor will it replace the water stones that I use to keep a razor edge on my chisels planes and gouges, but when using a knife frequently as I do it's nice to be able to reach in the pocket, take a few swipes with the sharpener and resume whatever, with a reasonable working edge.

B004FTSAMC|5.0|As an avid watcher of Bones, I have been equally drawn in by, and frustrated with, the character of Doctor Temperance Brennan. \\"Logical\\" and \\"rational\\" are two words that continually define this forensic anthropologist, often to her emotional detriment. Throughout the series, the writers have tried sporadically to show her more emotional side. This trend usually lasts for one, or part of, an episode. Well, I hope that \\"The Doctor in the Photo\\" is a sign of the times.     In this episode, Brennan struggles with the murder of a fellow doctor - a talented female cardiovascular surgeon. Instead of focusing on the bones, Brennan can't help seeing that she bears great similarity to Lauren (the deceased). Like Lauren, Brennan is a respected doctor at the top of her field. But, like Lauren, Brennan also lacks a husband and children, is immersed in her work, and comes off to many as cold. When Brennan sees how quickly Lauren's disappearance is forgotten, she begins to reflect on her own life, and what meaning it may have after her death. As the episode progresses, this introspection, and the effect it has on her colleagues, leads to nothing short of a character breakthrough for Dr. Brennan. Want to see Brennan outwardly displaying more depth and emotion? You'll love this episode!
0345529057|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books!!!  I got this set (at a fantastic price I might add), and I haven't been able to stop reading.  The books are incredible - masterfully written, full of drama and action, and all you could ask for in a series.  I personally love that each chapter switches from the point of view of several main characters.  Unlike others who are turned off by the fact that many main characters die or befall some great harm, I enjoy the realism.  Additionally, there are characters that stick through it all which makes their journey even more savory and sweet.<br /><br />I know that this is a review of the books, but I will also say that the HBO series is magnificently done.  It is not as rich and well-rounded as the books, but no television show could be.  I encourage you to watch a few episodes to see if this is the type of story that you would like.  I am personally not a fan of \\"fantasy\\" literature, but I think this is a book series than any lover of great writing can enjoy.  I would recommend it whole-heartedly.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Others have written very detailed reviews of this show, so I won't say much other than to reiterate that this show is in my top 3 of all time!  I watched the first episode and knew I had to buy the first 2 seasons.  I watched it all within 2 weeks.  My husband made fun of me for being so into it, but I made him watch the first episode to see why I love the show and he watched all the seasons within 3 weeks, as well (I watched them again, too).  Veronica Mars is just an incredibly well-written, perfectly-cast show with wit, intelligence, a strong female lead (Kristen Bell is amazing), clever plotlines, and enough suspense/drama to keep you up into the wee morning hours because you just HAVE to know what happens next!  We are 32 and 33-years old, btw, and we still loved this teenage/high school show!  Now, if only we could get them to make a movie and tie up those loose ends from Season 3!

0618680004|5.0|A lot of people have accused Dawkins of being harsh on religion, but that is part of his central thesis; why should religion be exempt from the tough probing questions we can apply to everything else. Why should it get a special pass?<br /><br />This book is not likely to change the minds of anyone religious. Part again of the point of the book is people have this socially ingrained ideas and they do not let them go easily.<br /><br />The eloquence in which he lays out how life could have began and then evolve through natural selection has made me want to read more books on evolution.  I consider myself a science-literate person and I did understand what he was saying, but that does not diminish the impact of Dawkins' text.<br /><br />This book should be required reading since I have a feeling that most people reading it, myself included, already subscribe to one of more of Dawkins viewpoints.
B00005ABKC|4.0|This is Tom Petty & the Heartbreaker's 4th overall release and the follow up to their breakout hit DAMN THE TORPEDOES. It's not quite as good as its predecessor but it still stands on its own as one of their best records. All of the songs range from very good to excellent. Classics on this album include:<br /><br />The Waiting<br />A Woman In Love (It's Not Me)<br />Nightwatchman<br />Letting You Go<br />A Thing About You<br />The Criminal Mind<br />You Can Still Change Your Mind<br /><br />Those are all excellent with A Woman In Love (It's Not Me) arguably the best love song they ever recorded. The other songs are still great, just not excellent. Great collection of songs that won't disappoint fans old and new. This band is consummately professional and can shuffle influences into their style effortlessly without losing that quality that makes them TP&H.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|In the last year, I have accumulated FOUR pairs of these shoes, and I love them all.<br /><br />As many commenters have already stated, there are some issues with the sizing. Depending on the type of shoe, my normal size is 11-12. The very first pair I bought I tried on while wearing socks, and it was a true size 11. However, I've taken to not wearing them with socks, so it leaves them a little roomy at size 11. But I don't mind the occasional 'flip-flop' sound they make, since they really are a flip-flop disguised as a shoe.<br /><br />The main reason I bought them is that I wanted to find a good-looking, comfortable and durable summer slip-on shoe. And Santa Cruz Crocs fit all of those criteria. I have them in Khaki, Espresso, Chocolate and Black because these colors seem to go well with most things that I usually wear. Maybe sometime soon I'll even try wearing them with socks and pants so that I can compare them to normal shoes which I wear everyday.<br /><br />Before last year, I never even blinked when I would see Crocs Shoes at a store. In my mind, when I would think of Crocs, I would think of the standard rubber shoes with the holes on top. But as I did more research, there are so many more types of shoes with the same sort of comfort technology that Crocs offers. And this is what turned me into a Crocs fan, and I can proudly say that I'm a guy who likes Crocs!<br /><br />I am a regular general Amazon customer, but I've found that ordering the Santa Cruz (or any Croc) directly from the Crocs website is a better deal. You can search for Croc coupon codes online for discounts, as well as coupon codes for free shipping.
B000065AI3|3.0|This is Tom Petty's debut and we see a band that is still maturing. There's some excellent material interspersed with some mediocre numbers as well. Hometown Blues and Anything That's Rock And Roll are forgettable. We have 4 real TP classics in:<br /><br />Rockin' Around With You<br />Breakdown<br />Strangered In The Night<br />American Girl<br /><br />The rest of the album is good but not outstanding. Mystery Man is TP doing Van Morrison and Luna could've been another classic if the lyrics were better and the vocal delivery more solid. All in all it's worth buying though and it shows a band with tremendous talent that is gelling. DAMN THE TORPEDOES, their third album, is where we see them hit their stride. That is the best album to start a Tom Petty collection. If you like this kind of music you will eventually want all of their albums and TP's solo material which is practically him and the Heartbreakers under a solo guise. Very talented band.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Evangelion 2.22 You Can Not Advance.  First off the visuals are simply stunning to behold on a television capable of displaying 1080P.  From the detail lavished upon the armaments buildings of Tokyo 3, to the new Angel designs, to the animated Evangelions, to the on screen information graphics etc. the tv show looks dull and boring in comparison.  The sound track once again is offered with an English 6.1 dub that sounds like a summer action movie block buster.  Also a Japan 6.1 dub is included which emphasizes the dialog over all other sounds.  This movie also includes a running commentary from the English voice over cast talking about their impressions of doing the voice dubbing work for the first two Rebuild of Evangelion films.  The extras on this movie includes some deleted scenes as well as a remixed scene.  However the extras are still kind of lite considering the storage capacity of a Blu-Ray disc.    Plot wise this movie makes it very clear this is an alternate universe Evangelion loosely based upon the tv show.  Whereas the first movie, 1.11, had subtle hints this movie is like a lead pipe in comparison.  While the first movie deviated from the tv show here or there, this movie diverges from the tv show plot dramatically from the very first scene.  In my opinion I rather like the new direction the francise is going.  I was sort of disappointed with the first movie as it appeared to be the first six tv episodes with better graphics.  This movie is like twelve tv episodes condensed into a nearly two hour action packed movie spectacular as it tears down what the tv show established story wise.  In the end I am left wanting parts three and four as I really want to know how this version of the story plays out.    Some have mentioned the cheaper style packaging used for 2.22 as opposed to the 1.11 glossy package.  I too am disappointed but Evangelion 2.22 is not the only one guilty of this.  The sad fact of the matter isBlu-Ray as a format came out too late in the game compared to DVD and Laser Disc before it.  Unlike DVD and LD, Blu-Ray has to compete against high speed broad band to the home which makes it easier for viewers to either stream or steal HD content with the press of a button.  As Blu-Ray sales erode to HD streaming and stealing, Blu-Ray content publishers are going to cut costs to keep their profits up however they can.  Cheaping out the packaging is one easy way to accomplish this.    On the upside at least 2.22 is the only version available for this movie.  There is no 2.02 version unlike the 1.01 debacle with the first movie.  For anyone who doesn't already know, don't bother getting the 1.01 version of the first movie.  Only get the 1.11 version of the first movie.
B000O75F7C|4.0|This is PT's 2007 offering. It's not that different than their previous 2 offerings, Deadwing and In Absentia, except for it being more atmospheric and flowing than those two. Here the album is very cohesive. It's almost like one big, long song. That was the intention and Steve Wilson and Co. got it right. It feels like the concept album that it's intended to be. There's less of a feel of individual songs and more of a feel of another world being created musically. It was inspired by Bret Easton Ellis' novel \\"Lunar Park\\". I have not read the book and therefore cannot comment on that portion of creative process, however the mark was hit squarely as far as creating a flowing, seamless piece of progressive rock art. Lyrically the album also holds together well. It is arguably the most cohesive album the band have made.     It's not my favorite because it tends to be a little bombastic in places. The songs average about 7 minutes in length with Anesthetize being 17:42. This is not something new to this band. They usually record more than one epic on every one of their albums, but when every song is long, it makes it harder to absorb and harder to stay submerged in the soundscape. This is not to say that I don't like this album; I do like it and it's great. The qualm here is that I liked them better when the songs were more concise. The same statements can be made in a little less time.     Another problem that I have with this release is that it is only 6 songs. This has been a point of contention amongst fans and I'm sure that some people reading this will cringe at yet another stab at the issue, but having released this as a full-length release and then releasing 4 songs that didn't make the album a year later reeks of opportunistic dealings. I don't know who makes those decisions, but the argument was to eliminate the extra songs because they don't flow with the rest of the album. Well, that is untrue. If you make a playlist and embed the extra songs from NIL RECURRING into FEAR... it is obvious that they all fit together very nicely. I put Cheating The Polygraph 3rd, Normal at #7, and Nil Recurring and What Happens Now? at 9 and 10 without changing the order of the other songs. Normal feels like a reprise of Sentimental and actually adds to the feel of a concept album. This new version plays beautifully and makes me wish that it had been on the original release. The final product, including the bombastic song lengths clocks in at 79 minutes and change, making this feasible to fit on an 80 minute cd. This makes me mad because it is an obvious attempt at cashing in. I hope that they don't repeat this gimmick in the future.     All things considered this is a great album and marks a slight change in direction for the band. I think that the next effort that we see after THE INCIDENT will see that direction solidifying into a balance between the bombastic, albeit cohesive material of FOABP and the more song-oriented style of the previous 2 albums. This album has some real gems on it. Ironically, the longest track is the best here. Anesthetize is one of the best songs that they've ever recorded. It's everything that makes PT the band that we all love and is worth the price of the cd by itself. My Ashes and Sentimental are two more classics, with the rest of the tracks being very good as well. Casual and hardcore fans alike will love FEAR OF A BLANK PLANET.     Another point that I would like to make is that the concept of a \\"lost generation in the making\\" that this album explores is a much-needed message in this most plastic of worlds that we live and evolve in. America becomes dumber and more complacent as time goes by and the attitudes and culture that I see that have developed will not fix that problem; instead they feed into it and today's youth are becoming a BLANK PLANET quickly. There is very little depth and heart in this most consumerist, isolated and self-centered society that we've created. From Jerry Springer to BritneySpears/Lindsey Lohan, there's not much provocative and intelligent statements being made for positive change, so this album comes as a welcome reminder that there are still people out there that realize that a change is needed and more of us need to talk about it. (Sorry about the soapboxing) Kudos to PT for making this bold and incisive statement.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|The delights of this movie for me are endless.............yet, this movie flopped badly on its release and only built a following in later years..............why was that?  The movie is perfectly made, acted, and directed; yet Depression era audiences gave it the cold shoulder.    When compared to other screwball comedies of the era this is one of the few where the spoiled rich person ends up winning by essentially running roughshod over the middle class person............the heiress smashes up cars, destroys his life long work, and generally wrecks his life........yet, she is not punished or even reprimanded on the screen...............I truly think this turned folks off in the Depression while movies like My Man Godfrey were popular because the rich were made to look foolish and the rich family's fortune was saved by the butler.  It is just my theory...I just wish I could figure out why It's A Wonderful Life also flopped on release!! lol

1601251505|4.0|This is a great paper and pen role-playing game. You will have amazing fun with your group when playing pathfinder, although nothing is too new from DnD 3.5 edition. At a glance their seems to almost be no difference from the 3.5 but upon closer inspection there are a lot of rules that are new and make sense and create dynamic role-playing. I highly suggest getting into Pathfinder as paizo is doing a great job of supporting the Pathfinder RPG with great published adventures and game products. My gaming group hasn't been this happy in awhile playing Pathfinder. My biggest complaints about the Pathfinder series are the contradicting rules and the sloppy editing job, although it is nice to have elaboration. It would be nice to have charts and rules separated to easily stick out to help understand them better. Besides these negatives I applaud Paizo and Pathfinder and give this book a 4.5
B004F5E9IA|5.0|First off i want to say this Blu-Ray is the U.K. Blu-Ray version of Meet Joe Black. In saying that, the disk is in English, is a fantastic transfer to Blu, and as with all Universal pictures releases the disk works on USA players just fine (there is no limited region code on it).  Quality really is excellent and im glad that i purchased it!  Update: The USA version is being released May 1st 2012 [[ASIN:B0076I624W Meet Joe Black [Blu-ray]]]
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Total trash, as if being directed by a 10 year-old. Don't let some big names on the cover fool you. This movie is just annoying and stupid.
B0036T31YY|5.0|This is a thinking person's creepy movie. The writing is scary good, as is the acting. I was hooked in the first 5 minutes. I watched this on the same day as Let the Right One In, also a lovely movie about alienation, loneliness and duty. Great double feature.

Suddenly freedom doesn't taste quite so sweet.<br /><br />Shadow's life as he imagined it is no more, and in the midst of the ruins a stranger emerges . . . Mr. Wednesday is looking for an assistant, and Shadow takes him up on the offer of curious work.<br /><br />But Mr. Wednesday is even more mysterious than Shadow first suspected. Because the old Mr. Wednesday is on a quest, of sorts. The once mighty Gods of old mythology are dying. They need humans to live - they need our belief and prayer, but modernity is taking over the piety of humanity - nowadays the human race worship at the altars of technology and marketing.<br /><br />Mr. Wednesday, along with his faithful side-kick, intends to round up the Gods of yesteryear - every divinity from Egypt to Russia. Wednesday is gathering them in preparation for a storm that's brewing - a day of days. And Shadow is intricate to Wednesday's grand plan, even if he doesn't know it yet. . .<br /><br />`American Gods' was released in 2001. It won Neil Gaiman a Hugo and Nebula award, and remains a staple of the modern fantasy genre. The book is once again in the spotlight, with Gaiman recently announcing on his website that a Tom Hanks-produced HBO series is in the works. And to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of this beloved novel, a new edition has been released, complete with an introduction by Gaiman (in which he says that he'd love to revisit Shadow!).<br /><br />I have always meant to read `American Gods'. It's inevitable when you love fantasy/sci-fi as much as I do, that Gaiman's name and this novel will be recommended. So I was thrilled to receive the special tenth anniversary edition in the mail - I needed no more encouragement to happily delve into this twisted fantastical mythological tale.<br /><br />`American Gods' is a cross-genre extravaganza. Gaiman explores Biblical, mythological and fantasy worlds all within the framework of modern, desolate America. The novel is complex, less for the ideas Gaiman is exploring and more for the way he presents his narrative. The book consists of many mini-plots as Mr. Wednesday and Shadow go off on their quest to discover deities and idols of the past. I initially struggled with the veering storyline, wishing instead to concentrate solely on Shadow's quest. But it quickly becomes apparent that Gaiman's twisted tale is as much about the little-big God characters as it is about the wandering protagonist of Shadow. In the end I loved the side stories as much as Shadow's over-arching journey . . .<br /><br />Gaiman's narrative may be initially difficult to follow, but his explorations are clear as day, as `American Gods' asks the big questions in a fantastical way. Gaiman observes the shifting of humanity from God-fearing worshippers to technological consumers. He asks what happens to Gods and idols when there's no one left to believe in them, and does our society still need worship? These sound like big, scary concepts - but Gaiman is exploring them with infinite wit, fancy and beauty. That was one of the things I loved best about `American Gods' - that there's a quotable-quote on practically every page.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's epic mythology-fantasy novel is like Jack Kerouac meets Homer. Gaiman takes readers on a sweeping, rollicking journey across America - from Chicago to Rhode Island and many a dusty town in between. Every sort of idolized God is along for the ride - from those of Norse mythology to Egyptian deities. Armageddon is coming and Mr. Wednesday and Shadow need to get to the real American heartland for the coming battle.<br /><br />Incredibly epic, `American Gods' is truly a must-read novel.desolate America.

B004ZGYEKC|5.0|The first 2 Donovan albums on US Epic (this one and \\"Mellow Yellow\\") along with the first Procol Harum LP   were probably the last significant albums issued in mono and phony stereo.  Finally, UK EMI (owner of these Mickie Most produced tapes) have issued the album in true, beautifully mixed stereo.    This is proper mid-1960's era stereo mixing, with all of the modern techniques to make the overall sound as crisp and clean as possible.  To my ears, the mixing decisions are exactly what I had always hoped these tracks would sound like stereo.    The first disc has the entire US Epic LP in true stereo:  SUNSHINE SUPERMAN (3:17 edited version)  LEGEND TO A GIRL CHILD LINDA  THREE KINGFISHERS  FERRIS WHEEL  BERT'S BLUES  SEASONS OF THE WITCH  THE TRIP (minus the harmonica solo from the 45)  GUINEVIEVE  THE FAT ANGEL  CELESTE    There are 9 bonus tracks:  BREEZES OF PATCULI  MUSEUM (1st version)  SUPERLUNGS (1st version)  THE LAND OF DOESN'T HAVE TO BE  SUNNY SOUTH KENSINGTON (was mixed into stereo on the 1998 UK EMI \\"Psychedelia at Abbey Road\\" comp)  EPISTLE TO DIPPY (early alternative arrangement)  plus first-time stereo of the tracks   WRITER IN THE SUN  HAMPSTEAD INCIDENT  as well as  SUNSHINE SUPERMAN (4:42 full version)    Of the above, only the long version of \\"Sunshine Superman\\", \\"Seasons Of The Witch\\" and \\"Sunny South Kensington\\" have been mixed into stereo previously.    Disc 2 contains the entire UK Pye album (12 tracks, including some issued on the US \\"Mellow Yellow\\" LP in mono, plus the three tracks in mono on the US Epic album.    The sound is absolutely top notch and anyone who likes Donovan will want to finally hear these in stereo...after all, this and (hopefully) upcoming \\"Mellow Yellow\\" albums were probably his best work.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|Absolute perfection and definitely worth adding to your DVD library. Wondered if it would be as good as \\"Hitman\\", and yes it certainly was, and if possible maybe even better. This man is truly a genius, and his guest stars are all fabulous. A wide variety of artists, and yet it would be hard to find someone who didn't enjoy ALL of them. Sound and visual quality of the blu-ray is awesome. Can't wait for the next one - Bring it on David Foster, because I'll be buying it as soon as it comes out. Feel confident in buying this item - you wont be sorry!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I bought this game and my wife and I are addicted! I wish it was longer! This game requires strategy and planning in order to win.
0345522478|5.0|An excellent book, reminiscent of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files.  I will not go into details,since that has been done by more proficient writers, so I am just highly recommending the series.  Have him on auto-order like I do Butcher.
B003K16P3M|5.0|As a woman who likes books about strong, realistic women doing awesome things with a bit of romance thrown in, this book was perfect.  Katsa is both kicka$$ and able to form strong, meaningful relationships, something I think other books can fall flat on.  Too often warrior women are portrayed as being outsiders and having to hold themselves aloof from everyone around them.  In contrast, the relationships Katsa forms with her cousin, the spymaster, Bitterblue, and especially Po all felt real and natural and very powerful.  At the same time, Katsa had flaws and was in some ways damaged and this, too, was reflected in how she related to other people.<br /><br />I think Cashore handled the whole \\"I don't want to get married/I don't want kids\\" extremely well.  It didn't feel like it was a controversial topic shoehorned onto Katsa's character to maker her unique and Katsa struggled with the issue in a real way.  Not every woman is the same in wanting the \\"traditional\\" things that a woman is supposed to want and it's nice to see that reflected and not have it turned around at the exact moment the heroine finds \\"true love.\\"  Or worse, the heroine can't have a relationship or be in love until she decides that maybe she is willing to marry and have kids.  Instead, she finds a man who loves her as she is and respects her wishes.<br /><br />All in all, Katsa was only one amazingly awesome character in this book surrounded by an engaging and heart-stopping plot.  I didn't guess any of the major plot twists and Cashore was certainly not above putting her characters in truly life-threatening, dangerous situations.  I can't wait for the sequel and will definitely read the prequel.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm a fairly active person, but I'm also obese.  I have not moved from the first level yet, but I'm getting there (it's been almost a month now).  I've lost inches galore, but I'm also combining this with Weight Watchers...so that helps.      The first day I did this I could hardly make it through...by the 3rd day I was extremely exhausted but I was doing every exercise all the way to the end.  The only thing I did half-a**'d is the jumping jacks--I had knee surgery less than a year ago and have lotsa screws so I'm still strething out my new parts so that was too much pressure on my knee; but I still do them with all my might and keep pace with Jillian.    It will kick your butt, but if your overweight/obese, of course it's going to be hard. Just gotta stick with it!  I am doing this 4 times a week and since it's over 100 degrees out now everyday, I swim/water aerobics the other days along with yoga.     It's worth it at this price if you're going to commit and do it!
0307946711|4.0|I picked up One Day as I saw that it was named one of the NY Times Notable Books of 2010 and I am very pleased I did as I flew through the book.  It is one of those rare books that makes you feel both happy and sad at different parts and I found myself reflecting on my own life and connections several times in the book.<br /><br />The book itself is about two individuals from the UK--Emma (Em) and Dexter (Dex) who meet up--really hook up--on their last night of university and then essentially go their separate ways.  Each chapter of the book takes us to exactly one year later in their lives--July 15th--and tells you where they are, where they have been, and how they have evolved as people.  Without giving away too much of the story, I can say that there are an incredible number of surprises--you expect eithr Emma or Dexter to be one way and then you see them act in a totally different way. You expect Emma to emerge from her search for meaning in life and a real career one way and she comes out totally different than expected. You expect the book to end one way and then it surprises you with a very different than expected ending.<br /><br />Overall a really good book. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 primarily because I felt it went on for about 100 pages too long and the author could have tightened it up a bit. Nevertheless very much worth a read.
B004QPOVE6|4.0|This is a good Blu-Ray to invest in if you like AC/DC. You can throw the last few dvds out and just use this for entertainment. They play all the \\"hits\\" and some new stuff. I enjoy puttimg this on and cranking up the sound. Good Stuff !!!
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|When i downloaded it, everything went well.  Afterwards when I tried to install, it gave me an error message &quot;cannot install.&quot;  I then exited out of the app and re-entered the app, only to find an error message stating,&quot;error occured while downloading.&quot; (even though the download was successful). I repeated this process once more, and then remembered an issue I had with another app not being able to be installed, and the only solution was to shut down my phone, take out the SD card, turn my phone back on, install the app, turn off the phone, reinsert the SD card, and then turn on the phone again. However, when I attempted to do this, it still did not install. Not cool offering a free app of the day that doesnt even work.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|I did not enjoy this film in the least, and I'm generally pretty forgiving about films and like this genre.  The storyline was jumbled, and the acting was terrible.  Too bad really, since it has so much potential.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This game plays very well on nexus s, no lag and one of the best games I've found. Definitely a keeper.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole King still rocks!  Don't ever think that musicians get old...they just keep on playing - I think the youngest player in this concert is 59...    Top-notch musical renditions and some new arrangements, along with the standards as we've grown to know them pepper this performance.  IF you like James Taylor or Carole King, buy this.  The fact it comes with both a DVD and CD is a bonus - you can take it wherever you are and listen.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|As someone who used to play U.S. versions of pool rather seriously (hundreds of dollars on cues, playing for paychecks, etc.) I would have to say that this is the best electronic billiards simulator I have ever played.  The addition of game rules and descriptions allows users to learn new games, many that you would be hard pressed to find at local halls.  Now if only there was a search function to find real world tables nearby (sighing with nostalgia)...

B000PMLFRA|1.0|As many others have stated - true fans want the TRUE ORIGINAL.  The fact is: Blu Ray discs have enough space to fit BOTH VERSIONS on them (as pointed out in other reviews).  So what is the excuse for not doing so?  MR. Lucas - you have been Milking this series for all its worth, for every last penny - can't you reward the fans who have been with you from the beginning.  We will forgive you for the last 3 movies if you do this one thing - AND THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF FORGIVING!!!!  How can we enjoy the movie the way it was meant to be seen (on Blu Ray), but not enjoy it because it is not what was \\"meant\\" to be seen!    BTW - a lot of the 5 star reviews are not for this Blu Ray release (it is for the earlier reviews of a few years back).  Why they are lumped in with this - I don't know.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really nothing more than new levels for the ever popular (and addictive) Angry Birds product line.  Would have liked to have seen some new features added (i.e. able to bounce back down off of floating balloons).
B00127RAJY|5.0|There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but this DVD is amazing. Here's a quick breakdown of what I thought of each of the three levels:    Level 1: I love how simple and old-school this level is. Lots of jumping jacks, jump rope, pushups, basic things you probably already know how to do. What makes them hard is how they are sequenced, and I was new to weight training when I started this, so all the strength segments were very hard! Even if you're advanced, I would recommend at least trying this once before moving on to Level 2.    Level 2: Though I like Level 2 and would do it again, it's my least favorite of all three. The sequencing wasn't quite as good and it felt like it was dragging on forever. It was also slightly above my advanced beginniner/intermediate level of fitness, so my body never adjusted to it the way it did to Level 1.    Level 3: This is by far my favorite level. The moves are great, with lots of plyo involved. The strength training mostly involves using your body weight, and since I'm very weak in that department, it's helped me a lot.     I should mention that I did not do this workout 30 days straight -- even though they're only 20 minutes each, I still didn't have the time and the energy to do it that often. I've been doing it on and off since Christmas, working my way up to each level when I feel ready and going back down to the previous level if I had been away from it too long. I'm almost done with Level 3 now, and in my 6 months of doing this, I've lost around 10 pounds, in conjunction with eating a little healthier of course. Not bad for a 20 minute workout. :) I would gladly recommend it to anyone and have already recommended it to a lot of my friends.
B004KAB4I8|5.0|Such a great drawing book for dragons and creatures really helped me get there features and bodies down
B0042RJWTC|4.0|A friend recommended the series and so far I've enjoyed it. It's definitely quality material and has a lot of depth to it. There's the drama, violence, politics, and oh yes... the sex. There is lots of nudity and sex in this series. Don't expect to be using this as a history lesson for the kids.    The discs are well-made and the digital content on them is great. No format or quality issues there.     The biggest complaint though is that the \\"book\\" that it came in. The width is about 3 times the width of a standard DVD case, so it won't fit on any standard DVD shelf. It's made of a thin cardboard with several pages containing pockets that the DVDs slide into. Another reviewer submitted images that show what to expect on the internal packaging so you can see for yourself. No snap cases or thinpacks that most other DVD box sets come in, which I'd have much preferred. The only saving grace of this packaging is the designs on each \\"page\\" and the cover, otherwise I'd have replaced it with a more standard DVD case that would much better protect the discs.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I was dying to switch to a different iPhone case, thanks to the Amazon vine program and got this one free.    The earlier iPhone case was a Griffin iPhone case which I got from the Apple free case program (for antenna issue) and the problem with that was that it would pull my pocket inner lining whenever I tried to take it out - since it was rubberized. Otherwise, the griffin is a neat looking case.    Now, for the Amazon Basics iPhone case - here are a few points which will let you decide:    +ve points  (1) Neat looking:  My iPhone looks sleek, neat and clean - does not look very bulky like the other cases  (2) Case is made from a smoky gray Plastic - it is not a very hard plastic, but something semi-soft so that it can protect against any falls.  And it does not stick to your clothes unlike the rubber/silicon cases.  (3) Fits snug and tight  (4) Does not slip if your hands get sweaty  (5) Leaves out ample space for the camera, volume, on/off switch    -ve points  (1) The screen protector is pretty transparent, but when you hold it at an angle, it shows off rainbow colors - looks kind of cheap  (2) Not well sized - the sizing is not very accurate, so if you make any small mistakes while applying the screen protector - it can potentially cover the edges of your front camera    Overall - I am pretty happy with the whole package and going to keep it.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|The game is fun, good graphics, good effects, many custimizations, no lag on my vibrant.     The only CON is the paddle control. The paddle rests right on top of your thumb rather than infront of it.  Because of this half of your filed ends us as a blind space, and if the puck gets behind you paddle, there is no way of seeing it, you have to blindly hit it out of that corner and hope you dont score into your own goal (which happends alot).
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|I purchased this CD out of curiosity to the sound of a K2HD recording. I was very pleasantly suprised to the clarity of each instrument that I can hear in every song. The sound was so good that I enjoyed every composition. If you have good sound system, it definitely is worth spending for good quality CD.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Your credibility was shot when you announced to the world that you purchased a bootleg movie.  What kind of moron are you?    Don't be surprised when you get served a complaint.  Even if you used a fake name they will track your IP address.    How much gall you must have to steal a product then criticize it???    It is people like you who enable the rest of the thieves.    I liked the movie.  People get a grip.  It's science fiction.  The operative word is FICTION!    If you want fact watch the History or Smithsonian channel.  Hollywood is for entertainment not education.
B000KZBRG6|3.0|Looks like it's going to be OK...  However, you would think that for a $100 item the manufacturer would throw in a battery - required before it CAN work.  Don't know whether this is an oversight or Sekonic has gone cheap.  Years ago a light meter was a less than $50 item and if a battery was required, it was usually included.  Now the price has gone up and the product is shipped incomplete as far as I am concerned
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Okay game play, but there is a significant and annoying lag when moving the paddle. I decided to just uninstall.
0141034599|1.0|I wanted to like this book, but the author goes on and on without really making his thesis practical.  For example, it's fine to criticize anything that is overdone, such as (perhaps) the bell curve, but if a bell curve were not explanatory in some or many cases, it would not be used.  Stating that sometimes things happen that we don't expect doesn't really give much of a blueprint, and repeating it over and over ad nauseum is annoying.  Many other reviewers recommend Taleb's first book, so perhaps it is worth reading, but this one is not.
B001IDZJFO|5.0|Currently enjoying the easy to read book by Norman Doidge, M.D. Our brains are miraculously made with mysteries yet to discover. Thank you to all the brilliant pioneers who have put in their sweat and toil to research our incredible organ. I recommend this book to everyone.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half. I would have torn through it quicker but one does need to sleep and work. I too read this entire story as fanfiction and was thrilled that the author was publishing. The characters are intriguing and sometimes even infuriating. The erotic elements are very sexy but never trashy or even gratuituous. The smut entices the reader and often furthers the plot. I can't wait for the future volumes.

B004MNO0BQ|2.0|Yes, the game looks great, but like most table hockey games on Android and iPhone, the controls are horrendous.   The paddle often seems to pass right through the pick and knocks it backwards into your own goal. There is also the unavoidable problem of your finger covering your paddle, which makes aiming extremely difficult.   I want to like this game, but the controls make it nigh impossible to win without just getting lucky. Very little opportunity for skillful play here.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Under producer Spielberg's assumed tutelage and inspiration, director J.J. Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in \\"Super 8\\". Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of \\"The Goonies\\", \\"War of the Worlds\\", and \\"E.T.\\", but not in equal proportions.<br /><br />Abrams handles the \\"Goonies\\" component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe (home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.<br /><br />The \\"War of the Worlds\\" component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. Army into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the \\"E.T.\\" aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the \\"Cloverfield\\" monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from \\"20 Million Miles to Earth\\". And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a pictureof Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? \\"E.T.\\" gets shortchanged here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time. If you are a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy it even more, and be more inclined to overlook its flaws.aby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot describe how much I LOVE this book! I have read it over fifteen times and will never find a book that beats it. A must read! I have read hundreds of books, and never have a found one so captivating. It grabs you from the first page... \\"When I wake up, the other side of my bed is cold.\\" While some say that this book is too violent, I think that while it is gruesome in some parts, it also shows that you can make a difference in the world if you stick your mind to it. Katniss, the main character, is my hero! She is a character that you immediately love. With all of her strength, its not that hard to imagine all of the difference she can make.
0316069353|4.0|I really liked this book. It was written about a highly topical subject- mortgage foreclosures. Of course, it blossoms out from there and becomes a multi-layered story. It is interesting to note what happens in a court case that becomes much more than a finding a person guilty or innocent. Mickey Haller would have been a great war-time general. I found this book much better than some of the books he has put out lately. I found it an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.  On another note, Amazon really needs to get the reviews complaining about Kindle out of the general reviews. I read the reviews to find out about a story not about the price of Kindle. I looked at this book and was quite confused as to why people either liked it or really hated it. Then I discovered that they just hated the price of it on Kindle. It's beyond frustrating. Please, Amazon, do something about this problem.
0670022411|5.0|I've seen mixed reviews of this book and was curious about it. I don't often feel a sense of sadness when a book ends - but I did when this one ended. I loved this book! It's a creative, imaginative, fantastical work of fiction.<br /><br />The book depicts world that is populated by humans, vampires, witches and demons.  A academic witch who has turned her back on her familial (descendants of Salem, Massachusetts witches) witching powers becomes acquainted with a vampire in the Bodleian library at Oxford. He's a fascinating, handsome professor who has, among many, a good Scottish friend named Hamish - who's a demon. Witch and vampire fall for each in a big way - a big \\"no-no\\" in the world of 'creatures'. This forbidden love triggers the fury of the 'council' and, in a facile twist of prose, brings together an odd assortment of 3 witches, 3 vampire and 3 demons...all of whom make for a sub council dedicated to true love for all. The reluctant witch must learn to use her ancestral powers in order to survive the wrath that her romance has unleashed.<br /><br />I can see where some readers might not be able to enjoy this book because they find the whole story implausible. It is, of course, implausible. Fiction is, almost by definition, generally, implausible. I read this book and thought of it not only as a truly imaginative work of fiction but also as allegorical ; where some loves are still considered taboo  and where we still think that some sorts of people are blood suckers, demonic or spell casters. What I wanted from this book was entertainment - and I got that in spades. It's rollicking tale of love, sorcery and the coming together of all creatures in a common desire for good. What I don't understand is how a reader would not at least appreciate this book as the well crafted, thoroughly imaginative tale that it is. I think of it almost as a fairy tale for grown ups. A unisex fairy tale.<br /><br />I liked this book so much that I also listened to the audible version - which makes the story all that much more enjoyable. It's perfectly narrated by the talented Jennifer Ikeda. Rumor has it that this will be a trilogy and I simply can't wait for the sequel to be in my hands.<br /><br />This book is a love story and rollicking romp into the mind of a gifted writer. This book needs to become a movie. It would be fantastic!  Okay - I've had my rave and will go back to my perusals.ory all that much more enjoyable.

B0012GMVSU|4.0|Alan Silvestri's SCORE for Forrest Gump is a classic. Movie music lovers all over the world surely will recognize the theme filtering through the first seconds of the movie, accompanying a feather carried in the wind. Don't be fooled: the other 20 tracks on this cd wil carry YOU back to that very first time you saw this picture, and - if you're old enough - to that time in American history. From 'run Forrest run' and 'Washington reunion' to 'Forrest meest Forrest' and 'Jenny's grave', it's Silvestri's way to tell a story. From subtle piano to majestic symphony variations: his orchestrations are magnificent.  Enjoy.    NB. Besides this SCORE there's also a double cd, titled 'Forrest Gump the soundtrack'. It contains 33 hits from this era (from Elvis Presley to Bob Seger) plus about 8 minutes of Silvestri's score.

B002A4UQLW|5.0|It's not easy being a Neil Young fan.    Just look at the \\"Geffen Decade.\\"    Sometimes Neil's good, sometimes he's great, sometimes he steals the loose change from your purse and laughs all the way to the bank.    [[ASIN:B000002LMK Ragged Glory]] followed [[ASIN:B000002LHM Freedom]], and with those two albums, Neil Young fans could finally wash the bitter taste of those Geffen ashes from their mouths.    I haven't been knocked on my *** by anything Neil has released since \\"Mirror Ball.\\" It's been a string of albums that weren't anywhere near as bad as the Geffen travesties, but there's been a tiny flash of genius here, a tiny flash there.    The crown jewel in Mirror Ball, for me, is \\"Peace and Love,\\" and it comes at the hands of Eddie Vedder: \\"I took it all, I took the oath...I took it all, Til I had most...I took what's left, I gave it breath...I had it all once, I gave it back...\\"    Now, Eddie knows what that means, since he wrote the lyrics, but I don't...and I don't need to. Like most great rock & roll, it is what it is...a raw nerve sucker punch, a flash of brilliance.    Will Neil ever be unquestionably brilliant again? I'd like to think so. But it won't happen until it matters to Neil, and as all Neil Young fans know, that could take a L-O-N-G time, or maybe it won't happen at all. It's Neil's world...we just live in it.

0316056863|4.0|Like most anyone who knows even just a little bit about Tina Fey, I was super excited to get this book. It is about what you'd expect; by that I mean that it is a funny page turner full of self deprecating moments that make you laugh, and want to say \\"Oh, Tina!\\" I recommended this book as soon as I got it to nearly everyone I spoke to (or texted with), but in fairness I bought it at an airport and I was on vacation so I most people I communicated with was after a few drinks.   Then there is what I was not expecting, which is a holier-than-thou, self important attitude that almost dares the reader to pretend to be as smart as she is. It's kind of frustrating when an author talks down to their audience, especially when the book in question is a memoir. Tina Fey's superiority complex gets annoying after a while, but the book is still worth your time to read.     It's quick, and easy. It would likely appeal to those who have read Chelsea Handler (it is as funny as 'Are You There Vodka It's Me Chelsea', almost), but replace Handler's antics of debauchery with Fey's up-in-her-stuff back patting that a lady such as herself would never... Yeah, yeah yeah. I don't care for people running around all too happy to share their foul behavior, but it is equally obnoxious when someone is all too quick to brag about what they won't do. Basically, what you will gather is that Tina Fey wants you to know she's a rich German/Greek lady, who has made a lot of money making people laugh, and ALWAYS doing the right thing.    It can all get to be a handful and many of the blows are below the waist. But between gently tapping herself in the front, and delivering a blow in the back to her readers, she manages to make you laugh out loud. She has the pretentiousness of Gwenyth Paltrow and sharp wit of Chelsea Handler- see, something for everyone.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|Headphone and loudspeaker selection is [by its nature], highly subjective. I own both of these headphones, the 7506 for a couple of years, and the 7509HD for a couple of weeks. I liked what I knew.<br /><br />Being accustomed to the 7506 when I started to work with the 7509HD, in a rather fundamental way I didn't like them very much. My experience is that most speakers / headphones encountered for the first time have problems. I like what I know. I found the 7509HD a touch \\"wooden\\" in the mid-range, but immediately recognized there great superiority in terms of precision. They 'imaged' everything much more precisely, much more clearly. I take this to somehow be related to greater manufacturing tolerances in the drivers, but it is hard to know.<br /><br />I have liked and enjoyed the 7506. Clean, comfortable, balanced, light, small ... just the ticket for much of my listening, but I am slowly moving to the 7509HD for more critical work. I have found that the 7506 has more high frequency 'beaming', ie, the high frequency response varies quite a lot depending on exactly where the headphone sits of the ear. The 7509HD appears to be somewhat less sensitive to the absolute positioning of the earphone. The 'closed' surround also provides a better seal, a plus in terms of extraneous noise production, but, as noted elsewhere, it makes them much warmer to wear for extended periods of time.<br /><br />My conclusion - 7506 a good standard alternative workhorse headphone; 7509HD, in the longer term, and for critical situations, simply superior.

0698116496|5.0|I introduced this book to our twins at around the age of 15 months, after seeing how much they enjoyed looking at gorillas in the zoo.  I just wanted something with pictures of gorillas to reinforce the word and hopefully keep their interest.      The book far surpassed my expectations, and is now one of the twins' most requested books.  The almost-all-pictures format is great for their age level.  The story was also simple enough for them to understand (to some degree) from the very first reading, but the pictures are also detailed enough that they like to look at them again and again, spotting more details each time.  My daughter loves to find the gorilla and the keys, while my son is currently obsessed with pointing out the little mouse and banana that are creeping through every page.  And both of them laugh like crazy when I act out the surprise of the zookeeper's wife when she finds the animals in her bedroom.

0307593495|4.0|Author Henning Mankell gets high marks for inventing a new method of \\"killing off\\" a series detective.  However, if you're over 50, or if you're particularly fond of Kurt Wallander, you may find this eleventh and last Kurt Wallander mystery to be somewhat depressing.  Much of the story is devoted to 60-year-old Kurt's reflections on aging and death, which are triggered by his granddaughter Klara's birth, his one true love Baiba's death, and his own worrisome memory blackouts that signal the inexorable onset of Alzheimer's disease.  Who would have imagined such an ending for Wallander?<br /><br />In this novel, Wallander investigates the totally unexpected disappearance of his daughter Linda's future father-in-law Hakan, a retired Swedish naval officer who commanded both submarines and surface vessels engaged in hunting enemy submarines. Wallander suspects that Hakan's disappearance could be related to a 1981 Cold War incident in which a Russian submarine ran aground in Swedish territorial waters, or possibly to the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme.  Wallander's strictly unofficial investigation turns up a number of memorable characters, including Linda's likely husband-to-be Hans, Hakan's best friend Sten, Hakan's wife Louise, and Hans' severely disabled sister Signe.  The story also adds to the reader's prior knowledge of Wallander's close relationships with Linda, and with fellow police officer Martinsson.  The plot of THE TROUBLED MAN is entertaining, and has a lot of twists.  However, I doubt that many readers will be surprised by the ending, or by the identity of the villain.<br /><br />My acquaintance with Kurt Wallander comes mostly from the BBC television series, which I enjoyed immensely (for a DVD, see [[ASIN:B001VLBDB2 Wallander: Sidetracked / Firewall / One Step Behind]]).  This was my first Kurt Wallander novel, and although it did not exactly bowl me over, it was good enough that I'll be going back to read at least some of the earlier books in the series (for the first Wallander, see [[ASIN:1400095824 The Pyramid: The First Wallander Cases]]). I rate THE TROUBLED MAN at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.the series (for the first Wallander, see [[ASIN:1400095824 The Pyramid: The First Wallander Cases]]).

0060557818|2.0|Well, after three weeks, and over half way finished, I finally gave this book to my husband to read and fill me in.  The writing style just put me off, completely.  There are so many paragraph-long sentences in this book I could hardly follow.  There is so much description of the surroundings that you sometimes forget what the story is about, yes the surrounding is a major part of the story, but there is only so much I can take and it eventually distracts from the plot.  Once into the book things become spoken of long before you get any knowledge of what they are.  Don't get me wrong, I like little tidbits here and there that make the puzzle all nuzzle together neatly at the end, but seriously, this was like taking a 1000 piece puzzle mixing it all up, dumping the picture reference and expecting you to put it together on your `skilz' alone.  Of course, by the end you can figure out where the final pieces go, but who wants to wait and struggle through that?!  I prefer to enjoy the whole book not just the ending when it all makes sense.      I did not connect with the characters my husband did, but only after reading the whole thing through.  Me, I like to connect straight away so I can invest in reading the rest of the story.      Through my husband I did get the story, which was really good.  I really liked the story, but the delivery was way too much work for me.  I like books with language that has flow and rhythm, not choppy, confusing and long run-on sentences. I like to re-read my favorite parts of a book, not re-read because I need to try and make sense of what's being said.  My husband agreed, the creative writing style just detracted from the story too much.  But, he did say I quit just when it was finally getting good, I just couldn't make myself read any more of it.  Too bad, I really wanted to love it!      2 stars because: It really was a good story, imaginative, unpredictable, suspenseful.  But, I just could not will myself to finish it.

I'm a huge fan of 'whodunnit' type of movies and I have to say there was absolutely no regret purchasing this movie because it's completely hilarious! It actually spoofs 'detectives' stories.. because you see, in majority if not all mystery movies and books, when we try to figure out the clues given and solve mystery and guessing the potential suspect, at the end they always give out theories and answers that were never given in the clues at the beginning! That's one point this movie is trying to point out... the ending is absolutely ridiculous and mind boggling, it's hilarious.    If you're a fan of 'whodunnit'/murder-mystery type of stories, I highly recommend this movie! Most memorable characters for me has got to be Sidney Wang and his number 3 adopted son, Willie. The others are awesome characters but somehow Sidney Wang and his son shines more for me. The dialogues are funny and great, and the plots are very interesting albeit a little confusing at times as too much things going on at the same time.    ~*~THE DVD~*~    The DVD has only and interview with Neil Simon, the creator of the movie, actors biography, and 2 trailers for the movie and the other movie by Neil called 'The Cheap Detective'.     Not much, but the interview with the creator was interesting enough, and it's better than nothing.

1400079144|4.0|Dan Brown manages to spin an intriguing tale, sprinkled with copious downloads of techy info on the subject matter. And I loved it right up to the end. Nice twists and turns with the plot, and quite an inspiring ending. I enjoyed his other books too and like that he is addressing these topics, getting people out of their comfort zones with their religious / political / societal views and beliefs and expanding that box of understanding. What a fun read, to explore all about the origins of our nation's capital and read more about the Masonic underpinnings and other symbolic stuff that is imbedded in everything American. Nice ending too. Could have been preachy but wasn't - maybe because I agree with him :)    However, I know D.C. well, and some of his location descriptions as he was traveling seemed a bit off - as though he wasn't quite native to the area. So getting an editor who is intimately familiar with the locale would have helped in a few instances to provide that local color / phraseology.    All in all, I highly recommend this read. And give it 4 1/2 stars.

My biggest issue with it is that it is to small (only a couple inches long, 3 inches max, 1.5 inches wide)and the shoelace came out.  I thought the shoe was going to be a little bigger, closer to the size of a normal shoe.  All in all it was a pretty good toy though because it still helped her learn to tie her shoes.

0316056863|3.0|I was so excited to get this book because i love autobiographies, especially from celebrities.  I was disappointed.  she skips around a lot.  She does not detail if she ever had to struggle as a comedian.  i wish she would have talked more about her life as a mother and a wife.  She talks a lot about her friends Amy Poehler and Alec Baldwin.  It almost seems like they paid her to be mentioned so many times in the book.  The shipping was quick and I can always rely on Amazon for great products.
B003HARV4S|5.0|From the very beginnings of cinema, especially with the turn-of-the-century movies of the great French magician, Georges Melies, film has been the ultimate illusion.  It's the amateur spectator who perceives the movies as a \\"documentation of reality.\\" Orson Welles, for one, knew better, saying \\"Film is a ribbon of dreams.\\"  And as the illusionist tells his agitated admirers out in the streets: \\"Everything you've seen is an illusion, a trick. Go home and don't be upset.\\"<br /><br />Accordingly, the first step toward the full appreciation of film is to see every great movie as a \\"construct\\" of the director, not as a \\"record of reality.\\"  The Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is the ideal spectator.  In his first confrontation with the Illusionist, he is allowed to see through Illusionist's illusion to the cause-effect logic behind the deception (identifying the behind-the-back hand that holds an object).  He, like the spectator, has seen a deception exposed, though something in us simultaneously wishes to believe in the magic.  As he tells the Illusionist (Edward Norton) during their final conversation, \\"I don't know whether you actually bring these people back from the 'other side' or are playing some great trick on us.  But I do know that you're special.\\" Alfred Hitchcock may not have put Gary Grant on the face of Mt. Rushmore, but we nonetheless believe whole-heartedly in the director's sleight of hand even as we appreciate and applaud his inventiveness.<br /><br />But then we reach the final scene of the film and not only witness but participate in an ever-crescendoing epiphany of joy, one which we share with the Chief Inspector, as he (along with the spectator) finally puts the pieces together: he figures out the illusion. It's ironic that many experienced filmgoers can become so savvy about special effects and complain that the \\"blood didn't look real,\\" etc., yet fail in this instance to be in step with let alone ahead of the Inspector.  Yet the film presents us not with \\"real\\" scenery and backgrounds but with painting after painting, fabrication after fabrication. We should have known all along (but the movie wouldn't have been better for it).<br /><br />No matter that the film is an adult \\"fairy tale\\" in which everything ends \\"happily ever after\\": we believe in it all the more strongly once we're able to discover that it is such a tale.  Or, to invoke a poet (Coleridge) from before the age of cinema, the film celebrates movies as the ultimate \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"<br /><br />This movie is as smart as they come--made for intelligent viewers who have had their fill of inferior formulaic and \\"family\\" film fare.  Not that the film's cleverness and sophistication should limit the size, or mitigate the pleasure, of its audience.  For a change, the spectator has an opportunity to have it both ways: to quote our poet once again, he can emerge a \\"wiser man\\"--but without being sadder.<br /><br />[The Blu-Ray version did not strike me as having stunning clarity lacking in the standard version.  But perhaps upon watching the film a 2nd time in Blu-Ray, the spectator who was \\"tricked\\" the first time, will be more alert to the fabrications employed in the filmmaking process.]scenery and backgrounds but with painting after painting, fabrication after fabrication.

B0000696I1|4.0|When their reporter friend April O'Neill (Paige Turco) is whisked off to parts unknown by a peculiar Japanese artifact she found at a flea market--and a 17th-Century Japanese warrior, Kenshin (Henry Hayashi), appears in her place--Michealangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Rafael naturally gear up to find her and get her back.  The artifact turns out to be a magic scepter which replaces people from the past with others of equivalent mass (hence Kenshin's advent) and carries the Turtles back to Japan in the year 1603, where they discover that an ambitious daimyo, Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono), who happens to be Kenshin's father, is attempting to crush a rebellion led by Mitsu (Vivian Wu), who happens to be Kenshin's beloved.  A British gunrunner (Stuart Wilson) eager to sell Norinaga his cargo of rifles and cannon makes things more complicated, since of course it's to his interest to make sure the war isn't settled.  And the Turtles have only 60 hours to accomplish their mission and return to their own time or they'll be \\"toast.\\"  It's fun to see the quartet in action in the land that invented their discipline, trying to adjust to a time long before their own (two of them even entertain thoughts of staying), and as always the quips fly thick and fast and the combat scenes are a fast-paced delight.  Elias Koteas returns as Casey Jones, though no explanation is offered for his absence in the last movie, and there's more than a hint that the Turtles will have a second adventure in the past too.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Excellent gameplay, graphics, and physics. Playing it on my Droid Charge, 1 player or 2 player no problem. Great use of multi-touch capabilities. Only option I wish it had would be to change table graphics mid-game or a \\"random\\" option to change table designs for each game or after each goal. Would probably be awesome on the right tablet.
0670022411|4.0|I really liked this book. Too bad she ripped off Twilight. The story in Discovery of Witches is so good, it doesn't need Twilight scenes at all. I wonder why they were included? Examples: 1. vampire climbs in open window and watches girl while she sleeps 2. girl is not so sure she likes the idea of marriage 3. vampire wants to wait to have sex 4. vampire hunts deer to preserve moral sensibilities 5. vampire is ice cold (if a vampire isn't warm blooded, wouldn't it be like a reptile and just take on the temperature around it? I think it's Meyer rip-off).    I'd give this book 5 stars if she wasn't so obviously on the Twilight coattails. It's even sadder because this story did not need to have any similarity at all to the Twilight series. The rest of the story is really interesting and ends on a cliffhanger, so presumably she is going to write more.     And it's also kind of reminiscent of Diana Gabaldon's series...
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Now, here's a real puzzle for you all you film buffs out there: the sentence above is actually a very cleverly disguised acronym. To unscramble the puzzle and discover what I really thought of this film, firstly take the first letter of the first word and put it on page three of any book of your choosing. Secondly, take the first letter of the second word and stick it up the bum of one of the scriptwriters. Thirdly, take the first letter of the third and fourth words and burn them - preferably inside the nostril of the dialect coaches.   But I digress: I have been attacked by some forthright readers of my critiques for not really writing reviews of those films I despise. Apart from the fact that I can do what I want within the confines of my own Amazon account, my only response is that I can't be bothered reviewing films where the actors really can't be bothered plying their trade. This 'film' is a shining example.   It really is a laugh a minute - quite possibly the best comedy Polanski has ever directed. That he was a recipient of an award for this piece of celluloid garbage is as gob-smacking to me as Cantrell's and McGregor's accents.   It was all I could bear.
B0051QJ83S|3.0|I purchased this the first day of release but wanted to listen to it for a couple of weeks before I reviewed it.  My immediate reaction was that I was disappointed.  These songs weren't as catchy as her previous hits.  After continuing to listen, they really grew on me and while I still don't care for them quite as much as her earlier work, she does make some really interesting vocal and musical choices so for that, I think it deserves 3.5 stars.  My husband, who is a classic rock fan, loves it and thinks it deserves 4 stars.    My favorite song, by far, is \\"You and I.\\"
B003EYVXYQ|5.0|The sixth entry in Romero's Dead series is one of the best. It's one of the best because it contains three main ingredients that make a Romero Dead film spectacular: 1) a point, 2) humor, 3) gore.<br /><br />People are giving SURVIVAL horrible reviews because they want more of the same ol', same ol', and the thing about George Romero is he likes to do something different with each film he directs. He says it himself on the commentary and documentary that are included in the special features of this disc.<br /><br />And SURVIVAL is definitely different. The film is somewhat inspired by the Western film THE BIG COUNTRY, which was about two warring families. With that said, what Romero offers us is a zombie Western set in the present on an island off the coast of Delaware. There's humor just in that premise alone and people don't get it: a Western that is set on an island off the coast of Delaware?! That's about as far removed from the Old West as you can get.<br /><br />Even the characters on the island don't make sense, some have Irish accents, others Southern, while others have Northeastern accents. I'll admit, when I first saw it I was a little put off. I laughed, but I just thought it was okay. Then I saw it again, and I noticed a few things that I missed before. From there on the movie just grew on me. I love it now. The humor in it, some of it is intentional, some unintentional, is hilarious. But the film probably would not have worked without Alan van Sprang and Kenneth Walsh, who play \\"Nicotine\\" Crockett and Patrick O'Flynn, respectively. Every scene these guys are in is entertaining and it's even better when they share the screen, Mr. Sprang is great as the tough guy and Mr. Walsh is a comedic genius as the wisecracking Irishman looking to kill any of the walking dead.<br /><br />If there is anything wrong with this movie, it's the zombies. They are just not scary at all. For me, DAY OF THE DEAD holds the title for scariest zombies in a Romero film. But don'tlet that stop you from watching this movie. I know you're going to say, \\"But the zombies are the most important thing about a zombie movie,\\" but that's not true. It's the people and their fight for survival that's most important. George Romero knows what he's doing and he's done it again.<br /><br />Side note: there is also a fantastic documentary included with the Ultimate Edition that is almost as long as the movie itself, and it takes the viewer through the whole production process and first screenings of the movie.<br /><br />I will guarantee that SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD develops a cult following in the years to come. The fans will come around to appreciate Crockett, O'Flynn, and the rest of the gang.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I agree with some of the others reviewers assessments about the battery pack. It did not properly sit in the mouse. Besides the fact that there are no written instructions on how to put the pack in, how to charge or any other directions. I think the idea is sound, but some of the bugs need to be worked out.

0670022411|3.0|It has been approximately a month now since I finished reading \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" by Deborah Harkness, and I am still trying to fully wrap my mind (and fingers) around what I would like to say about this novel.    Most importantly, I suppose, would be to point out that \\"Witches\\" feels like two novels jam-packed into one.  In the first portion of the novel, we are introduced to Dr. Diana Bishop, an intelligent, uniquely independent heroine.  Feminists may rejoice!  This first half of the book is monumentally exciting to devour: it's unique; intelligent; fun and flirty; and it offers an adult perspective on subject matter that has recently been left largely in the hands of teens.  Unfortunately, there is a definite divide in the literature.  As the plot moves the characters away from Oxford, Harkness seemingly loses her grasp on her sassy heroine- Diana suddenly devolves into a helpless, quivering, predictabley useless female character.  Consequently, it is as the relationship evolves between Diana and her love interest, the sexy vampire Matthew Clairmont, that the female character takes this predictable nosedive into overall helplessness.  Are we left to believe that the entire purpose of Harkness tale is simply to remind us that, often times, loves makes us stupid?  I have a problem believing this, and so I ask where is the strong, intelligent woman who held her own in the beginning of this adventure?  In the latter pages of \\"Witches\\", this woman evaporates into a ghost of her former self (pun intended).    This is truly my greatest qualm with \\"Witches\\": it starts strong and slowly dies off.  For a book that is nearly 600 pages, that is not a particularly good thing, either.  I am, however, anxious to read the upcoming sequel.  While I fault the development of Bishop's character and the pacing of this particular novel, I definitely believe that Deborah Harkness is going to become a pivotal name in modern literature- a force to be reckoned with (forgive the additional pun).  She writes wonderfully, fantastically, so that we become so engrossed in her scenes that we, as readers, barely even stop to consider that we are no longer questioning the legitimacy of the paranormal.  As Harkness shows in the first portions of \\"Witches\\", she truly does possess the ability to weave an incredibly unique and intelligent tale.  Now it's simply a waiting game to see what Deborah will decide to do with her powers . . . . .
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|First, I'd like to state that I agree with all the praises, I have read from other reviewers about this amazing album. What else would you expect from this 11 member ensemble of musicians, packed full of amazing talent? Some of these band members have a previous connection, to either the Derek Trucks Band, The Susan Tedeschi Band, &/or the Allman Brothers Band. Some members are just unique to this band only. However, all are very talented performers. Both Derek & Oteil are current members of the Allman Brothers Band. My favorite song is \\"Midnight in Harlem\\", it gives me \\"goose bumps\\", and I don't get \\"goose bumps\\" very easily. Susan sings this great song to perfection. Mike Mattison was the main writer of this great song. Susan's vocals along with Derek's guitar playing & the wonderful music, and background singing from the other musicans just \\"take me away\\". I love this album.  I love Susan's vocals, however, maybe it would have been a little better, if Mike Mattison had sung, or co-sung, some of the lead vocals. He is a great vocalist also.    I would like to add, that this band is on Eric Clapton's 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD set. On that dvd (disc 2) they perform \\"Midnight in Harlem\\", \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Space Captain\\", also they collaborate with some of the other artists on the dvd. Also, if you're lucky enought to have the 3rd dvd special edition, you also get the song, \\"Love Has Something Else to Say\\". I just thought that would be helpful. Thanks!!!!!

B000VSAEYI|3.0|This swimming/wading pool is great for toddlers who like to run in and out of a pool rather than staying in a deeper pool for longer. The colors are bright and the blow-up toys are fun and appropriate. And the size is great for several toddlers. Two problems: First, the sliding board really doesn't work well. Kids just can't slide well on it (my two toddler twins are 2 years old and about 24 and a half pounds). Second, the pool tends to leak after a fairly short period of time of use. We've had the pool for a couple of months and it has a slow leak. We have to pump it up every day and we've not been able to locate the leak in order to patch it. An additional minor issue is that the cute palm tree does not stand up very well, even when the pool is adequately inflated. So, on the whole, it's a cute and functional pool for toddlers, but the quality could be better. Probably will only get a few months use out of it. But it was only about $40.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I love this movie... I was exacted when they came out with Marines fighting aliens instead of People trying to survive... Really enjoyed the movie... It a great Geek/Nerd movie...
0316098329|1.0|When you live to read and a book like \\"Room\\" comes along, you absolutely jump onto the bandwagon!  Unfortunately, I am here to tell you that the hype is decidedly without warrant: this is a poorly-written experiment in literary form.  That's it.  The plot may be unique, but once the entire mystery behind the title is given away the story falls entirely flat.  This is just another weepy, depressing drama about two poorly developed characters struggling to survive in the big, bad world.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Comparison blurb: I decided to buy this knife after hours upon hours of researching the best and most inexpensive survival knives. Those in my price range included 3 contenders, the Gerber LMF 2, the SOG field pup, and the bk-2. I finally decided that:    The LMF 2 just wouldn't hold up the way I need a knife to in a survival situation. Issues with the handle breaking from light batoning and the partially serrated blade meant it was more suited to tactical situations, not field survival.     The field pup seems like a good, solid knife, however, the blade looked shorter and thinner than the other contenders, and seeing as I already have a perfectly good skinning knife, (a Schrade 150T) as well as several decent folders, I didn't need a knife for delicate work.    I finally was able to see the bk2 in person, and I was immediately sold. I ordered it online that day (120$ in the store, ridiculous.) and I couldn't be happier with my choice.    Brass tacks: This is a great knife. It has a few minor drawbacks, but the thing to remember is that it is perfectly basic. With a little ingenuity, the knife and sheath can be modified easily so that it is the perfect brush tool. The blade is sharp, with a shaving edge out of the box, and it just works. I would especially recommend this knife to someone who is new to survival knives, due to the insanely low price and exceptional build quality.    P.S. I have a feeling the issues with the sheath's plastic retention piece probably came out of the 1st generation of this knife. Pretty sure they only make the 2nd gen now. Anyway, I can swing this thing around with paracord tied to the tip and the knife does NOT come out. In fact, it actually HURTS my thumb when using the thumb ramp to pull the knife out. This may wear down over time, but until then I don't have any problems with retention whatsoever. I don't even use the nylon strap. (And considering how the knife weighs a whole pound, I think I'll notice if it comes out of the sheathon accident.)
B004WJRF6C|4.0|McCartney was a precious surprise back in 1970 with it's original release. As with the rest of the 'Beatles', alot of these songs come from the 'White Album' sessions. I can't imagine how much material was actually written during that time in 68. This time around with 'McCartney' nothing's changed short of the remastering, nice! Bonus material is always a plus when it comes from a Beatle. For anyones interest, it took America 20 years to catch up to this one 'McCartney\\". Check the Adult Comtemporary charts through the 90's and you'll see McCartney showed up in the top 100 for quite a few years before finally falling off into obscurity again.<br />This is a lovely album from Paul. The facts all state Linda literally had to peel Paul off the couch and away from the bottle in the depressive state he was in wacthing his bandmates (The Beatle) colapse. She really was apart of Paul. No one just wanted to admit it. Buy without a doubt...

B0036EH3WK|1.0|Save your shekels.  LOST is a terribly creative, fun, engaging show.  But it's also one that goes nowhere interesting ultimately.  Five seasons of build-up, and they say at the end, \\"IT'S MAGIC!\\"    Do not buy this crap.  Damon Lindelof is a hack.  Carlton Cuse is worse than that.  J.J.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|I must say that I have had little hope for the X-men series for some time now. I liked the first two X-men and I even (I know I know) kind of liked the third one. But the Wolverine movie was just awful....and by awful I mean the worst Marvel movie I've seen. The origins movie I was looking forward to the most was the rumored Magneto movie. Then I heard that one was being canned for some stupid X-Men movie called First Class *yawn*. Then I had to suffer through the 2 Iron Man movies. Norton's version of the Hulk wasn't bad and Thor was actually pretty good (I know the avengers movies are from a different studio yes yes).<br /><br />Anyways...I didn't have high hopes for this film. So when I went to the movies I went in expecting this wasn't going to be much. Man was I wrong. James McAvoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender(Magneto), Kevin Bacon (Shaw), Jennifer Lawrence (Raven/Mystique), January Jones (Frost), and Nicholaus Hoult (Beast) all played amazing parts and their acting was near perfection.<br /><br />Basically the story is about the coming of age of two very strong Mutants, Xavier and Magneto. Magneto's story starts off in the nazi concentration camps as a tortured young Jew where one of the officers (Shaw) discovers his abilities and takes him in to use him as his own personal weapon. Xavier lives an upper class life where he befriends a shapeshifting young girl (Mystique) and they grow up together much like brother and sister. Their paths cross years later in early adulthood where Xavier and Raven/Mystique are helping the CIA track and take down Shaw for trying to start World War 3 and Magneto is trying to get revenge on Shaw for murdering his family and torturing him for many years. Xavier and Magneto end up working together, recruiting other mutants, and trying to stop world war 3 before it starts.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor. If you have lost faith in the X-men movies go watch this. You'll thank yourself and look forward to the future X-men movies
014241543X|3.0|\\"If I Stay\\" is a well-written, terribly emotional tale that, while it ends predictably, is a beautiful read.  As an adult, I had expected little of the novel to appeal to me, and yet I found myself shedding many tears and hugging a box of Kleenex as I took the journey that is this wonderful little novel.  Perfect for a mother-daughter read, \\"If I Stay\\" will raise many discussions about life and what it means to truly \\"live\\".        (As an aside for parents and teens, I would suggest this novel for mature teens who can handle intense discussions of death.  \\"Mature\\" does not have to mean elder teens, but rather those that can handle the emotional impact that is made by a novel about a girl facing the very real possibility of her own death and the loss of her entire family.  It's a harrowing topic that is not appropriate for all readers.)
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Tried it on an Iconia A500. The graphics look ok and the physics seem fine, but the hockey &quot;stick&quot; lags tremendously which defeats the purpose of this game. It's really difficult to maneuver around and the game gets frustrating fast. I'll keep it installed in case of future updates, but right now it is unplayable on my tablet.

However, I am more interested on the monochrome settings to accomplish the coloring.      I understand that Bowhaus developed his printing program to get that special monchrome look for him to use and that he uses a matte paper.  I have wasted countless sheets of Museo Silver Rag trying to duplicate the monchrome look.  If you are into B&W prints, Bowhaus has a great program that I use on my Epson R2400.

B004VUP8LG|4.0|Finally, a new Morbid Angel record! And with David Vincent! But is it any good? ... well I liked it. It appears many people really dislike this album for many reasons I agree and disagree with. I'll cover that later, now how about a track-by-track? Yes:    Omni Potens: Aw man, this track totally has a classic Morbid Angel cheese factor about it. Keyboard orchestrations and a David Vincent choir, it's a sweet intro, reminds me personally of an old Warhammer computer game.    Too Extreme!: Yes, lame title, this album is filled with them. This song definitely warns you right off that this is a much different Morbid Angel album. With techno influences and wail guitar in the background, it's starts out a fun track, but it's \\"pounding rhythm\\" really gets annoying after the first three minutes, and it's a six minute track. Vincent even says \\"Pounding pounding!\\" at one point, yeah, no crap. I usually skip this track. This song is three minutes too long and gets really tired quick, so this song is a miss for me.    Existo Vulgoré: Here we go! The first sign on the album of some classic Morbid Angel vibe! Blast beats, Vincent's trademark growls, Trey's signature guitar solos. Great riffs, great chorus, great song!    Blades for Baal: Another rocking track. Vincent's vocals sound particularly guttural on this song. Blades for Baal sounds like it would fit perfectly on Covenant, definitely a track old-school Morbid Angel fans need to hear. Morbid Angel display here that they can still release some genuinely awesome Death Metal.    I Am Morbid: Another goofy title, but another awesome song. The best way I can describe this song would be Where the Slime Live mixed with new Slayer. This is probably my favorite on this record, it's got a cool vibe with a crowd chanting \\"Morbid!\\" under this sludgy call-back to Domination and also features a fantastic pre-chorus. This is the song that sold the album for me.    10 More Dead: Well what can I say? Four cool tunes in a row. Like the previous tracks, this one sounds like something previously from their catalog (Heretic to be specific), but with David Vincent helming the vocals, of course. The lyrics are a little laughable here, though, the riffs are very rockin' and features more classic Azagthoth guitar solo work.    Destrutos Vs. the Earth / Attack: Ha! Here's a song I though I'd be scratching my head at, and I wasn't that far off, but it's in a good way. This song is a bit more techno influenced, but it's fun! If's obviously suppose to be a bit tongue-in-cheek... I mean, just look at the subject matter! If you don't take it too seriously as well you may end up getting a kick out of it, too.    Nevermore: Back to a more classic Morbid Angel sounding song, most people have heard this song by now having been played live over the past several years, but it's even better on the album. More, blast beats, more Trey solos, some Morbid Angel tremolo picking riffs, but it's got a different vibe from previous song and doesn't really sound like something from a previous release.    Beauty Meets Beast: It's at this point I started to wonder why people hate this album... this is the seventh song on the album that sounds worthy of being in the Morbid Angel catalog. It's a great Death Metal song like most of the previous songs, and like the previous songs it presents a much different vibe. This one has great lyrics and a glorious bridge/solo section.    Radikult: Yeah, this is the one that even people who like the album tend to hate. This isn't very Death Metal at all, sounds like a mix between Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson. The lyrics are a bit weird too, and are very un-like Morbid Angel, dealing with cults and radicals (btw, the opening lyrics are \\"killer cult\\" not \\"Kill-a-cop\\", common misheard lyrics) easily some of the weaker lyrics on the record. Despite this, I dig the track. Vincent sings it well, I dig the industrial influences, it's got a pretty sweet solo section, and the outro is quite awesome and atmospheric, very reminiscent of Omni Potens. I don't expect many to agree with me on this one, those who dislike the industrial music song are definitely not gonna like this one, and knowing that it came from Morbid Angel are gonna make them like it even less.    Profundis - Mea Culpa: This outro track I found to be pretty weak. Very electronic and it seems to be all over the place, a bit of a mess if you ask me. There's just nothing really going on for this track and is a quite weak end for the album.    So, final verdict, 9 great/good tracks, 2 misses. I really think people are making this album out to be worse than it actually is, there are alot of great Death Metal tracks on here that are being overshadowed by the experimental songs that most people did not want to hear on a Morbid Angel record. But I think a Morbid Angel fan with open mind may find a lot here to enjoy. I will admit that this wasn't the album I was hoping for as the first under in the second David Vincent-era of Morbid Angel. Although I really like this record, I hope their 'J' album is a more 'full-blooded' Death Metal release.

1594202249|5.0|After reading \\"Vineland\\" and enjoying his wacky characters I had to read this one. It is great! Funny and because the people are so \\"spaced\\" out in the 70's it really sounds true to character. The sort-of-P.I. has some great lines and experiences...this will keep you reading to see what happens next. Takes place at the beach in southern california, on the many freeways/roads that are familiar to someone who lived through that time period. Good for a rainy night's reading or for a hot summer afternoon.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|this game is an awesome timewaster and is loads of fun to play. the interface is easy to use and the game is easy to learn how to play. I was lucky to purchase this when it was offered free but I feel it is worth the 1.50 price tag.
B000BT97AO|2.0|MirrorMask is a lukewarm offering from the Jim Henson Company that suffers from uneven scripting, bizarre visuals with no sense of intrinsic logic, barely audible dialogue, a jarring score, dark and muddy gels, and an over-reliance on computer graphics. The movie had a great cast and some potential, but it's about as watchable as a computer game. If Jim Henson had been alive to make this, he would never have substituted puppetry--an art that he kept alive for years--with substandard CGI effects.     Lacking in tight plotting, sensical narration and fantastical charm, and far too computerized for its own good, MirrorMask is a somewhat entertaining psychological fantasy story featuring fun characters, a plucky heroine, and interesting--albeit muddy and half baked--scenery. This film has some strong points to recommend it. The subtlety of yesteryear is not one of them.     Rumor has it the Jim Henson company noticed Dark Crystal and Labyrinth DVD's flying off the shelves, and in an effort to milk the cash cow for all it was worth, cooked up a movie LIKE those films instead of a sequel that may or may not have gone wrong. Then they roped Neil Gaiman into writing the script, which he set about doing by watching an hours-long uncut version of Labyrinth (lucky man). The result is a movie about an adolescent girl with family issues who journeys through a surreal fantasy realm of her own invention to save the life of a family member. Sound familiar?     The premise is hardly new, and the queens of darkness and light obviously symbolize aspects of Helena's mother. I saw something very similar to this in a cartoon called \\"Oyayubi Hime\\" a.k.a. Japanese Thumbelina, in which the heroine encounters a good and evil witch in a dream land before returning to the real world and her mother. MirrorMask is not a bad idea by any means, but it's a definite retread of better films that had more complex things to say about growing up.     Consider Labyrinth. Are we to view it as a literal adventure, a dream, or Sarah's way of retreating into her mind to deal with her problems? On the surface it appears that Sarah's adventure actually happened, if it wasn't for the toys scattered throughout her room. They assume lifelike stature and importance inside the labyrinth, particularly the figurine on her desk that resembles the Goblin King, making us question just how real the rest of the story is, and what it would show us of Sarah's subconscious if she had invented it. Is Labyrinth just a simple story about a girl's transition from childhood to adulthood and the learning of responsibility? Is it about her distrust of sexuality? Or could there be a darker subtext buried in the film: victimization by an older man and the search for lost innocence, symbolized by the missing baby? Many interpretations are possible.     By contrast, MirrorMask spoon feeds us every maternal symbol as if we couldn't see it coming. Helena's fantasy world directly reflects the real world, and the symbols she encounters (the light queen in an enchanted sleep is her mother in the hospital) make it much more obvious that it's a dream fueled by her worries over her mother. By focusing exclusively on the mother-daughter issue (which Sarah also had), MirrorMask is too confined, too derivative in terms of plot, and I would say too tame. It's essentially Labyrinth-lite without the kinky weirdness, which renders it more simplistic and far less interesting. Where's Bowie when you need him?
B0039W1J0Q|4.0|First: Here is the man himself explaining track by track an album that is getting mixed reception.    I have two PG albums, the two that some would argue that \\"matter\\" So and Us.  I have heard them casually but I am by no means a die hard.    My GF (a die hard) took me to see hm on the current orchestra tour.  And I was floored.  All the sparsity let the lyrics shine on the covers and on his own work.  So this had me scrambling for the music didn't have I cried three times at the show, if that tells you anything and I almost never cry.    My guess is that with this album some people will want the Sledgehammer and will not like this work at all.  Some will be perplexed and some will love it as an example of true artistry and/or experimentation.    Some will complain that it is too soundtracky:  What is wrong with that many good songs have come from soundtracks?    My personal feeling is it is quite good given how many other aging rockers have gone the orchestral route and failed (I'm looking at you Sting).  Sure it may sound schmaltzy is some areas but for me anyway it never sounded gimmicky (oh look I used to rock with drums and horns but now I'm all mellow and introspective or like Justin Bieber's \\"acoustic album\\").  It sounds sincere throughout.    I think having seen him do many of these songs live I am jaded. I think since he's been on tour he's had more time to be with the songs and the orchestra and that helped him in the live setting perform them better.  Though Book of Love made me cry even when I was just singing it to myself (sad I know).    But despite all that you cannot argue the fact there is some damn fine songwriting present on this album.    Now what I would really like is for him to release a CD of the show he did on Friday at The Greek that was bloody awesome. One of the top ten shows I've ever seen.
B004518W9G|1.0|The product will attempt to sync to the car, and even gives the audible signals indicating it has found the high and low RPM levels. It will then MAYBE work for a minute or two.  It will then lose track and either sit at an idle, or get stuck on the highest RPM.  The built in exhaust pops sound like nothing more than static on the radio.     I am extremely disappointed in the product.    Even as the novelty that it is, it fails miserably.    I would NOT recommend this product to anybody.

0061743526|5.0|I was eleven years old the first time I read this book. Harper Lee does a beautiful job portraying the impact society has on children. In this case she examines the social impact of racism. There have been many novels about the dynamics of race in America. However, few if any meet the \\"gold standard\\" of 'Mockingbird'. This book has endured because the ramifications of racism are complex, disturbing, and seemingly perpetual.   - Cathy Clay author of Agatta
B0007KLH1Y|2.0|I was very excited about these based on the reviews, but forget that and realize that they are simply flat pieces of wood all cut to the same dimensions. They are very thin, so even though the children had fun for a day or two stacking them, they do not resemble any actual building materials I have ever seen. This makes it difficult to do anything useful with them, and not particularly educational unless your child is going to build Dr. Seuss houses when they grow up. If shaped like bricks, they'd be far more enjoyable and practical.    Our creative and smart 7-yo and 3-yo have not touched them in months after three days of stacking them and trying hard to balance them on their thin sides. So in that sense they are educational because my children learned what shapes aren't great for building with.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is easily the best thing that ever happened to television. If you disagree, then just throw out every television you own. In fact, go to the nearest electronic retailer, buy a television, and then throw it out.  This show is amazing, and just looks better on Blu-Ray. (Arguably Brown-Ray would be better)  Seriously, if you don't like this show, then there is something wrong with you.
B001L1C46A|5.0|Having been disappointed when the box set did not come out with the SACD as advertised, I finally decided to get this on SACD, as a Japanese import. For those of you who've heard the 5.1 DTS version in the box set, let me be clear. There is nothing wrong with the DTS version.<br /><br />But folks, there is no comparison between that version and the SACD. This is The Lamb as it was meant to be heard. Utterly dynamic, almost effortless on the ears, just pure music. The surround mix is tasteful, and every instrument reveals itself as never before. This is especially true of the backing vocals by both Gabriel and Collins. Details are audible that were previously lost in the wash.<br /><br />For lovers of this recording, despite not being offered domestically, this is worth every penny. An especially nice touch, with a nod to the good old days of lp's, each disc comes in a plastic wrap. Nice.<br /><br />If you cannot play SACD with a great 5.1 system, don't bother. If you can, don't wait. This is the only version of this I'll ever play.
0316069353|5.0|I never thought mortgage fraud would be such a page turner. The hero of the Lincoln Lawyer rides again to defend an alleged murderer who was the target of a foreclosure. The last half of the book I could not put down and the ending was a shock.
B004UXUT7C|3.0|A young man in high school develops his first relationship, deals with bullies, and tries to save his parents marriage. The first part of this film was very engaging. I found the segment with the girlfriend interesting, and I was intrigued by how the relationship was developing, and the changes that would result in his school and family surroundings. The movie then goes into part II, when he is trying to prevent the possible dissolution of his parents' marriage. This section I found a little dull, but not so much that it ruins the entire movie. It picks up again when the girlfriend becomes the focus. A modest recommendation for a film that is solid in two-thirds of its running time.

B004ZH66XO|2.0|There are somethings I really don't like about this game: -When you use either of the control methods, there is a very decent chance you are going to block the spot you are headed to with your finger.  -You have to back out and reenter about 5 screens to check how many coins you have. Seems like that wood be something important you would put on the pause screen.  -Force closes when you touch the continue button while the level is loading.  -The icon for it didn't install on my Galaxy Tab.

B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Remember when Jeff Beck briefly hooked up again with Rod Stewart on \\"People Get Ready\\"?  Well that effect is again felt when a strong Blues singer like Susan Tedeschi gets enhanced by her better guitar playing husband - Derek Trucks.  Yes it is a Susan Tedeschi album.  Derek's pronounced  solos makes this release Tedeschi best to date. These are new songs instead of rehashing old covers like on many of her previous recordings.  Only a couple slips bring \\"Revelator\\" down a notch.  First, there are too many ballads. Also on  the last part of CD, the songs drag in some slow interludes that go nowhere.  Reduce the length from sixty minutes to about fifty and it would a dandy.  Still there's plenty of material that outweigh the minor flaws.  The variety brings back memories of 1970's Bonnie Raitt, Duane Allman's \\"Little Martha\\" and Gregg Allman's solo recordings using horns.  On the next future project  please do us a favor and add a lot more bite like on the \\"Crossroads\\" DVD.  A remake of the whole \\"Layla\\" album using special guests - Eric Clapton, Gregg Allman and Steve Winwood\\" would make for a nice tribute.  Until then proceed if you like this  husband-wife team.  Contemprorary Blues needed a shot in the arm.  They deliver.  So does the band.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Having read some of the reviews outlining faulty or broken parts I was a little wary of buying this. I was reassured by reading the excellent customer service responses from the company and so decided to go ahead and order. I own the original Perplexus and the UK \\"rip-off\\" the Addictaball, and have had hours of fun with both. The Addictaball is almost the same as the original Perplexus with a couple of differences. First, the Addictaball seems to be less well-made (it feels very flimsy and many of the new parts look like they were stuck onto the original model without much care for how it looked). Second, the Addictaball is a little more tricky than the original Perplexus, mainly due to the new chutes, steps, and ladders added on.     Perplexus Epic is easily the best version yet. It is considerably more complex than the original Perplexus, and much better to look at than the Addictaball. I would go so far as to say that it is rather beautiful. The ball itself is a little larger than the previous version, and the model within fills every inch perfectly. No space is wasted. No matter how you tilt it, it looks like a 3D rendering of an Escher painting. My toy arrived in great shape this morning. No loose or broken parts, or unwanted screws sticking out. I have only been able to get up to level 22 so far, but I'm working on it! Highly recommended.

0553573403|2.0|I was really, really looking forward to this series after hearing all the hype about it for years. And I agree with a lot of other reviewers that it was well written and interesting. The two stars are not for lack of an interesting plot or bad characterization. Indeed, the characters are compelling...which is part of the problem. I enjoyed the \\"no one is safe\\" feeling--for a while. But, as another reviewer said, if I can't find a character to root for, I really have no reason to keep reading. The plot is interesting, but if I'm not invested in the characters that are involved in it, it falls flat for me. It's disheartening to get attached to a character and have them get killed, over and over. I think this series is one you either love or hate. What makes it great for some makes it agonizing for others. I know this series is probably more \\"realistic\\" than most high fantasy; the good guys sometimes die and don't always win...but quite honestly I read to get away from reality. If most fantasy series play it \\"too safe\\" with their characters, this one goes too far in the opposite direction.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is well worth watching. It's an interesting glimpse into the lives of the Royals in the modern era--a particularly dark chapter of the modern era, at that. All of the characters were memorable, even the bit players. The girls who played young Elizabeth and Margaret were realistically portrayed without being cloying. Bertie's transformation into George VI is allowed to develop with all the nuances of his changing private-to-public role and the \\"sticky wicket\\" situation of his brother's abdication and subsequent marriage to an American divorcee. It also seemed clear that King Edward's personal life was such a distraction for him that he really didn't have much of a handle on world events as they sped up, and that Bertie/George had a far better understanding of Hitler's war machine and Britain's role in addressing it. I guess I always thought the abdication-forced transition was much smoother, and that it didn't matter who was seated on the throne.  If the movie is accurate, though, it was a stroke of good fortune that the monarch ended up being George.<br /><br />I expected Bertie's relationship with Logue to be compelling, and it is.  Obviously the men had a high regard for each other aside from the fact that one was monarch and the other gave the king his voice.<br /><br />I was not prepared for how witty the script was--it's not just a straightforward treatment of sessions with a speech therapist. The audience really comes to like the King and Logue, and to root for their success.<br /><br />It wasn't easy being Bertie--there's mention of his brother John, who died at the age of 13 from an epileptic seizure.  John's story was one of the sadder royal tales--he was hidden away because he was mentally challenged, although by all accounts he was a kind, affectionate child. Several sources say that Bertie loved John, but the princes' lives were so structured and appearances were so important, John was removed from the public eye. But losing John was only one of the childhood traumas Bertie endured. Bertie's early life no doubt had a huge impact on his developing stammer.<br /><br />This is an excellent biopic,but make sure you watch the version that has not been edited to \\"clean up\\" the language.  The controversy forcing a PG rating because of a profanity is silliness that never should have happened. The controversial word, in the context of this film, is entirely appropriate.as Bertie endured. Bertie's early life no doubt had a huge impact on his developing stammer.

0767817710|5.0|The western is by definition a light genre designed as pure escapist entertainment. At first glance, this is just another typical specimen. Apart from the woman with the gun, everything else in the plot is one cliche after another: gunfight contest with lots corpses, old revenge burning with everlasting fire, relentlessly evil villain who terrorises a city, a brash young fellow under the illusion that he is the fastest on the West, a reverend who is ex-bandit. Yet, despite these grave shortcomings, I would rank this as the finest western after [[ASIN:B0000AUHPG Once Upon a Time in the West]] and [[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone]]. Why?     To begin with, the plot may be as hackneyed as they come, but it does have quite a few highly dramatic situations, and these are made the best of by a simply great cast. Gene Hackman fits perfectly into the role of the sadistic fellow who feeds on people's terror: a great actor who can convey menace very convincingly with but a glance or a word. Sharon Stone is, of course, quite hot but she is a fine actress nonetheless for that; hers is a convincing performance of the 'tough girl' who is not nearly as tough as she looks. Both Russell Crowe and the young Leo di Caprio were more or less completely unknown at the time, but both of them show here a most promising talent as the God-fearing priest-murderer and the incredibly boastful youngster, respectively; well over a decade later, both Russell and Leo have quite fine careers behind their backs, so I guess the fulfilled that promise. The duel between Harrod and Ace Hanlon, the scene in the bar in the beginning, the death of the Kid: there is hardly a scene in the whole movie which is without some merit indeed. And who can forget such a dialogue:     He: You're pretty!   She: You're not.   He: I need a woman!   She: You need a bath.     But the real star in the director Sam Raimi. Thanks to highly imaginative and effective way of directing, almost every scene in the movie is a minor masterpiece of film-making. Unusual visual angles, terrific close shots, quick changes, slow-motion, zoom: you name it: everything is used and put to the best use. Take, for instance, the first appearance of Herrod; this is what I call genius for directing. Or pretty much each of the numerous gunfights; none of them is less than memorable, nor are two of them alike. Also, the surreal yellowish lighting used during more or less the whole movie additionally makes it even more compelling, as if taking place on some other planet, or in a dream perhaps.     No, this is not the greatest western ever made. But it is one of the most unforgettable and one of the most entertaining all the same. It is a fine example how to make a great movie out of perfectly mediocre script - provided, of course, that you have fine cast and great director.

0684824906|5.0|This ingenious Lincoln political plan really worked for him, with his consummate political skills. Obama has mimicked Lincoln, with much less success (although Secretary of State Clinton was a brilliant choice and has risen to the occasion in her own right).  Probably the real difference between Lincoln and Obama is that the Lincoln Cabinet was dominated by real politicians and great patriots of substance, while Obama's Cabinet seems full of less illustrious types (with the exception of the aforementioned Clinton).  That Lincoln could corrale such giants of his age is a real testament to his skills, political and personal, and the author has brilliantly demonstrated that at length.  The hardbound copy of this book is well worth the difference in price from the paperback, since the pictures and typing are far more readable.  I thank the bookseller for its great quality and low price, and commend the book and the bookseller to all who love history told by a historian with great passion and compassion, creating a work of prose almost poetic in effect.
0062060554|5.0|Christine wakes up every morning not knowing were she is and who the man is next to her in bed. Every morning she learns anew that she's had an accident years ago and can only retain memories of one day. As soon as she goes to sleep, she forgets everything again.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to her husband Ben, she is in contact with a doctor, a neurologist, who is trying to help her improve her memory. He calls her every morning to tell her she has a journal hidden in her closet, which she reads and adds to. She also meets with the doctor every few days.<br /><br />Through the journal, she realises that she sometimes has memories from the past and by reading the journal each morning she learns about herself and her past. She discovers that there is something strange going on. Her husband doesn't seem to tell the truth about certain events. Is this just to protect her from learning about dramatic situations? Or is it so he himself doesn't have to keep telling her the same stories over again?<br /><br />Whilst this book starts off in a quiet way, eventually it turns into a thriller where Christine's life isn't safe.<br /><br />The book was very good, but not quite the thriller I expected. The thrilling element only started towards the end of the book. Early on, it was clear that some things didn't make sense, but they were easily explained away.<br /><br />The book is very well written and although the individual entries in the journal are a bit long (I wouldn't think she'd have the time to write that much on a day), they told me all I wanted to know and nothing more. In other words, it never became boring.<br /><br />A fast and good read, very believable. Only the end was a little too convenient for my taste.

0061726826|2.0|I read Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall and LOVED it so much that I immediately purchased Delirium and started reading.  Unfortunately, it falls flat.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book starts out very interesting and engaging.  Lauren Oliver is a great writer and this really shows in the first half of the book.  The two best friends, Hana and Lena, are both three-dimensional, believable and unique and I was interested in seeing where their story led.  Alex, the main male protagonist, is realistic (unlike many male leads in love stories) which may not inspire passionate obsession from a reader, but its refreshing to have a kind, intelligent, realistic male after a trend toward taciturn, moody, divinely gorgeous males I've found in other young adult novels.  However, somehow Peeta Mellark (of Hunger Games) managed to capture my attention and affection even though he is realistically kind, caring, thoughtful, and verbally engaging, and Alex never did.  Anyway, I digress.  Still, the story had three solid main characters and an interesting, if not wholly believable, premise.  And then, it foundered painfully during its second half.  The prose became extremely melodramatic and long-winded (it easily could have been shortened to 300 pages).  And we just spent too much time hearing about the profundity of love, entangled in lengthy descriptions of how glowing and beautiful the world appeared to Lena after she'd discovered love.  Don't get me wrong, love is great, but I think that the melodrama cheapened the love, making it unrealistic and boring.  I just wanted Lena to stop waxing poetic about love and the beauty of the world and get back to the story.    I need to focus or this review will become as long-winded and tedious as this novel.  Ultimately, I think this book suffered from two things: 1) the author became too obsessed with her own ability to write beautiful prose and to make a simile/metaphor out of everything and lost focus on the pacing of the actual story. 2) The common problem of the first book in a trilogy, in which the book feels like an incomplete set-up for the two books that will follow.  I think that the brilliance of the Hunger Games (book one) and all of the Harry Potter books was that each book had its own story arc that was fulfilling to the reader, even though there was still more story to read and unanswered questions to get to in the sequels.  For me, the story arc of Delirum was poorly developed and too many questions were left unanswered. A part of me wants answers to those questions, but not enough to endure the long-winded prose of two more books...I think I'll just end up reading the synopses of Pandemonium and Requiem on wikipedia...which means that this book failed, at least for me.
B004ZQRJH2|5.0|AMAZING!!!! definitely worth buying if your a true bad and evil fan you wont download this you will buy it!
0061726826|4.0|I just finished the book a few minutes ago and boy did I keep the pages turning. If you enjoyed her previous book, Before I Fall, you will enjoy Delirium. Oliver brings the characters alive so well you almost feel yourself being in the story. Feeling--this is a good way to describe the book and a central point of it's plot. I have a full range of emotions with how it ended but I would definitely read it again. I only did not give it 5 stars as I felt there could have been one more issue resolved in the end for me to feel content. All in all a great read if you enjoy books from Margaret Atwood, The Hunger Games Trilogy, and John Green.

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Sound quality is a bit better than the '93 remaster and the DCC Gold. A bit more punch and crispness. There are bonus tracks, though the quality of them is so-so. Studio tracks/demos not great but the live tracks are OK (if not period). Should be something better to put on here-what about the Unplugged tracks from this album? Packaging is very similar to Band on the Run from last year. Triple opening, booklet on left and 2 discs top loading on the right. Almost as thick as the BOTR deluxe 3 disc edition.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|this app is great fun.  no lag on evo 4g.  if ypu do have lag try turning off particle effects and it should run smoother on lower end phobes.  great app though.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Clean smooth graphics and loads of fun. Its exactly how its advertised: table hockey for your android. Lots of different tables to play on and no ads unlike the first version.<br /><br />I have not had issues with this version becoming laggy or slow nor did I have problems installing the program. If you have too many Apps on your phone or tablet or a ton of background apps running it will slow down this game. Deinstall some of the stuff you don't use or kill all the apps in your background. It will greatly improve your experience with the game.<br /><br />Why is it that tablet owners always have issues with every app made? Remember Apps are usually designed for a phone and not your overpriced tablet.
B000001FY9|3.0|i have always loved Bob Marley and am embarrassed to admit i had to update from a cassette to a CD just recently; not because i am that out of touch, but i couldn't find \\"Legend: Best of\\" that i had been trying to find forever.    the music is the same that i've listened to thousands of times, but i have to admit that the quality isn't what i was expecting.  in the middle of \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" there is this god awful high-pitched sound; it's not a screech, it's more of a tone that lasts just long enough to hurt a little bit.  once you get past that, it's all good.  i haven't noticed this on any other song.    not sure if i would recommend; \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" is my favorite song but i don't play it as often as i would like; the tone actually makes you cringe a bit.
B004WJREMW|5.0|Sound quality is a bit better than the '93 remaster. A bit more punch and crispness. You either like it or you don't. I happen to enjoy this one, and am also buying the deluxe 4 disc version.  There are many bonus tracks, though, so the price is right for you if you don't have it. Packaging is very similar to Band on the Run from last year. Triple opening, booklet on left and 2 discs top loading on the right. Almost as thick as the BOTR deluxe 3 disc edition.
B004RC8NUQ|2.0|After an hour I could not take the crass jokes and terrible acting.  Skip this one at all costs.

B00544L9EI|5.0|Finally some real hip hop to listen and get into. Em and Royce blaze this whole album from start to finish. It's good to know that true lyricists still have a place. This is hip hop not rap, if you want rap listen to the garbage on the radio.
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|Having recently spotted him on video from his Albert Hall gig, I've become a Joe Bonamassa fan and started surfing around his other material.  When I got to the Black Country Communion stuff, I nearly gagged.  I HATE Glenn Hughes' vocals.  He's a stereotype.  He exemplifies all the vocalists that I've disliked in metal/hard rock for the last... well, forever.    In the clips I've heard, Bonamassa's great, Bonham's great, and Hughes stinks.  I'll take a pass on this not-so-supergroup and stick to collecting Bonamassa's back catalog.
1400052181|3.0|...and I don't really understand the hype.  I read a lot of science related non-fiction and I give this book an average rating.  The history of cell culture was overly long and drawn out.  I found the Lacks family's personal story more compelling, which finally bubbled up in the second half of the story.  I have to say I found the management of the ethical issues somewhat disjointed, and I have thought of most of them long before I read this account.  It didn't offer anything new.
0937381888|5.0|Palmer writes in an easy style, and walks the first-time brewer through the basic steps.<br /><br />Advanced technical information about enzymes, water hardness, Temperature needs, and the like may seem intimidating, but they're handled well and appeal to the advanced brewer and geeks alike -- and the information helps ease the transition from new brewer to experienced all-grain mash-maker.<br /><br />Well done as instructional books go -- and very inexpensive compared to many other instructional/educational books.
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|Totally messed up on the Acer Iconia A500, both graphics and controls.  Will rate higher once this can be resolved.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just a couple of suggestions.  Make sure to take your measurements before you start. I didn't lose a lot of weight but lost several inches very quickly.  Also, if your goal is weight loss,, you'll need to diet as well. Take a day off between workouts if you're sore. The next workout you will have much more energy.  Have fun with it!
B0051BVQFG|2.0|This movie could have been much better if the film had been either written or edited so that there was a true beginning and ending. Instead, you're thrown into the battle without any background or scene setting, and at the end find yourself staring at the credits and saying, \\"That's it?\\" If this had been a movie with some heavy thoughts or weighty substance, and if I felt the director was trying to make an artistic statement by starting and stopping the movie like this, then I'd give the movie credit for that, but such is not the case. The script itself is weak and the characters poorly developed, so I can understand why someone said \\"cut it here at the beginning\\" (snip) \\"and here at the end\\" (snip) \\"and let's this story over with.\\" My advice: if you really must watch it, don't spend the extra $2 for the hi-def version, since that's just a prettier picture of a problem. I gave the movie 2 stars because I like science fiction, some of the action scenes were fun to watch, and there was at least some potential for it.
1400052181|5.0|It's hard to add much to the glowing reviews of this book, all of which I agree with. It was truly hard to put down, and first-time author Skloot is a real talent.<br /><br />I will add that the book reminded me (or told me for the first time, in some cases) about how slapdash our concepts of medical ethics were, well into the 1950s or even the 1960s. Protection for human subjects hardly existed. Although science advanced rapidly, many lines were crossed when it came to human experimentation. It's understandable that we now have necessary safeguards -- and of course, scientific knowledge continues to advance. It's interesting to note that many top scientists of the day thought research would come to a screeching halt if limits were placed on human experimentation and if informed consent were to be consistently required.
B000FC1MOQ|1.0|loved the book, loved the writing style and hope and the message it sent. i'm a former probation officer and usually dont like these types of books but the heart and soul that this book showed was overpowering. most of you critics are looking at all the negatives and not the message of life and overcoming addiction that it sends, shame on you and to oprah too! thank you james!
B00425S1H8|5.0|This product does exactly what it says.  I was able to connect my Uniden BC346XT Police Scanner to my laptop running Windows 7 64 bit, without a bit of trouble.  I just attached the cable to the laptop, put in the cd and loaded the drivers.  Then attached the scanner to the cable. That was it.  Worked perfect.
B004UHF51S|4.0|Jazz vocalist Michael Franks has a new CD (11 tracks) release titled 'Time Together' : it's a well crafted album (great vocals, melody, piano, saxophone & well produced material/music. Stand-out track is \\"Now That The Summer Is Over\\" : wonderful guitar, vocals & melody. This is my favourite track from this CD. The remaining 10 tracks are all great jazz tracks with no weak tracks to talk of : they are \\"One Day In St. Tropez\\" (great piano, vocals & melody), \\"Summer In New York\\" (wonderful saxophone on 'strange sounds'), \\"Mice\\", \\"Charlie Chan In Egypt\\" (a slow track with great piano, saxophone & vocals), \\"I'd Rather Be Happy Than Right\\" (great guitar & vocals), \\"Time Together\\" (a slow title track with great guitar pick-ups, piano & vocals), \\"Samba Blue\\", \\"My Heart Said Wow\\", \\"If I Could Make September Stay\\" & \\"Feather From An Angel\\" (a slow closing track with great piano/bass combination). On overall, the talented jazz vocalist Michael Franks is back with a well crafted CD release 'Time Together', a highly recommended CD listening.
0815411839|5.0|I just finished this book and I really loved it. Donald Spoto had a great way of writing it so I felt like I was really there and it was easy to follow. Not boring or tedious, as I feared a biography might be. It reads almost like a novel. Some of my favorite things about this book are that when someone is quoted, they are credited or sourced right in the text. He says who said what and usually who they said it to as well. Everything was very detailed, which helped to really set the scene. The author didn't take liberties or make assumptions, as I've seen in other materials about MM. Also, I could just feel it when I was reading that Spoto respected and admired MM. He makes her very human, and gives her credit where she deserves it, but still is truthful about her downfalls and flaws. Whereas, I'm reading another MM biography currently and it seems like the author goes out of her way to make Marilyn seem like a sad, scared, stupid woman. Spoto doesn't do that at all. And perhaps my favorite part of the book was how he ended it. Spoto doesn't buy into all of the conspiracy theories we've all heard. He carefully explains the events of Marilyn's death and the days following and explains why those theories are not and could not be true. So, if you want to read about how the Kennedys or the mob had a hand in Marilyn's death or that she was murdered, this book is not for you.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about Marilyn's life. It was a great read and I learned a lot and gained even more admiration for Marilyn.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs perfectly on my Driod X. Really fun game. Starts out like a cartoonish tower defense game, but has some more interactive levels. Just lots of fun.
B003VD23YO|1.0|I bought this version as it is the 'latest version' and after all of the chat about missing illustrations, I thought that the powers that be just might have rectified this version, but no, no illustrations.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I liked this book - could be because it hits close to home for me.  I like how we see this disease through Alice's eyes.  I was saddened at many parts of the books, but only because I couldn't imagine living my life with losing a sense of who I am.      Props to the author, I think she touched this subject just the right amount and told the story how it needed to be told.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I have had the free version for several months now and love it. i actually downloaded another (ugly) air hockey game because it had two player even though I totally prefer (beautiful) Glow Hockey.<br />So glad this was the free app today. it's one of my favorite games on my Incredible. my 10 &amp; 11 year old love to play this also and there's no fighting over who gets to play with my phone :-)<br />oh yeah... the themes are cute, esp. the doodle one
B004R9Q9UK|1.0|Yes, there are illustrations in this version, but from other, older, publications and they bear no relationship to the text.  Buyer beware!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch just arrived yesterday as an early Fathers Day gift from my wife and son. I own another Seiko auto watch and asked for this model as a more casual alternative for theme parks and days off. It is spot on with the time I set yesterday. I expect it'll change by a couple seconds here and there overall but seems aok so far. The build quality and materials used in its construction are durable and refined. From previous experience I know the Hardlex Crystal is near bullet-proof as far as scratch resistance.  If I had to pick one thing to improve, I would love to see the hands and markers hold there luminescence longer in the dark. Neither this nor the other model I own tend to stay bright for more than 10-15 minutes after sun exposure. It tends not to glow well at all with non-natural light exposure. I don't think it detracts much as I really don't need it at night and I will not knock a star off for it. The winding seems smooth and mostly quiet just as my other.  I love this like many other Seiko Auto watches and wish they had wider distribution in the states.  Quick update: After over 7 months of use I still love this watch. IT IS SUPER ACCURATE! You will need to occasionally wash the band with soap and warm water because it will get funky. I don't remove it, I just scrub it on the watch.
1439102724|5.0|I think this book was wonderful. I think it should be read with an open mind. I bought this book after reading about it and I definitely wasn't disappointed, I read 470 pages in 3 days, I couldn't put it down. I feel it is hard for me to put the book into words because there is so much in this book. I would highly recommend to anyone that this book is a must read. It has to be one of the best purchases I have ever read. I think this is one of Jodi's best!!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have a loss of hearing and listen to TV through headphones.  This amplifier considerably reduced the necessary TV volume for listening.  Will probably buy another soon as a backup/spare, or for travelling.
0470876417|5.0|Para mim, um dos melhores livros sobre Plano de Negócios.  Sem dúvida um livro de cabeceira para qualquer empreendedor ou profissionais que lidam com desenvolvimento de produtos.  Nota 10.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I think this is a great look at what life was like living in the GDR (German Democratic Republic) and constantly living in fear of the Stasi.  It is also a fabulous movie on human nature and how one can evolve from the dogma they were trained in (Stasi Officer) to becoming compassionate and realizing the real motivations behind the actions of the Stasi.<br /><br />This is not a true story, but a good story on how we live and have an effect on each other set in the GDR in the 80's.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Like most are saying, the paddle doesn't keep up with your finger, not even if u go really slow. and at times your finger does block the puck, but that doesn't seem 2b the dev fault, just the nature of the game. kind of like the real game, when the puck is blocked from your view because of your arm, i can't see anyway around that.<br /><br />i'm not a Big fan of games on my phone, i try the games that look ok when they are the free app of the day, but i rather have a useful app. i do get a couple from Amazon, but unfortunately, there seems 2b more games then anything else... that said, although i rate this app a little low because of the lag (gets pretty frustrating), i'm keeping it for now. it's a 2 player game, and maybe i'll use it with my kid here and there (IF we don't get to aggravated with the lag)
B000TGCR38|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  The plot, the pace and the acting was great.  While I am sure that there is a great deal of theatrical license involved, the feel of what it must have been like in Holland at that time seemed to be very well portrayed.<br /><br />I have watched this several times and always see something new in the story line as far as who the bad guys are and who the good guys are..I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />If you like movies with intrigue, about WWI and a little macabre and risque humor this is for you.
1558908323|2.0|Assuming that insects could grow to human proportions, which is physically impossible because of their respiratory system (or they would have done), this is a standard monster thriller.  That means that it is not hard scifi.  Of course, monster movies can be good, but their need at least a spark of originality or at least details that enable the viewers to suspend their disbelief.<br /><br />Some awful, unexplained things are happening, so the smart, tough, beautiful chick decides to investigate.  She finds the monster, but is it destroyed?  Tune for the sequel if it sells well enough.  This is fine as background, time-wasting filler, but nothing original comes out of this whatsoever.  Maybe I am getting old, but I thought this was a complete bore.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Hello,  I ordered the Silver Box Collection of the complete series on Blu-ray Disc on June 8th, and received it at my home on June 13th, 2011 (Free Super Saver Shipping). The Disc set was well packaged in the shipping container. I ordered my collection set during a \\"Gold Box\\" 1 day promotion from Amazon, so I got a fantastic price for the collection. Thanks Amazon for the heads up e-mail the day of the promotion. The \\"product description\\" and photo's at the Amazon web site/page matched 100% what was delivered to my home.    The \\"Silver Box\\" series does \\"not\\" include the Cylon action figure, nor does it come with a separate reference Disc sheet for each season. That info is printed on each season's discs' jackets'. I am currently reviewing each disc to be sure each one is OK.    My general impression with the \\"Silver Box\\" series is 5 stars. As for the packaging of the discs in their season by season jacket/cardboard container(s), it seems to me that I will need to find a different way to store these discs. The removal/return from the cardboard container and the opening/closing of the paper/plastic jacket that holds the discs, are not durable enough to stand up to a lot of use, even with care taken when doing such actions. For me this is \\"not\\" a deal breaker. I intend to purchase the 3 ring DVD Disc holder sheet-jackets that will go into a 3 ring binder notebook. I have done this with every TV series collection of DVDs that I own. I will cut out the \\"Disc Description Sheet\\" that is on the jacket of each season's set of discs, and mount it in the 3 ring notebook to index the collection of discs. I wrote this as a suggestion to an alternative way to store and maintain this collection. Otherwise, count on investing in individual Blu-ray Disc containers' for each Disc.    The only other comment I can add is to watch for another \\"Gold Box\\" deal of the day/week promo offered by Amazon with this set. It's an awesome price, and this was an awesome series--\\"So say we all\\".
B0001HAISG|5.0|As a fan of J.M. Barrie's book, I was very doubtful that this film would measure up to my very high standards of a Peter Pan adaptation.  Just this week I watched it for the first time.  For the first thirty minutes or so, I still wasn't convinced (being of the opinion that a movie can almost never come close to the book), but after I saw the Lost Boys for the first time and saw that they were PERFECT in every way, I began to change my mind!  And when I found that I was quoting the book ALONG with the movie, I was completely convinced.  I could hardly keep my seat when I saw the scene where Hook was questioning Peter (\\"Mineral?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Animal?\\" \\"Yes!\\") - it was even better than I had imagined in the book!      Jeremy Sumpter completely took my breath away in his performance as Peter.  Peter is such a slippery, elusive character - not one in a million actors could have played him even adequately.  And Sumpter went above and beyond \\"adequate\\"; he completely WAS Peter.  I have always imagined Peter as being a rather \\"changeable\\" boy - one moment he seems like he's 8, the next he seems like he's 14.  Sumpter embodied this perfectly: his wide-eyed, \\"little boy\\" excitement lit up the story one moment, and the next, he would grow sober and seem to be older and wiser.  Also, Jeremy's incredible portrayal of emotion just shone through every second of the film: you absolutely cannot listen to him laugh and not laugh along with him, and when his eyes fill up with tears, it seems as though the world were coming to an end.  Sumpter as Peter was one of the most amazing acting performances I have ever seen - he took Peter to a whole new level.    The other characters were also perfect!  Mr. and Mrs. Darling, Nana, John, Michael, the Lost Boys, Hook, Smee, even the crocodile - everything was amazing.  The sets were brilliant, and the music was indescribable!  (By the way, I HIGHLY recommend the soundtrack)  I was, however, very disappointed in Tinkerbell and Tigerlilly.  They werenot at all how I imagined them.  And a few slight things were changed (Marooner's rock was The Black Castle in the film, Hook ended up flying around a bit, and the ending was not so sad as the book) But I soon got over it - I watched the film two days in a row it was so good!  For die-hard Pan fans, watch the alternate ending!!  It was SO perfect; Peter's deep sorrow upon finding Wendy grown up was horribly sad in the book, and Jeremy Sumpter acted it beautifully.  I am not a person who cries easily when watching movies, and I didn't cry through the whole show (though at several parts my more soft-hearted sister cried), but this alternate ending brought me to tears.  It was that good.    Peter Pan the film was perfect in nearly every way.  I haven't been able to stop thinking/talking about it since I watched it!  It blew me away to Neverland in a way that I'd never experienced before, either in the book or in other film adaptations.  10 stars!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Six words, tree sentences: Buy it. Devour it. Love it.  And you will absolutely love it. I give you my word.    Beautiful Disaster is a heartwarming and heartbreaking, beautifully written, wonderfully told, passionate and often witty love story, that doesn't just explore the warm, sweet side of love, but also the complicated and messy side. I was so enthralled by it that I didn't want it to end.    I devoured every word of it, adored Abby and Travis (this two were truly a beautiful disaster), and I hope there will be more and more YA novels with 18 to 20 year old protagonists.    It was an amazing ride, full of great characters, exciting and sigh-worthy moments, drama, laughter, and countless emotions. Kudos to you, Jamie McGuire!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I am an avid soundtrack collector/listener, and have listened to plenty of soundtracks in my time, but I must say that this is my all-time favorite.  Almost as soon as I saw the movie in the theater, I bought the soundtrack - it's that good!  I've had it for over a year now, yet I still listen to this CD all the time; it's one I don't get tired of.    In my opinion, a soundtrack is raised from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\" if the composer sticks to a few distinct themes and varies them; John Powell has done just that in this incredible score.  Very distinct themes, incredible instruments (powerful drums, stirring strings, bagpipe, flute, horns).  Not only is the score well-put together, but it is emotionally powerful - \\"Romantic Flight\\" is unprecedented in its ability to \\"carry you away\\" while you listen.  I would try to list a few of my favorite tracks for you, but I'd end up listing all of them!  (As a bonus for me, a violin player, this score is great for playing-along by ear.  I've already picked up on half a dozen of the tracks and play along with the orchestra; it's great fun!)  Whether you've seen this movie or not, I can just about guarentee that any listener would love this soundtrack.  Two thumbs way up!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|very cool, sync with your amazon kindle account very easily.  highly recommend this app for any android user. get it
B000QCTNIW|4.0|I would have given this book five stars, except for the fact that chapter on psychoanalysis was based on speculation.  BTW, the author just happens to be a psychoanalyst.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I don't know why some electronics have a headphone connection or a way to hook up headphones but sometimes they just lack in volume. Well this Amp works good, there is a hum the louder you try to make it but it's great compared to just using your TV connection. I also had to buy an extra 3/4\\" adapter and everything works good. The only thing I don't buy from Amazon is clothes, I love Amazon.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This is a movie that takes a lot of thinking, and concentration. Today we rarely see a movie that actually makes us think about what we are seeing. The visuals were amazing, same with the soundtrack. The movie is complicating, but if you think through the story, you will be amazed!
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I bought this album for 99 cents, I was really excited, but after listening I was pretty disappointed. The music is no where near as good as her first album. The only saving grace for me is that I do like \\"Born This Way\\" so I'm just going to pretend I bought only that song, and try to forget listening to stuff like \\"Government Hooker.\\"
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|This is a great cd i recommend this to any Eminem or Royce Da 5'9 fan. Just about every track is tight.
B004MNO0BQ|2.0|A fun classic game but very choppy game play on my T-Mobile G2 - so much so that it makes it difficult to play. Nice graphics but that probably contributes to the lag.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Judging from the breakdown in the reviews for this book, most people either loved it or hated it. I've read all of Connelly's books and haven't \\"hated\\" one yet.  Some, naturally, are better than others - but they're all at least good.  I thought this was an excellent read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it. I don't understand why so many people hated it. It's almost like people can have vastly different tastes and points of view. Go figure!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I am actually approuching this review not sure what I am going to say because I think all of the other reviews have already pointed out why this album is a masterpiece. I don't know how to write about Sgt. Pepper or The Beatles in general without sounding cliche or obvious so I will just be simple with it. Released in 1967, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the first in the late Beatles albums from 1967-1970 and one of the most perfected and most realised in the series if you ask me. As great as Abbey Road, The White Album or even Let It Be are, this album is more foucesd. The songs are unique and well produced, it never follows a formula but it also remains consistent. The previous album Revolver had already shown The Bealtes experimenting a little but this one took it to ever greater hights. I know that I'm going to get a lot of critcism here but I feel that this may be the first great Beatles album. As much as I love the previous records, to me this is when the band found their own voice and while it was pretty evident on Rubber Soul and Revolver, it was again fully realised by this album.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest expert on The Beatles so I guess I can't judge them creatively and maybe I'm wrong when I say this was the first realised album but after listening to all of the records, it sounds like the first fully complete to me. This truly is a great album and every second of it is amazing and well thought out, performed and again produced. Every song is so great that I can't pick a favorite. Within You Without You is an underrated tune written by the late George Harrison and I highly recommend it but also every other track on the album. Magical Mystery Tour was released the same year as this and is also a favorite so check out that one as well, along with the other records. As I stated above, maybe The Beatles are overrated but weather if that's the case or not, I still think they made inspired music that still holds up and never gets dull or predictable. So check it out and make up your own mind about it but I am with those who say this record is a masterpiece.check it out and make up your own mind about it but I am with those who say this record is a masterpiece.

B0045DO8NI|5.0|Pink has musical and visual style and this deluxe cd/dvd set reflects a style worthy of Pink.  The packaging is done like a cd case sized hard cover book. The first and last page are sleeves that hold the cd and dvd. Between the disc-sleeves are 18 pages with song info and some great photos of Pink. The lyrics to the songs aren't printed out but fortunately Pink is very articulate and clear while she sings so I am glad resources weren't wasted. Enough about the packaging, the reason to get the deluxe edition is for the dvd. !4 of Pink's music videos, 2 live song performances, 3 funhouse freak show edition videos,  behind the scenes of  the video 'Funhouse' and the photo shoot for this Greatest hits album make this uniquely Pink.  This collection of music and videos is the evolution of Pink over the past decade and really showcases how great her career has been so far. Isn't that what a greatest hits album should be?
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was amazing.  I have recommended it to everyone I know who loves to read.  The emotion and how this book made me feel; I can't even put into words.  The courage of this mother is beyond words.  Even though she is a fictional character, there is so much for a mother to relate to.  Truly an amazing story with amzing characters.  A MUST read!
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|with version 2.3.3 you cant go past the opening screen. It shows as loading but thats all it does. if you try to do anything it still does nothing.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|I give it 2 stars only because it is built sturdy. Maybe a 2 for operation, because you have to load the clip, pull the charging handle, it has adjustable sights etc. Performance I'd give a 1.  As mentioned in other reviews, the range is about 10 feet. You can aim high and get a dart to go 20 feet in a dramatic arch. The long barrel only serves to rob the dart of momentum. It's too large for any child that would actually enjoy playing with it. My 3 and 5 year olds fell in love with some smaller nerf guns a neighbor had. So I got them the long shot, assuming it would be slightly less appropriate for their age, but maybe they would have some fun if I helped them. They immediately noticed that it didn't have any range and what fun is a few lame shots? One kid had the single shot tiny pistol and it went further and straighter. I also go them each the Barricade RV-10, which shoots further and straighter. They can load it themselves and can rapid fire when they are running around. If the `aim' of long shot is to be a `sniper' it fails horribly. Do your kid a favor and get him 2 Barricades and some spare ammo for the same price as a single, useless long shot.

B000000I0I|5.0|Whatever Ommadawn means, I haven't a clue, haha.  Perhaps it's the same fictional spiritual being that Ummagumma is?  Perhaps the two are related?  Two Gods that watch over the Earth from faraway and speculate on human existence, haha.      All joking aside (well I mean, with a few jokes remaining as I continue my review so it doesn't become a dry, uninspiring read) Ommadawn is one of those albums that seems \\"very pretty\\" the first time you hear it, and gradually -through lots of patience and determination- these \\"very pretty\\" sounds eventually develop into pretty instrumental melodies.  Actually, this stuff is pretty melodic almost right away (GOD I love using the word \\"pretty\\" as you can probably gather, hehe- I must be a fairy princess in a performance theater).      I wouldn't exactly call Mike Oldfield's first three albums a challenging listening experience.  Not that I could replicate such an album with its many diverse styles of course... well alright, pay me 1,000 bucks and I'll pack my bags, pack my musical instruments, take a plane right to your home, walk through your front door and give you the concert of a lifetime!  Just don't throw popcorn in my face if you don't like my out of tune notes.  By all means throw money in my face, though.  The economy hasn't recovered yet. :)    Alright, let's do what you've come here to read- describe the music.  Oh boy, the hardest thing to do, haha.  Let's see, you have an assortment of sounds and styles.  No duh, amirite?  Yes that's right, you already *knew* that (assuming you've heard Tubular Bells, and I'm almost 100% gosh darn positive you have because it's an alarmingly unique unavoidably praised classic, baby).      I hear elements of symphonic experimentation.  This is mostly side two though.  The FIRST side... is a mixture of folk, heavenly voices, and uh... more symphonic sounds?  I guess?  I don't really know.  It's like Mike Oldfield took a bunch of styles and threw them in a blender and created a masterpiece of carefully planned perfection (if such a thing is even possible?)  Side one is definitely the more awesome side because it's significantly more diverse.  Side two is just... the reason Godspeed You Black Emperor is such a great band.  I hear beauty and I hear sadness combined together through delicate and emotionally pleasing instrumental work.  Cool beans, bro.    Listen up you bumbling... er, you awesome patient readers, hehe.  Sorry about that.  Bumbling is a word that should only be used to describe a bee and nothing more.  Listen to this album.  Go to amazon *wink wink!* and pick yourself up a copy of this 36-minute ride of awesomesauce.  It will change your life, making it a life-changing experience.  That's the truth, says R Truth.

B0018QOIXU|5.0|In this album it's more authentic. Its' more blues, less pop. And the lyrics are original. The sound is less of a feast than her 21 album. I am loving this album. It's distinctly different from 21. I wish I knew music more to describe it better, but it's a younger side of her voice, and it's not as toned as 21. I know this is the first album, but I got this one second.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this first time in Europe last year. I loved the way the real life was described: the illnesses like the smallpox, and their treatment, how they carried on their daily life  under the pressure of Englishmen and the higher taxation, how they made the decision to appeal to the king of England to have less taxes leading to denial and then eventually to the war. The hard choices were made, thus, making some people angry even if there really was no other choices to make.<br /><br />The politicians at the time learned by doing their work, like Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, how to be politicians, and what is best for the country at the time, even if it does not always please everyone or even their former allies.<br />Sometimes you need to cooperate with your former enemy and ruler in order to save your country and continue to be prosperous.<br /><br />The actors were also believable in their roles as John Adams and his wife, Jefferson and Bejamin Franklin. The French court was described quite accurately with their desire of beauty, fashion, and novelty... except perhaps not enough of the lack of cleanliness, and how they actually suffered of lices, did not wash themselves so often, and the children often died early because of not being so clean. In Versailles, it was actually a custom for the visitors to pee in the corners, and they sometimes kept medallion chain with a smelly grease around their necks to collect the bugs, like lices, in them. As they did not wash themselves so often, they hid the smell, the dirt, and the grease under the wigs and powder. Powdered wigs were popular during the Louis Quatorze (Ludvig IV, the Sun King) time.<br /><br />Versailles palace was, and still is, a luxurious place with hundreds of rooms as described in this miniseries. The palace garden is still famous and you will recognize it once you see it because it is unique. The palace is nowadays open for visitors, and even if you won't be able to see all the rooms, you will see how glorious it must have been in 1600-1700.<br />When Adams and Franklin served as ambassadors in France, looking for financing and allies, they visited the royal court in Versailles, and played by the rules of the king of France, Louis IV.<br /><br />In addition, when the French Revolution started, and Washington and Adams had to make choices whose side they are and who they support, it was a hard decision as described in this series because England was a former ruler, and still a mighty enemy. The founding fathers could not risk their relationship with England.<br /><br />All in all, the producers did a great job in describing the time of the founding fathers as it was, without sugarcoding the actual conditions and people.n in 1600-1700.

0810993139|4.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is about Greg, a young boy, with an older brother, Rodrick, and his best friend, Rowley Jefferson. His mother gives him a diary or a journal but only girls have journals and diaries and not boys like him. In this journal, he writes about a year in a school and in his life which could relate easily to today's world. There are plenty of illustrations and the type is written on lines instead of just plain white paper.     The author has demystified the reading process as something other an assignment or by force. Children appear to identify with Greg's life very easily regardless of their background. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is easy reading and works well with struggling readers as well. The author makes reading fun again without witchcraft or vampires. Reality can be more frightening than the supernatural.    I highly recommend this book but I didn't like what happened to Rowley and Greg's friendship. I think the book should have concluded and resolved it.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I have glow hockey 1 and this is a great follow up app. Possibly the best feature is the multiplayer on one device.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|In 1999 Eminem and Royce Da 5'9\\" collaborated on a song for Eminem's first album [[ASIN:B00000I5JQ The Slim Shady LP]] called \\"Bad Meets Evil,\\" at the end of which they promised \\"see you in Hell for the sequel.\\" 12 years later, the two have returned under the moniker Bad Meets Evil with their EP \\"Hell: The Sequel.\\" It's called an EP, but with the 2 bonus tracks featured in the deluxe edition it's basically an LP. Many people will be picking up this album solely for Eminem, who, despite being one of the most iconic living people in the world, has had his share of criticism in the last few years. Even with his last record [[ASIN:B003KUSUG8 Recovery]] being the biggest selling album of 2010, some fans have complained about the change in Eminem's style. He tends to shout his raps now, his lyrics contain much more wordplay (particularly puns) then they used to, and he's begun rapping at a much quicker pace. I personally love his progression; the shouting doesn't bother me, I find the lyrics very clever even at their most corny, and I love the fast rapping style. It's impossible for me to review an album like this one-hundred percent objectively, so I must share these thoughts with you beforehand. I'm a fan of the song \\"Bad Meets Evil,\\" but I listened to this album for Eminem. I'm sure I won't be the only person who listens to it and wants to hear more of Royce though.     Eminem tends to destroy other rappers when he collaborates with them. If not, at the very least, he seems to be rapping on a different track (think of \\"No Love\\" with Lil Wayne). On this album, Royce proves to be one of the few rappers who can hold their own against him. These two have a very distinct chemistry that brings out the best in one another. Eminem and Royce Da 5'9' are two brilliant rappers/lyricists at the top of their game who have crafted a jaw-dropping EP that was definitely worth the 12-year-wait. Here's a breakdown of the tracks:    1. Welcome 2 Hell - A brief, atmospheric opener that sets the tone for the album. It's essentially an introduction, but it's a great one that instantly hooked me. A haunting beat with the two rapping over it like their life depends on being better than the other. (5/5)    2. Fast Lane - The first single. Most people have probably heard this track already and they probably agree that it's a great hip-hop track. Accessible, but not overproduced or toned-down. Even the biggest Eminem fans will probably agree that Royce delivers the better verses, although they run neck-and-neck throughout. You'll most likely giggle the most at Eminem's \\"Nicki Minaj\\" line though. (5/5)    3. The Reunion - Many Eminem fans will see this as a sort of return to form. The hook (sung by Eminem) is similar to [[ASIN:B00006690G The Eminem Show]]-era hooks rather than the more high-pitched Recovery-era hooks. The subject matter hearkens back to Relapse a bit, with Em even making fun of that record. It features probably the slowest flow from both Em and Royce than any other song on the album, but will likely be a fan favorite. (5/5)     4. Above the Law - A catchy hook with Eminem and Royce spitting fire on their verses make this a terrific track. Some will be turned off by Eminem's verse as he starts off angry and then spends the last 30 seconds or so full-on shouting. Admittedly, the first time I heard it I was even like \\"Whoa, stop yelling,\\" but his rage-filled verse has grown on me substantially. Royce once again shows off his ability to go neck-and-neck with Em and will be the saving grace of the track for some. (5/5)    5. I'm On Everything - The most \\"wtf?\\" track on the record. Sampling a bit from Mike Epps' stand-up and turning it into the hook (I must admit, a creative idea by producer Mr. Porter), \\"I'm On Everything\\" has Royce and Em rapping about their massive drug intake. It's a song that the two were obviously just having a bit of fun with. While the track has grown on me, neither of their individual verses are particularly good; they sound sloppy, thrown-together, and a bit lazy. It's when the two start switching back-and-forth at breakneck speed that the song actually gets impressive. Also, will Eminem ever grow out of throwing in flatulence sound effects onto his records? It's a song that many will disregard as a waste, but I'm actually (embarrassed to admit that) I'm quite partial to it. (4/5)    6. A Kiss - This song has already gained some attention for a supposed diss directed towards Lady Gaga. Well, it's not a diss; it's Eminem joking about an old rumor and the fact that people are getting offended by it is remarkable. Eminem has been doing this for years. While the line about Lady Gaga is not particularly clever, it's far from a big deal. The track itself has a strange beat and an even stranger hook, but it's become one of my favorite tracks on the album. Eminem tones down the yelling significantly, which will please many and the slower, but rapid flow that Royce and Em have makes this stand-out. It took a few listens to grow on me, but it's one of the most infectious tracks on the record. (5/5)    7. Lighters - This song will be the second single and features pop star Bruno Mars singing the hook. It's a complete departure from the rest of the album's sound and seems to be here for the singular purpose of pushing more units. I'm not a fan of Mars, but I don't have anything against him or his music either. With that said, his hook brings  a softness that is not present anywhere else on the album and this song will likely help this album to sell way more copies than it would have without it. However, it's because of that hook that I haven't been able to greatly appreciate the song. The track boasts the most mature, focused lyrics of the entire album from both Eminem and Royce, but the hook by Mars just takes it into too poppy of a territory for me. If you like/love Mars, then you'll no doubt love this song...And once again, Em has toned down the yelling. (4/5)    8. Take from Me - A song that deals with music piracy (among other things). There's a lot of anger from both rappers and both deliver the goods. Even if you're pro-piracy and roll your eyes at the lyrics, you can't deny the feeling that's present in the track and the overall ability that's displayed on this track. The hook may annoy some (it's annoyingly catchy), but this is a great track. (5/5)    9. Loud Noises - This features rap supergroup Slaughterhouse and despite them all delivering sick verses, it's not one of my favorite tracks. I'm not a fan of the random \\"SLAUGHTERHOUSE!\\" yell that occurs before the beginning of every verse nor do I like it as the album closer. Despite these reservations, I do like it and there's enough talent here to make me look into Slaughterhouse's records. (4/5)    The two tracks included with the deluxe edition are \\"Living Proof\\" and \\"Echo,\\" which leaked onto the internet many months ago and most huge fans have heard. \\"Living Proof\\" is basically the same at the leaked version. Royce kind of takes the lead on this one and it's a very raw, stripped-down, hip-hop song and an easy 5/5. \\"Echo\\" has Eminem and Royce's verses switched and a couple small production changes throughout the song. I'm glad they decided to include these tracks on here and release them officially, as they're both gems that don't deserve to just float around the internet in an un-mastered form.    So that's what you get from this EP from a terrific duo whom I hope will do more in the future. I don't know of another rapper besides Royce that could work so well with Eminem on a record. The two really complement each other nicely and it's nearly impossible to say one is better than the other on any given song. There's no point really, as they establish themselves as equals in both lyrical-ability and flow. Rarely does something that some have waited 12 years for live up to the hype, but Hell: The Sequel does just that. It's a stunning display of raw ability and impassioned expression and should definitely put Royce Da 5'9\\" on the mainstream map where he belongs. There will be those that don't share the same ecstatic view I have of this album, but many others (including those who gave Recovery a lukewarm reception) will see this as a return to form for Eminem. The lyrics range from funny to clever to poetic; the beats from sparse to haunting; the flows from lightning-quick to laid-back. This is an all-around great record.    GRADE: A-
0316056863|4.0|It reads just the same way that she speaks/delivers her lines. I really loved her insight and backstage perspective on the world of prime time TV. And her background on her upbringing really shows how humble she is...just a real \\"real woman\\" to the core. I love her attitude about women's equality/glass cielings in the business, ones that not always she herself, but her respected colleagues, have busted right through and never looked back. I laughed...A LOT, and where I was kind of luke-warm about her prior to this book, I am definitely a fan by the last page. Will recommend to any one taking a long plane trip or just sitting by the pool, or just take it with you wherever you go and are stuck waiting for a while. You can pick it up and put it down mid chapter, without missing a thing. Well done, Tina! Glad someone has said what needed to be heard about women in comedy...and made it funny/captivating, at that!

B000RJO578|4.0|A comedy movie about an overachieving police officer in London who gets sent to a small village in the countryside because of his idealistic and overachieving attitude. As soon as he is transferred over there he begins to suspect that things are more than they seem.    Simon Pegg plays the role of that super-cop who ends up being partnered with the Captain's goofball son `Danny'... who is his complete polar opposite and completely out of it! They both begin to influence each other with their positives and they both end up being better people...    The comedy factor in the movie was rather enjoyable and made me watch this one over and over many times. I think that if you've enjoyed `Shaun of the Dead' then you will enjoy this one as well as it closely follows in its comedy style.    The ending struggle near the end of the movie was a bit too graphic for my taste and makes me cringe every time I see it... but it hasn't made me loose my lunch yet!    Overall, a good comedy movie which is viewable several times.
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|I gave it one star because it was the free app of the day. I already have the first one and I see no reason to keep this one. Looks and plays exactly the same. Extra options that I don't care for. Uninstalled. HTC G2.

The original framework the author has constructed around the burning of metals for abilities is refreshing and interesting Gives characters both abilities and weaknesses that create for more engaging reading - and is well suited to the larger, believable construct of the world the author has created. Just a fun, well written, original read.

B003Y74AXO|5.0|My chief complaint with the name-brand screen protector I previously used was that it seemed to attract smudges that were extremely difficult to remove. These AmazonBasics protectors react similarly to the actual iPad screen. There are some fingerprints but they are easily removed. Since I play several games on my iPad, I needed a protector that made me feel safe but would also look clean and shiny with a couple of swipes with a cloth.     As with every protector I've ever applied, there are a couple of bubbles. I may be getting better at the application process, but this protector actually seemed to go on more easily and was more forgiving than others I've used. The bubbles are nearly imperceptible.     For peace of mind, I highly recommend this product.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent series, but unfortunately ended too soon, so you will also need to buy the movie Serenity to answer the questions the series poses.    As with all Whedon series, there is great witty banter from interesting characters. Some don't get developed to their maximum, again due to premature cancellation. The series was ahead of its time and multiple series have borrowed from its aesthetic style since it was made. Possibly now it can be even clearer that we will all be cussing in mandarin in the years to come!    Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I thought this reboot of a classic franchise was great. Creating a believable alternate version of a well-established sci-fi universe is no small order, but I think it was pulled off with this movie. The Blu-ray itself seems to have all your standard features and the quality of picture/sound is excellent. It also has plenty of extra features.  There are plenty of lengthy reviews on here by some of the Star Trek nerds who love to point out every little minor detail to try and show how smart they are so they can get an ego boost so I will leave all the nitpicking up to them. My recommendation is that this is worth buying.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally bought the first book because the concept of the story was interesting.  I didn't think that I would get so involved so quickly, but I soon found it hard to put down!  This trilogy is one of the best I have read in a long time.  I was pulled in from the first chapter, and found myself quickly pouring through the rest of the series.  I am recommending this series to my friends and family, and have just started to re-read it again.  The second time around you can catch things you didn't notice the first time, and even though you know the out come, it is still worth the time.  I never make reviews, but I felt that this trilogy deserved recognition for its wonderful and captivating story.  Believe me when I say it is well worth your time!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you haven't read the books or followed the HBO series based on them, you should. Martin throws the twin children of formula and predictabilty out the window and fills them full of arrows. Then tramples the corpses. A Song of Ice and Fire is a totally unpredictable, exciting series. I've thrown down my kindle in disgust and howled for vengence throughout reading the series. Absolutely NO ONE is safe! Do yourself a favor: Pick these up!

B00003CXSP|2.0|Taken chronologically, Hannibal Lecter started out as a brilliant schemer in Red Dragon, refined his - ahem - tastes in Silence of the Lambs, and if the last installment is any measure, became a traditional slasher in Hannibal.<br /><br />Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) has always been the more gentlemanly of two evils.  Whether it was The Tooth Fairy in Red Dragon or Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, Lecter seemed pleasant and refined in comparison to the more brutal serial killers. This is what makes an anti-hero so much fun; he's bad, but he's not as bad as the bad guy.  The even-worse villain in Hannibal is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a wealthy child molester whom Hannibal convinced (through judicious application of mind-altering drugs) to cut off his own face.  A crippled, revolting shell of a man, Verger seethes with an unholy vengeance and, thanks to his immense wealth, crafts a far-fetched plan to get revenge.<br /><br />And this is where the problems with Hannibal begin. Although it's clear Verger was bad - and presumably, in the Levels of Evil, we can assume molestation of children is worse than cannibalism of adults - but he simply doesn't have the physical presence of the other serial killers to justify Hannibal's own villainy.  Verger is more disgusting than vile, and the shock of the character wears off after a while. Verger's schemes border on cartoon-character levels with his plans to have Hannibal's face eaten by specially bred wild boars.  Yes, that's right - Hannibal's up against a cripple and his army of killer pigs.<br /><br />The first third of the film is a cat-and-mouse game between Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) and Hannibal in Florence, Italy.  This is the Hannibal we know - crawling inside his victim's heads, using their secret shame as a weapon against them, and giving morally flawed human beings their comeuppance for being so gauche. Pazzi's ending is never in doubt, but the increasingly high stakes between the two men makes for thrilling drama.<br /><br />Then we're back to Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). You'll recall that Clarice was a woman trying to make it in a man's world in Silence of the Lambs.  Forget all that - here, Starling as embodied by Moore is a delicious peach, to be ogled by the camera as it slow pans not once but twice over her body.  Since Hannibal and Starling meet only at the end of the film, director Ridley Scott uses this technique as a substitute for Hannibal's amorous intentions. It's no surprise Foster turned the role down.<br /><br />The last third of Hannibal features Starling, the ridiculously corrupt Justice Department officer Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, who looks the part), and everybody's favorite cannibal at a dinner for two.  The dinner scene only manages to be disgusting because there's not a shred of sympathy for Krendler, unlike Pazzi who had a gorgeous wife and so much to lose.  By the conclusion Hannibal is in full slasher mode, complete with the ability to silence dogs at a glance, terrorize gun-wielding victims into inaction with just a knife, and otherwise pop-up and disappear as needed for him to abduct his victims.  In short, Hannibal goes from being a three-dimensional character to a one-dimensional killer.<br /><br />Conversely, Starling is a straight arrow.  So straight, in fact, that it becomes inconceivable that there's any room for romance with Hannibal.  She is polite, but frigid - her lack of connection with any other character leaves her as a cipher with about as much charm as a wax statue.  The final showdown between Starling and Hannibal, which is considerably different from the book, detracts from all the romantic opera chatter that took place in the first third of the film.  Hannibal has difficulty staying true to its convictions.<br /><br />But if you know anything about the original source material, you can understand why.  Hannibal, the book, is a grand guignol of ridiculous characters and over-the-top violence.  Hannibal, the movie, is tame in comparison, but not daring enough to conclude the cannibal's movie legacy.g enough to conclude the cannibal's movie legacy.
0670022411|5.0|If you, like me, enjoy reading history, love having your brain twisted by time travel, and savor a good inter-species romance amongst non-human creatures, this is your book. This book scratched pretty much all my literary itches at the same time ... which is no mean feat. Okay, the author is obviously an historian and does occasionally commit the sin of delving excessively into a particularly narrow historical niche, but the quality of the writing more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Are the characters realistic? Well, how realistic do you figure a witch and a very old vampire are actually going to be? Quibbling about the main character's academic credentials and personal achievements is kind of pointless in view of the fact that she is supernatural and her chosen mate is a more-than-thousand-year-old vampire. You either suspend your credibility and take the story on its own terms, or read something else.<br /><br />Romance may be at the heart of the story, but history is its blood and brains. History drives the story. So. If you love history, the book is a total treat ... exceptionally well written and full of entertaining historical tidbits. The characters, however entertaining, are the means to an end. If history isn't your \\"thing,\\" then this is probably not the book for you.<br /><br />I was completely un-surprised to learn that the author is a history professor. What worries me is that having left us dangling at the end of the book, that she will fail to provide a sequel. This books needs a sequel like your right leg needs a left one. I will try to be patient. Meanwhile, I guess I will have to read this book again. Maybe more than once.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|I AM NUMBER FOUR starts out well enough: a handsome young lad going by the name of John Smith (Alex Pettyfer, 21 year old British actor) and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) have moved to a small Ohio town to avoid being found and killed by an alien group who seek to diminish John Smith's confreres in order (John is number four), having just killed number three whose son Sam (Callan McAuliffe, 16 year old Australian newcomer) happens to live in the little town.  John meets a photographer girl Sarah (Dianna Agron) who has been dating pushy Mark (Jake Abel).  Gradually John's alien powers emerge (his hands can be flashlights and he as extraordinary powers of physical strength), he puts his now competitor for in Sarah's affections Mark in place in fights, reveals his identity to Sam who bonds because of his father's being number three, and the trio - John, Sarah and Sam - are off and running.  So far so good for a teenage love n' stuff movie.<br /><br />The problems (not only for the trio, but also for the audience) begin as the stalking aliens appear - hilariously ugly creatures with silly guns and manners of communicating - as well as a strange fighting girl (we discover later is the one designated number Six - Teresa Palmer).  John, despite Henri's protective insistence that they move on, decides to stay because he has found love with Sarah.  From this point the film just becomes silly as flying squirrels become immense, multifanged prehistoric monsters and the plot deteriorates into a m&eacute;lange of gore, flying body parts, transmogrification of a pet dog into a beastie, etc etc etc.<br /><br />The film is squeezed out a novel 'Pittacus Lore' by James Frey and Jobie Hughes, molded into its present screenplay form by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar,  and Marti Noxon, and stirred by director D.J. Caruso.  Before it becomes hilariously silly there are some pretty decent performances by Olyphant, Pettyfer and McAuliffe that make the film worth watching.  It is a film that will please some (according to box office receipts it was quite successful) and lose others.

B0036EH40Q|5.0|This movie got slammed by Kevin Costner who was making his own version of Wyatt Earp to be released at the same time as this one. Costner managed to blackball the film so effectively that only Disney (Buena Vista) was willing to distribute it. And Costner's movie doesn't hold a candle to this one.<br /><br />The performances of everyone in the cast are terrific. It is a long movie that feels short. I always want it to go on longer than it does. My husband and I and our friends have watched it many times and it never gets \\"old.\\"<br /><br />It was really filmed in Tombstone (been there!)and that's a big plus. It has a great sense of place. I think this is Val Kilmer's best performance ... quite probably Kurt Russell's best work too. It is a super good western, with all the elements that make westerns a great genre. If you have not discovered this movie yet, don't wait another minute!! This is GREAT stuff.

B0054NQZ9S|5.0|I think this story delivers an important message in a way that is easily relatable for many people. It's a modern-day take on the age old \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags\\" theme. The main characters, who have worked their way up the corporate ladder to a life of luxury that others only dream of, are suddenly faced with the cold, hard reality that it can all be taken away in no time at all, no matter who you are. What a crushing blow to learn that years of time and dedication are no longer of value thanks to the almighty to the bottom line. Greed is a powerful force that thrives on gaining more with no regard for the destruction left in its wake.     One of the most significant events during my childhood was that of my father losing his job in 1970 and the impact it had on our lives. It was a major blow to his self esteem. He worked for the same mega-corporation that both of my grandfathers had retired from after decades of hard work. He had planned to do the same. He was part of a generation that grew up believing in the benefits of dedicating yourself to a good company and therefore being respected and rewarded for your effort.     He was blindsided by a massive downsizing layoff and was distraught at suddenly being unable to support our single-income family. Jobs were scarce because so many other men were in the same situation, and ultimately my parents were forced to sell our newly built home - the dream house they had worked and saved for over the years. They bought a mobile home and we lived on the corner of a relatives property. He found a job at a small manufacturing plant where he was miserable but nonetheless busted his back for 30+ years ... and then was ultimately screwed out of his promised retirement package when the company later went under.     I think it's because of that I realized early in my career that business is a game involving players who are driven by their own particular motivation. Some people are team players whose goal is working for the greatergood of everyone involved, while others have no true concern for anyone but themselves and will step on everyone who gets in their way. You've got to play the game to succeed, but I believe it's the honest, empathetic and hard-working people who are the winners no matter how many dollar signs are on their paycheck.

B0014C0BMU|4.0|Man and machine, can they coexist? Man and machine, do they need each other? At the end of this movie those questions were answered.It's an epic conclusion to the series in which Neo and the machines,for once, had a common enemy, a superordinate goal . A powerful virus,Agent Smith, rapidly spreading through the matrix, wrecking havoc,creating an \\"unbalance\\", ready to bring down the matrix,the machines,and all the human nurseries. Neo, was the one; he was chosen(frankly manipulated), by the machines to bring back balance, to restore order in the Matrix,to destroy Agent Smith.<br />  To me, the whole Matrix was an allegory. An allegory of how our lives have become more and more  engulfed by technology. Our lives have become hijacked by technology, our own creation. Phones,Facebook,Twitter,and other entities alike,have deprived us of pure human interactions; everything has been digitalized to just a vestige of the true joy of seeing a beautiful smile on someone's face, the smirk on a lover's face, the fascination in the eyes of a child, the warmth of someone's embrace.Although technology has appealed more and more to our senses, some experiences will never be able to be duplicated in a digital realm.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much because of the unforgettable power of HBO's earlier effort \\"Band of Brothers.\\" That series was a cohesive, sensitive and gripping story of how war not only breaks the human heart, but also how it bonds together diverse personalities. Those two themes worked together.<br /><br />I mention this because I found \\"The Pacific\\" to do too much of the former and not enough of the latter. It seems to be much too focused on how war destroys the soul. To be sure, that's an important theme and must be part of every war story. But in this case, episode after episode seems to come and go with little sense of hope or purpose. You see loss and despair, over and over, without sufficient reason to stay involved in the story.<br /><br />The war in the Pacific was a very different experience from that in Europe. Autobiographical accounts from the men who served in that theater make it clear that this theater of war was filled with a greater sense of despair. There was no clear turn of events as were seen in North Africa, Italy, or the beaches of Normandy. There was only a long, gradual series of small victories that seemed to add up to an ending. But always looming in the distance was the horrible prospect of war on the Japanese homeland. In that respect, The Pacific presents an accurate portrayal of what seemed, many times, a hopeless cause. Yet it wasn't hopeless. The men savored every small victory and they bonded together through their experiences, just as they did in Europe. While The Pacific is every bit as rich a production and as well acted as Band of Brothers, it just left me feeling a little empty when it was all over.

0307716511|4.0|If you are already reading or plan to read Sister: A Novel by Rosamund Lupton, do not read this post.  This review contains spoilers, and I refuse to be the spoiler of a great book.    Because that's what this book was; it was great.  I loved it.  I appreciated the writing more than the story itself, but the plot did keep me hooked until the end.  I'm not typically a fan of epistolary novels (\\"epistolary\\" = word of the day); I find them choppy and difficult to read, but I felt that Lupton did it right.  Despite Beatrice's first-person, past-tense account directed at her sister, I found myself forgetting that it was a story told through letters, and I think I enjoyed this book so much specifically because it was written in that style.  It was a smooth but insightful read.  And it was the author's first novel, which I didn't find out until after I read the book. I found that impressive, considering that it was exceedingly well-written and interesting.    What I wasn't crazy about: the ending.  And when I say the ending, I mean thevery ending, because the few pages right before the end were juicily shocking, in my opinion.  We discover the identiy of Tess' killer, but the real blow is learning how much of the tale Beatrice fabricated in order to elicit comfort and have an outlet through which to tell her story.  Mr. Wright, the lawyer that Beatrice uses as a vehicle through which to narrate the account as she gives a witness statement was fabricated, along with other crucial parts of the narrative.  In the final pages, we also find out that Beatrice is about to suffer the same gruesome fate as Tess (murdered in a public restroom, alone, dazed and frightened), and were the author to leave it that way, I think it would have been even more chilling and a hell of a lot more surprising.    Yes, I'm suggesting that the author should have killed off the main character-- a main character that I actually liked.  At the very end, though, at the 11th hour, with death knocking atthe door and Beatrice ready to surrender to it, we learn that she is about to be rescued.  Call me crazy, but I found this deflating.  Should you read it? Definitely.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|One of the greatest adventures of the Computer is the ability to scroll through documents!  However, Amazon decided to favor the old fashioned \\"turn the page\\" mode...  I guess it's too difficult for such a small company like Amazon to  employ Developers who are capable of integrating both modes,  so that the customer is able to switch between them.    To keep it short:  It's f***** annoying that I can't scroll through my books,  but have to turn the page.

B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|I'm writying this as a old anime fan coming back onto the new anime scene:    Having been a late-comer to this series, I've been blown away completely by it for 3 reasons  -  character background/design/synopsis  -  Mecha design/functionality  -  story backdrop/synopsis    I've seen the compiled movie versions and have rented/borrowed the first original 10 episodes. The animation in this DVD (and v 2.22)  is outstanding to say the least and performs perectly to carry on the story.    But ---     How many time s can one show and tell a story to an audience that knows the beginning and ending? It does cut some corners and loses some pacing but I'm not going to watch an successful cult series/movie be REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN like BLADE RUNNER!!! I will despite this, look forward to the next 2 feature films. Any further decimals or numbers added on, count me out! >:P    another gripe:    The Extras DVD does NOT live up to anything worthwhile!

1416972242|5.0|Cassandra Clare has done it again. In City of Ashes, the second part to her ever-growing Mortal Instruments series, Clary, Jace, Izzy, Alec, Luke and Magnus are back to their magic- and drama-filled life in New York City. This time, there is a murderer on the loose who seems to be out to get Downworlders. If that wasn't bad enough, Jace is under investigation thanks to the events in City of Bones and the Inquistor sent from the Clave is not messing around.<br /><br />I admit that this book was very hard to put down. Clare has an amazing ability to keep you on the edge of your seat with major events happening on almost every other page. Her writing is brilliant and she definitely knows how to keep a reader drawn in.<br /><br />It seemed like a major portion of this book was focused on the definition of a family. The only thing that bothered me is that while the book focused on Jace's family, Clary's mother was mostly in the background. Due to the events in City of Bones, Jocelyn was left in a coma-like state. Though she was mentioned more in the beginning and the end, through most of the story she wasn't mentioned at all. I suppose she couldn't be a major character because she wasn't conscious, but I think it is safe to say that Clary would have been thinking about her mother quite a bit.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this book and can't wait to get into City of Glass. Just like in City of Bones, Clare left the me dying to know what is next.
1423389387|5.0|I wish I had researched The Wise Man's Fear prior to reading it. Then I would have known it was the second installment in a series. Although The Wise Man's Fear can stand on it's own as an excellent book. I do plan to read the first book, The Name of the Wind, in the series. This book left me wanting more of Kvothe's, the lute-playing adventurer and arcanist, backstory.<br /><br />I felt the time Kvothe spent travelling during his school leave seemed rushed compared to his school adventurers. This part could have been it's own book permitting for more detail during Kvothe's travels and adventures.<br /><br />The books end disappointed me because it left me hanging and waiting more. I really enjoyed The Wise Man's Fear. I recommend this book and by proxy The Name of the Wind.
1400052173|3.0|The story of Henrietta Lacks is extremely interesting and in a way, benefits all of us. I'm glad that I read this book to learn of the woman who unknowingly contributed so much to science in the 20th century. My issue with the book is how this story is told. Rebecca Skloot obviously felt it important to insert herself into the narrative as a key player. I firmly believe that this was an unnecessary way to tell Henrietta's story. In fact, it almost seems a bit insincere since what the Lacks family truly deserves is to be recognized for their mother's contribution and this book, in an ironic way, becomes Skloot's story on how she authored a successful book. In an effort to \\"tell Henrietta's story\\", the author takes much of the focus and places it onto herself. The story of Henrietta's immortality and her reproducing cancer cells is worth telling. I just wish that I didn't have to read Skloot's own grasp for immortality as a writer.
B003UESJEM|4.0|I just watched this movie yesterday on video on demand in HD. It was pretty good. The problem with this movie is that it was not promoted or advertised nearly enough.

This movie could have done much better at the box office with more support. Definately worth renting.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I got this one as a replacement  of an SGP Case I had been using for a while now. The Amazon Basics case, while not as fancy as the one I had before, performs as expected and protects my iPhone 4 as needed.<br /><br />The material (TPU) is not as soft as it may seem in the pictures, but is not plastic like other products available, which is great, other cases I have seen made out of plastic slip trough one's fingers, which is not the case with this one. It is also slightly transparent, which I suppose is good for those who want the iPhone design not to be covered completely.<br /><br />Additionally, a screen protector (I highly recommend you use it to avoid scratches and the like) and a cleaning cloth are included.<br /><br />Besides being a product that looks well and of quality, you simply cannot beat the price. The Amazon logo is printed on the back of the case, as any other brand would be (call me crazy but I think it looks cool) As if that were not enough, a one year limited warranty is also included.<br /><br />If you are looking for protection, quality and good looks (again, nothing fancy but simple), you can go no wrong with this protective case.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|This movie is a bit better than \\"Underworld\\" with its camerawork and average action scenes but bad writing destroys it, the pacing is too slow and its main character (Selene) can't shoot well. This film isn't as bad as the first movie, its more mediocre than awful. 5/10
B000683VI4|5.0|Oh my god, what a beautiful, romantic but sad story. A tale of a marriage, a tale of having to choose between your heart and societal expectations. Not at all predictable and that is the reason I liked this love story as much as I did.    I totally cried when I watched the part of the movie when the wife slipped into dementia and couldn't remember her husband. I thought it was just amazing how he stuck to her side to the very end...despite all others telling him to give up. A love like that is something to be admired...definitely.    If you get the DVD, I recommend watch the deleted scenes in the special features section as it underscores the story rather than deletes from it... and I say the MPAA are a bunch of prudes for cutting the love scenes like they did! Yeah, they were graphic in parts, but it fit the story and wasn't done in a prurient manner.
030745455X|4.0|The enthusiasm of this review is tempered by the crushing disappointment of the third installment of the series.  But taken alone, The Girl Who Played with Fire is brilliant. I scanned with curiosity and amusement some of the one-star reviews, and found the criticism unwarranted. I actually enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the purchases for Salander's apartment; call me strange. The everyday details of living made the story more real to me. They're in Sweden, where are they supposed to shop except IKEA? The only details I remember given about a computer were when Salander wrecked her laptop and had to buy a new one. What is Larsson supposed to say? \\"She populated her home with assorted products purchased at a self-assembly home furnishings retail chain and had some generic frozen pizza for dinner... \\"  I neither know nor care whether Larsson had product placement deals with these companies. We live in a consumerist society, deal with it. Those are the least of his literary offenses. Yes, the premise is farfetched. I'm skeptical that in \\"real life\\" Salander could pull off the massive embezzlement she did, but if suspense thrillers had to be like reality no one would ever have heard of Ian Fleming. All that matters is that there's a compelling story that's quick-paced and entertaining to read, and TGWPWF delivers. If the haters hadn't stopped reading in a fit of pique when they got to the IKEA stuff, they might have found an enjoyable read.<br /><br />That said, TGWPWF brings some things from the first novel into clearer focus.  Where the first and third novels suffer under the weight of excessive exposition and dialogue, this one is more action driven.  I couldn't put it down. Dragon Tattoo was all about Blomkvist; Salander is the star here, less one-dimensional and more sympathetic. The sinister Advokat Bjurman resurfaces to chilling effect. I could have done without the seemingly pointless subplot early in the book about an American couple which played no role in the rest of the story. Needless side characters and subplots are Larsson's most annoying literary quirk.  It's just a shame he didn't wrap up the series with a concluding novel worthy of this gem, because TGWPWF leaves you craving more. Make like a Larsson character and put on another pot of coffee, because you'll stay up late reading this one.rest of the story.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Wow. Just. WOW.<br /><br />And not \\"wow\\" in a good way, either! Sex in the City 2 starts where the first movie left off. I'm a fan of the original HBO series and even though that show didn't exactly do much for empowering women, it was still a guilty pleasure of mine. After all, there's nothing wrong with girls enjoying fashion, makeup, fabulous lifestyles in fabulous places, and MEN... Even if some negative stereotypes separating the genders were still enforced even if the show supposedly broke boundaries.<br /><br />The first movie was unnecessary, in my opinion, and this second movie is even less necessary. And yet, I willed myself to see them both -- it's just something one has to do if you're a fan of the show, and the makers of these films were definitely banking on the original fan base to sell this mess. It's clear the writers are different for this movie compared to the original show, because even though Carrie is just as lame with her stupid puns (which she THINKS are so clever) in this movie, the \\"wittiness\\" in these movies is more just for the sake of having some jokes rather than having the witticisms be part of Carrie's personality.<br /><br />*** spoilers ***<br /><br />I thought it was inconsistent with the characters' personalities that Steve would cheat on Miranda and they'd break up. I don't know if other people think differently, but that's just the way the movie hit me. I thought the subplot with Carrie and Aiden kissing in the Middle East was flat out forced and just stupid.<br /><br />AND most important to me of all is that this movie is insultingly ignorant of women's issues in the Middle East.<br /><br />Utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />Subplots with Charlotte and Big and Samantha were all just excuses to bring familiar characters around for an extended SATC episode. Nothing shocking, though it tries to be. It's just all familiar, tired ground, and not interesting.<br /><br />-- and the karaoke scene! SO painful my stomach hurt, I was so embarrassed just watching it.<br /><br />Rich, stupid, aging women act like teenage tramps in a foreign land and completely disrespect that country's customs. One can challenge a society's views without coming off as an ignorant snob, and yet that's exactly how these women came off.<br /><br />YAWN.eenage tramps in a foreign land and completely disrespect that country's customs.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|This movie is both too brief and too long, wildly exciting in places and boring in others, well acted in spots and cheesy elsewhere, the kind of movie that everyone says is good, so it must be good.    Is it good? Yes it is. Good, but not great.    Many others have already summed up the plot of this film so I won't waste your time here, but if you're anything like me -- a person who didn't have a definite idea of what this film was about but is a fan of both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis -- then this film should admirably fill a couple of hours of your day.    You could do a lot worse!     Anyway the movie seems a tad melodramatic, almost like it's taking itself too seriously as if it's a high art house film or something like that, and the aftertaste of this pretentiousness works against the film in my opinion, as a casual viewer.    If you're into ballet and the world of dance troupe politics then there's a lot of insider stuff to be enjoyed, and even if you're not an expert on this art form the film does a good job of drawing you in.    But the slowness of some parts rather than highlighting the exciting ones just gives the movie a \\"could have been better\\" flavor.    Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are SO beautiful though. I'm Jealous, definitely.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Well, I think I can speak for everyone when I say who would have thought \\"Smallville\\" would have lasted for 10 years, a decade of television!! Most TV series now a days, barely make it through their first seasons and the lucky ones last 2 or 3 seasons tops. Back on October 16th 2001, no one was prepared for \\"Smallville\\". Sure, it was a series based on the Superman mythology but I doubt anyone expected it to be so re-freshing and unique. As soon as those meteors swept across the screen and took Smallville by storm, we knew we were in store for one hell of a series! Throughout it's 10 seasons, Smallville has had some truly incredible moments within some iconic, amazing episodes as well as some no so incredible moments will some of the most awful, embarrassing and plot stalling episodes. But despite all the ups and downs throughout the series' 10 year run, Smallville has become the longest running sci-fi/comic book superhero series in history, so it was obviously doing something right....right? Well, here is the Smallville: The Complete Series Boxset. All 218 episodes are here as well as an overwhelming supply of extras and bonus material including the famous Daily Planet \\"Superman Saves the Day\\" Newspaper which was featured in Smallville's 200th episode, \\"Homecoming\\".

B002ZG977Y|2.0|When I saw that one of the lead actors from the movie \\"Avatar\\" was also starring in this movie, I thought \\"Clash of the Titans\\" would be a sure thing. But when I finally did get to see the film, I was left disappointed.     I thought the special effects were well-done, and since this movie was made in 2010 and such things are done with computers this ought to be expected. But I also think the special effects were OVER done, because the movie relies so much on visual wow factors and less on acting and story development.     Maybe it's just me, but I had a bit of trouble following the plot of this movie. I watched the 1980s Harry Hamlin version when a friend loaned it to me on VHS, and even though the older film is cheesy in places, with lots of dated claymation, it tells a better story, and the acting is better!     Since I watched the older movie first it was a little easier to understand the newer one because basically it's the same thing, but I think that if I didn't see the older movie first and just watched the new one by itself, I'd be very confused about what exactly was the point of the whole thing.     All in all this movie reminds me of a really, really bad, bombastic Michael Bay movie with lots of visuals but without much else. It's a shame because it seems like the cast could do better. I'm certainly glad I didn't waste money seeing this in a theater but I'm disappointed I watched the movie, because it's 100plus minutes of my life I can't get back, which I could have better spent sleeping. I'll bet I could dream something more entertaining than this mess!    I did give this a second star because I think Sam Worthington is cute, but other than him being eye candy, that's the film's problem. It's just eye candy, with not much else to offer.
0143038419|1.0|When I finally picked up this book, it was like the Emporer had no clothes. I love nonfiction but found it unbearably dull, I could not read it straight through, had to skim, skipping around trying in vain to find the part that made so many people (including Ophrah, right?) \\"love\\" it and the reason it was a best-seller. Ugh. In a sentence:  \\"Narcisstic, self-absorbed person who goes on a self-indulgent journey of self-discovery paid for by her publisher.\\" This book reminded me of a line Miss Manners that she suggested to a gentle reader to use to dis-encourage people from conversing with her:  \\"Oh, I've been on a wonderful journey of self-discovery, do let me tell you ALL about it!\\"  Relationships are my hobby, yet I could not get into it and can't understand why so many people loved it.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|When Lady Gaga first hit it big I was annoyed by her and almost hated hearing her songs on the radio.    I thought I was \\"above\\" her music, and thought she would be one of those artists who disappears as quickly as she comes into our consciousness.    I was a snob, and I'm so sorry now.        Because yeah -- this album. HOTTTTTTT.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Great album by Royce and Eminem. There is not song on here that I don't not only like but love.<br /><br />1)Welcome to Hell: 9/10<br />-There is no better way to start the album then with this song. It sets the tone that this won't be a soft-served album but it's going to go hard from start to finish.<br /><br />2)Fast Lane: 8.5/10<br />-I heard this song before the album even came out. It was a released single about 4 weeks before today. I love this song but I feel Royce did a tad bit better than Em in this case. Alot may disagree but that's just my point of view.<br /><br />3)The Reunion: 8/10<br />-Though I'm not this song's biggest fan, I do still like it. It's different but I do like it. There really isn;t much more for me to say about it.<br /><br />4)Above the Law: 9/10<br />-Great song. I don't know whose vocals those are for the chorus but she sounds great on this track. Em comes in strong and then Royce comes in strong. Great song. If you're a person that wants to sample a track on this album before you get it I recommend this one or Loud Noises.<br /><br />5)I'm on Everything: 9/10<br />-The only reason I wouldn't recommend this track for those sampling a track is because I don't want people thinking that every song on here is about drugs. This is still a great song and I don't want to take anything from it. Mike Epps actually does bring something to the song. He adds some comic relief and what he says actually pertains to the song. This is one of the only times that a comedian features on a song that I feel actually added something to it. Unlike Chris Rock on Ludacris' \\"Everybody Hates Chris\\".<br /><br />6)A Kiss: 10/10<br />-A song that is different from the rest of the album but still delivers that \\"go hard\\" feel to it. I love this song and that Lady Gaga reference from Em actually made me laugh the first time I heard it.<br /><br />7)Lighters: 8/10<br />-Not my favorite song because it reminds me alot of what I didn't like about Recovery. But it still isn't a bad song. I do enjoy it though and Bruno adds great vocals to it.<br /><br />8)Take From Me: 9.5/10<br />-Great song with a great message from Em and Royce. Again I don't know who is doing the vocals on the chorus but she sounds great. This is a song I would also recommend if someone was sampling tracks.<br /><br />9)Loud Noises: 10/10<br />-One of my favorite songs on the album. And what's funny is that it's not even because of Em or Royce. I feel that Joel Ortiz is the star player in this song. That's just my opinion but it wouldn't be one of my favorites without him.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br /><br />10)Living Proof: 10/10<br />-If this were on the original album and not a bonus track then this would've been a song I would recommend. Seeing as it isn't then I won't but I do love this song. This is one of my favorite songs by Royce and Em. Period.<br /><br />11)Echo: 9.5/10<br />-Great vocals by Liz Rodriguez for the chorus. My only wish is that the song went a little longer because every time I listen to it I always want more.<br /><br />This just may be my favorite album by Em in a long time. Encore, Relapse, Refill and Recovery. The Re-Up was a pretty solid album but it wasn't a mainly Eminem album. Recovery was great but I felt wasn't the Eminem I grew up listening to. The Marshall Mathers may always be my favorite Eminem album but this one came pretty d*** close. Royce really shined on this album. I give him mad props. And even though Street Hop was a pretty solid album as was Slaughterhouse this is Royce (In my opinion) at his very best.ake From Me: 9.5/10  -Great song with a great message from Em and Royce.

B0036S4C6G|4.0|At this point, the Goon Squad has reached the highest possible status for a best seller (including the Pulitzer) and I was curious to read it. I would definitely advise you to download the book: it is superbly written and a most unusual novel - more a collection of inter-connected short stories than a traditional novel.<br /><br />Egan's virtuosity is impressive. She manages to:<br />1. weave the plot from diverse characters all linked together by their past experiences in punk rock music; as a result, we are given a vast and varying vision of a particular world of musicians and their fans, spanning three decades, and even ending sometime in the (near) future: an ambitious goal, and one that is substantially achieved (I have never learned so much about the punk rock scene);<br />2. write from vastly diverse points of views: each time, a different voice matches the different point of view of a different character, and nowhere is this more evident than in the chapter where Rob, the half gay friend of one of the novel's main characters, a mixed-up woman named Sasha, goes swimming in the East River and drowns.<br /><br />This particular chapter, written from the \\"you\\" standpoint is a genuine literary tour de force. Indeed \\"you\\" is a  rare and notoriously hard to manage point of view (most books are written either in the first or third person). Yet the author manages to describe everything that is going on between no less than three characters and also, by adopting the \\"you\\" mode, she succeeds in expressing in an original way the fact that Rob (the one who uses \\"you\\" in the chapter) suffers from identity problems (he's gay, but not quite, he's in love with Sasha but not quite etc.)<br /><br />But there are some drawbacks. For example, one of the last chapters, meant to describe how Sasha eventually finds her own equilibrium in marriage and motherhood, is laid out like a series of scientific diagrams, graphs and boxes of varying shape, that while intriguing (the graphs are imaginatively used), can be irritating. Apart from the fact that it was hard to read on the Kindle(the font size was too small and couldn't be enlarged), it left too much out of what you expect in a work of fiction, in particular with regard to plot development and linkages between characters, events and setting. It was more like a scientific summary than a novel. If intended as an experimental form of fiction, it didn't really work: it left you felt you, the reader, out in the cold, yearning for more. In no way could you connect and enter in the mind of any of the characters ensconced in a diagram. No empathy was possible.<br /><br />Still, in spite of the drawbacks, the book is so innovative and so well written, that I highly recommend it.irritating.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have you ever read a book or watched a movie knowing nothing about it beforehand?  Then been utterly disappointed after having spent the time on such nonsense?  I can't count the number of times this has happened to me.  But on those rare occasions, I've gone in completely blind, which is hard to do these days because media is everywhere, and come out so elated I can't contain myself.  The Hunger Games is one of these rare events.<br /><br />So how did I hear about the book?  Well, my lovely wife recommended I take a read, so I asked her what it's about.  Three words into her description (\\"It's about...\\") I said, \\"You know what? Don't tell me, I want to be surprised.\\"  And from the moment I turned the first page, I was riveted.<br /><br />The premise of this book is like nothing I've read about before.  It's set in the future within a dictatorship regime and each year children are randomly selected to fight to the death for entertainment purposes.  It sounds gruesome and it is, fortunately Collins understands this and doesn't get into the gory details save but a few times when it's necessary.<br /><br />Woven into this dramatic and unnerving theme, is a love story which may sound sappy and unnecessary but it truly adds another dimension to the dynamic relationships between the characters.  Additionally it allows for a few very unexpected, but welcome, surprises.<br /><br />The range of emotions I ran through while reading The Hunger Games was intense.  I'm not an emotional person per se but to find myself feeling dejected, elated, saddened, relieved, enchanted, impassioned, excited all in the first few chapters, I was astounded.  The book is a rollercoaster of a ride, and it doesn't just stop after the first few pages.  The ride continues during the middle and even through to the end.<br /><br />I can't imagine the movie they're making will be nearly as good as the book but who knows.  It will definitely have to be a decent budget for the special effects and over-the-top costumes.  And to have kids face off against one another to the death will be a stretch for Hollywood.  If they stay true to the book and don't glamorize or \\"Hollywood\\" it, they may just pull it off.<br /><br />I will say the only downside to the book, and this is nitpicking, is the writing at times.  For the most part Collins does a good job but at moments, I was a bit thrown off by some of the wording, including the dialog.  Again, this is splitting hairs because the other elements of the book shine.<br /><br />I don't give too many five stars just because I feel a book must truly set itself apart from the rest and really draw me in, but would I recommend this book?  Absolutely, yes.  And I've purposefully refrained from giving details but rather tried to give the emotional feel of the book.  Because if you're like me, not knowing what to expect and then immediately grabbed from page one, is what it's all about.  I'm already in book two (oh it's a trilogy btw) and it's just as good.ff against one another to the death will be a stretch for Hollywood.

B003VR5PPY|4.0|I won't go over the story or setup in detail because there are plenty of reviews that already do that. The story is great, kind of a mixture between SAW, Fringe and the Ace Attorney games. I really liked how they mixed pseudo science and historical fact together. What keeps this from being a perfect game is just how much you have to read. I am not exaggerating when I say you can read for an hour and get maybe 10 minutes of gameplay, and then repeat through the whole game. I almost wish it had been an anime instead of a game. If you don't have a ton of patience, don't get it. But if you're used to reading books on a Kindle, go for it.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|A Poem I wrote after seeing this film. I was substitute teaching in<br />a sixth grade classroom for a few days and the students asked me<br />to watch the movie.<br /><br />I watched a movie early last night,<br />a movie sixth graders had asked me to view.<br />Should I or could I or would I<br />have watched a movie such as this anytime sooner than now?<br />Well, I've seen Schlinder's List<br />and I applauded his try.<br />Then tonight I again viewed a movie with a tear in my eye<br />because I remember when I was 17<br />and on a European study trip into Germany we went.<br />I guess to view a living history<br />that only 19 years earlier was still alive and ill.<br />The showers with no water I walked through.<br />The brick buildings with all the ovens<br />for 1 or 2 or maybe a few.<br />The open ditches for men, women, and children.<br />Yes, those holy burial grounds I found.<br />I remember my pain, my shock, my disbelief.<br />I had read The Diary of Anne Frank,<br />but nothing makes an impression quite like the real thing.<br />I feel kind of sick right now and so to my words and piano I must go.<br />Dear, dear hearts:  my precious little friends who asked me to watch this film,<br />I hope and pray you will always choose somewhere good to go<br />and something good to do because reality can be very, very hard to see.<br /><br />I read my review to that class I was substituting in the following day.

B000HCO83G|5.0|X-Men last stand is the best of the X-Men franchise.  The storyline and special effects are superb.  I can not imagine a reboot can top this.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the original TV Series, so this review will probably be biased.    As soon as the feature starts you can see what's familiar and what's not. The image quality is outstanding for starters and the addition of CGI does wonders to the story without getting in the way, thankfully. What starts as subtle differences soon become the real points that give you a sense of the actual, new direction the filmmakers are taking. This is good. I'm glad it's not just a frame by frame rebuild but rather a re-adaptation. Some scenes you don't get anymore, and to be honest some of them I missed them.     The score is different too and I wonder why they changed it since at most of it to me sounds as good as the original. I'm not very impressed by changes being done just for the sake of change, you're going to take out something, make sure you replace it with something better.    Still, what you get once the credits start rolling is a different sensation. The feature length changes the pace of the original, this one you don't have to absorve it 20 or so minutes at a time, and that's good too.    I can't say yet that this rebuild is better than the original, which I like so much, but it stands on his own as a big promise.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started looking into this series after reading about the Game of Thrones TV series that was in production (at the time) on HBO.  I've been an avid fantasy and science fiction reader for many years, and though there are some parts which might turn off more than a few people, this series of books really drew me in.     The kindle version for me was great.  Actually, I can't imagine anyone finding fault with it.  The chapters were well organized, the menus accessible.  I'm not sure what complainers were expecting from an ebook (I love my kindle btw).  The alternative: lugging around some very thick volumes as you go about your day (this story really is un-put-downable!)  I finished all four volumes in about 3 weeks, but I typically average about 500 pages a day with a normal paperback, so that isn't to say this is a quick read.      GRRM's strength is in his characters.  You will find yourself loving to hate some, and hating to love others.  If you take the dive, you'll see what I mean.  I don't want to spoil it for you.  Mr. Martin seems to take all the old rules about fantasy fiction, or literature in general, and turn them on their collective heads.  Stereotypes?  Pfeh!      If you enjoy political intrigue, drama and great characters which just happen to inhabit a medieval/fantasy setting, you will LOVE this story!  It just works on so many different levels.  When was the last time you read fantasy which was intellectually stimulating?      For those of you with tender sensibilities, I really don't think this is for you.  This is definitely not for kids, or even teens for that matter.  There's a LOT of graphic sex and violence, which is sort of right up HBO's alley.  Yeah, it's that kind of story.  Mr. Martin pulls no punches but by the same token, I don't believe he was being gratuitous either.  I certainly don't think the story would have benefited from being \\"cleansed\\".      I know some fans have pretty big axes to grind with Mr. Martin.  Having just recently come across this series, I haven't had to deal with waiting for over a decade between sequels.  All I can say is, I've already placed my advance order for A Dance with Dragons, and I hope it comes soon.      I'm still looking for something to fill the Song of Ice and Fire void in my reading until A Dance with Dragons comes out.  I guess I'll have to go and re-read the first four volumes again.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|The \\"Stargate\\" franchise has literally run its course, some may feel.  While others feel, similar to the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise, there are many stories that can still be told.<br /><br />From \\"Stargate SG-1' to the animated series \\"Stargate Infinity\\" and then \\"Stargate Atlantis\\", here we are with the final season of \\"Stargate Universe\\", a series that met with fans who were split on whether they enjoyed or disliked the series.  Unfortunately, for this series which began in 2009, there was no renewal for a third season and thus the second season ended with a cliffhanger, just when the series had made some major changes and had gotten better.<br /><br />Should \\"Stargate Universe\\" had a chance to prove itself?  Afterall, even the popular syndicated series \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" had its haters and also didn't do well initially in the ratings, but given the chance to make the series better, it became one of the best \\"Star Trek\\" spinoff.  So, I ask the question again, did SG-U deserve to be cancelled?<br /><br />I'm sure that this will be a debate in which these split fans will continue to have varying opinions but the fact is, \\"Stargate\\" is over and in April 2011, \\"Stargate\\" producer announced that any plans for continuation of \\"Stargate\\" have been cancelled and that he had officially packed his desk.  17 years of \\"Stargate\\" on television and it looks as if this was the final nail on the popular military sci-fi franchise... Or is it?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I have been watching Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper's series and I admit that the first season was OK but the second season was even better.  I do dislike when a series never receives its full run and in this case, ending with a cliffhanger but still, the creators and the fans did all they can to keep the series going and one can hope that the story of \\"Stargate Universe\\" is completed in someway in the near future.  May it be through a film, animation or even a novel, one can only hold on to that hope.<br /><br />But for the fans who stuck with this series from beginning to end, here we are with \\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\\" featuring episode 21-40 on five DVD's and each DVD loaded with special features.  It's a great sendoff for the series and while it may not make up for a lack of closure, this set is an appropriate & special features loaded DVD set for the fans of the series!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\\" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and is presented in Englisy 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As expected with DVD, you're going to see a wee bit of compression, especially since there is a lot of data from the special features and audio commentary included on each disc.<br /><br />It is a shame though that the series that does feature a good amount of detail such as \\"Stargate Universe\\" will not get a Blu-ray release because this is one series that would look awesome in HD!<br /><br />Surprisingly, the PQ is good for DVD and it helps that there are some scenes that are shot outdoors and scenes with a lot of lighting.<br /><br />As for AQ, there are also some episodes that have a good amount of action and therefore you will hear scenes of explosions and laser blasts but once you get to the latter half of the season, this is where you hear the surround channels being utilized.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"SG-U Stargate Universe: The Complete Final Season\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  Robert Carlyle Directs - (4:16) Robert Carlyle (Dr. Nicholas Rush) directs the episode of \\"Pathogen\\".

B0020BUWX2|4.0|Mia`s life suddenly is on the line after the huge car crash.She finds herself not in her body but out of it.She hears all the comments made by her relatives and tries making her decision.Such a sad meaningfull story where she remembers all her memories and of course her boyfriend.I loved reading this book and all the events that were happening made me want to keep reading.You should read this book to learn the importance of loved ones.Although I liked this book,I have to say that it was a little bit not interesting in between the dramatic parts but still an amazing story to read.
B003UESJEM|3.0|SPOILER ALERT (right outta the chute!). I have to ask (no time to read all reviews). Did anyone else just KNOW right away that the character played by Chris Cooper (Phil) would commit suicide? I watched it alone so I can't provide sworn testimony, but within 3 minutes of seeing Phil I said (probably aloud), \\"He's going to kill himself.\\" Either I'm quite prescient or he WAAAAY telegraphed his hand. Not good in Texas Hold'em, or early in a movie, for that matter. Surprised the director didn't do something to disguise the obvious. Kind of wasted the whole 2 minutes leading up to the act.    Overall, pretty good flick. Tommy L Jones was his usual self...comme ci, comme ça. Affleck was a great choice for the lead. As good as I've seen him. The other players were more than adequate. Unless this movie sat on the shelf for a coupla years, I have to wonder why they had it set with Bush as Prez. (Or, maybe I don't, huh?) My own business went into a downward spiral in the fall of '08, and has gotten progressively worse...to the point 5 employees have become 1 - me. That might account for the movie's having gotten no great amount of attention - simply too close to home, though I've yet to reach the point of contemplating joining Phil.    I give it 3&1/2 *'s.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|Yup, that's about it... it's okay.  Love cheesy horror flicks, B movies, car movies, etc so this is watchable.  Is it a movie I would watch again and again... um nah, just didn't hit me that way but hey it was alright.... Just so you can have a reference to my tastes: Army of Darkness is one I could watch again and again so if your tastes are like mine then go ahead and spend the buck to rent it from Redbox... wouldn't buy.
B0009S2T0M|1.0|I'm sorry that you have been tricked but this movie is not the real oldboy.  It is in fact an imposter. The real Oldboy is a Japanese manga that is sold  by Dark Horse Comics. The real Oldboy is Shinichi Goto not Oh Dae Su.  The two are only real similar in title only. The movie is simply using  the Old Boy name. If you want a story that is cheap thrills, shock and awe,  stupid plot twists, one dimensional characters and pseudo artistic style  then this movie is for you. However if you want a great plot, excellent  iconic characters, a classic noir style, and one of the greatest cat and  mouse chases in literature then read the manga of the same name.     Shinichi Goto pummels Oh Dae Su
B004XZ99LO|1.0|I purchased this from amazon and it would not play on both a sony and samsung 3d bluray player.  It would either eject and say disc error or load forever, or occasionally make it to the menu, but the movie would only play for a few seconds then lock up.  Even though I've never had a bad dvd or bluray before I thought that particular disc must of been bad.  I sent it back to amazon and they sent me another brand new one.  Guess what?  Same exact problem.    Sony also makes the swimsuit sports illustrated 3d bluray and it plays fine along with all my other 3D and 2D blurays and dvds.    The few seconds I saw of the film between it locking up did show great 3D and was really pretty to look at, I wish I could watch the whole thing.
B003UESJEW|5.0|[[VIDEOID:ee1f1d68d9d1a7333e7ff7e5d2a5df62]] A time will come in which the current crisis caused by the sharks of Wall Street and the banks, among others, is going to be examined in more detail by Hollywood. We need a strong testament about how greed is always a cause for so much misery - even if we don't learn from it. Perhaps the riveting and unforgettable \\"The Company Men\\" will suffice for now. It is a warning call for those who watch it and those who have been suffering due to our present economic mess.<br /><br />Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is a young, successful high-profile executive at GTX (Global Transportation Systems). Just when everything is going well for him, he is informed that there has been a consolidation at the corporation, and that his position has become redundant. Because of this, he is fired. As you can imagine, everything down spirals for him from then on. He lives in a big house, drives a fancy car and has a beautiful wife and two children. With time, pressure begins mounting and he can not make payments anymore. He tries to look for jobs, but has no success. Eventually, Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), one of his co-workers, is also fired, as well was Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), who happened to be their boss. Curiously, Gene, together with James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), were two of the original employees of GTX. Salinger eventually becomes the owner of the company and begins consolidating his power, guided by greed and corporate sharing. He uses Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) as his henchwoman, who is in charge of downsizing personnel. The film guides us through the lives of Walker, McClary, and Wood ward, as they desperately try to survive.<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\" is honest and eye-opening. It tells us that we are all together in the current state of things - in this particular case, the movie focuses on extremely highly-paid employees, including a millionaire. It shows the evolution of despair in great detail, and how it affects the family and the self-respect of the individuals who are victims of downsizing. It also shows the role of wives in sharing the pain. The film also stars Kevin Costner as Bobby's brother-in-law. The way the movie ends, I won't be surprised if there is a sequel - it screams for one. \\"The Company Men\\" is a great companion to \\"Wall Street,\\" and Ben Affleck's character will remind you to the one that he played in \\"Jersey Girl.\\" The Blu-ray edition also includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, making-of documentary, and audio commentary by writer-director John Wells. (UK/USA, 2010, color, 105 mins plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on June 12, 2011 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Anchor Bay Entertainment Blu-ray.iduals who are victims of downsizing.

B002RKSZKI|4.0|Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.  Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice.
B004RSCWZ2|3.0|I wanted to like this album, I really did.  Unfortunately, I'm not really liking it as much as I thought I would.  I'll echo what a couple of other reviewers have said.  If you're a Susan Tedeschi fan, I'd recommend this CD.  Unfortunately after a couple of times through, I couldn't listen to her voice any more.  Her singing on every song sounds exactly the same.  There are no dynamics to her singing and her tone, phrasing, style and nuances are identical on every single song.  For me, it got old really quickly.  The best part of the CD is Derek Trucks and the rest of the band.
B004Y03LQ2|1.0|I know this is a worthless release for the Iron Maiden fan that owns all the albums...but I bought it anyway because I such a diehard that I like reading the liner notes/essays that usually come inside.    However, I can't find out anywhere if there's a decent booklet/liner notes contained.  And I don't want to open it to find out, because then I can't return it to the store.    Has anyone actually opened this item, and if so, can anyone tell me what type of booklet is inside?    Thanks.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Hands down, one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  From the beats, to the flow, to the lyrics, this album is simply amazing.  This is a must buy!!

B0019NG73G|1.0|I have the regular DVD in 4:3 Ratio and was looking forward to this Blu Ray release.  I even bought a new Panasonic blu ray player just for this movie.  Upon first viewing, It seemed like everything is too dark with poor shadow detail, even after color adjustments. I have a Panasonic 1080p plasma HDTV and I can tell  when picture quality is not there. It is sharp but I think there is something wrong with the transfer to Blu ray.  Maybe there will be a REDUX/REMASTER   version released next year.  The movie itself is excellent all the way through, no problem with the movie itself.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|The movie itself is pretty good to me.  It's an adrenaline rush.  If you like movies like Independence Day, War of The Worlds, or even more recent movies like Skyline, Predators, Expendables, Rambo, or District 9, then you should like this movie.  Definitely a summertime easy going entertaining movie.  I wouldn't call it \\"essential\\" but it's good to watch and nice to show off.    Now to my rant....    I don't know why in 2011 that a brand new movie would come out and not be packaged with a digital copy.  Then have the AUDACITY to price it at $25! (as compared to True Grit last week priced at 17.99 with DVD, BluRay and Digital Copy).  Don't get me wrong...I'm a movie buff.  I buy blu-rays at a rate that I can't possibly maintain but I feel that at $25 I need the BluRay, 3D, DVD and Digital copy and probably in steelbook form or blu ray sleeve (like Tron when it first came out).  If Boondock Saints (a ten year old movie) can get a digital copy then there's no excuse.    That's it for this useless review.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|If you're into the actual history behind the miniseries the books are much, much better.  Many liberties have been taken with the stories to make it into a Hollywood production.  If you actually care about what happened and the men who fought the war read the books.  If you want to see a \\"based on a true story\\" Hollywood movie, you might enjoy it.  It doesn't come close to Band of Brothers.
0743496736|3.0|This is the first Jodi Picoult novel I've read, though I did see the movie My Sister's Keeper and didn't care for it. Because of that, I really wasn't expecting much from Nineteen Minutes. However, from the moment I picked up this novel I didn't want to put it down. Although I think that there was a lot of repetitive filler dealing with some of the main characters' feelings/issues (Alex Cormier and Lacy Houghton in particular), the back and forth between present and past certainly kept me guessing regarding the ending...for a while. Unfortunately, I disagree with other reviewers that the twist in this book was amazing. Although I hadn't figured out the exact details, it becomes pretty obvious that a certain character or two knows something they aren't revealing and one can certainly, as I did, hazard an educated guess as to the nature of said secret. 3.5/5 stars
B003Y3MYWW|5.0|I have acquired all of the Bartok recordings of Zoltan Kocsis, not from this product, but from individual compact discs that I've purchased separately, one by one.  The recordings by Mr. Kocsis are of the highest artistic merit.  The engineering of these recordings is excellent too.  These recordings are not encumbered by shortcomings sometimes found in other piano recordings, such as, muddiness or too many echos.  However, the product under review has a tiny little problem.  The title is NOT correct.  Is this the \\"complete\\" solo piano music, as is proclaimed by the title of this product? No, sorry, it is not. The most amazing solo piano composition by Bela Bartok has been omitted, namely, Bartok's piano version of his CONCERTO FOR ORCHESTRA. There is only one commercially available recording of this captivating and exciting piano solo piece, namely, that recorded by Gyorgy Sandor and available on the Sony label (MK 44526).    Please see a published review of Mr. Bartok's piano transcription, which I posted below in the COMMENTS SECTION.  The published review is by Bernard Holland, and is entitled, \\"MUSIC; Looking at the Big Picture in a Small Way, and Vice Versa\\" (September 16, 1990).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is well written with many unexpected turns. I coudn't put it down but strong caution! This book is by far the most violent of the three. The first books were violent but nothing compared to this. Be sure to check it out before you let your kids read it. Despite the major violence, it was very well written and went in many unexpected directions. Despite the turns, it ends in my opinion close to perfection.

B002R88G5E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Kite Runner and it was with some trepidation that I read this book; not convinced that it could be as good, however I am glad to say that I was wrong. Hosseini has a way of drawing you into the lives of his characters so you feel apart of it.  Even though the lives of the two Afghani women he portrays in this book are far removed from my own cushy Western existence I found I could easy relate to them...feel their frustrations and disappointments.  I highly recommend this book.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm an audio book guy with my Kindle (45 minute drive to work) - I purchased this book a while ago and enjoyed it a lot.  I went to reread the book (or have it read to me on my commute) and found that text-to-speach had been disabled recently.  Why?<br /><br />That's what keeps my from giving it a 5 star rating.  The book is good.  I enjoyed the personal story format - it kept the story bouncing around the world with different veiwpoints on the same overall disaster.  Recommend.
0312323867|5.0|I read both Something Borrowed and Something Blue. I also saw Something Borrowed at the movies. Both books were enjoyable, but I enjoyed Something Blue much, much more.  I really wish they will make it a sequel to Something Borrowed it will be awesome to see Something Blue up in the big screen. Love it

0811870413|3.0|I've just begun to use this book, so this is a preliminary opinion but--it's surprisingly badly edited, in that the instructions are so vague. To mix a starter, e.g., we're told to fill \\"a small container\\" halfway with water. Please, why on earth not give a measurement: use a standard-measure cup of water? a standard-measure half-cup of water? a standard-measure 1 1/2 cups of water? Containers can range a fair amount in size and still be small. We're told to add \\"a handful of flour\\" to make a \\"thick batter.\\" If a handful of flour produces a thin batter, have we used too much water? Should we start again with less? Or should we just keep adding flour? If we add three or four handfuls of flour and the batter is thicker but it's still questionable whether to call it \\"thick,\\" have we probably added enough, or did we really start with too much water? If the latter, is it ok to keep going with more flour, would that just mean we'd end up with a lot of starter, or should we probably start again with less water? Then \\"place in a cool, shaded spot for 2 or 3 days.\\" In much of the U.S.--unless you run a/c 24/7, even when you're at work--the only cool spot in summer is your refrigerator. But--is that cool? Or is that cold--cold enough to kill a starter? Between your kitchen closet and your refrigerator, which is the better bet--or should you just forget about breadmaking in summer and wait until fall? Photos alongside the text I think are meant to help guide us, but they're decoratively blurred, printed in a faded, bleached b&w--not clear enough to be completely clarifying, particularly with scale. More important, there are no captions. Which means there's no sense of time: is this photo how the starter's meant to look when you first mix it? Or after that 2 or 3 days?     And this is the first page of the first recipe.    It's a very handsome book--and the bread looks wonderful--but it's one of those books where more thought has gone into the *style* of the writing, and into the design, than into how best to communicate to the reader. The imagined audience seems to live in the cool climate of San Francisco or rural Marin County; there's no attempt whatsoever to imagine the range of circumstances in which a reader might live. Incidentally, I've made bread many times before, I'm not coming to it for the first time; I just think a book like this should be clearly written.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am not a minimalist by any means, but Ms. Minimalist thoroughly enticed me with her blog about simple living.<br /><br />I stumbled across her site during a desperate attempt to declutter. Wow, less is actually more. How can that be? Logical? Maybe not in our consumer culture, but refreshing? It definitely is.<br /><br />As a person who grew up thinking that abundance and excess were the norm, I appreciate Ms. Minimalist's approach to minimalism. She doesn't overcomplicate the idea of minimalism. Basically, you should dictate the course of your life; don't let (your) stuff do it for you. Let everything that you decide to keep have a purpose (or many purposes), and don't keep stuff just to have stuff.  Know that it's ok to not have to keep up with the Joneses (who are actually having a hard time keeping up with themselves). You don't have to upgrade your cellphone whenever a new model comes out, or get a new car every few years, or spend umpteen hours and dollars taking pretty pictures to post on your Facebook account to outdo the Joneses (phew, thank goodness!)<br />There's wisdom in this kind of advice, a wisdom missing from our culture of consumerism that can be had by perusing the pages of this eBook, which is a compilation of 60 articles/ posts from her blog.<br /><br />I don't know if i agree with everything in the book, but this is still comforting advice for hard times, compiled into a cute, easily accessible eBook that takes up no room at all and can be lent to your friends or anyone you see fit. Definitely worth the 99 cents.

1400052181|4.0|I'm entering college this fall, and my school is making the freshmen read this book and write a short paper about it. I'm sure that without being forced into it in the first place, I would have never even picked up this book. But I'm glad I did! Although it's a bit boring at times, and the writing is a little too \\"dulled\\" for my liking (however intended it may have been by the author), I can say that I am still thoroughly enjoying the story of Mrs. Lacks so far; I'm about half-way through.    It really opens up a knew world for me racially. I've read Roots, and it gave me an insight of how African-American slaves were treated. But I've never read anything on the \\"contemporary existence\\" of the African-American population. This book takes place during the time when segregation was popular and where the white population commonly took advantage of the black population. I won't give away any details, but ultimately this book is not only a science and history lesson, but a lesson in cultural studies.     The Immortal life of Henrietta Lacks is a job well done!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I watched this movie and it was really awsome and totally action-pack movie that I seen in a while and I would gives this movie a 10/10 for this movie,
B002VPE1AW|4.0|When I first saw this film I was floored by the grandeur and visual effects in this movie when I saw it at IMAX. The level of detail and the vividness of the colors were absolutely amazing. You could almost feel what it was like to be on Pandora while watching the film. My biggest issue with the movie was that anyone that is familiar with Disney's \\"Pochahontas\\" could very easily predict where the storyline was headed. For an adult at times the film was a yawn due to the inevitability of the plot, but my children and teenage son were enraptured throughout the entire film. My family has re-watched Avatar many times, but without the excitement of 3D and a giant IMAX screen I can't say that it was as thrilling as the first go-round. It is a wonderful movie and I wholeheartedly believe that deserves the accolades it received for breakthroughs in filming technology, however the story telling just isn't there for an adult audience.

B004K4AUZW|1.0|except copy this way from great madonna and judas, this album is a holy crap.   far away from the fame monster.   I don't understand why some monsters(most of them are 14 to 18 years old around) like GAGA because she is unique?   really? dresses like a drag queen? talk like a monster without mind? Is this these little moster fond of her?   Unlike the fame moster, this album is a crap, GAGA now mainly focus on how to sell albums, how to make the numbers good, how to attract people's attention with worse dressing, is this really fashion??? ugly, only this word can describe what GAGA has done now.   Some may say GAGA has many followers on facebook, oh, come on,then why so many of them don;t buy her music?   just because they add GAGA because people are curious about why many people add her.   GAGA;s team now work on internet, hire some people to write articles to praise her,please keep your eyes open monsters. Don;t just be a fool.  Songs  in this album mostly sound like noise, come on you guys ,you must admit that. I see some compliments on amzaon, just can`t understand. Must admit the fame monster is good, but this album? oh no.I think amazon's compliments contain some GAGA's hard core,so whatever this crap is, the result in their eyes is good. Poorly sad,you monsters always said you have your own ideas,but this time, you are misled,really indeed.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This movie, coupled with Expendables, really made my year in action flicks.    If you like Angelina (or even if you don't care for her), if you love action movies... this is a must see!    Great twist at the end... and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|Remember seeing this when it was first released, was part of a small film festival doing the rounds of towns in New Zealand. Was already a big DC fan at the time, went along with some mates, we were all blown away! Definitely made some converts that day. First time I have watched it since then, still awesome! AC/DC (with Bon) at their very best. Would recommend this to any rock fan. Big thanks to Amazon for shipping it out so quickly.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|When Paul McCartney released his first solo album and the first true solo studio album by a Beatle in 1970, it was almost universally panned. While it certainly doesn't matchup with any of the Beatles albums, it has aged better than a lot of the music of the time. Mr. McCartney recorded the album at his farm and its greatest asset is the simple, down-home feel that permeates it. You can almost picture the newlywed and new father just tooling around the house and living the country life and whenever the mood struck him, laying down a new track. He plays all the instruments and other than some backing vocals by Linda, sings all the songs. There are several instrumentals on the album and a couple of songs like \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" that are basically just a couple of lines sung over and over, but \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is a true gem. The song ranks up there with anything he's done in his solo career and a wouldn't be slighted by songs in the Beatles catalog. Other standout tracks include the sweet \\"Every Night\\", \\"Junk\\" & \\"That Would Be Something\\" & \\"Teddy Boy\\". There are a few too many instrumentals like \\"Hot As Sun/Glasses\\", the bizarre, jungle like \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" and an unneeded instrumental version of \\"Junk\\".  Despite the wish for more fully composed songs, the half-completed tracks and instrumentals add to the album's rustic charm.  Of the three outtakes from the original album sessions, none of them really add much with the best of three ironically being an instrumental \\"Don't Cry Baby\\".
B002SRQ214|5.0|I bought this back in December of 2010 and have run every stress test I can think of and this thing just doesn't stop impressing me. I have run this chip with a variety of different programs, games, speed configurations, graphics cards, etc and it only get's better. Let's start with a very known issue so I can save any new owners a lot of headaches! I have seen several complaints about the fan spinning out of control and sounding like a jet engine, this does happen but is VERY easy to fix. The reason it's spinning at max is because you have to instal the UI suite that comes with the motherboard. I have this on an Asus 880TG Evo mobo which comes with bundled software to control the fan speed. Once this is adjusted it is as quiet as it gets.    System Specs:    -Phenom II 965 BE 3.4 GHZ OC'd to 3.6 auto 3.9 at Load via Turbo Unlocker  -16 GB DDR3 1333  -Asus AM3 880EVO Motherboard with CPU and Ram unlockers  -Cooler Master V6 GT CPU cooler (2x120mm fans push / pull)  -Cooler Master HAF 922 with stock and additional fans installed ( 3x 200mm, 2x 120mm )  -4 Optical drives ( 1 LG BD-R, 1 Pioneer Blu Ray read only, and 2x HP dvd/dvd-r)  -2x Hitachi Deskstar HDD ( 1x 2tb Sata III 7200 RPM and 1x 1TB Sata II 7200 RPM )  -AMD Radeon 6970 2Gb DDR5 OC'd to 900 MHZ and 1400 MHZ mem clock ( only a 20 and 70 Mhz difference from stock ) GPU fan at 50%   -2x Samsung P2770 1ms 1080P displays  -Cooler Master Silent Pro Gold 800w 80 plus gold PSU  -Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit    Since building this system I have been asked to build 4 just like it by friends and family once they see how it performs. Crysis, Crysis2, Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Metro 2033, Portal 2, Brink, Bulletstorm, Alien Vs. Predator, and Fallout New Vegas all run at max resolution at at least 60-90 fps.  System Idle, and Load temps are a little high with the stock cooler but not at any dangerous levels. The stock cooler also includes a heatsink with heat pipes that does help a little butif you plan to overclock then you will want to look into an aftermarket cooling option.    Stock Temps:  -Idle 34c  -Load max temp 52c (Crysis)    Temps with V6 GT  - Idle 26c  - Load max 36c (Crysis)    OC'd to 3.9 with V6 GT  - Idle 28c  - Load Max 42c (Crysis)    But keep in mind this is also with 5 system fans, temps will vary depending on internal components and the size of the case and room temp's. So as you can see this is definately a great chip for any style user. I don't recomend the x6 cores because the clock speeds are lower and applications do not yet utilize the extra 2 cores. The 970 and 980 Phenom II's only add an extra 100 and 200 mhz easily achieved by OC'ng the 965. This is a great chip that I recomend to anyone who doesn't want to fork out an extra 200-300 bucks for the same performance from an intel CPU.
B004WJREMW|3.0|McCartney II finds Paul McCartney losing Wings and heading back to style of recording he did on his first solo album. Instead of the down home, easy stylings of the first record, McCartney II finds him experimenting with the new wave, electronic sounds of the time. The album is heavily drenched with keyboards and while it doesn't always work, the spirit of the attempt is true. \\"Coming Up\\" is an excellent, funky song that in a live version would be his first number one song of the 80's. There are two instrumentals, \\"Frozen Jap\\" and \\"Front Parlour\\" aren't too impressive. \\"Waterfalls\\" is a good ballad as is \\"One Of These Days\\". Some of the bonus tracks are interesting. \\"Blue Sway\\" (the first version) is a string-laden almost disco like song.  \\"Mr. H Atom\\" is a strange chanted like song and \\"Secret Friend\\" is a ten minute spaced out number that ranks as one of the most experimental things he's ever done.
B002ZG974W|5.0|This movie is too cute. I love to put it on while I'm relaxing or if I want something playing in the background. It is interesting to see how these babies are raised in different cultures. Instead of the normal documentary with the commentary, I love the music so you can focus on what the babies are doing, not what a narrator is interpreting about what the babies are doing.
B004DL5K2K|4.0|I have to agree with another reviewer who observed that the high end has been boosted quite a bit, and the bottom end seems to lack punch.  The mastering is unnecessarily loud and compressed, but tolerable for the most part.  There are worse remasters out there.  However, I find myself having to tone down the treble and up the bass to strike a suitable balance.  Beyond that it's nice to have the original unmolested tracks re-issued, so it deserves an extra star for that, otherwise I'd only give it 3.  If there was ever a metal album worthy of an audiophile remaster on a superior format (such as SHM-SACD), this one truly deserves it.  Your average consumer won't notice or care either way, so this remaster will satisfy 95% of potential buyers out there.  Die hard fans who are cursed audiophiles might want to stick to their original CDs, LPs, or imports, and pray that the remastering gods will grace us with an analog mastering on a digital format worthy of being called definitive.

B004VQK9XW|5.0|Love this cd!  The lyrics are spectacular.  I love the fact that each song has its own feel and sound.  My only gripe would be the 25-30 second silence at the beginning of the first track.  I'm impatient.  I don't like sitting and waiting that long for the music to start after putting the cd in the player.  Maybe it's just my copy, but it's irritating enough that I ripped the cd to my hard drive, edited the first track, then burned a whole new cd.

1439152780|1.0|I forced myself to finish this, convinced all the while that if someone had gone through the book and arbitrarily deleted every third word, the story would still be too long, too cluttered with extraneous characters, and too needlessly convoluted.  Do we really need a painstaking description of every rosebud on every teacup, while the main characters are lifeless stereotypes?  Were all the judicious editors in the UK on holiday when this was published?  Definitely a loser!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|If you wear your Plantronics 6 hours a day, like I do (comfortably) you'll still need to buy a pack of these at some point, because of the wear and tear on the delicate soft plastic (I don't use the foam).  Buy a pack now so you'll know where they are, in your desk drawer.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|-Some might say I'm giving Nightwish too much credit. Granted, coming from such a Nightwish fan as myself, it's inevitable that this statment is at least slightly biased, but whether or not you agree with me, there's no denying that Once rules.   Once is for me, their greatest work, which is obviously saying alot when you take a good look at all that this band has accomplished over their many years in exsistance. Toumas has never come up with such powerfull compositions ever. Some of the most memorable Nightwish tunes can be found here, as well as some of the finest lyrics. In this style of metal, genuinly good lyrics are somewhat difficult to come by. Nightwish comes down like a breath of fresh air with their poetic, but not overly pretintious lyrics, which I really appriciate about this band. Then there's the legendary Tarja. It will come as no suprise to fans that her vocal duties on this album are amazing. She simpily washes the floor with 90% of the compitition in female fronted metal, leaving her as one of the undisputed godesses of this genre. She has the ability to effortlessly hit notes that would split the necks of the majority of 'soprano singers' out there, but not only is her technique worthy of worship, but the way in which she lays out the melodys that thoumas writes is truely a marvel. The emotional convection of Tarja's voice takes the listener on a magical journey that can really only be described as... Nightwish. It is a spiritual journey, exploring the emotions of the soul. Tragedy and sadness, yet with a constant shining ray of hope ever present on this record. And of course, you can't forget about Marco, who took the role as co-vocalist on their previous release 'Century Child.' He quickly made a name for himself as a singer more than capable of complimenting Tarja with his instantly recognizable vocals. Intense and filled with rage, he sores high above the moon with his chilling voice, that contrasts greatly with tarja's equally chilling but less angry vocals. It is my belief that Marco is the best thing that ever happened to Nightwish, and is perhaps the greatest male singer in Finland. Unfortanetly it took me a little while to hop on board, seeing as Marco's vocals is somthing that you either love or hate. Needless to say at this point, I'm a HUGE fan of now, so that it has become difficult for me to decide whom I prefer between the two singers. I'll just leave it at this, they both rule.   Emmpu Vourian is in my opinion, one of the most underrated guitar players in metal, primarily due to the fact that he doesent shred at lightning speed. That just isn't his style, and thank god for that, because it really wouldn't work for Nightwish's sound. Whether or not he is genuinly capable of shredding is irrevelent. His heavy riffage, and magical yet tastefull soloing is one of the primary sources of the Nightwish formula. Don't overlook his subtle touch.  Next is Jukka. His drumming is simple, but heartfelt, and he creates the heartbeat of the band in a way that few drummers can. His performance here is perhaps his best.  Now, the reason I say that this is amoung the most influencial albums in metal, is for the simple reason that these is the blueprints of modern symphonic power metal. Granted, Nightwish is not the first to have done this, but they are the best ever to do it, and there is no other band that has captured the world beneath the spell that has been cast by Nightwish. This is a spell that has created a legion of immatators. Female fronted metal can be summed up in four names. The Gathering, After Forever, Epica and Nightwish. All else in female fronted power/symphonic/gothic metal bows before them. They are the big four of these subgenres.  Notable tracks:  Ghost Love Score  The Siren  Planet hell  Higher than Hope  Nemo  Dark Chest of Wonders  This is my somewhat less than humble opinion of a band that I owe my Alligance. Buy it if you have ever cared for symphonic metal.
6305076995|4.0|I cannot say enough good things about this concert film.  It is a treasure.  For fans of Yes music and fans of good music of any kind, including but not limited to progressive rock, this period in Yes' history is the absolute pinacle.  The members of Yes at this point in time are considered by most to be the best of the best, and the definitive Yes group.  Yes has changed personnel more often than most bands, but this quintet is the real deal, not only maximizing their individual roles within the band, but having actual musical chemistry.  A side note is that Bill Bruford and Alan White actually both played on different tracks, but either one are excellent and both are considered Yes rock royalty.    All that said, why haven't the band members, who have made millions of dollars of the Yes brand, and who continue to adore their fans by continuing to tour ad infinitem, and who therefore continue to sell tickets to their shows, which means a lot of money going into their pockets. Why, oh why, can they not bring themselves to finance a blu ray remastering of both the sound and picture of the only recorded film of their greatest tour.  I know I am not alone in having listened to the Yessongs vinyl triple LP live version of this concert and imagined in our collective imaginations what visuals would match those sounds.  Certainly, with today's technology, this cannot be it.  Certainly, tapes must exist of both the audio and video tracks that could be restored to the extent possible then transfered to a blu ray version of this movie with at minimum 2.0 Dolby Digital sound.    Please Jon, Steve, Chris, Bill, and Rick (and Alan).   Are you listening Trevor Horn? I know you know how to produce a great sounding recording (90125).  Can you help the boys out?    Thanks for your consideration.

B00005NVDF|4.0|This is one of the funniest and 'tightest' of Woody Allen's early period films, which is interesting since it is one of the few that he wrote and acted in (and therefore can be considered as part of his body of work) but did not himself direct.  The way Herbert Ross sees Allen's comedy (as expressed through both his writing and performance) seems less 'self-indulgent' (for lack of a better term, though not really fair) than the comedy Allen enacts in films of his own directing.  (A point of comparison that will hopefully clarify what I mean here is that between the 'meeting the blind date' scene in this film and the 'product testing' scene near the opening of \\"Bananas\\", and the difference between the former deriving its comedy from a more distanced observance of the situation and the latter's 'personalization' of it through the use of close-ups on Allen's responses to what is occurring (which approaches 'mugging').)

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Super 8 is a throwback of sorts to the storytelling that made 80's films like E.T. so compelling. Only this time around there is an added dose of menace. The trailers didn't give too much away, which made the movie seem mysterious and boring at the same time, when it's far from the latter. Basically, a train crashes while a group of kids are filming a zombie movie. Something breaks out of the train and strange things start to happen in the neighboring small town. All of the dogs run away and people go missing. I'm not going to spoil the surprises, since it was a much better experience for me not knowing. The CGI is very good and the all the kid actors are convincing.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams may have stolen a lot of Spielberg's charms here, but it is rare thing these days to watch a summer film that relies on it's story,  acting and nostalgia, rather than just loud explosions and CGI overkill.
0316067938|5.0|Wow such an amazing book. I really think that it was a great ending to this great series! All of those reviews that rip it apart are just plain rude and they wish they could write such an amazing novel! Seriously if you don't like it then fine but don't be so rude to the author and the fans of the book.     This novel was a great way to tie off the series and i thought SM did great in making a family that was so closely knit! A FANTASTIC BOOK! It is in my top three favorite books of all time along with \\"The Host\\". SM is a great author with a great story!    I would recommend this book to everyone who likes a good fantasy and love story! Way to go Stephenie!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Having seen every episode except the finale, I feel that it's time for me to write this review. After watching the first episode I was hooked and I decided to buy the first four novels together in paperback soon after (for less than $20!). I have been keeping pace with each episode and I'm surprised how much they have translated from book to screen. At the rate I'm going I'll be finished with the first book a couple of days after the final episode ends this Sunday (800 plus pages in a month is fast for me). Having seen the show first actually helped me visualize the book and the huge number of characters within it.<br /><br />The enormous cast is excellent in every role. I can't picture anyone other than Sean Bean as Ned Stark and Peter Dinklage steals every scene, much as his character does in the book, as Tyrion Lannister. The visuals are big budget movie calibur and the writing, thanks to the outstanding source material, is better than anything I've seen on TV or at the movies in a long time. The Lord of the Rings trilogy are really good fantasy movies of course, but the lack of eye rolling dialogue found in Game of Thrones really puts it a notch above. Plus you get the added gore and sex that just adds to the realism.<br /><br />HBO is back on the map with high quality shows like this and Boardwalk Empire. Here is to hoping the show last the 7 seasons (one for each book) it needs to tell the complete story.<br /><br />Edit 6/24/2011: I saw the finale and loved every minute. Bring on Spring 2012!
0061134007|4.0|As a fan of Nordic Noir perhaps I set the bar too high for my first Jo Nesbro novel.  The Redbreast was just ok. I liked Harry Hole a lot so I will read another book with his character but I found this plot slightly boring  - I just couldn't get that interested in the war sections and I thought maybe the translation was just a little bumpy. Not the worst book but not the best to come out of Scandinavia.
B004XQO90O|2.0|A film that's been done to death (pardon the pun) many times before. Or has it?   Maybe it's me - perhaps I keep re-living someone else's life and I'm sitting in   a cinema watching a film about a man who goes back in time to save lives but doesn't   quite succeed the first five times but then does and then falls in love and goes on   a date with his new girl and they sit in a cinema and watch a film about a man who   travels back in time to save lives but doesn't quite succeed but then does and then   falls....etc etc.  Ad nauseum.  This was a much-hyped film that failed in just every department. A huge disappointment.  I think I've said that before.......
B000JLSM00|5.0|Work Great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a book that will hook you on the first chapter. Once you start reading you can't stop. Twists in the plot come nearly every page, and they are always a HUGE suprise. Even after you're done reading this book it will keep you up at night thinking about it.     Katniss is a character nearly every one can relate to in some way. She lost her father when she was young, she's a amazing hunter etr...     All I have left to say, is READ the Hunger Games!
B003NFM3JU|1.0|Be careful with \\"New Town Videos\\". I only bought this Blu-ray because of the 3D version, but for my disappointment it didn`t come. The case, which came with no plastic protection, suppose to have 4 discs and it came with only 3. It was missing just the one I wanted: the 3D version. I am very disappointed!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It takes a lot to interest me in a book...but Suzanne did it with this one.  From page one I could not put it down.  Cannot wait to purchase book two!
B002JVWQT6|5.0|There is a reason that this show has won multiple Emmy's in it's first year.    It is funny, sometimes poignant, always satisfying. The writing and the acting are simply amazing.    WARNING: It is impossible to catch all the jokes in one viewing. Watch each episode a minimum of 2 times.
B000JIJPZY|4.0|I bought this for my daughter to have at daycare. I liked that it was narrow & portable! Fits perfectly in a portable crib too.   I give it 4 stars because it's a good product for what it is; however, if your baby is rolling, get a different one. I wish I would have bought this when she was 2 months old not 4. She rols to much & needs a larger mat now.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Battle LA is fast paced and aggressively filmed. True, it's derivative of a lot of other films but it still manages to be great in its own right. The dialogue is terrible a couple times but the actors do a good job of making it convincing. The action scenes are compelling and immersive. Music is great and the film even manages a couple very heartfelt sequences. If you liked District 9 or Black Hawk Down, you owe it to yourself to see Battle Los Angeles.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|Not being acquainted with the original series, the fascination for this live action version was completely lost on me.  Why was there a chimpanzee with this family and who names their kid Speed?  Given the negative connotations, maybe Speedy would have been better.<br /><br />They left me behind immediately, all the flashing colors and rapid cuts: no rest for the eye, where was I supposed to look?  Oh sure, the story was basic enough, too easy to follow, no surprises (the phrase 'a foregone conclusion' springs to mind), but did it have to be so long?  I could have also done without the six million flashbacks; it started feeling as if they were in a time warp.<br /><br />Throughout my viewing ordeal I kept wondering why the excess?  Why the garish overuse of color?  Why do the cars slide/glide instead moving the way real cars do?  I'd accuse this movie of being too cartoony but that would be redundant under the circumstances.<br /><br />(Even more disconcerting are the charges of animal cruelty on the set during filming.)<br /><br />It's watchable, I'll give it that, but not a keeper.
0345529057|5.0|20$ for 4 new books is already a steal. These are compelling reads with deep plots and diverse characters. I would suggest these to anyone who likes to read. They are not too fantasy or medieval to get stuck just playing those roles. War, romance, politics, religion... it's all incorporated in Martin's amazing world. And of course Amazon.coms service was exceptional as usual.
0761158820|5.0|Get this!  At <12 USD, you get 50 pages (50 times) of fun with your kids, assembling it.... literally >50hrs of fun.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I pit this app on my phone and now I can't keep my kids off of it. my five and ten year old both love the game as do my husband and I. It is simple to learn and keeps you zones in. It is not gory or gross at all, its more comical.
B004SBQALA|5.0|This movie is great and is even better in blu ray.  This movie is one of my top ten favorites.  It's a movie you wouldn't mind watching over and over.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Okay so this book is probably one of the saddest yet true to life books I've ever read. I recommend it to everyone!!!! Its about a boy, Clay, who receives tapes from the girl that killed herself, Hannah. As the plot develops we find out what led Hannah to do this and what part Clay and 12 others play into this.   In my life I've had to unfortunately experience the death of someone I loved through suicide. And I believe that Asher (sp?) did a fantastic job of demonstrating some of the after effects of suicide and how everything you do effects people. Though I don't feel as though he showed the even harsher realities of suicide like how permanent it is and that there normally won't be an explanation or a way for answers to be given. He also neglects to really emphasize how selfish suicide by nature is, especially by avoiding any real mentions of Hannah's parents and how it effected them, etc. But overall this book is powerful and moving. Clay's character is relate-able and honestly one of the few characters (out of the literally hundreds of books I've read) that I really felt could've been me or someone I know. His character's reaction is realistic and pure.   This is one of my favorite books of all time and if you haven't read it-Do!
0061353248|5.0|This is such an interesting book. Written in part from a personal angle, but reviewing so much solid research about human problems and biases from someone who has contributed such a great deal to this area. Easy to read, but you learn such a lot about strange behavioural effects. Well worth it.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|As a Sherlock Holmes purist, I initially avoided renting this movie, as I think of Holmes and Watson  as older men, but once rented, I was hooked! Subsequently, I ordered the Blu-Ray, and don't regret it!  I think the sound editing alone was worth an Academy Award nomination. Also the soundtrack was superb,  with the occasional Middle Eastern music, for effect.  Both Edward Downey jr. and Jude Law were perfect for their parts. By going with the flow, and ignoring  my \\"older persons\\" concept, I think this film, with the gratuitous supernatural flavor, really rocked!  Two minor flaws, which don't lower my five star rating: Edward Downey jr. would occasionally speak in  a whisper, which I found inaudible. The worst flaw I found, however (correct me, if I'm wrong) is my  understanding that Irene Adler was an actual stage actress of that era. That being the case, the lady  chosen to play Adler, with her high pitched voice, has no stage presence at all. I found it interesting,  however, that the movie portrays Ms. Adler as an intellectual equal to Holmes.  I'm quite surprised that this excellent film (my favorite for the year), is selling so cheaply, in  Blu-Ray. This film deserves more respect.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|A young woman, growing up in a small town where everybody seems to think they know what's best for her, is just becoming aware of her own sexuality and knows that something more is out there.  It turns out, there is something more out there, but it's a bit scary, and if she goes out on her own she might get hurt.<br /><br />That's the basic scenario that the original fairy tale is designed to address - and in some ways the moral remains timelessly relevant - that while it's understandable that a young woman would be curious what lies out there in the woods, there's a real risk that what she'll find is the big bad wolf (whether he comes in sheep's clothing as the \\"nice\\" guy who makes promises but abandons her when she gets pregnant, or whether he's the even more dangerous type who never bothers to pretend being nice).<br /><br />This modern version - directed by Catherine Hardwicke from the first [[ASIN:B003ZKBELG Twilight]] film - tweaks the original story, but stays true to its basic structure (even as it tweaks the moral of the story slightly to suggest that while the danger is real, empowered young women can still find a way to become independent and find love).  What's clear from this film is that she's not all that interested in creating timeless tales that transcend the demands of the teen audience she hopes will follow her from Twilight.  The young crush, the goth sensibilities, the daddy issues, the dark romance, are all tailor-made for today's teenagers.  I guess that's fine - but it meant that while my daughters liked this I really couldn't connect as I sometimes can with films of this sort.  I couldn't connect with the Twilight films either.<br /><br />I will say that Hardwicke has a very keen eye for visual composition - and does create the aura of a fairy tale here.  She really knows what to do with a red cape.  I'm impressed that she seems to manage much of the look of the film, as she did in Twilight, in camera, by the way she and her team shoot and light scenes and through the costumes, rather than through digital enhancement (although I'm sure they spent quite a bit of time on digital postprocessing).<br /><br />For all the bad rap this film got from those who really wanted it to go much darker or bigger (they should try [[ASIN:B00006G8H3 The Company of Wolves]], which I consider to be a better and more timeless version than this one, that's also quite scary) - this wasn't a bad retelling of the original story.  It's not bad, and teenagers are likely to like it, and for those who don't love it it's still fun to look at.ough the costumes, rather than through digital enhancement (although I'm sure they spent quite a bit of time on digital postprocessing).    For all the bad rap this film got from those who really wanted it to go much darker or bigger (they should try [[ASIN:B00006G8H3 The Company of Wolves]], which I consider to be a better and more timeless version than this one, that's also quite scary) - this wasn't a bad retelling of the original story.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|Great performer! What more can I say. I built my gaming computer about a month ago and this processor works fantastic. No problems at all and fast!
