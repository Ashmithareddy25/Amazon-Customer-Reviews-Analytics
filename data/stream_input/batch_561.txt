B0006A9FMI|5.0|GITS2 is so gorgeous to look at, that the first time through watching it, you will be left breathless.  It is truly an animation feat of combining cell shading and Computer Graphics so seamlessly.  The plot is a bit difficult to follow so just watch the movie a few times and it should start to click.  Each time you watch GITS2 it will make more and more sense plus each time through you catch more eye candy in the background that you may have missed.  The fact that the movie changes each time you watch it adds a tremendous amount of replay value and I'm sure a lot of the philosophical topics mentioned could spur lengthy debates.  I also suggest watching the DVD bonus feature where the director talks about the meaning of the movie, which may clear up some of the confusion surrounding the storyline.   <br />     <br />As for some of the reviewers out there, you need to quit complaining about how the DVD features suck and how there is no dubbing in English.  Get over it!  GITS2 is a great movie already! <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|4.0|The song \\"Wings\\" (the last track on the soundtrack that everyone is talking about) has in-fact been given credit where credit isn't due. The Jayhawks album \\"Sound of Lies\\" album is where this unque and delicate sound has arrived from. If I could give any credit at all it would be that they borrowed it from a very powerful and well written song. \\"Sound of Lies\\" is a self titled song from the Jayhawks 1997 release of \\"Sound of Lies\\". However, they did a fantastic job turning it into a hollywood blockbuster sound. Ironically enough they even made \\"wings\\" the last song on the album just like the Jayhawks positioned it on thier album. If there were lyrics to this song they would have had no choice but to lift those as well. The contents of the lyrics somehow find themselves lyrically twisted into the movie, very strange! Sing along to the sound track Hollywood borrowed. I hope they at least paid them for something... This score brought some emotional impact to the movie and this song especially. If you enjoyed this song from the soundtrack you're about to become a true diehard fan of The Jayhawks. I just played both songs side by side, one from my computer and one from my cd player and they are the same song. The fact that Wings is only 1:52 minutes only strengthens the case. They took the strongest melodies from it. Infact, the song repeats itself and is only 3:55 in length. Just over double the size of \\"Wings\\". <br /> <br />Here are the lyrics... Enjoy... <br /> <br />It's a matter of time <br />Till I fall <br />In the middle of the town <br />There stands a tall brick wall <br />In the middle of a dream <br />Where time plays in between <br />The sound lies rings funny against the truth <br />When I was young, outspoken <br />(Mama said it'll work out right) <br />Then sixteen brought a moody star <br />(Mama said it'll work out right) <br />Mamasaid it'll work out right <br />Boulevards and green leaves billowing <br />It's a matter of time <br />Till I fall <br />In the middle of a town <br />There stands a tall brick wall <br />In the middle of a dream <br />Where time stands in between <br />The sound of lies rings funny <br />Against the truth <br /> <br />------------- <br /> <br />All in all a fantastic movie... I stayed for the end of the film to see if they had indeed given them a credit and they didn't. I still recommend the soundtrack. I found it fantastic!
B000069HZP|5.0|A movie that will keep you guessing to the very end!!  This was a gift for my brother.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Ok. I Loved this movie, let me say that first and foremost. Great story, great acting. Quite possibly the best movie I have seen in a while. Point one, I am a heterosexual. Point two, I am so sick of all of the \\"morality\\" talk and \\"propaganda\\" talk being used as an arguement against this film. If we want to talk propaganda, look at say \\"Passion of the Christ,\\" another highly controversial film. Instead of dealing with homosexuallity though, it deal with Jesus. But, is this not religious propaganda, put forth as a means to try to \\"inspire\\" religious conviction. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" on the other hand, is not a film trying to convince anyone of anything. It is simply a tragic story of love and loss. The only thing I can hope that it inspires is acceptance and tolerance.
B0000524CY|5.0|Yeah it was 1972 when this movie first came out, and it defined horror pictures for the next decades. <br />The reason why? It is simple. When you watch the first 30 minutes of this movie, it seems to be rather a drama. No big special effects, no demons flying around.Hence this movie has a great charge of realism. We believe everything that happens is highly plausible. Perhaps it is because the script is extremely similar to the book.And the book itself is a great literature piece.  <br />The acting is supremely good, and aside the green puke, the especial effects used on Linda Blair are creepy enough to still scare you 30 years after this movie was shot.The extra scenes are equally as scary. <br />A great horror classic that will never stop horrofying us...
B000301YY8|5.0|Five stars really do not suffice. This guys is amazing! My only complaint is that the CD is only 39 min; it's just leaves you craving for more. His voice is so soft and comforting, and his lyrics will blow you away. My personal favorites are: <br />1.High <br />2.You're Beautiful <br />4.Goodbye My Lover (one of the saddest, most beautiful songs I've heard in a very long time) <br />9.Cry <br /> <br />But really, the whole album is fantastic. A must buy!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\", scripted by Larry McMurtry (\\"Lonesome Dove\\") and Diana Ossana from E. Annie Proulx's short story, and directed by Ang Lee (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\"), has a lot of people talking.  The tale of two cowboys, the taciturn Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) who fall in love while working on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming in 1963, has just won several major Golden Globe Awards, has been banned in the State of Utah, and has people, straight and gay, talking...and thinking...a lot.<br /><br />When I first heard of the film's subject, I said \\"Oh, not another film about gay people that ends in tragedy, haven't we progressed beyond that?\\" Well, after seeing the film, I have to say \\"Yes.....and no.\\" I, a gay man born in the mid-1950s in New York City, feel very fortunate to have not been a gay man in Riverton, Wyoming in 1963, tho I can still remember being \\"fag baited\\" in my teens, and was even physically attacked in the early 1980s, for \\"being queer.\\" I, fortunately, survived. A lot of people who were born after the 1970s cannot imagine what it must have been like for gay people, especially for those who were not living in major cities, back in the 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />Since I won't go too much into the film's storyline, what I will say what I admired was how the subject was handled. Since the story begins in Wyoming in 1963, where there was no such thing as an openly gay man, one has to place oneself in that time and place.  Men didn't show \\"tenderness\\" towards another man, because \\"Real men don't do such things, unless they're queer\\", and \\"Real\\" men got married and raised families. Women were expected to marry, have children, and look after their homes. Homosexuality was a subject that was whispered about, or derided as a sign of sexual perversion, or weakness, or mental illness. Period. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" does not eroticize, nor sensationalize, nor exploit the activity between the two men. There is one (count it, one) scene, shot in semi-darkness, when \\"the urge\\" overtakes the two men and they begin to have \\"rough\\" sex (remember, \\"real\\" men have to be rough in Wyoming!), and that's that. No nudity, no revelling, it's over in seconds. Those expecting steamy \\"Queer as Folk\\" sex scenes will be disappointed, it's not to be found here. Keep reading.<br /><br />The acting in the film is, well, I forgot that I was watching actors! There is no grandstanding here, no showy histrionics. Heath Ledger's Ennis is so believable, I didn't know he is Australian! No goofy cowboy twang here. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack is sensitive but not whiney, and Michelle William's Alma Del Mar and Anne Hathaway's  Lureen Twist are no brain-dead bimbos, they are women who married their men for love, and then must deal with the realization of their husbands' \\"other life\\" in the best way they can. Michelle Williams' \\"suffer in silence\\" performance, until she can longer be silent, and Anne Hathaway's Lureen, who remains tight-lipped and stoic, are believable, subtle performances. There are no villains and heroes in this tale, no devils or angels, just people. This is a true-to-life tragedy, where everyone suffers a loss. A loss of innocence, a loss of dreams.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a study in contrasts. The \\"bigness\\" and beauty of Brokeback Mountain, and the cramped, claustrohobic, often ugly, \\"real world\\" (dismal apartments, trailers, saloons) are an obvious leitmotif. Rodrigo Prieto's unglossy cinematography, very sharp, has its own stark beauty, and Gustavo Santaolalla's decidedly spare score, add to the simple and sensitive way this story is told. Director Ang Lee, I understand, did not \\"fuss\\" at his actors., nor does the film \\"preach\\" or fall into kitschy sentimentality, it walks a very fine line and does not falter. It takes a slightly detached (but not dispassionate) point of view, it depicts its situations and characters simply and directly, they \\"are what they are\\". The story plays itself, and the important theme that seems to be the crux of this film, is that people make decisions in life, be they good or bad, right or wrong, and what follows is.....? No one goes through life without heartbreak, it's unavoidable. We all make mistakes, we all make compromises, we all have regrets, we're only human. After being clobbered, bludgeoned, and oversaturated  with unbelievable scenarios, non-stop editing, deafening musical scores, endless special effects, this film is a welcome (altho some people may not like this, as it gives them time to think!) change for filmgoers. I was drawn into the story by the simple and beautiful imagery, the remarkably believable performances, the all-too-believable situations, and yes, I wept. I wept for everyone in the film. Here it is, 2 days after I've seen the film, and it's still on my mind. And that's good enough reason for me to write about it.ry plays itself, and the important theme that seems to be the crux of this film, is that people make decisions in life, be they good or bad, right or wrong, and what follows is.....?

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Yes, it's not the A&E version....but who cares?  I am a long-time Jane Austen fan and own the DVD A&E series, but I have to admit, the newer version tells the story in its own way, with its own interpretation.  Relax and enjoy.  I applaude them for their insight and ability to find the actors and actresses that placed a new spin on the story and the characters.  If you want the purist version, only watch the A&E, but remember it has a good five hours to tell its story, where the movie had only two hours, and did the best it possibly could in that time allotment. <br />There were vast differences from the original storyline, but I found it entertaining and refreshing.  I will purchase the newer version as soon as it is released.
B00005JNQS|4.0|My kids enjoy this movie.  I found the reference to a \\"Brazilian\\" very interesting.
0307276902|3.0|although poorly written and full of stretchers, it is a good story. Frey introduces a few interesting characters in this story and you actually like them. Any book, regardless of the contoversy around it, that makes me care about the characters is worth a read.
0671015206|2.0|I consider myself to have personal finance knowledge that is a little bit above average. As such, I found absolutely nothing useful in this book. It is possible that the book was written for the beginner, and if that is the case, fine. However, I also have a problem with the authors' attitude towards money. They seem to advocate a pauper's life for all the wrong reasons. Now, I think this could be a perfectly reasonable way of life depending on ones motivation. You may feel more at peace by not buying into consumerism - great! You may want to donate any extra monies above that needed for basic living - terrific! But Stanley and Danko would rather you take any and all joy out of life to attain as much money as possible, not for the reasons stated above, but so that you can die neither happy or peaceful, but wealthy. I believe in the notion that a \\"penny saved is two pennies earned\\" (just think about taxes), but this is a bit ridiculous. I would recommend \\"The Wealthy Barber\\" by David Chilton instead for both beginner and intermediate personal financial \\"wanna-bees\\".
B000065U1N|5.0|There are very few war movies that have it all - the look and feel of combat, the realism, the colors and sounds of battle, the camera work necessary to do justice to the event -  but Black Hawk Down is one of those movies.   <br />    This film has one concern, and that is to depict the events of Somalia as realistically as possible.  Of course Ridley Scott is involved, and this is a movie with big name actors, so there are some hollywood moments, but overall, BHD may be the closest the average american every comes to witnessing modern urban warfare.   <br />    It is not necessary to discuss the authenticity of the movie.  Simply watching the special features divulges the efforts of the crew to get everything right down to the last detail.  I personally think it's not the authenticity of the movie that is central so much as the manner in which the film is shot.  Never have I seen such a claustrophobic movie.  You cringe just watching the American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers creep down narrow alleyways.  It is not hard at all to feel their apprehension, as windows pop open and Ak-47 rounds rain down from the rooftops.  I almost cover my face when Ewan McGregor's character takes on a mounted machine gun by himself, barely getting his grenade off before the Somalians finish reloading.  The scenes with the humvees are just gut wrenching, as one roadblock after another prevent them from getting to safety, and casualties quickly mount. <br />    One thing I love about this movie is that we don't see our American soldiers as invincible.  We watch them shoot at windows and sprinting Somalians, but more often that not, they don't hit their target (with the notable exceptions of the two Delta Force snipers).  This is real.  Our American boys are damn good, but they shouldn't be able to hit somebody on the run at three hundred yards every time, and BHD does a wonderful job of not forcing you to suspend your disbelief. <br />    If you allow yourself to become engrossed in the film, BHD can be slightly nauseating at times.  I am not bothered by gore at all in movies, and absolutely love good war films, but the confining nature of this movie and its realism is well...a little too real sometimes.  Not that I'm complaining.  BHD is everything a war movie should be.  It demonstrates the disgusting nature of modern armed conflict and lets you make your own conclusions. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is one of the best movies that I have seen this year. Considering I got it off the clearance rack at Blockbuster, this is one of the best purchases I have made recently.  Why? Well...<br /><br />1) As a huge fan of the Firefly series, I enjoyed immensely the relevance to the plot line and inclusion of main characters.<br /><br />2) Okay, I admit it... River (played superbly by young actress Summer Glau) is extremely good-looking and a great actress.  Plus, the fact that she kicked major undead ass trying to defend Simon and the rest of the crew (using her amazing karate skills and a sword and a handax stolen from a dead undead) scores a billion cool points in my book.<br /><br />3) Two words: SPECIAL EFFECTS!!  Even though Firefly's SE was great, Serenity's CGIs blow all competition out of the water.<br /><br />4) The film is directed by Joss Whedon, the producer of two of the best series ever, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  Whedon did an excellent job on the two series, but outdoes himself a million times over writing and directing Serenity.<br /><br />5) The plot rocks.  What else can I say?<br /><br />6) The Reavers (cannibalistic bounty hunters) were cool, but I loved seeing the crew kick their asses the one time they meet face to face.<br /><br />All in all, Serenity has something for everyone... It has romance, action, and some funny parts.  If I could give it more than five stars, rest assured I would.  This film is Joss Whedon's crowning work; let's just hope that his next piece even comes close (if possible) to the masterpiece that is... Serenity.
B000BVD460|1.0|There are only a few things that I HATE. War, violence toward women, alcohol, and EMINEM. And of all those things, I can avoid three of them, but I can't avoid Eminem. Why? Because he and his record distributors have completely brainwashed an entire generation into thinking this guy is GANGSTER-GOD!  --- FLASH! Eminem is the reason we are having so much trouble with our young teenagers. He sings about hate, and violence toward EVERYTHING. And the kids get their information from HIM about how to treat women and situations. They emulate it, just like they have from every rock star forever.  --- This isn't MUSIC, this is slam-poetry.  --  I DEFY EMINEM TO STOP HIDING BEHIND THE BIG BEAT AND PUBLISH HIS BOOK OF THOUGHTS. He never will. He doesn't want you to read what he's REALLY saying, least you see his true colors.  ----I wish I was allowed to say what I really think about Eminem because your ears would be burning.  ---DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER ALBUM BY EMINEM. DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR MONEY!! DON'T PAY FOR THIS MALICIOUS HATE !!!
0140277447|4.0|Ms. Chang writes a vivid depiction of the forgotten World War II holocaust. She pulled no punches describing some of the more gruesome atrocities perpetrated by the occupying Japanese including a \\"game\\" where the Japanese soldiers would throw babies into the air and attempt to \\"catch\\" them on the end of a spear. The book reminded me that war crimes committed by those of non-European descent (think Africa and Asia) are often ignored by the world community and are more easily \\"swept under the carpet\\". The fact that the author is a Chinese woman gives the book more power and credibility.
B000AP04FG|1.0|They should have named it Mumbles......What a no plot, unrealistic, mindless waste of time. <br /> <br />
B000002OMN|5.0|\\"It was long and ago and it was far away...\\", just kidding it was just two years ago when I was introduced to the epic bombast of Mssrs. Aday and Steinmen. I had previously downloaded \\"Paradise\\" and \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" from the first one and \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\". which for the longest time was the only song off this terrific album that I knew.  Now in summer '04 I purchased Bat One and was amazed. It was unlike anything I had ever heard before. More and more I listened to it and thought \\"It can't get better than this.\\"  But it did.  Fast-forward. Christmas '05. After months of asking for it, I recieved Bat Two, thinking it would be as good as it's predessor.  I was wrong.  It was better.  \\"Anything for Love\\" and \\"Life is a Lemon\\" I had previously heard and loved, but the rest were new and exciting and are far superior to the original. Let's look at the tracks.  1.\\"I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\\" The version I had had eariler was a mere 5 minutes and 16 seconds long, not enough to do it justice. The 7 minutes that were cut out of it were amazing, although the 5 minute version had only one thing I liked, and that was after the final bombastic \\"I Won't do that\\" it went straight into Mrs. Loud's part, but on the 12 min. one it goes on for a little longer, not that that's bad, but it just flowed better on the 5 minute one. Rating (Out of 100): 97  2.\\"Life is a Lemon (And I Want My Money Back)\\" Bombastic, loud and cynical. It doesn't miss a beat. Sure the final guitar part drags on for a while and I mostly turn it off after the \\"It's Defective\\" dialouge, but it's still a great song. Rating: 89  3.\\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come True\\" I've adopted this as my personal anthmn, because as the song says \\"You're never alone cause you can put on the phones and let the drummer tell your heart what to do.\\" A great uplifter after the cynical \\"Life is a Lemon\\". Rating: 100  4.\\"It Just Won't Quit\\" It starts off slow, but when the chorus kicks in, the song takesoff. Although the ending is a little slow, this is one of the many highlights off the album. Rating: 93  5.\\"Out of the Frying Pan (And Into the Fire)\\" In my opinion, this is written almost in the same vein as \\"Paradise\\", what with the guy seemingly pressuring a girl for sex, but it still is an excellent song, especially the guitar parts and the final orgasmic \\"Fire! Fire! Fire!\\". Great song really. Rating: 95  6.\\"Objects in the Rear View Mirror (May Appear Closer Than They Are)\\" Aside from having the longest title of anything I have ever heard, this song is a bit of a tribute to \\"Paradise\\", what with the chorus repeating \\"Long ago and far away\\" and the final verse talking about \\"Salvation every night\\" when refering to having playful teenage sex in a car. The song is slower than the others and seems to be a bit like \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" or \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" off Bat One. Rating: 92  7.\\"Wasted Youth\\" Not really my favorite as it's not a song per se and I don't have the patience to listen to this bizarre fantasy (Although in the liner notes, I'm both curious and turned away at the fact it says where the people involved on this states \\"Kids don't try this at home, we're professionals\\". And the fact it talks about blood and a Fender Guitar in the smae sentence). Rating: 70  8.\\"Everything Louder Than Everything Else\\" Now ideally, the final chorus of this song should be performed with 500 people, 100 on each of the instraments in the song. How's that for being louder than everything else? The best line in the song is \\"Don't ask my veiws of history, there's something you should know, the three men I admire most are Curly, Larry, Moe.\\" A great anthmn to march down the street to. Rating: 96  9.\\"Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)\\" Easily the 2nd best song on the CD, behind \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come True\\". With frank lyrics and a rocking beat, it can't go wrong. Now, this would ideally be song by a woman in an extremely erotic dance show, or at least that's howI picture it. If you listen to it, you can probably imagine it. Rating: 100  10.\\"Back into Hell\\" An instramental track that's okay. It seems to be an overture to the enitre CD, but the only song I can clearly pick out is \\"Good Girls Go to Heaven\\". An alright song in it's own right. Rating: 78  11.\\"Lost Boys and Golden Girls\\" The only bad song on the CD. It's too slow and I can't recommend it to anyone. Rating: 30  Well, that's every song on the CD and if you listen to it, you'll see that \\"Everythings Louder Than Everything Else\\". So get \\"Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire\\", \\"Do Anything For Love\\" and have a \\"Wasted Youth\\", because this CD \\"Just Won't Quit\\". Hee hee.
B00009ZYC1|2.0|Very good production values, very poor human values. <br /> <br />Not so much childlike, but sophomoric. Personally am sorry I  bought it for my child. Cutesy, not be bought or even borrowed.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this is incubus ive never seen a band go through such a transformation as these guys.They started off with fungus amoungus witch is a horrible disgusting take on heavy music and funk.then comes science a brilliant wierd evolution of the last album but with one major difference its more relaxed brandon boyds voice is more settled.then on to make yourself the hit drive was a softer acoustice song alot of the album was softer.then comes morning view the best incubus album i own it may be poppy and has divided fans but is full of wonderful tracks they havnt lost there experimental side either for example the last track aqueaous transmission is a really relaxed closer to the album.it sounds orinental and has flutes to help give it that feel.songs like i wish you where here and nice to know you are great tracks but do not amount to the rest of the album.some more highlights include mexico a nice acoustic song and 11 am witch starts off with some epicish high singing witch comes after the smooth intro incubus seem to of gone from being to intense to becomeing very laid back and listenable.this may be a poppier album but in my eyes its too good to be a pop record by far there best of what ive heard in my opinion.it wipes the floor with make yourself science and crushes fungus amoungus this is an incubus classic.there are so many highlights to this album i cant list them all i suggest buying the album and giving it a spin for yourself.
6305161992|5.0|Ah, the adventures of the type-casted actor (Jason Statham, reading this?). In 1991 some mediocre filmmakers contacted Lungren for a movie and they told him that he would be playing Drago (from 'Rocky IV') once again. For legal purposes they told Lungren that the English diminutive for Drago is Kenner.   Kenner: he's a cop, he wears a black leather jacket, he's impervious to bullets, he lifts cars, he single-handedly mangles and destroys people and public property, he is emotionless and expressionless, and he works alone. Like a pirate...cop, the expressionless Kenner swings on a rope onto the ring of an illegal fight club, pummels both fighters, and puts everyone in mortal danger, or as he likes to say, \\"under arrest.\\" Perhaps Kenner is angry because the Asian mob bosses never invite him to be a contestant in their fight club - and because of this, Kenner drives his muscle car around town looking to take out his mildly racist frustrations on members of the Asian community to the tune of \\"left over Miami Vice music\\" (Tom Servo). Later in the movie, Kenner throws some human bodies around like rag dolls and in the process he destroys a Chinese restaurant, where he then meets his assigned partner played by Brandon Lee. I felt bad for Brandon Lee just for having had to read the script for this movie, especially those revolving around Kenner's crotch (this in itself deserves some additional analysis, but I'll leave that to someone else). Brandon Lee and Kenner don't like each other at first but upon listening to Kenner's tragic story about the murder of his parents, Lee joins Kener in a mindless game of revenge because he really \\"likes him\\" and in the end they'll be able to \\"eat fish off of the naked chicks\\". Well guess what? I like Dolph too, er I mean Kenner. And while the director's intent was to convince the viewers that Kenner needs a midwife to assist him in giving birth to human emotions, the real moral of this story is: we all need someone to help us kill bad Japanese druglords to avenge the deaths of our loved ones.  This movie is so god AWFUL that I LOVE IT!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I couldn't review Shaun of the dead the first time I saw it because it was a little different than what you usually see in zombie movies. When you think about it why wouldn't zombies be funny, they're slow, stupid, and two English guys with nothing to do are willing to show you every other reason to laugh about it. Don't even try to watch Shaun of the dead if you take everything seriously because it really isn't that type of film. This movie is like one of the classic zombie flicks and the guys who are watching it and saying all the stuff they would do if they were in the movie like if that was me I'd shoot all the zombies save the girl and run. Except those guys are in this film and get interrupted by the zombies while sleeping after a night at the pub. Their stupidity make the film even funnier as they even try to blend in with the zombies to get to a safe place. I thought the movie was hilarious but it might take a few watches before you can really get into it.
0141000198|5.0|This is an excellent and funny book.  Quite a bit of it is in diary form but much is like a novel -my preference as I find diaries can get a bit hard to read.   <br /> <br />Helen Fielding has captured Bridget's thoughts in a hilarious way, the things she's thinking at 'those' family Christmas parties (you get much more detail in the book), 'that' boss and of course in dealings with her neurotic mother. <br /> <br />I quote Bridget: <br />\\"I am not going to spend another evening being danced around in front of Mark Darcy like a spoonful of pureed turnip in front of a baby\\". <br /> <br />If you like Marian Keyes, you'll like this.  Classic chick-lit.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I popped Oldboy into my DVD player expecting to see a pretty decent movie but I got something way past that. First do not buy this film expecting to see a martial arts or action packed film because this is not packed it's just the right amount to keep you interested. There's more torture than fighting as you see Oh dae-su seek the ultimate revenge after being kidnapped and held for 15 years and then for some crazy reason he's let go.<br /><br /> By this time your probably thinking Oh dae-su has some bit of control over his life after being released but his napper tells him different. Whenever Oh dae-su thinks he's getting some control he is pulled back like a dog on a leash. He figures out he has not really been released just let out for some air. The napper tells Oh dae-su he released him because he wanted him to know why this was done to him and who did it and he only had 5 days to do so. You think you know who's getting the revenge but you don't really know.<br /><br />This film surpasses anything your thinking about it and the twist makes it worth every penny. I actually jokingly guessed the twist before it came and had the biggest jaw drop ever when I found out I was right, that's how unbelievable the twist is.<br />This film is so unique that you have to see it because there is no way you can find a twist in a movie in America like the one in Oldboy so get ready to be surprised. The actors are on the next level in this violent masterpiece and stop at nothing to make the film perfect. Don't watch this if you have a weak stomach.

B00005JNQA|4.0|Only liberal Hollywood would cast Sean Penn as - of all things - a Secret Service agent and fulfill his egomaniacal dream of actually standing at the podium of the UN General Assembly.  But I'm going to try and rein in my feelings for Sean Penn and the UN here - although it will take a great show of will for me to pull that off.  Suffice it to say, I had sworn a solemn oath to never, ever watch a Sean Penn movie - and then Nicole Kidman, one of my personal favorites, goes and makes a movie with the guy.  Thus, this was an unusual film for me to sit through - and, as much as I dislike Sean Penn for a myriad of reasons (not just political - the guy did marry Madonna back when I had a teenager's crush on her, after all), he delivers a darn good performance in this movie - he was even better than Nicole.  Were it not for the fact that I have an issue with the ending and the matter of a few plot weaknesses along the way, I might have considered giving The Interpreter 5 stars.<br /><br />It's hard to judge Nicole's performance because I'm not sure if I was supposed to truly like her character.  Silvia Broome (and how ironic is it that Nicole plays a witch and a character named Broome in the same year?) is fairly remote, mysterious, and secretive, and I never really warmed up to her.  This is the first time I've ever not liked or loved a Nicole Kidman character - I even loved her in To Die For, and she wasn't exactly Miss Sweetness in that one.  Here, she plays a UN interpreter who just so happens to overhear a whispered conversation (in a language only she and a handful of other people understand) pointing to an assassination attempt against President Zuwanie of the (nonexistent) African nation of Matoba.  After learning the next day that Zuwanie is planning on addressing the General Assembly in a few days, she reports what she has heard.  Now a lot of summaries tell you that Tobin Keller (Penn) is assigned to protect Silvia, but this is not accurate (not at first, anyway).  Keller's job, as a part of the Secret Service branch overseeing the security of foreign dignitaries, is to protect Zuwanie from the time he enters the US to the time he leaves.  He initially thinks Silvia is lying about the purported assassination attempt.  It's certainly true that she isn't divulging a heck of a lot of relevant information.<br /><br />There are a lot of subplots and gradually revealed secrets throughout this film - and the writer and director earn major kudos for making sure all of it makes sense and doesn't cause great confusion.  In fact, it's all laid out so well that what might be considered surprises toward the end aren't surprising at all.  I wouldn't dream of going into any of the intricate details in my review, though - just know that the story is complex and very well told.<br /><br />There are some definite Hollywood elements to the story, especially in terms of the ins and outs of the UN.  One would hope that UN security is better handled in real life than it is here.  Background checks, people.  Security sweeps really should involve more than someone walking through a room without actually checking anything.  And that safe room - here, it should be called a \\"well, we might have checked it a week or two ago room.\\"  We all know the UN is corrupt, but it can't possibly be this vulnerable to security breaches.  And why were there any General Assembly microphones on at all when Silvia went back after hours to retrieve her bag?  Of course, all of these things can pretty much be forgiven - this is just a movie, after all.  It's amazing to me that the United Nations allowed Sydney Pollack to shoot a number of scenes in actual UN locations, including the General Assembly and Security Council areas.  The shooting was done on the weekends, but still - why let a brood of movie crew members traipse all over the place?  I wonder if they did background checks on these guys - and whose hands they had to grease to get the OK to film there in the first place.<br /><br />In closing, I'll just say that The Interpreter surprised me - in a good way.  It was a far more intelligent, suspenseful story that I expected, and Sean Penn's presence didn't ruin it at all for me.  That's not to say I plan on watching any other Sean Penn movies, though - not unless he costars with Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, or Aishwarya Rai.he first place. <br /> <br />In closing, I'll just say that The Interpreter surprised me - in a good way.

B0000AUHQF|5.0|If I take into effect everything about the movie, I should probably give it a 4, since it is far from perfect.  It gets a 5 however from my sheer enjoyment of the film.  No matter how many times I see it, I still watch it every time I stumble across it.  The acting is fantastic, and the story follows a rocky/karate kid formula.  Though if I were to list other movies that I would recommend if you enjoy this, they would be: Hoosiers, Breaking Away, Babe, Remember the Titans, and Miracle.  If you want something more than the movie, then go for the special edition, otherwise you can get just the movie itself for under $10.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|I have been a longtime fan of Madonna, but I was thoroughly disappointed by her latest CD. Of course her hit single \\"Hung Up\\" is very catchy, but that is only because she sampled an Abba song. Even tracks that have some potential are ruined by her cliched and self-involved lyrics. Get over yourself Madonna, not everyone wants to be you and have your life.
0060825219|4.0|<br />The book is very good, I have found it very interesting, it wasn't like eleven minutes, more of the exploration of the body, soul and love.. it wasn't like the fifth mountain, mixed between spirituality, religion and a bit of love.. it had it all..  <br />he wrote in this book about love, marriage, life, sex.. how he saw marriage, how his love was possessive and obsessive, how he realized that for the first time in his life, he loves someone more than himself.. which ofcourse happens to many of us through out our lives.  <br />some parts of the book weren't as thrilling, specially the parts with Mikhail, it was more of weird things happening, but I believe it does exist. fact is there are many things in life we never saw, and Paulo has mentioned in his book, his experiences, his encounters, his search for his love.  <br />unfortunatly I hated the fact that his wife ended up being pregnant, I did not like her personality, I couldn't get my self to realize  how she left the place,and the type of life she adopted was very unexpected..  <br /> <br />To me, this book made me realize how beautiful it is to hold on to your love no matter what happens.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book, for readers who would like to explore more things in life thro reading, and who wants to know how the journy of love should be like..
0671688782|5.0|Everyone here in Vermont has tremendous respect for Dr. Welch's work. They advised that I do holding with my girl. I'm the single mother of a 11 year old adopted girl with attachment problems. Before I found Dr. Welch's center we were in serious trouble. It took a 6 day rage on her part and her hitting a state cop before someone said, oh what we're doing in her therapy is not working.  She got caught in a school system that didn't understand reactive attachment disorder together. I thank God that I found Dr. Welch and Holding time. If I had not had early work with the Welch method, I would not have been able to continue. I persisted round after round of holding cycles and learned eventually what Dr. Welch says - that holding is a way of life. At first the holding worked miracles on her behavior. It took a while (10 months before I began to see lasting results. If I stopped, she regressed, but Ariela always asked to resume holding because it made her feel better. She is now living with me and is in a structured small (8) child class room. She's getting A's, behaving in school, taking piano lessons. She is very close to me.  She is getting better and better. No matter what she's been through, Ariela Ariela and I both know the work we did together worked.  At 10  still talks to people about Dr. Welch's help and how it changed our lives for the better. I just want you to know that I followed Holding time and it worked.  It gave me gifts that I still use today.  I always keep HOldin time instructions in my head and will be forever grateful that I found it for the early work with my girl.  Lots has stayed. Dr. Welch told me that I had a life time to work with my kids. I have kept that in the back of my mind it kept me going.  I have used what I learned over and over again and it works. But you have to stick with it.
B000002TQV|4.0|Perhaps my taste runs somewhat differently than the typical Radiohead fan.  While I certainly like \\"The Bends\\" very much, I can't place it in the same category as \\"O.K. Computer.\\"  Maybe the reason for that is I don't think any of the songs on \\"The Bends\\" match the soaring power of \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Karma Police,\\" which, together with \\"Optimistic\\" (from \\"Kid A\\") are my three favorite Radiohead songs. <br /> <br />I also notice that in quite a few reviews, fans indicate that, in their opinion, \\"Bones\\" is one  of the weakest songs on \\"The Bends,\\" and, surprise surprise, it's my favorite on this album.  Strangely enough, I feel this song can be related to my career as a negligence attorney, as perhaps an outline for a Summation in a typical, relatively minor, car accident case, where a plaintiff attempts to \\"build up\\" his/her injuries: <br /> <br />   I don't want to be krippled kracked <br />   shoulders, wrists, knees and back [which are typical complaints of a plaintiff after a car accident] <br />     . . . . . .  <br />   Now I can't climb the stairs <br />   pieces missing everywhere  <br />   prozak painkillers [the drugs needed to be taken] <br />   When you've got to feel it in your bones. <br />   And I used to fly like Peter Pan, <br />   All the children flew when I touched their hands [i.e. the extraordinary, albeit exaggerated lives that plaintiffs, with relatively small injuries, claimed to have lived prior to being \\"damaged\\"]. <br /> <br />Allright, so maybe my analysis of \\"Bones\\" is ridiculous, but I still really like the song.  Other \\"Bends\\" highlights to me are \\"Planet Telex\\" [I love that sci-fi back-drop, something Radiohead often uses], \\"High and Dry,\\" \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" \\"Sulk\\" and \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out).\\"  Frankly, I find some of the other songs somewhat tedious.   <br /> <br />\\"The Bends,\\" really provides the listener with a good sense of Radiohead's prodigious capabilities, musically and lyrically.  No other band can go from beauty toharshness so easily, often in the same song [e.g. \\"Iron Lung,\\" which sounds like a bizarre mix of Bread at their sappiest, and Nirvana at their most discordant). <br /> <br />As I've said, I think \\"O.K. Computer\\" -- one of my favorite albums -- is quite a bit better.  But \\"The Bends\\" is just fine, and, I have to admit, I find most of the lyrics, and pretty much all of the artwork, to be just as puzzling as in their later releases. <br /> <br />Note:  If anyone reads my reviews in general (perhaps that's quite presumptuous) he or she will notice that I usually review every album by a particular band in chronological order.  I can't review \\"Pablo Honey\\" because I've never purchased that C.D., and only know one song on it, \\"Creep.\\"  I've heard it doesn't approach Radiohead's other albums in quality, so I never bothered getting it.  Maybe one day I'll give it a listen. <br />             <br /> <br />
B000BNX3B4|4.0|This was a fun, not to serious movie about dating with the help of cyberspace. I really enjoyed it and thought the actors did a good job.
B000002BMV|2.0|I know everybody that was alive 25 years ago loves this record, so I'll probably take a lot of heat for giving it a bad review.  But the truth must be told!  The Steve Perry era albums by Journey are BORING!!!  Thats right I said it----BORING!  For those of you who don't know, the REAL Journey was formed in San Francisco without Steve Perry in 1973.  Back then, the band members weren't trying to be a blockbuster, mega platinum, chart topping, arena rocking, satin trousered super duper group.  Instead, they were a minor league progressive rock group.  Sure, early Journey wasn't on the same level of complexity as say, Dream Theater, but it was a heck of a lot better than this album of made-for-radio filler!  If it weren't for this band's unquenchable thirst for money, they would have been a lot better. <br /> <br />But by 1978, the record company told the band that they were going to get dropped from the label if they didn't come up with a hit.  So they hired Steve Perry, and transformed the band into a top 40 hitmaking machine!  From 1978 to 1986, Journey cranked out hit after hit, just like the assembly line in a factory.  \\"Escape\\" was typical of that period of oversimplified and formulaic top 40 drivel.  Whenever I listen to that simplistic guitar on \\"Open Arms\\", it makes me mourn the loss of the REAL Journey...an amazingly talented progressive rock band that made a fortune by pandering to top 40 radio!  Too bad they had to oversiimplify their music just to have a hit.  What could have been...
0380789035|1.0|I was loaned this book by someone whose opinion I respect a great deal. She loved it and thought that I would too. I read and enjoy a lot of sf, fantasy and horror. It's been a long, long time since I've read a book that I wasn't able to finish. After several months, I reached the halfway point in this book and then gave it back to my friend. Why? First, I was bored rigid by it. Second, this kind of book is just not to my taste. I know it's become trendy these days to recycle other countries' mythologies and put them into books, but to me, it's akin to baking a cake from a mix instead of from scratch. I wouldn't call that great cookery.
0553801503|5.0|Having just finished this book I have to ask... with all the negative reviews, what book were these people reading. Yes, this book did not have any battles; yes, this book only had half the characters; and yes, Brienne's chapters did get a little redundant - but the character develop was outstanding!  Even the new characters added so much more to the story. People have complained that these new characters were not necessary for the plot to continue... hello! These characters answered questions as to what happened to Myrcella, and how Euron (the new King of the Ironmen) is going to take on everyone (including the dragons). People have to remember that this is not a stand alone book but a continuation of the other three. Since it took so long to come out, I reread the other three books before reading this one and have to say that, with all the material and names fresh in my head, book four was the logical choice for Mr. Martin to make in his story. The war is over, people are still fighting for control but in a somewhat more passive (behind the back) way. Also, people have complained that all the sex is with children or relatives... again, hello! During this time period (in our own time period and in reality) this was common place and totally accepted. By doing this, I think Mr. Martin has stuck fully with the flavor of the time period in all aspects, whether it is sex or war or weaponry or housing or social class. It is all historically accurate in a fantasy world. No, I am not advocating sex with children, but this time period was all about the flowering of a woman the second she bled (which made her a woman). Ok, off my soapbox... This series is outstanding and is getting better with every book. For those of you who disagree, reread the other books and then read Feast and then tell me that this book doesn't push the plot forward in setting up for the final three (which Mr. Martin says will only be seven books in the first place). This is war - and this book shows that sometimes war is not fought in the battlefields but in the backroom of the ruling governments.
B0009P42S2|3.0|The anti-corporate stance taken by the grandfather was tiring and old.  The father was cliched.  The story could have been MORE interesting if it didn't play on these old themes of 'corporations bad, weapons evil' which is the basis for this movie.  The animation is good, not great, the voice acting is very well done (though I would have had an actual boy voice the lead role) and the overall plot is intersting.  This would have gotten 4 stars, easy, if the politics of the movie were more subtle.
1563899426|4.0|This reprint of the first few issues of \\"Fables\\" serves as an introduction to the Fables' world. All the characters of fairy tale and legend are real, and living in New York. They were chased from their alternate worlds where their fairy tale kingdoms were located, by a stock fantasy uber-villain, a vaguely-named \\"Adversary\\" with huge armies of orc-like creatures that overran the Homelands. We learn that those Fables who can pass for human live in New York City, while the inhuman ones live on a \\"farm\\" upstate. Their community is governed by Old King Cole, with Snow White as his deputy (and for all practical purposes, the real boss). The Big Bad Wolf (who can assume human form) is the Sherrif. The community sticks together under an agreement of amnesty for all deeds performed prior to their emigration from the Homelands.<br /><br />In this first story, we mostly get a quick introduction to a lot of fairy tale characters cast in this modern setting. Some are central to the plot, like Snow White, Prince Charming, Rose Red, the Wolf, Bluebeard, and Jack (of Beanstalk fame). Others only make cameos this time around: Cinderella, Pinochio, the Witch (from Hansel and Gretel), one of the Three Little Pigs, Little Boy Blue, Beauty and the Beast.... The story itself is just a vehicle to introduce us to the setting.<br /><br />The ending is not terribly surprising, but delivered with touches of humor, and some additional character development. Elements that were barely touched on (such as the upstate \\"Farm\\" for Fables that can't pass for human, the history of the Fables community, the current activities of the Adversary and what is happening back in the Homelands) will no doubt be revisited in future volumes, and of course, you'll be anticipating which fairy tale characters will appear that haven't been introduced yet.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great film.  I loved it the first time I saw it.  I loved it the second time.  And so on.  It is a terrific movie with fun, heart, and a good story. <br /> <br />The animation is wonderful, of course.  The monsters all look great, especially Sully.  And the little girl, Boo, is utterly adorable.  This movie has a lot of great humor, and several geniunely touching moments.  Despite being about monsters, the characters are so real and lively, their performances so subtle, that I found myself completely believing in them.  Of course, I already like monsters so I'm an easy sell. <br /> <br />Maybe you won't love the movie like I do, but it is still an instant classic that deserves to be seen for generations to come.  And I'll thumb wrestle anyone who says otherwise!
B000BYA5GO|4.0|In \\"Lord of War,\\" Director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Truman Show, S1m0ne) shines his cinematic spotlight on the shadowy world of illicit arms trafficking - a global scourge that has claimed millions of lives since the end of the Cold War. It is a slick, stylish film about a slick, stylish crime. Yet despite its Hollywood feel, \\"Lord of War\\" is an excellent introduction to the opaque and oft-ignored activities of the merchants of death, or lords of war.  <br /> <br />The movie follows arms trafficker Yuri Orlov's meteoric rise to the top of his profession. Yuri, played perfectly by Nicholas Cage, is the ambitious son of Ukranian immigrants whose desire to escape the banality of New York's Little Odessa leads him to the hyper-violent war zones of post-Cold War West Africa - \\"the edge of Hell,\\" quips Yuri. There, he dodges bullets and Interpol agents while delivering planeloads of weapons to a sociopathic dictator. After each sale, Yuri returns to his multimillion dollar Manhattan condo, his fashion model wife, and their young son. Yuri's transition between the two worlds is seamless, as is the ethical compartmentalization that allows him to exist in both: \\"Cars and cigarettes kill more people than guns,\\" \\"I simply give people the means to defend themselves,\\" etc. Slowly the corrosive depravity of Yuri's vocation eats away at this bifurcated morality and he succumbs to the vices that his weapon sales indirectly cultivate - prostitution, drug addiction, and murder.  <br /> <br />Niccol's portrayal of international arms trafficking is inspired. At one level, gun running is an activity that lends itself perfectly to the big screen - big guns, lots of money, exotic places, shady characters. But that's only half the story. Less sexy but more important is the dizzyingly complex administrative and bureaucratic arrangements made by traffickers to hide their activities and throw law enforcement officials off the scent. Fraudulent end-user certificates, front companies, false bills of lading - all essential elements of the illicit arms trade but hardly the stuff of an enjoyable Friday night at the movies. Niccol manages to communicate these details while keeping his audience on the edge of their seats with the guns, money and shady characters. <br /> <br />In one particularly riveting (and educational) scene, Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jerad Leto) are approaching the Colombian coastal city of Cartagena with a boatload of AK-47 assault rifles. Yuri is conversing with his nacro-trafficker client about the \\"Angel Kings\\" he is going to deliver. Moments later, he receives a phone call from one of his plants in a Colombian intelligence agency who informs him that Interpol is hot on his trail. Yuri goes to work. He sends one of his crew members over the side of the ship with a can of paint and hasty orders to paint over the large, white \\"Kristol\\" (the name of the ship). He then calls another paid spy who gives him the name of a clean Dutch ship, the \\"Kono,\\" which he barks at the crew member on the hanging scaffold. Vitaly frantically searches their extensive collection of national flags for a Dutch flag, which has gone missing. The camera pans to a rapidly approaching Interpol patrol boat. In the nick of time, Vitaly finds a French flag which, turned on its side, looks like the Dutch flag, and the anonymous crew member finishes repainting the side of the ship.  <br /> <br />The Interpol patrol boat pulls up along side the \\"Kono.\\" Even though the name doesn't match the ship they are looking for, agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) decides to board the ship anyway. He is greeted by Yuri, who shows him to the cargo hold while a voice-over by Cage explains how he conceals his merchandise: in boxes labeled \\"farm equipment,\\" in canisters marked \\"radio active waste,\\" and, his personal favorite, \\"the combination of week-old potatoes and tropical heat,\\" which is what Valentine finds in the cargo hold. <br /> <br />Real world examples can be found for nearly every reference in the scene. Using code words for weapons (i.e. \\"Angel Kings\\" for AK-47s) is a common practice amongst arms traffickers and their clients. In 2000, the Colombian military intercepted a conversation between guerrillas during which they discuss the cost of \\"pineapples\\" in terms of \\"lettuce leaves.\\" The \\"pineapples\\" were hand grenades and the \\"lettuce leaves\\" were U.S. dollars. Similarly, there are several documented cases of arms traffickers mislabeling weapons shipments as farm machinery. In one particularly notable case, a ship carrying an estimated $100 million in Russian and Czech weaponry, including 30 tanks and 4 million rounds of ammunition, was impounded by British officials because of paperwork problems. The captain told the Brits that he was transporting \\"agricultural equipment\\" and, upon providing the proper paperwork, was permitted to continue his journey to Angola, where he delivered his deadly cargo in violation of a United Nations embargo. <br /> <br />Through numerous scenes like the boarding of the Kristol, Niccol constructs a surprisingly nuanced and accurate portrayal of the illicit arms trade. As an arms trade analyst, I have no criticisms, only a point of clarification concerning Niccol's use of arms trade statistics in the closing credits. While private arms dealers continue to thrive, reads his parting shot, the largest arms exporters are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Technically, Niccol is correct; the five permanent members of the Security Council are often the top five global arms exporters in dollar value terms. But the wording of this comment conflates illicit arms trafficking by private brokers with legal, government-to-government sales - two entirely different animals. For example, most of the $18.5 billion in defense articles sold last year by the world's largest arms exporter, the United States, are the so-called \\"big weapons\\" - airplanes, tanks, ships and the sophisticated munitions, surveillance and communications equipment that they use - not the assault rifles, machine guns and missile launchers peddled by Yuri. The U.S. does sell military style small arms as well, but most end up in arsenals of responsible governments. That's not to say that all legal sales are harmless. There are plenty of examples of legal, government-to-government arms transfers that have fueled arms races, perpetuated regional wars, and supported repressive regimes. But the two types of arms sales are categorically different, and should be treated that way. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Lord of War\\" is an edgy, innovative and darkly humorous film that appeals to lay audiences and policy analysts alike. <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|<br />I love the movie because of the performance presented by Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. I love this DVD becuase it is a widescreen edition. I would recommend this as a great product.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|The good:  the acting from all the principle actors is solid; though none of the characters are particularly likable, they manage to sustain interest in their activity.  The script is complex and intelligent and demands that you pay attention even through all the long sections of seemingly unnecessary dialogue. <br /> <br />The bad: the pace of the film is often insanely slow, even with all the subtext and subtlety of acting desperately trying to keep your attention away from the popcorn bowl.  After seeing this story, which takes place primarily in Africa, I have even less desire to visit that deeply troubled continent than ever before.  All the poverty-stricken areas that are shown are immediately repellent to the senses. <br /> <br />The ugly:  I hate hand-held photography!  This movie is rampant with it, as if the filmmakers knew the pace of the movie was going to be almost unbearable and they decided to play with the shaky-cam for 90% of the film in the grim hope of distracting the viewer into thinking anything was actually happening. <br /> <br />I have become less reliant on film critics these days who rave about any film with the slightest bit of intelligence.  I realize they are starving for intellectual stimulation in films, but not at the expense of movie entertainment.  \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is smart, but it is also incredibly slow and frequently boring.

B00005JOFO|4.0|I am not going to belabor the plot of the movie.  It's been well-described elsewhere, and to a large extent, this is not a plot-driven movie.  It covers a lot of time, and its characters go through a lot...but to a greater extent it's a mood or tone piece...it's not about what happens, but how what happens changes the characters.   <br /> <br />First, let me touch on the good stuff.  The obvious place to heap praise is in the acting.  Heath Ledger (as Ennis)is very good...to me he got better as the film went along.  Just watch his posture.  He's not just aging, he's \\"wearying.\\"  A load of sadness settles on him, only momentarily lifted when he's around his daughters...or the love of his life...Jake Glynenhaal (as Jack).  It's a performance that feels as lived in as the denim clothes he wears.  Michelle Williams is very sympathetic as his wife.  Randy Quaid, in a small role, is frankly quite riveting.  He's an actor with no ego about his appearance, and he plays that for excellent effect here.  Glynenhaal, to me, is the weakest link.  His Jack Twist is a slightly less full-bodied character.  He's always full of mischief and high-spirits...sometimes its hard to find anything below that.  It's there, and it comes out at times, but sometimes I felt the actor was coasting a little bit.  He's still quite good, but is not up to Ledger's performance, and not worthy of the Oscar-buzz. <br /> <br />The cinematography is great.  The music is very good.  And the script from Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana is sparse and to the point.  You can tell it's McMurtry...so many stylings of dialogue hearken to LONESOME DOVE, LAST PICTURE SHOW, etc.  And the ending of the film is typical of McMurtry's refusal to give us any closure.  Don't come into the theatre expecting to know all you want to know about the characters when you leave 134 minutes later.  McMurtry refuses to write stories that way (even adaptations) and Ang Lee (the director) is clearly interested in other things too. <br /> <br />To say this movie is about gay love, or about how hiding your true self causes anguish overly politicizes or oversimplifies it.  The characters and situations are FAR too specific and detailed to simply be generalized.  As the two characters grow in their relationships, we grow to care about them...but we also see clearly the damage they are doing to others around them...others they should care about.  Their love is dangerous, reckless and wrong...not wrong because it's immoral for two men to love each other...but wrong because it leaves a wake of dead and damaged souls.  It's no passing fancy...they have found the love of their lives with each other, and can only endulge for a few days a year.  Yet the very act of experiencing their love hurts others.  It's not just adultery...these two men are depriving their spouses of intimacy.  They leave those that care about them (such as their children) baffled and lonely.  It's a sad situation all around...and the universal truth one might draw from it is that if only these men had been able to spend their lives openly together without fear of consequence from society...so much heartache would have been spared...and who would it have harmed?  That's certainly a valid question, but to generalize the movie to such a global conclusion, in my mind, diminishes the power of the movie itself.  Put simply, just enjoy the movie on its own terms. <br /> <br />Ironically, I believe this \\"politization\\" of the movie is why it has generated so much award buzz.  I think a lot of people believe by heaping critical awards on the film, they will drive home its message.  What they are doing, however, is forcing people to take sides.  If you don't like the movie...you must be against gay relationships or worse yet, you must be a homophobe.  You can't dislike the movie just because you don't like the film.  Much like disliking SCHINDLER'S LIST (although I can't imagine disliking it myself) would have branded you as anti-semetic.  Thepolarization actually keeps people away from the film, I believe. <br /> <br />For me, this is a very good film...but not GREAT.  I mentioned already all the things I liked.  But in the end, the film left me unmoved.  I wasn't emotionally invested in it beyond a casual interest in seeing how things unfolded.  While I appreciate a movie with a leisurely pace...sometimes I felt the pace was just indulgent.  And the biggest flaw was the initial sexual encounter between the men.  Where did it come from?  These two men had become friendly, out on their lonely shepherding job, but suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) a lust we hadn't seen before bubbles up and is manifested in a fairly violent and fast encounter.  The next morning, it seems just as likely that these two guys would have grown further apart, not closer together.  They generated no romantic or sexual tension.  Later, this is not the case, as their need for each other is quite palpable (lots of scenes of grabbing each other by the thick, comfortable coats they wear), but I missed the early spark which might have made me invest more of my emotion into the film as well. <br /> <br />I recommend the film for adults (particularly since it's going to grab up so many Oscars), but to my mind, better movies this year include CRASH, CAPOTE, KING KONG and even THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN.   <br />

B000000WHX|3.0|While this album is the most highly lauded of the long and amazing career of Massive Attack, it left me disappointed, prehaps because of all the hype I had heard about it before listening.  Sure, safe From harm and Five Man Army are nice tracks but don't expect them to just knock you flat like 'Angel' or 'Black Milk' from Mezzanine did for me.   <br /> <br />The production, owing to its age of course, definitely has that 'eighties' edge to it which I dislike; and there are a couple songs which I just can't STAND! 'Be Thankful for What You've Got' has to be the most annoyingly whiny song Massive Attack have ever made!!  And there are too many that just failed to impress or were overshadowed by later, more refined productions on Mezzanine.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: if you're a fan of Massive Attack because of Mezzanine, like i was, you might be hugely disappointed.  In any case, don't buy the hype; after 4-5 listens I still can't see what everyone's raving about. Good, yeah, but not great.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is a pleasant little book, gory scenes notwithstanding, about a boy and his fight for survival aboard a 26-foot lifeboat drifting in the Pacific.  But survival isn't the only thing that Pi Patel struggles with.  He also struggles with reality vs. hallucination, fact vs. fiction, and the improbable vs. the impossible during his 7-month ordeal at sea.<br /><br />Truth be told, the same fate awaits the reader of this book.  Those who are inclined to analyze the deeper meaning behind an author's words will find ample fodder for analysis in Yann Martel's story.  Religion, community, sanity, humanity, the meaning of life.  Oh my goodness, there's so much to think about, so many messages hidden beneath the surface.<br /><br />Those who want to read a story solely for the sake of a story may also be attracted to \\"Life of Pi\\".  Martel captures the voice of the gifted 16 year old well, and he keeps his chapters moving along with plenty of interesting twists and turns.  Readers who enjoy skimming along the surface are probably the happier audience for \\"Life of Pi\\".  It's a fun and unusual book--okay, it's also a little weird in parts--and it's particularly enjoyable if you try not to think too hard.
B00005JO1R|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie and thought it was excellent. I grew up with Johnny Cash and June Carters music and this movie helped me come to know them and what they went through to become \\"one.\\" I would reccomend it to all to go see it. It is worth the price of a ticket and as part of any collection. Whenever you think your having it rough and don't see the light at the end of that dark tunnel, watch this movie. There is a rainbow at the end of every trial you may be going through. If you have had dealings with any of the things these two have been through, drugs, failed marriages, alcohol, do as they did, put your trust and faith in Jesus and you, to, will overcome anything that comes your way as Johnny and June did. This movie is very inspirational to anyone who may be going through a valley right now. It is a movie about hope, faith and struggles we all go through but it's also about winning the battles in our everyday life. I hope that as you watch this movie, you see yourself in some area of it and that you also find your strength to come out victorious at the end.       damama_d
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is without a doubt the greatest total score ever released mainly because of how it was released. The music on three CD's which is great, but the DVD-Audio made the pain of $63.99 go away with its insanely clear highs and mids. I recommend this to anyone who likes the LOTR music and even if you have the short single CD score, upgrade as I did. I just can't wait for the other two film scores to come out now. The DVD-Audio makes the greatest reproduction of music I have heard yet. Be ware as I found out that the only way to play the DVD-Audio with High Resolution as I havd, is through the DVD analog outputs, I was trying it throught the optical cable and it did not work, due to copyright? The DVD-Audio come with either Dolby Digital or High Resolution depending on your player's ability, the High resolution is the better quality, I have A Marantz Dv6500 so it luckly plays the insanely clear High Resolution. I wish other great films would release a score like this one, but most don't have enough music to. THIS IS A GREAT SCORE, I STRONGLY RECOMMENT IT.  I FEEL I NEED TO POINT OUT THE DVD-AUDIO AGAIN. I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOME HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE HAD NO NEED OF IT, BUT HERE IS WHY I LOVED IT SO. For anyone who has a moderate to upper end home theater stereo, the DVD-Audio brings unmatched quality. I mean, I have never in my life heard such clear orchestrated music. Maybe the detail is not as noticable to most people(most people don't have a 5 Grand stereo(not including TV) but it is actually alot of the reason I bought the set, was for all music on one disk for my stereo. Wow it is awesome. Sure some people could do without it, because they must not have a system at home to use it with properly. But if you do have a system and hate that kind of static or background noise you get with scores, this is ur best buy.
1400031087|3.0|James Frey, the rich kid turned outcast turned crack addict turned recoverer turned script writer turned once again rich kid, covers his time at a rehab clinic.  While there, he meets a wily band of characters who pepper his time there with bittersweet irony, unique bravado, and ultimate fallibility which balances his own determination to persevere.  Unrelenting to the dogma of the 12 steps or belief in a supreme being, he finds his rehab by simply not doing it, a sort of homage to the Reagan \\"Just say No\\" campaign that becomes personified in James Frey.     A bit hokey.  A bit mushy.  The story is great.  The summation of what happens to each of the people he befriends is greater.  What isn't so great is the ability to believe that this all rings true.  What made sense is that some time after his rehabilitation, he heads out to LA and writes screen plays.  This book screams \\"make me into a movie.\\"  All the elements are there: the brash young protagonist with a checkered past who stops hiding and becomes a man through truth, accountability and acceptance, the love interest, the prophetic Mafioso who can make anything happen, the ying to his yang roommate who is an older black federal judge (unlike James -the young white rebel Criminal), the insolent counselors who eventually warm up to him, the parental reconciliation.... There are so few books today that don't have that underlying cinematic flavor, and it doesn't belong in a book.     From a purported person who diffused his Fury with hard core drugs for almost a decade, \\"Kissing a Fool\\" was begot.  Finding this out after finishing the book was the first clue that the elements which seemed all too surreal were just that.  Now there is a large scale scandal that \\"Million Little Pieces\\" was a \\"Million Little Lies.\\"  I'm sure parts, or at least, the outline of this book is true.  But from what I've subsequently learned about the popular blue blazer, soccer playing frat boy whose infractions against society mostly consisted of drunken driving stints and nickel bag possessions, without so much as skipping a semester in college and getting his degree in the standard 4 years -while supposedly puking up blood, passing out in alleys with prostitutes and strung out on crack- has tarnished this book's flavor as a naked account of a drug addict/criminal's journey back and how easy it is to fall when everyone else who struggles on the journey with you doesn't make it.    While passing this book off as a simple dedication to those people who met and ultimately passed away, Frey, this humble guy who is self-described as off the charts intelligent, and who has the sort of insistent resolve that hasn't been seen since the Dali Lama, says \\"I don't give a **** what Jonathan Safran whatever-his-name does or what David Foster Wallace does. I don't give a **** what any of those people do...A book that I thought was mediocre was being hailed as the best book written by the best writer of my generation. **** that. And **** him and **** anybody who says that. I don't give a **** what they think about me. I'm going to try to write the best book of my generation and I'm going to try to be the best writer.\\"\\" Hmm.  I have to admit that I'm not familiar with either of these writers but I'm hoping that they too haven't tried to pass off fiction for fact.    Many have taken Frey's book to be their own blue book for addiction recovery.  This is being called in to question with the major holes that offer contradictory accounts of his life. Frey's \\"MLP\\" still makes for a great read, if what you are looking for is not a factual inspiration.  The words and the way they are shaped together are still powerful, not as powerful though as if it were true.  For a book about addiction, I'd also suggest Requiem for a Dream.  For a real version, or at least one that is based on a true story with admitted alterations, read Magical Thinking.  For a great read that has nothing to do with recovery or truth but is so profoundthat it will have you emotionally entangled from the first chapter, read The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini.
0385507755|5.0|Like most renowned new authors, James Frey found himself with a story he felt compelled to share. His very passion for the subject carried the story. I felt myself reading the book in a day, and after reading it, I found myself unable to let the story go.<br /><br />Like other writers/reviewers I found myself conjecturing over the causes of Frey's addiction and anger and considering some interesting pathologies. And despite the obvious outcome of the story if he hadn't stopped at Hazelden (no story to tell), I felt he might have at least appreciated the help he got without constantly undermining the staff and criticizing their intentions.<br /><br />But perhaps Frey meant to get under the reader's skin the way true addicts often do. Would we understand him better and recognize the very stubbornness that led him to succeed if the hostility was veiled?<br /><br />I don't imagine Frey set out to dupe anyone. Any writer with a story to tell who is first faced with multiple rejections will accept whatever venue is offered and keep their fictional hooks. Perhaps his publisher and editors are the ones remiss for not suggesting a disclaimer and a medical reviewer to weed out some of the mistakes....or possibly the facts that may have been misconstrued by patient naivete.<br /><br />A memoir should not be confused with a biography and its memories scrutinized so closely. Frey should be commended for baring his soul and writing the story he was meant to tell.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City is one wild ride of a movie. With it's black and white filming, the unique use of certain colors such as red for blood and lipstick to accent certain people and things, it's rough but sometimes brutally funny dialogue, and it's riveting action sequences, there is nothing that has come before it that I can compare it to. It is a feast for the eye and you won't want to turn away for fear of missing a moment. Not for everyone as there are some very graphic scenes of violence but this is basically a comic book come to life. All the elements I've mention go into creating a wonderfully dark mood where the people of Sin City live and die, some heroically, some as cowards. I can honestly say there is nothing out there in the world of film like it. My best advice is, if you are uncertain about this movie, rent it and then make up your own mind if you want to add it to your home library. I'd be willing to bet at least 7 out of every 10 people who do so will buy it.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|There are several problems with the film 'Troy', if one is trying to fit it too closely with the literature which inspired it, Homer's Illiad. There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than 'inspired by' - there are characters missing (Cassandra, etc.); there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (I won't give spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.<br /><br />In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world. However, he is a loose canon of sorts, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy. Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory. Achilles is persuaded in the end by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy. Achilles sets sail.<br /><br />The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair 'was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy; Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.<br /><br />Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event as a chance to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time). This is where the retelling becomes much more modern than ancient. The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as it is with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends. Does one sense a thinly-veiled critique of the modern siege-makers in this?<br /><br />An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy. Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo (a dishonouring of the local gods - again, does one sense a critique of the moderns here?) by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have. At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.<br /><br />The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of `good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache). Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one. (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.) We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and 'shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).<br /><br />The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally. The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.<br /><br />The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody. The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.<br /><br />I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery. The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse. The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called `the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory. As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in.<br /><br />A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).<br /><br />The effects are great, as is the general cinematography.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|I truly love the new Madonna collection of songs.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing compliments the most recent style of Porcupine Tree brought to the fore with In Absentia. Both albums adopt a heavier feel with distorted guitar riffs a-plenty. However Steve Wilson and the rest of the crew manage to dovetail the heaviness with wonderful melodic pieces throughout - Arriving Somewhere But Not Here being a prime example - probably one of the best songs I've heard in a long long time and is worthy of 5+ stars on its own. Porcupine Tree display their musical talents throughout the album from the straight ahead chord trashing of Shallow (which even has his quieter moments with R Barbieri's keyboards used to great effect) through to the melodic Lazarus (somewhat reminiscent of Trains from In Absentia). The lyrics, as in keeping with much of PT's previous works, tend towards the darker aspects of the human psyche: <br />\\"Can you imagine the final sound is a gun <br />or the smashing windscreen of a car <br />did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you faded  <br />was a song\\" or how about <br />\\"mother lost her looks for you <br />father never wanted you\\"...ouch!  <br />The weakest track for me on the cd is Open Car and yet it's still a track that many bands would love to have written I'm sure, let alone have the ability to play it.  <br />If you haven't heard Porcupine Tree yet - then nows the time to jump on the \\"band\\"wagon -if there's any justice Steve Wilson and the lads are on the verge of great things. And if PT are playing anywhere between where you live and Pluto - take the effort to see them live - you'll be hard pushed to find anyone of this calibre. As a friend uttered when leaving a recent concert...\\"I think I've just seen a slice of musical history\\"
B0009OPO0S|5.0|I've followed Shakira's music from her first album, way back when she started in Colombia. I totally love her music. Her breakthrough into the American music industry was a spectacular hit... Laundry Service was a great album. But Fijacion Oral really shows her diversity. Shakira is very particular about all her music, and in almost everything she does she is a perfectionist. This album really displays her creativity, her willingness to experiment and her talent. I definitely recommend this album. She's really fantastic.

B000A59PMO|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I didn't even catch it on TV in season one, but I saw the Pilot over at a friend's house, and I was immediately hooked. I had to know who raped Veronica, who killed Lilly, what Veronica's mother was doing, and why Duncan broke up with Veronica. So, I bought the DVD. And, just let me tell you right now, that was money well spent. <br /> <br />The lack of extras disappoints me a bit, but hey, you can't have everything.

0553062182|4.0|Whether male or female, if you happen to be on the sensitive side, this book is worth a read.  Or, if you live, work or encounter someone who is someone you'd rate as \\"super sensitive,\\" this book might be helpful for you as well.  While psychology as  a field is an area I have a great deal of distrust for, I believe it has its uses - so long as one doesn't go off the \\"deep end\\" with it.  The author of this book is not guilty of pushing psychology further than it should really go.<br /><br />The single most revealing aspect of the book is that I personally don't feel quite so unique as I used to.  In this case, that's a good thing.  I have always taken seriously what other people's feelings are, while other people at the same time may not care at all how I or anyone else feels.  I've also done my very best to be a genuine & good friend to people, while at the same time I've been let down time & time again.<br /><br />Aron demonstrates that I'm not alone & I'm not \\"defective\\" for taking life so seriously.  There are others out there like me, and that's a liberating thought.  In this day & age, with all the hatred in the world, the citizens of this planet would do well to allow themselves a little MORE sympathy, compassion and generosity.<br /><br />Aron has been studying this topic for quite some time and some of her insights are quite good.  The case studies she presents are helpful as well as her discussion of the work of other psychotherapists and writers.<br /><br />If ever you too have felt that there was something \\"odd\\" about you because of an over-abundance of sensitivity, this book may well be worth a look.  Ditto for everyone who has ever been accused of being overly-sentimental at some point in their life.  It's good to know that there are more of us out there, and we may very well \\"have it right\\" after all.

B00005OAIE|4.0|This CD is now three years old.  I happened to listen to it Jan 06 because my daugther and I share music on our iPods. I tend more toward Miles Davis, The Mavericks, Otis Redding, BB King and Sting. She is a teenager enough said. I was listening to the \\"Heavy\\" CD and wanted to hear more, so I purchased \\"Try.\\"  I appreciate musical evolution and live recording.  \\"Try\\" rocked more than I expected, excellent musicianship, but his unique sound was almost missing.  The attraction of \\"A Room for Squares,\\" is the unique sound of an excellent and young musician.  I can forgive the Dave Mathews vocal stylings, as youthful folly, and simply absorption of what John is hearing on the radio--why not borrow from the best.  I find his lyrics idiosyncratic, phrasing confusing, and sentiments youthful. How about some slack, he probably wrote some of the tunes in his late teens.  In a wasteland of three cord wonders and formula tunes from the \\"major talent,\\" I was delighted with the complex progressions and funky guitar style supporting a unique sound and poetic voice.  There is enough there for me to want to hear it again and again; something I don't say that often any more.
0307263118|4.0|When this book won the Man Booker prize in England late last year, there were dissenting opinions among the panel of judges.  In fact, after the announcement that 'The Sea' had won, one of the disagreeing judges was quoted in the press that the choice by the majority of the panel had been \\"perverse.\\" <br /> <br />John Banville, in an oblique response to that slur, stated during his acceptance speech that he congratulated the committee for having the courage to select a novel with good writing this year (I paraphrase).  This may have been a comment also on the other nominees last year, among them 'Saturday' and 'Never Let Me Go' (I happen to agree with that assessment). <br /> <br />There may be a bit of truth to both sides of that prize skirmish.  This novel is a narrative with a weak story line.  It is more a stream of consciousness reminiscence and pondering of the past than a novel with a plot.  As such, it is a bit static, since nothing much happens outside of the first person singular main character's thought process.  However, the observations that he makes about his life are so touching and so profound that one becomes as involved in his life as with an engaging memoirist.  The sentences are constructed as carefully as lines of poetry, the words conveying beauty as well as emotional insights. <br /> <br />Approach this book as you would a gourmet meal--ingest it slowly and savor every sentence. And if you go back for seconds and read it again, you'll pick up scents and textures you missed the first time. <br /> <br />Go for it.  The calories are worth it here.
B000002KXO|4.0|This album, like Tusk before it, suffers by comparison with the titanic success of Rumours, but what album doesn't? FM had moved on and were enjoying the luxury of being able to make art/pop with their own unique approach to arranging and the compelling character of the three independent songwriters.<br /><br />I would place this album as my third favourite FM album (of the Nicks/Buckingham era) although almost tied with Tusk which would be forth. I like the adventurous quality of the music. Despite the fact that they are attempting to echo a Rumours style sequence, they just can't help themselves and do a few interesting things along the way. Take the amazing vocal interplay between Lindsey and Christine McVie at the beginning of 'Eyes of the World' or listen to the sublime backing vocals on 'Can't go Back'. Stevie contributes the most substantial hit here with 'Gypsy' although for me over the years 'Straight Back' has become more and more superb. Give it another listen. It just blows you away. It would have to be in my top 10 FM songs of all time. Christine pens the catchy and nicely played 'Hold Me' which demonstrates that the band really know how to sell a song, no matter how slight and it's always nice to hear Christine and Lindsey dueting.<br /><br />Lindsey's songs are bizarre and wonderful, and also very catchy. I particularly like 'Empire State' but it could be an aquired taste. I prefer this album to the overproduced but still very decent 'Tango in the Night' album and you get the sense with both of these albums that the band is attempting to keep up with the times rather than serve up the straight up melodic blues of Rumours or the self-titled white album. It's innevitable that a band must keep moving and evolving while many of us would like them to stay put. Mirage is a smart, artistic and enjoyable pop experiment, very much of it's time.<br /><br />Love the album cover too, echoing the bizarre and compelling sexual dynamic of the band!
B00005QXXO|3.0|I hate to flame a Radiohead release because OK COMPUTER and KID A are two of my all-time favorite albums by any group, however, this live release regrettably exposes one of the weaknesses that bands who rely on heavy production in their studio albums, namely, the inability to reproduce that sound live.   <br /> <br />I tend to measure the quality of a live show by whether or not I would \\"take\\" the live version over the studio version and out of 8 tracks, I wouldn't take any over their studio versions.  The specific shortcomings I found with this album are (1) the \\"thin\\" ness of Thom Yorke's vocal when not given double and triple overdubbing (by his own voice) in studio (2) a guitar sound that doesn't fill the spatial landscape (again due to the inability to recreate the multi-track effect from the studio) (3) somewhat weak song selection.  Of the better songs, Everything In Its Right Place is the best of the lot, but that (in my view) is due to the use of echo chambering and voice manipulation (taking a page from, of all bands, the Grateful Dead) in turning the song into a very trippy sonic landscape.  National Anthem is ok, but sounds a beat or two too fast and I Might Be Wrong is just ok.   <br /> <br />This album is for the completists, not the casual.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|While the film did a positive thing by refocusing the public's attention onto a key persona of the World's Stage, I did not approve of this movie.  And the reason why is that this theatrical tragedy portrayed the real Ali who possessed a for-the-most-part soft-spoken and somewhat shy demeanor and was adoreed by the ladies on a sex symbol scale with a loud-mouthed, vainglorious person who reminded me of some of the negro punks who I attended an integrated school with.  So why ruin Ali's reputation over the making of this piece of trash in return for a quick buck.  Missed being treacherous on a Judas scale by a fine hair.  Couldn't even mention that Muhammad was so good-hearted, how could anyone ask him to kill anybody!  So F^^K the movie, S^^K Me Director, & DUCK Me Actor
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Tony Leung exudes coolness, and Zhang Ziyi is beautiful and sexy.  2046 is about love and memories and the passage of time.  It is about a longing for the past, and it is about one man who is tormented by his memories.  Leung's character drinks and gambles excessively, and when he is not mistreating women, he is writing a science fiction novel about the future.  He will not appreciate the nice things he has in the present until the future, when the present becomes part of his past, at which time he will regret what he has lost.  There is a wonderful scene in which Zhang Ziyi tells Leung that she loves him, that it did not matter if he loved her or not, that she would love him still.  The dialog is nothing too exciting, but it's all handled with such style.  Mix in terrific music and cinematography, and it's all terribly romantic.<br /><br />If you do not speak Chinese, you may not realize it, but in their scenes together, Leung speaks Cantonese while both Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi speak Mandarin, an entirely different language.  I guess that's what happens when the cast comes from so many different countries.
0393317552|3.0|I just ordered this book, and therefore can't say whether or not I agree or disagree,(why I gave it a 3), with the reviews I've read, but what I can say is that I dislike the ratings I've seen.  If you review a thesis, the rating you give should not depend on whether or not you agree with the arguments, but on the level of the content and the writing itself.  You all seem to enjoy the book, and just disregard it because Diamond supports his own arguments and not yours.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Been listening since Parachutes and still awed by how good coldplay is.  <br /> <br />I cant see how this cd could be lower than 4 stars as the quality of music is much higher than most of the recent new groups who make \\"one hit cds\\".  <br /> <br />Unlike most modern music where an album has maybe two or three good songs and the rest is ok.. or pretty bad.. Coldplay has made 11 good songs at least, on each of their albums, which is to say that there are no bads songs by coldplay.  <br /> <br />X&Y starts out with the \\"right\\" song for an intro to start the cd. Not to say that the other 2 cds didnt.. with \\"dont panic\\" and \\"politik\\"... Square one sets the mood for the album into  one good song after another. The songs are easy to sing to and the melodies are beautiful. Each song is well produced and flawless. <br /> <br />There is little else to ask for if your a coldplay fan as this cd shines above \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" with more catchy and relaxing songs. Though i do recommend their other albums as they are almost as good as this one. <br /> <br />Stand out songs on X&Y: <br /> <br />Square One <br />What if <br />Fix you <br />Talk <br />Speed of Sound <br />A Message  <br />Low <br />Swallowed in The Sea <br /> <br />I hope you enjoy the album as much as i do and look forward to a new coldplay cd which will probably be some time.. <br /> <br />During the Meantime, some of the newer cds which have more than a \\"few\\" good songs, i recommend are.. Audioslave \\"Out of Exile\\" , 311 \\"Dont Tread on me\\" , Oasis \\"Dont believe the Truth\\". (Though i think Oasis's and 311's older music is better these 2 cds are still good..) <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BCE918|4.0|There have been a few other boxed sets that were a bit \\"glitzier\\", with more bells and whistles.  This Adventure Pack is simply designed and includes only the 3 discs in a tri-fold cardboard case within a hard cardboard box.  You get the 3 Collector's Edition discs that were released individually over the years.  The box itself is cool, although the front flaps hang open, with nothing to keep them closed - kind of annoying, but not a big deal.  The discs are well-protected.   <br /> <br />All 3 Jurassic Park movies for under $20.00 is quite amazing.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|In almost every review i have read for muse, i see, \\"radiohead\\" (sorry im gonna put my 2 cents in too).  <br /> <br />To make it understood, Radiohead is a good band, i have almost all their music and id say my fav by far is \\"the bends\\" but i will say that not all their albums are good unlike.. Muse.  <br /> <br />Muse has produced 3 great albums that i feel took off where radiohead couldnt. <br /> <br />Ignore what die-hard radiohead fans have to say about Muse taking off Radioheads music, because the reality is that Muse is continuing off from \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Ok Computer\\" and making music that is much better than the new radiohead albums. Radiohead died In my opinion with ok computer.. and thats where Muse came in and took their place by doing what radiohead couldnt do.... continue to make GOOD music. <br /> <br />Absolution is a masterpiece, carefully mixed from one great song to another. There is not one song on this cd i skip, it is one of those great albums that you listen from start to finish.  <br /> <br />Song favs: Time is running out, Stockholm Syndrome, Hysteria, Butterflies and Hurricanes, TSP and Thoughts of a dying Athiest. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs are awesome but those stand out the most.  <br /> <br />Id recommend this and their 2 previous albums to anyone and if you havent listened to \\"The Bends\\" by Radiohead i would recommend you buy that as that is radioheads best cd IMO... <br /> <br />Cant wait for Muse's new album! <br />
B000002J1U|5.0|After two albums of blues plundering some succesful (most of Zep 1) some not (most of zep 2) the band decided it was time to plunder another art form; folk. People that get surprised by this are dunderheads; what was black mountain side if it wasn't folk?  <br /> <br />Any ways, this album is much better produced, and the hard rock songs on here are much less \\"blues cliched\\" and therefore much more interesting. The folk songs tend to kind of blend together but they have nice melodies and sometimes decent lyrics (ruined by a Plant that couldn't sing subtly if his life depended on it; always the weakest link in Zeppelin) with nice arrangments. <br /> <br />hell, after the non stop muddy riffing of Zeppelin 2, this stuff is a breath of fresh air. Page's acoustic playing is as fresh as can be (honestly, probably better on acoustic than he is on electric) jones bass lines, mandonlin, keyboard playing, and string arrangments (best link in zeppelin, sometimes) and bonham's straightforward, lumbering, stupid sounding percussion is at odds with this sort of material. At least page was nice enough to throw a bongo or something in his direction, which he happily, drunkenly bashes around like the five year old we know he was, mentally. <br /> <br />While little is truly catchy, it's at the very least nice to listen to, and often times catchy. A nice little record, but kind of a \\"first try\\" for Zeppelin 4, the \\"other\\" zeppelin masterpiece besides the first.
B00005JNX0|5.0|What a fine, fun movie to enjoy with the kids!  My 11 and 16 year old boys and I loved the characters, the music is great and the story works.  This is a sweet show for a family enjoyment.
B000002J09|5.0|Hey this is really good! I mean, really good. They finally got their shtuff together long enough to make a truly amazing album, their first since their first. Mixing the blues of the first two albums with the folk of the third turns out to be a great idea.  <br /> <br />Album starts out with their prototypical cock rock anthem \\"black dog\\"; but this is oh so much better than that. This song is claustrophbic, strange, the riff truly strange (thanks john paul jones, writer of the riff) with insane howling singing by plant. Normally, he leaves me cold but here he wails like there is no tommorrow, today, or yesterday. Great straight ahead unabashed rock song on \\"rock and roll\\" with even BONHAM sounding good! You hear that? John Bonham sounding like more than incompetent hack! <br /> <br />I won't go over every song, but this is the album with Stairway to heaven the overplayed, annoying, amazing wonderful, stupid classic. You'll rarely hear a more majestic sounding song in your life (even if the melody was AGAIN ripped off, this time from another rock band; the band Spirit has an instrumental called \\"Taurus\\" with the exact same acoustic melody. Zeppelin toured with Spirit and page really liked that song, so yeah, rip off. But wonderfully done, better than the original). The folk songs here are, for the first time, truly enthalling and very beautiful, even if the lyrics are sometimes awful (battle of evermore). They save the best for last, with \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" with Bonham holding down exactly one drum beat (ah bonham...) for the entireity of the song. Good thing that drum beat is among the most amazing drum beats ever. I'm not sure why; it's very simple, and very straightforward. I think it's just the sound of the drums themselves, the way they're produced, as the beastie boys use the same drum beat on the first song on their first album, and it doesn't hit the same way this one does. In other words, Jimmy made the drums sound good, it was nothing Bonham did. How appropriate. The song itself is a repetitive, amazing sounding, ecstatic, climatic, orgasmic masterpiece. <br /> <br />If you're a casual zep fan, buy this, zep one, and a greatest hits or two. You really don't need any other album. They appeal to hardcore fans (not me) or simply rock historians (me).
B0002U0UKS|5.0|Once more, Joe Hisaishi has come up with another winner and with the excellent and imaginative visions of Hayao Miyazaki combined, the score compliments the film beautifully. This tie, Joe use elements from the many musical flavours from Europe especially French music as clearly depicted in 'A Stroll In the Sky' and 'Wondering Sophie' where waltzes are use to illustrate the action and emotions in the film. The end song entitled 'Promise Of The World' is very poignant and wraps up the proceedings nicely and rounds up with 'The Merry Go Round of Life' and ends up with a Viennese waltz. Excellent. The entire score is memorable and it stands on its own and with the piano solo, it certainly a musical gem. A soundtrack worth an award for music contribution to a beautifully animated film. Worth owning! A must have.
B000002JSP|2.0|That would be Coda. But almost the weakest \\"real\\" zeppelin album; if not for the fact that Precense was worse. <br /> <br />Disclaimer; I like Led Zeppelin, I really do. I have that live DVD thing, and I really like it. But I like it because it was Zeppelin at their peak, which they were way past at this point. Zeppelin was never as good as the who, who's \\"after peak\\" albums such as who by numbers and who are you are definitely better than this; at least more interesting. <br /> <br />This is mostly dull, poorly thought out attempts to update their sound. Again, comparisions to who are you make sense; townshend did the same thing there. However, who are you was a much more interesting album, much livelier, much more tasteful, and more interesting; after all, townshend was a genius. Nobody in Zeppelin ever was. So alternating between dull keyboard jazz of \\"south bound suarez\\" to the over load of disco rhytmns of \\"caroselorama\\" (ugh!) this album doesn't offer much. I like \\"All Your Love\\" it has a melody! And \\"In The Evening\\" is somewhat effective. And the last song, I'm Gonna Crawl is one of their best blues songs ever, with Jimmy waking up from his heroin enduced stupoir long enough to play a decent solo.  <br /> <br />Die hard Zeppelin fans will rave, but I'm ont a die hard fan.
0975991477|4.0|This is the long-awaited compilation of ideas and research by Bruce Lipton, cell biologist and lecturer in the field of mind/body interaction. Has it been worth the wait? I think so. The book is a wonderful condensation of cutting-edge biological research delivered in simple, readable form. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down until I finished it.  Lipton is engaging and interesting.        The book begins with a short overview of how Lipton became interested in science and biology in particular. We glimpse his voyage through academia and the changes in his career. We are treated to a clear discussion of DNA and cell biology that reveals the high quality of Lipton's teaching ability.         Lipton details how he came to the realizations that spawned the book. He reveals his current thinking about how cells operate, and how the mind interacts with cells. His vision is based on research and he includes citations and references. His revelations are also influenced by his incorporation of quantum mechanics into cell biology. We now know that DNA is not the kingpin of biology that it has been assumed to be. It turns out that the membrane is far more important. His discussion of the membrane's function is not only enlightening, it is engaging. (And no, I am not a biology geek.)  The book is worth reading for his description of cellular functioning alone.         He discusses problems with allopathic medicine, the pharmaceutical industrial complex (love that term), and science in general. His experiences trying to approach mainstream scientists with his revelations mirror the experiences of those in the new energy field. Regardless of the evidence, many people simply will not accept the death of a paradigm which has outlived its usefulness.         Lipton also touches briefly on the perils of genetic engineering and its emergent problems foreshadowing possible disaster. He discusses the Human Genome Project which has foundered in the wake of conceptual failureand the success of the emerging field of epigenetics. The lesson is that clinging to an outmoded worldview is self-defeating and possibly even fatal. \\"Grow or die,\\" seems to be a fact of life, and is a \\"natural law\\" of greater strength than any postulated by ivory tower scholars.       Fortunately, as Lipton points out, our cells have incredible capacity for life, and hence, so do we. We can \\"reprogram\\" life patterns and unleash the immense capabilites in us all. In doing that we are cooperating with the flow of life and evolution, not fighting or trying to dominate it.        Lipton provides us with a concise set of scientific data explaining how therapies such as accupunture and even placebos might work. Unfortunately, more detail on how to use this knowledge on a daily basis is beyond the scope of this book.        I do find the analogy on page 198 of cancer to homeless and jobless people to be ill-conceived. I think the analogy would be more accurate if one compared cancer to corporations and damaged cells to homeless and jobless people.         If you want an understanding of the ongoing breakthroughs in cellular biology, this is a very good place to start.
B000002JSR|1.0|Amazon's review for this is ridiculous; \\"zeppelin's one true disappointing album\\" (what about hourses of the holy, precense, in through the out door hmm?) \\"there is some classic material here\\"?!?! I have no idea what they're talking about. This is the worst \\"odds and sods\\" album ever released. Its truly insane to listen to this, and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults. It shows Page's poor mental state at the time; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin.<br /><br />Or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults? That seems unlikely, but perhaps that's the only way to explain this. Did they really release everything they recorded? The mind boggles! Nobody does that; you don't record 12 songs for a 12 song album, you record 30, 35 and whittle it down to the best songs. If Zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote, that would be amazing. It would be unlike any other band ever.<br /><br />Sorry I dwell so long on that. It's just I do not want to talk about \\"the music\\" on this album. Its so incompatiable with Zeppelin's legacy, and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band, or it should be. This stuff doesn't even qualify for THE FIRM for Gods sake! As cynical as I am about Led Zeppelin, they could really get me rocking at their best; they were majestic, mythical, AND rocking, all at the same time! They were a good band with good music, that always at least had interesting sounding material. This stuff wouldn't have made the grade on the sex pistols album; its that bad.<br /><br />Don't buy this; even if you're vaguely interested, don't buy this. If you like Zeppelin, you won't after this! Or maybe you'll just be a drone and use words like \\"lost classic.\\" If you do, you are a goofy SOB.
B000008LOV|4.0|Anytime you take giants of the Rock and Roll industry of this magnitude and you put them together, you knows its either going to be great, or it will be a total disaster. <br />George Harrison, Tom Petty Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison made an outstanding album. <br />Handle me with Care is George Harrison at his very best. Harrison wrote a real gem for this album. <br />Tom Petty does a great song called Last Night which is well worth listening to.  <br />End of the Line is the last song on the CD and a real gem as well. <br />What you have here are 5 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame musicians letting their hair down and having a wonderful time. <br />Harrison and Orbison are now gone, but this remains as one of the better compilations in R&R history.....Enjoy
B000002JSJ|2.0|Three songs here are good. Achilles Last Stand, Nobodies Fault But Mine, and Tea for One are all great songs. Achilles Last Stand is perhaps THE Zeppelin epic; thousands of guitar over dubs flying all over the place, horrible, pretentious lyrics wheezed out by a damaged Plant; amazing bass lines pounding, and Bonham being breath taking in his drumming (this is a big deal for me to admit, as I tend to view Bonham as almost retarded) and an epic length that may not be justified by the msuical content, but is completely understandable. I never want the song to end!<br /><br />Nobodies Fault But Mine is just a pounding, soaring, majestic blues song. It shows that Zeppelin truly were at their best on the blues. This is one of there best \\"hard blues\\" songs since their debut, even if it rips off Robert Johnson for part of it (to be fair, everyone ripped him off, including the Stones) wow!<br /><br />Tea For One is a great \\"slow blues\\" that also sets that atmosphere that Zeppelin at there best could. These three songs would have given this album three stars on their own.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the other four songs are so bad, so ridiculously self parodic and unlistenable, it actually DRAGS the rating down a star. I can't remember a single one of them, but to know they're just so stupid, and so ridiculous that it pains me to know the state the band was in at the time; Page a heroin addict, Plant in a wheel chair, tired, and sick of being rock stars. Not to mention they had VERY little time to record this, and about 90% of that time went to Achilles Last Stand (which shows; it's easily the most arranged song on here, to the point of suffocation) which means most of these songs were no doubt just bashed out in the studio with little thought to decency. Its no surprise that the two best songs are blues songs, as that was the one genre Zeppelin could just \\"bash out\\" and make sound wonderful no matter what. It's also a shame that the band didn't just lump all of the good material on one side; that one side would be one of the best \\"late\\" period sides of Zeppelin. Also, listening it on vinyl would have been easier; after listening to one side, just take it off, and go home. No, they had to spread the material all over the place, and make the album a chore to listen to, even if it's the shortest Zeppelin album ever.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Zeppelin fans HAVE to buy this one, as Achilles Last Stand, Nobodies Fault but Mine, and Tea for One are essential, and you're not going to find them anywhere else. And, amazingly, there is one worse Zeppelin album.
0446577383|2.0|This is a fairly generic tale: A few evil people within the government manage to accumulate enough information, lackeys and firepower to effect a coup d'etat.  A handful of brave, unusually skillful, perceptive and extremely lucky individuals save the day, at great physical and psychological cost. <br /> <br />Given that this sort of thriller depends on the reader being willing to give up any credulity, you'll like or dislike this book accordingly. <br /> <br />I can get into an incredible thriller as much as the next guy or gal, but I like some novelty in my plotting, such as Balducci's earlier book, The Winner. <br /> <br />The Camel Club is so dependent on truly extraordinary coincidences I can't recommend it.  Nor do any of the characters become more than two-dimensional stereotypes, soon forgotten.
B000002J03|3.0|I can't get over the sound of this thing. Where did the sparkling, fresh guitars of old go? How come everything all sounds like a muddy, mashy pulp? Why does Robert Plant already sound annoying (\\"squeeze the lemon till the juice runs down my leg\\"?! get used to that phrase, as Plant would use it in improvisations constantly) Where did the neat, weirdo stuff like \\"black mountain side\\" or \\"your time is gonna come\\" go?! This is all one stupid sounding heavy riff with absolutely ridiculous lyrics; are their song breaks on here? And why is there a drum solo? At least it's not half an hour like it would get in concert. <br /> <br />To be fair, some of this is fairly engaging. Whole Lotta Love is whole lotta fun, and Heartbreaker has great riffs (and a ridiculous solo that I've never liked. I don't like solo's that are just there to show off, and this is the probably the first effort. Everything stops, and Jimmy plays a, basically, unmelodic, unrhytmnic, uninteresting solo for way too long. Zepp excess setting in...) and What is and what never should be isn't as good as \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" (but what is?) and Living Loving Maid is funny. But Moby Dick is ridiculous and whatever the last song on here (can't be boethered to know) with Plant singing through his harmonica is absolutely stupid. They get better, but this shows Zep stumbling. I don't believe in the sophmore slump, but this seems to be.
0679759328|4.0|Edith Hope, a British writer of popular fiction that indulges in the comforting illusion that the tortoises of the world win the race against the hares, has been shuttled off to the Swiss Hotel Du Lac on Lake Geneva by her friend Penelope to contemplate and to rehabilitate from a significant social indiscretion. There the approaching gloom of the winter and the grayness of the mist arising from the lake contribute to a somber environment for reflection.<br /><br />Though largely unoccupied, this understated hotel for the well-to-do has as guests four women living in various stages of illusion and desperation. Edith is drawn to one of those guests, Ms. Iris Busey, an elderly lady who defies her age and demands and commands attention and service whether it be at the hotel or in her extravagant shopping forays. Edith is forced to contemplate her rather limited and closeted existence as a writer of romantic fantasies versus the worldly social presence of a Ms. Busey, which does have its own costs.<br /><br />The author is a master of wording, precisely capturing the environment and actions and thoughts, though the sentences can seem rather complicated. One shouldn't look for sweeping conclusions. If Edith has become more accepting, or even wiser, of her situation, then her fortnight of contemplation and testing others' illusions will have been worthwhile. The same can be said for the reader.
B000BYA5G4|2.0|Here I am thinking that I am going to settle down with another great action packed thriller...NOT!!  This movie was not something that I would be interested in seeing again.  I found the plot to be pretty good, but the rest of the movie as it played out was BORING!!!  Cage's narration throughout the flick was annoying too!!  I was just waiting for this movie to get better, but it never did.  You may find yourself just sitting there bored to tears with this one, as I did!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's best CD.  I've never been a rabid fan, but I have Immaculate Collection and Ray of Light.  This is a danceable, positive, excellent collection of music.  I particularly like Jump, Hung Up, Get Together, Forbidden Love and Issac.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave's new cd is amazing.  Chris Cornell's vocals mixed with Tom Morrello's lead and the amazing rhythm section have made a masterpiece.  Audioslave has their own sound and it is amazing.  A must buy.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|After the critical success of his debut solo effort, Heartbreaker, it was hard to not frown upon some of the tracks on his sophomore. People have complained that the CD contains great tracks, mingled with merely average ones. I beg to differ. <br /> <br />Adams is known for his constant genre-bending, and this is no exception. The CD begins with an obviously radio-biased single, New York, New York. This happens to be one of my least favourite tunes on Gold, it seems forced and unnatural for him. After this poppy-opener however, the album launches into one of it's great tracks, Firecracker. While very short, it features one of the catchiest hooks on the album, and is memorable thanks to the harmonica solos. Next is Answering Bell, recalling The Band, and while it has a catchy tune, it's a little too laid-back for my liking. Following it however, is one of the album's  best. La Cienga Just Smiled is a broken-hearted ballad, and Adams' tone throughout the song is utterly convincing as a man in emotional pain. Adding to this song, is the photo next to the lyrics in the album sleeve. Here Adams' puts on his most painful, regretful expression, and it fits the song perfectly. <br /> <br />The album now heads in a more bluesey direction with the next two tracks, The Rescue Blues and Somehow, Someday. Both these tracks are very good, with a country feel to them. \\"There ain't no way I'll ever stop from loving you now\\", Adams' wails in the latters' chorus, yet he manages to make this seemingly cliched line persuasively heartfelt. Following this is When The Stars Go Blue, another ballad with an incredibly catchy tune, a definite favourite of mine. <br /> <br />Next is an album highlight. At 9:39 mins, Nobody Girl is not an easy listen, but it's lyrics are poignantly touching. A brilliant song that needent be so long, but with a tune you could listen to for much longer. To balance the scales, a couple of weaker songs must follow. Sylvia Plath is a slow, weak ballad, and while still a good song in it's own right, it is comparatively awful. And while some believe Enemy Fire is a stand-out track, to me is naggingly repetitive and too thrashy. <br /> <br />Following this is an upbeat ditty, Gonna Make You Love Me More, which has a fresh country twang to it. Wild Flowers is another highlight, a pretty song about lost love, where Adams' vocal are at his top end, making his vocals as fragile as the songs' subject. Harder Now That It's Over is When The Stars Go Blue's poorer cousin. Not a memorable track, but pleasant enough. <br /> <br />The CD moves into it's final phase, with the jazzy-blues of Touch, Feel, & Lose and Tina Toledo's Street Walking Blues. The former is a dramatic number, that wouldn't be out of place in a jazz bar. Tina Toledo's... is an unnessesarily stretched-out song about a \\"working-girl\\", and it takes it's place as one of the more upbeat tracks on Gold. It could, however, lose a minute or two of (the Tina Turner-like back-up singer's) screeching from the end. To conclude the album is Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd., a weak song to end on with lyrics the verge on lame, \\"see you soon....yeah right\\". To me, New York, New York would have been a better choice to conclude the album, with Firecracker as the opener. <br /> <br />Overall, despite the weaker songs, one cannot deny the exceptional songs this album contains. It has at least a normal album-lengths worth of brilliance, and for that, I recommend it to you, especially if you are new to Ryan Adams. A great CD to start a lifetime's worth of fanship with!
B00005MP58|5.0|Having seen the series when it aired, we bought the DVD as soon as we knew it was available. We have owned it for quite a while now, and have enjoyed the entire series several times. The acting, casting, scenery, and production as a whole have been repeatedly gratifying to me and my wife. We have purchased two more copies one for our daughter, and one for our granddaughter. We can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a first class story well presented.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Amazing. Similar to NIN, Marilyn Manson, Smashing Pumpkins (Adore era), Tool. Everything together.  <br /> Album takes you to the world you can't describe. Most people will say that the song The Outsider is the best on the album but it is not. The Outsider - just another radio song. Songs like The Package, Blue, The Noose, Vanishing will hit your imagination and will stay in your mind for a long time. Wherever... if you will listen whole album you will understand what i mean.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Most audience members might already be aware of the heartbreaking ending of King Kong, but this is also the problem with remakes, as the grand finale falls short of surprise.  With this notion in mind, many viewers might wonder why the prestigious director Peter Jackson desired to remake King Kong, as the movie industry simply would allow him to make anything after the brilliant and financially successful Tolkien trilogy Lord of the Rings.  However, his love for the cinematic art has allowed him to pursue one of his personal favorites and tell the story his own way, a similar way a theater director would give their own interpretation of the play.  In the new King Kong, Jackson's interpretation initially flares out through the extravagant special effects, but as the three hours of adventure has reached its culmination the audience will find themselves emotionally fatigued through an intensely poignant drama.<br /><br />The story focuses on the making of a film on a remote location unknown to the civilized world.  A film director Carl Denham (Jack Black) is adamant about making a film even as the film company attempts to withdraw their funding, as his previous cinematic escapades have lost the film studio an abundance of money.  Despite the producer's attempt to pull the money out of the project, Carl persuades his assistant Preston (Colin Hanks) to help him get the ship away before the producers can stop them.  At the same time they must find a new starlet, as Carl's fiascos have driven people away from him.  Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, Carl stumbles across Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  Ann suffers the brutal aftermath of the Great Depression, as she has just lost her job and has not been paid for weeks.  Carl finds her in a moment when she is considering exploiting her beauty on the stage for food, and Carl offers her the main part in his film.  She takes the part, as her favorite stage writer has written the piece they are about to shoot.  The deceptive plan of Carl succeeds, as he gets everyone he needs out to sea including the writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) that Ann admires.<br /><br />Under the command of Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann) they set sail towards their own unforeseen doom, as Carl's obsession has lured them away from the safety of civilization.  Onboard the ship rumors begin to spread after one of the sailors eavesdrops on a conversation.  The rumors begin to enhance the tense atmosphere on the ship, as the superstitious seamen fear the worst in their destined goal.  Meanwhile, Ann discovers her infatuation with Jack, which begins to develop.  It is here Jackson truly begins to develop the story after the character introduction in New York before they set their course for Skull Island.  The story builds heavily on emotions with a strong emphasis on love, obsession, and fear.  The borders between these emotions slowly begin to diffuse, as they soon turn into a madman's dream.<br /><br />The ship's arrival to Skull Island soon makes it clear that the cinematic expedition was poorly planned for what they are about to encounter on the island, which is hidden in a dense and mischievous fog.  The most basic emotion emerges within them all - fear - as they discover the secret dangers that have been lurking on the island for the last million years.  Out of fear other emotions begin to brew such as rage, anger, and vengeance, as Ann is kidnapped and brought to the heart of the darkness within the island.  The men on the ship set out on a rescue expedition to discover that some secrets are best unknown, as the most primal of instincts emerges within them all - survival of the fittest.<br /><br />King Kong displays an extraordinary adventure with remarkable visuals that effectively applies computer-generated animation.  These visuals are only the icing on the cake, as the audience begins to cut into the cake they will expose multiple layers that provide a genuine depiction of the primal origin of emotions.  However, Jackson is not content with this notion, as he pushes the audience to investigate the prehistoric emotions that swell up in our civilized society through greed and vanity among other feelings.  Eventually, the film converges on the unifying emotion of love, but where rage and fear exist this tender feeling will rapidly vanish if the individual does not surrender himself or herself to love.  Thus, within this highly engaging epic adventure, the viewer will find himself or herself stumbling into a poignantly expressive tale of unconditional and fearless love resting within all creatures hiding beneath the primal rage protecting the being.emotions.

B000002J1M|4.0|Overall, this record's pretty solid.  Watcher of the Skies is really cool...if these guys had metal-type half stacks back when they recorded this, the opening riff would sound like something from Meshuggah or Dillinger Escape Plan.  Ha.  Don't let me mislead you, this is art/prog rock all the way, but a great band to check out if you otherwise might have associated the name Genesis with their I Can't Dance era.
B00004TH83|5.0|Unlike the assinine comment made at the top of the page by Courtney Kemp, Lara Fabian is outstanding in all features, talented beyond belief, and the fact that she sings fluently, without a trace of an accent in English, French and Spanish, and has appeared with such top talent like Josh Groban and others, has appeared on Movie Soundtracks, and the list goes on.  It's too bad that the derogatory comments made by Courtney Kemp, i.e. that her music befits a 13 year old, and other weird comments, such people as this who CANNOT appreciate talent, should keep their mouths shut.  Lara Fabian is pure magic!   Wes Schrader, M.A.
0553573411|1.0|Looking at the reviews of this book it would seem I am in the minority but I really grew to hate this book. The first book in the series (Assasins' Apprentice) was OK and had a pretty good ending. It was very slow, but I slogged through it.I hoped the second would be better. The second book, was, for the most part much worse. I found it to move incredibly slow. Moreover, I feel that the way people act in this story is incredibly irrational. Without going into spoilers, the resolution of the main thread of this book, is wholly unbelievable and I did not feel that in the circumstances people of any intelligence would have chosen the paths the characters took in this book. It was very frustrating, and I found I hated the plot. The last 100 pages are bewildering and I found really no interest or empathy for the direction the book took. The writing style is kind of high-literaturish, but I found it overblown and extremely melodramtic. There are a lot of professed key turning points in the plot or in characters growth or personality that are summarily dismissed a few pages later on. There are many major plot holes. I did not believe the actions or motivations of the characters. I especially did not empathize at all with the main character, Fitz. Since it is written in a first person POV this is a major problem. I understand he is \\"the king's man\\", but I just did not buy the storyline. I did trudge through to the end, and found no interest in the sudden change of direction the story took. I have no interest at all in reading the third in the series though I own it or any other of Hobbs books. I really cannot see what people like in this book at all. I found it dull, poorly pace, unbelievable, annoying and uninteresting. One of my least favorite books I have read. And I love fantasy. Some think this is the pinnacle, but I find it near the bottom. Really poor story arc, and poorly designed characters with very suspect actions and motivations.
B000002KZA|4.0|This is where DM began to diversify musically, combining samples and  acoustic guitar work with their synthesizers, and it is the first indication of where they would go. Lyrically it's all a bit naive and earnest, but that's actually part of its charm. There's hardly a dud song in the bunch, even the slightly annoying Love,In Itself has a chorus that lifts it to greater heights than it should rightly be allowed. Also here is the first song that can be considered a DM \\"classic\\" in the form of Everything Counts, which has the best lyric on the album ( not to mention one of Martin Gore's finest ever.) CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN is a real winner -  one of DM's best - and it still holds up more than twenty years later.
B00004W3L3|5.0|I first heard of Marillion when they opened for RUSH during their 1986 Power Windows tour.  Usually, I don't have the patience for opening bands, but this one blew me away!  I remember they played the entire album and I didn't want it to end.    MISPLACED CHILDHOOD is like one 41-minute continuous progressive rock journey that can be compared to old Genesis music with Peter Gabriel.  However, lead singer Fish gives the band its own flavor and essence.  The album is a mid-eighties progressive rock gem!
B000BI0WOA|3.0|Previous reviews have pointed out that the bulk of this collection focuses (and rightly so) on Mark Knopfler's work with Dire Straits, but the music that is unaddressed creates a vacuum.  If one were not familiar with Mark Knopfler, this collection would present a skewed portrait of his range.  Where are a couple of tracks from the Neck and Neck album with Chet Atkins?  This album showed a great deal of his prowess and playfulness.  I would also liked to have seen a track or two from the Notting Hillbillies album.  A wonderful opportunity to showcase his range was unexplored.  However, as a fan I would find it hard to distill his work down to 2 CD's.
B00000I01A|2.0|well cant say this rocky album is one to stand the test of time, thanks to a snyth heavy soundtrack, and lots of cheesy but infectious arena rockers. but it really cant hold a candle to the more organic,memorable, and soulful orchestrations of thew original. It probablly still makes for good listenings to pump you up. but like its lame movie it leaves me cold. and the soundtrack features the skin and bones version of \\"war\\" which i recall has a wailing guitar solo and a more powerful punch to it, that was in the movie but absent from the soundtrack. most of the miniscule original orchestral composistions never made it to the cut sadly....and probablly will never see the light of day
B0002NRQTS|5.0|A good candidate for my favorite Rush album would be 1987's 'Hold Your Fire' containing the excellent \\"Time Stand Still\\".1989's 'Presto' has the same basic feel only pushes the rock edge further up front again-leaving this album a tad more edgy in places.But those edges are smoothed out across \\"Show Don't Tell\\",\\"Chain Lightning\\" and \\"War Paint\\".The most impressive cuts are the more atmospheric title song and \\"Red Tide\\".The catchiest tune on 'Presto' is \\"Anagram (For Mongo)\\",one of the poppiest items in Rush's catalog.The most telling cut here is \\"Scars\\",looking strongly towards the instrumental jamming funk groove of the next album,although again with more fusion leanings.With 'Presto' Rush continues their 80's winning streak and ended their golden decade with yet another golden egg.And thankfully even better things were to come.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Set in Kenya, you'll find everything you'd expect: the Nairobi of the diplomats, especially the English, their ennui and ritual behavior and on the other hand the living of the poor and poorest (lacks a bit the middle class). Beautiful landscapes and safari type adventures, soon overshadowed by the thrilling plot -drug companies which kill not only by testing their drugs. <br /> <br />The camera work is astonishingly, it's lovely to see Rahel Weisz naked and pregnant, even Ralph Finnes isn't as dull as usually - so five stars for what to expect (and we didn't expect an African movie).
B000001ESP|5.0|The interesting thing about Rush is that unlike alot of progressive rockers who are indulgent and somewhat pretentious Rush's lyrics intelligently explore the rebellious spirit of rock n' roll itself.The words match the bombast.So for the bands best known album 'Moving Pictures' instead of dumbing down their sound to appeal to a bigger audience,Rush allowed it's audience to get into them by sharpening up their songcraft along with their musicianship,more so then the previous year's triumph 'Permanent Waves'.Of course the two best known songs were the bands biggest hits-\\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\"-the latter of which explores the bands newfound fame and has them declaring \\"all the worlds a stage\\".\\"Red Barchetta\\",\\"Witch Hunt\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\" all amply explore Rush's \\"new\\" sound,which aptly combines instrumental prowess with a heavy rock kick.Every one of the songs features more synthesizers then is typical for Rush.My favorite song on the album is THE jam-\\"YYZ\\" is a brief instrumental that captures a fast paced,memorable jazz-rock fusion groove with Geddy's bass and Neal'drums and their most improvisational and funky.\\"The Camera Eye\\" is a ten minute distillation of the same theme.<br /><br />  Eight years into their recording career and seven albums worth of material to toy with and expand their sound Rush were lucky enough to peak during an era when the era of music they were a part of was beginning to peak-Journey's 'Escape\\",ELO's 'Time' and  The Moody Blue's 'Long Distance Voyager\\" all came out the same year and all records were big commerical breakthrough's for now legendary progressive rock bands.And with 'Moving Pictures' Rush can be proud to add themselves to that impressive roaster!
B000C3H4MC|1.0|I returned the Brick to Rhino because my Onkyo DVD-A player could not access the Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 tracks. Not only couldn't I access those tracks, my machine would freeze.  <br /> <br />So, I bought this new reissue of \\"Remain In Light\\" hoping the problem with the Brick version would be corrected. No such luck.  <br /> <br />Thanks Rhino.
B000026ESX|4.0|The review by Darth Kommisar pretty much sums up this release. Anybody who actually likes 80's hard rock should own this album as at this point Europe were really in their own little world. They may have loved Thin Lizzy but this release has a teutonic grandiose sound that Lizzy just wouldn't of done.<br /><br />Memories is right up there as one of the tremendous rock songs about lost opportunities. Seriously, anyone over the age of 14 or so should be able to relate to this song as it's so universal. Paradize Bay - the music and the lyrics sound like they should be two different songs. Whatever Joey Tempest was drinking at the time he wrote these lyrics I want some, it should NOT work but it does.<br /><br />Of course this is a debut effort and thre are some creaky bits. But I can forgive it all as a guilty pleasure, and John Norums Boyazont is not the low point that many instrumentals are. In fact to me it's one of the highlights of the album. And also shows why he won best guitarist in the competition that saw Europe get the funding for this, their debut effort.
B00002687X|4.0|I love this album. Sure it's got some dud songs on it and is a little more American sounding. But when you get Dreamer on the same album as Wings of Tomorrow and Scream of Anger you know your dealing with a band that actually has feeling.<br /><br />The force with which the rockers hit my (then) teenage mind cannot be overestimated. Joey Tempests lyrics are at times fun loving and at other times deadly serious. He had really hit his stride and the band sound fully focussed on this release.<br /><br />Some people hated their next album, The Final Countdown, but if it wasn't for the success of that album most people wouldn't of gotten to hear that this album and it's predecessor existed. and that would be a real shame.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|ok so when i first saw this movie was coming out i did not want to see it because frankly it looked like just masive killing of animals and whores. <br /> <br />but funny enough i got a free month subscription to netflix and so i figured well why not since it is free.  So i sat down and watched it and it turns out this was an amazing movie.  If anyone has doubts about seeing it because it looks bad or because the previews  make it look like what i described in the first paragraph, forget that and rent it.   <br /> <br />It actually was an amazinly well done movie with an amazing twist at the end and a incredible plot.  hands down amazing!!!
0446577383|1.0|If you view the U.S.and the War on Terror through Michael Moore style coke-bottle glasses, you might like this book.  I don't and didn't.  Even sophomoric politics aside, the book lacked the novelization and plot skills of a Lescroart, Connolloy, W.E.B. Griffin, Grisham (most of the time) etc.I gave up reading it halfway through.  Just seemed a little too contrived and I was put off my his anti-American bent. In this, it seems little different than other of Baldacci's book which I seem to toss before getting to the middle of the book.  And that's where this book's heading. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000009XP|5.0|I'm not a blues expert. I'm a born and bred south Chicagoan, and a blues fan for over thirty years. Purists be damned, this IS a blues album.  <br />I bought this album on vinyl when it was released. I saw Buddy playing live a lot around then (and many times since) and if you want to get an idea what kind of a pounding show he played in small clubs at that time listen to \\"You've Been Gone Too Long\\".  <br />Although this is a studio album, it feels \\"live\\" and has none of the over-produced slickness that mars many of the albums on the Alligator Records label. Buddy and the band are loose (not sloppy though, the chops and grooves are tight) yet intense. Phil Guy, Buddy's brother, is also on Stone Crazy and is a phenomenal blues guitarist as well (I'm not sure, but I believe some of the solos on this album may be his).  <br />If you are in a Son House / Robert Johnson kind of mood this isn't the album for you. But if you'd like to know what it was like at small, smokey blues clubs in Chicago when this album came out, buy this.  <br />If you like this album I also recommend \\"Son Seals: Live and Burning\\". Both are rough, raw, powerfull, and \\"sloppy-tight\\" I never play Stone Crazy without it...and a shot of whiskey.  <br />
1590581814|5.0|A few paragraphs in and you can smell the musty 40s. Gooseneck lamps, gently rounded cars, double-breasted suits. Everyone smoked. Everyone drank. Everyone ate steak.<br /><br />  But it's the modern day in LA. Driver leaves his foster home at 16. Makes it to L.A. Becomes a stunt driver. Along the way he develops a sideline of driving getaway cars.<br /><br />  A robbery goes wrong. Driver escapes with the loot and a woman robber. Someone tries to kill Driver: doesn't succeed, but takes out the woman.<br /><br />  Driver is a gentle soul. I drive, that's all is his ethic. But someone wants more and Driver doesn't like anyone on his trail.<br /><br />  Sallis is a master of noir. In 158 pages, he bangs out a complete morality play in which there is no good, no bad: just is, just what is there. Driver doesn't have a past or a future. Just a moment that demands certain things be done. Rootless, but not souless, Sallis paints his portrait in subtle strokes, all the more telling for that.<br /><br />  Sallis dedicates this work to Ed McBain, Donald Westlake and Larry Block, three great American writers. Sallis is, in my opinion, matched only by Block. McBain was great, but Sallis is better at noir.<br /><br />  \\"Drive\\" is a pleasant escape into a different reality, a true gem.<br /><br />Jerry
0385507755|1.0|why are some of you people letting him off so easy (ie, \\"so what if he changed a few details...\\")? you seem to be missing the whole point. the book is only compelling if it is *true*. if it is not true, and he didn't really do time, didn't kick an extreme, life-threatening crack habit by very unconventional means... if he's not this badass he made up and is really just a spoiled frat boy with a few DUIs and a booze and coke problem.. then the story has no power! <br /> <br />further, he is from my wife's hometown. he went to school with my sister-in-law. there are giant inaccuracies, and misappropriation of another family's tragedy (namely that he had anything to do with the death and aftermath of the girl[s] who died in the train accident). to me, it says that what he has currently admitted to falsifying is likely just the tip of the iceberg: was there really a leonard and were they really friends? was there a lilly and did she really die just hours before he could get to her? if not, again, the story has no power. <br /> <br />if we could just make up fantastical stuff and call it true/memoir/non-fiction... then why don't we all write stories about how we can fly, just by flapping. or cure cancer by touching people, \\"i swear i can do it, i'm just not gonna show you cuz i don't feel like i want people probing my life anymore... even though i pubilshed a frigging memoir!\\" <br /> <br />please do not let self-aggrandizing, crap-talking liars off this easily. sickens me to think he profited off his BS. and profited off me. i bought AMLP and MFL. finished AMLP just a day before this broke. will NOT be reading MFL - ever. it has no truth or power anymore - whatsoever.
0553801503|3.0|I'm a big fan of George R.R. Martin. I've been reading his fiction eagerly ever since he published the short story, \\"Sandkings,\\" a sci fi piece I highly recommend. When I found out he was writing fantasy, I was ecstatic, as I saw it as a sorely needed addition of quality writing to field filled with so much garbage. <br /> <br />I've read the first three books in his \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, and I'm now on page 302 of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (hardcover edition). Normally I wouldn't critique a book until I'm done reading it, but this novel cries out for comment. <br /> <br />Despite being a wonderful wordsmith, Martin stumbled when he wrote \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" His prose is still lovely, borderline poetic. But I think he sacrificed the story to character development in his latest work. <br /> <br />Whereas the first book in the series (\\"A Game of Thrones\\") was relatively fast-paced, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" plods along like a crippled hunchback. I blame this on the way the series is written. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" begins with one point of view (POV), which opens up to more and more, until you have several by the end of the novel. The number of POVs increases further book by book (despite the fact that he kills off a number of characters), until there are more than ten by the time you get to \\"A Feast For Crows.\\" <br /> <br />This wouldn't be that bad if these were all characters you already knew, but several are new ones, which means he has to explain who they are, their history, what their motivations are, etc. This, on top of the backstory he has to write for characters we already know, filling us in on what they have been up to since we last checked in with them. Thus there's lots of blabbing, many asides, lengthy pondering and very little action. <br /> <br />What irritates me the most, though, is that the character I like best, Tyrion (the disfigured dwarf), hasn't even shown up yet! <br /> <br />I will finish this book. I owe that much to the fantasy master. But I certainly hope the next in the series is tighter and simpler.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|The Disney studios dropped traditional animation. It is, for historical reasons, very sad and this is definitely the end of an era for animation, and cinema in general. <br /> <br />I must say the trailer for Chicken Little did not make this movie very appealing. We took our 4 year old daughter to see it and all enjoyed it after all. The humour is upbeat, no doubt modern, but never trivial or vulgar. The characters play much better than expected (the fish is a truly classic but effective cartoon character) and even though the storyline probably does not go any further than the average\\"Goof Troop\\" tv episode, the dialogues and the action surely deliver good entertainment. <br /> <br />For animation fans, which I am, I don't think we should try to compare Chicken Little with a Pixar film for it would not live up to that but still, this one comes highly recommanded. <br />Unlike some of the dreamworks 3D flicks, Chicken Little has a heart and you can feel that the animators and directors really have a good appreciation and understanding of animation. <br /> <br />A certain heritage and tradition of American animation lives on throught this movie. <br />Seeing that Disney scored at their first attempt at 3D animation is a relief, now let's wait for their next release to confirm the hopes.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I just got home from seeing the majestic \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" The movie is \\"THAT GOOD.\\" I won't go into a plot synopsis since that has been covered so many times on this site. I would like discuss the performances. Everyone involved in the film is excellent, in fact, flawless. I think Jake Gyllenhaal has been unjustly overlooked with all the praise over Heath Ledger's performance. Jake's performance is as good as Heath's--just in a understated sort of way. Also Ann Hathaway has an astonishing scene at the end on the phone with Heath's Ennis. My only complaint is that the film is a little slow, but this is a very tiny quibble. The screenplay is amazing and will definetly win the Oscar. I hope Jake is nominated for a supporting Oscar(he was strangely omitted at the Golden Globes???) Also check out the poignant soundtrack on CD. All in all, the best picture of the year--one you will not easily forget in your mind or heart.
B000067J1H|3.0|This film is being sold with Pulp Fiction. Don't compare the two and expect fight club to be as good. You'll be let down. Admittedly it had some interesting concepts and was well acted but how it came together bothered me. It probably works much better in its book format. Though there are some scenes, like the scar-ing scene which work very well to have me on edge. But on the whole i couldn't rate this any better. 2.5 would be my prefered rating. It lacks pacing in many places and in many places you lack a reason to want to continue on through the film. I saw it because of the hype and was let down, but don't be fooled. <br />Its worth a glance if you have the time or its on TV but not for buying if you haven't seen it yet.  <br />On the whole, Wholely unsatisfying. But it had potential.
B00007LTIB|5.0|If you are a fan of Yes and you don't own this MASTERPIECE, you should seek professional help. I'll admit, Relayer was rather difficult for me to get into, but after I bought some more of their older stuff like Close To The Edge and Drama, I realized that to seize listening to Relayer was a task I could not perform! What makes Relayer Yes's best album? Perhaps it's because the stroy is of it is told through not only the lyrics, but the instrumentation, or because it's sound isn't like any of their other albums. Not only is Relayer the best Yes album, but one of the best records of all time.<br /><br /> The Gates Of Delrium is the longest song here, running 21 13 or so. It doesn't start out as you expect it to, as the beginning of it sounds like it trailed off a song with the jumpy keyboards and light symbol tapping. It seems to be about an intergalactic battle between warriors trying to defend their ground, \\"Stand and fight we do consider\\". One thing that's outstanding about the song is that if you listen to the midle of the song, you can hear the guitar and keyboards battle with each other constantly; this is what really stands out on the record.<br /><br /> I beleive Soud Chaser is when some friends have lost each other while fighting the battle, and are trying to find each other.<br /><br /> The title of To Be Over bassically explains itself. After fighting the battle, the warriors sail away and look back at the war and their adventures, but decide to move on, \\"We go sailing dow the calming stream\\". Now i don't know if that's what it's really about, but that is what I have come to think.<br /><br /> JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!! You can't have just one song, it's all or nothing! Actually, it's all or all!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|this is such an amazing album. it has a new sound, but it is still the wonderful music that we have grown to love from the strokes. i can't stop listening to it. i have to fight with my brother to listen to it because he always wants to have it in his car.i should just buy another one. it is so awesome. everytime i listen to it i love it more and more. if you don't have it, go and get it because you are seriously missing out on the best that there is out there.don't be a coconut. go and get \\"First Impressions of Earth\\".  you should also visit there website at [...] thestrokes.com. you can get more info on their other awesome albums.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'll admit that I never really got massively into grunge, but Alice In Chains is awesome!!! I couldn't find Dirt or Jar Of Flies in any stores so eventually I just downloaded them both off of itunes. Every song is brilliant and the next never fails to over shadow the last. The skip button might as well be obsolete when listening to this album, but my favorites would have to be Rooster, Rain When I Die, Them Bones, Would?, and the increbily underrated Sickman. People don't like that song because it's a bit repetitive, but you gotta love the drums in the biggining, the jumpy guitar riff during the verses, and the weird sound effects during the last minute of the song. It switches continuously from being super heavy to super melodic. Them Bones is the catchiest off the album, with the chorus and the guitar solo at the end. Rain When I Die is really melodic, with great lyrics, and a cathy chorus of \\"Well did she call my NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME?! I think it's gonna RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIN when I DIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\\" Rooster is definately the best off the album. It's the slowest and most melodic, but has some great guitar riffs and a chorus that makes you feel like you're running from something. And do I need to explain why Would? is so great. I didn't think so. But of course, all of the songs are masterpieces! Unfortunately, this album is open to get negative reviews from immature individuals like ILFOB!Melissa who voice completely useless opinions that prove they don't know anything about music. Anyway, If you haven't bought this album yet and you have good taste in music(unlike ILFOB!), you don't know what you're missing!<br /><br />Oh, and if any of you are looking for a good laugh, check out what ILFOBMelissa wrote about herself, her idol is Paris Hilton! Doh!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I first heard \\"Drume Negrita\\" on my local NPR station (Oregon Public Broadcasting has a great night time lineup) about a year ago and nearly lost it when I heard all that fabulous twang, reverb and slow tremolo, played with such taste and restraint that I knew it must be a master at work. I was not surprised to find out that Ry Cooder was involved, but the CD is even more rewarding than I expected for there are two great masters at play here. <br /> <br />Ry Cooder has long demonstrated his nearly frightening ability to deeply assimilate remote cultural influences, never betraying the slightest condescension. He finds himself in the presence of Cuban master Manuel Galban whose sense of the obscure and beautiful is a match for his own; indeed, it is often hard to tell who is who, as the strings bend and chime as if with one mind. <br /> <br />If all that weren't enough, the superb accompaniment lifts Ry and Manuel ever higher with flawless and soulful Carribean rhythms. The syncopations - the accents - the perpetual motion - all lend a sense of absolute inevitability to these songs, as if they have always existed. <br /> <br />I can't stop listening to this one. 5 stars, one of Ry's best efforts!

B000BSY142|5.0|This is not the movie \\"1984\\". SO BEWARE!   It is a study course of the political ramifications of a system of government that completely controls the lives of everyone, in every possibble aspect. A great tool for teaching what a democracy is not.
0446577383|4.0|I wish I could pick 3 1/2 stars.  It wasn't just \\"OK\\" but I don't think it deserved 4 stars either. <br />Apparently Baldacci has been reading \\"Thiller writing for dummies\\" and attending his local community college foreign affairs class.  The only thing unique about this book was the overall motivation of villains.  The romance was poorly contrived and forced upon the reader.  I found this book very much the way I find Dan Brown's books...  very strict at following a decent recipe.  The problem is you can only eat the same dish so many times before you become bored with it and stop ordering from that chef.  This book would have been much better for me if I had spent any length of time in the D.C. area, and I can see why the guy from MD liked it.   <br /> <br />The dialogue was average, the twists were predictable and at some points blatantly obvious.  I didn't mind the massive american bashing, and was rather impressed with some of the research level.  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, asking someone to sufficate their brain to kill all the cells that are able of inteligent though just to believe what they are reading is another.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|People always want instant gratification. This album dosn't give you that, it demands more than one listen, and after listening to the album all the way through 10 or 11 times, it became clear to me this is a amazing album. Worth every penny.
B00005JOFO|4.0|In many ways, this is a great film, and Heath Ledger's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, as well as an Oscar.  Its understated brilliance and his portrayal of his character as a man torn between two lives, mostly evoked through subtle action, laconic speech, and a physical disconnect from his circumstances, save for the flashes of violent love and too few tender moments, never dares stray into a world he really doesn't know, and therein lies its success as a performance but also the failure of the film.  I was expecting the movie to be a crushing emotional experience, but the audience, including myself, never started weeping until the last ten minutes, when Ennis goes to Jack's boyhood room and finds the bloddy shirt.  He clutches it and smells it and only then do we understand the depth of his feeling for the other man.  The weathered boards of the wall in that room are the weathered remnants of his love and the emptiness of Ennis's world as the desolate view through the window there is the last frame of the film and testimony to the artist's vision of its director, Ang Lee. <br /> <br />The problem with the movie, however, is ultimately that it is a film made by heterosexual people about a homosexual experience, and that is where the emotional disappointment occurs for me.  Having lived that same torment, I never felt the strangling and overwhelming inner pain that such an impossible love causes in either Ennis or Jack.  Perhaps the Michelle Williams character best evoked that struggle, but she too seemed somewhat detached from the reality of emotional distress. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it is still a beautiful and heart-wrenching movie that I would recommend to anyone, either straight or gay.  It has beautiful scenery and a score that is appropriate in its simplicity and repetitiveness, and the performance by Heath Ledger shows him as an actor of great sensitivity, promise, and skill. <br /> <br />I look forward to the release of the DVD sothat I can see it again.  I expect I will like it more the second time.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|When I learned that the PULSE concert DVD was getting a first-rate upgrade, I was excited when I saw that they are FINALLY putting the screen films on the DVD as a seperate item, so we can watch the wonderful visuals contined in them. I have seen many concerts in the last thirty-years, and BY FAR, PINK FLOYD was the absolute best. They define presentation in performance.<br /><br />The most notable thing about the PULSE show, and what makes it a historically important musical event, is because it was the first time the entire DARK SIDE OF THE MOON album had been filmed in concert performance. This is the concert of THE DIVISION BELL tour, which was a great show.<br /><br />The goodies on this DVD set make it a MUST-HAVE for even marginal fans of this band. It provides a document as to why they are considered the masters of theatre rock. PINK FLOYD is NOT just a concert, it's an experience.<br /><br />The technical surround 5.1 mix on this title approximates the spatial orientation as if the viewer was seated in the center floor, about twenty rows back.<br /><br />This is a CANNOT LOSE title, all the way!

But unfortunately for Clark Kent, he wants to give up his superpowers for good so he can be with Lois ( Margot Kidder) as she finally figured out who Clark really and is now a mortal without no mere strength or power. However, the country and the world are in mortal danger from the fearsome four but can Clark Kent change back to Superman or will the world be doom?<br /><br />Excellent second part that proves that a sequel can work as much as \\"X-Men 2\\", \\"Spider-Man 2\\", \\"Godfather 2\\", \\"Empire Strikes Back\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead ( 1978)\\", \\"Evil Dead 2\\" and some others can do. The acting is top notch, The villians are preety belivable including the sexy Sarah Douglas as Ursa! there's also some good special effects for it's time, E.G. Marshall does an appearence as the president and there's plenty of action to satisfy the viewer's taste.<br /><br />The DVD has only two features which is a trailer and bios, but the picture and sound are good but not great! i hear there's going to be 2-disc special editions of all 4 movies coming out on DVD this summer to cash-in on \\"Superman Returns\\".<br /><br />A recommended sequel!
1932907009|5.0|In terms of conceptualizing and structuring a screenplay, this is the best book that I have read. The only issue I have is the notion that the hero should be constructed after the premise -- a person who \\"would offer the 'longest journey' and need to learn the biggest lesson.\\" This gets down to the issue of a story being plot-driven or character-driven. I tend to side with the latter: create a memorable character dealing with real human issues and you can place him in just about any situation. In fact, as I point out in my book on story theory, \\"The World as Story,\\" [...] the story premise world is a metaphorical realm for dealing with the hero's fundamental issue. Character is primary, plot is secondary. On the whole, though, a great book. Many thanks!

B000003TA4|5.0|Sure they borrowed from a lot of other acts but so did those acts borrow from others and on and on it goes but does that mean that Nirvana isn't great or that this album is overrated?  Definitely not!<br /><br />If you believe that then you'll have to say that Eric Clapton sucks and is overrated because he copied B.B. King, Albert Collins, Freddie King, and countless others.  Why stop there?  B.B. King sucks because he copied Muddy Waters.  Muddy Waters sucks because he copied Robert Johnson and the other Delta Blues singers....etc, etc.  How about David Bowie?  He openly admits that nothing he does is original but he borrows from various influences and so does he suck and does that make \\"Ziggy Stardust...Mars\\" one of the rock classic albums of all time a bad album?<br /><br />All music irrespective of genre is built upon the work of others and unless you totally and utterly rip off someone and infringe on copyright, you are building on something and eventually making it your own.  This album isn't overrated and every track is a genre standard.  15 years on, the only problem with this album is that it needs some remastering although I know Kurt himself wouldn't agree as he hated the polished sound and tried to remedy it with a very raw and yet awesome sounding \\"In Utero\\" but you can't really compare the 2 and they are both awesome in their own right i.e. you don't have to hate the one to like the other.<br /><br />I've already started seeing on more recent best of albums lists compiled by renowned music critics where this album is among the top 10 albums of all time along with albums by the Stones and the Beatles and I for one am not surprised.

B00005AQE8|1.0|2pac's fans are like a cult. They blame people for being ignorant and bigoted yet they present themselves just as narrow-minded as the ones they accuse. If Tupac's music is even questioned, his blind legion of fans will swarm immediately defending their dead icon while taking someone's individual opinion as a personal assault. Thus, it never occurred to you fans that it might be essential to practice what you preach? How many of you are actually permissive enough to sit down and have the patience to indulge into an album like Tool's \\"Aenima\\"? How many of you have the tolerance to endure a metal masterpiece such as Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\"? How about just having some appreciation for the amazing production in a classic piano piece like Chopin's \\"Polonaise\\"? If anything, rap fans are the most narrow-minded people I have ever encountered in my entire life. I am 18 and just finished high school where rap was the most popular genre of music that everyone listened to. I would always receive a condescending smirk followed by a head shaking from one of my classmates when they ask me what I was listening to in my CD player and the answer was not hip hop or r&b. Ironically, I consider myself as a rap fan. I thoroughly enjoy NWA, Public Enemy and Wu-Tang Clan and even new age hip hop artists such as Outkast have the ability to bring talent on the table.  <br /> <br />Similar to poets and artists, many musicians will receive more sales and fame once they die. People are oblivious to claim this as false. Van Gough, an artist who failed to sell one painting in his entire lifetime only achieved success after death. Even a mediocre band by the name of Nirvana reached cult-like status after the demise of Kurt Cobain. Thus, the same can be said for the Notorious BIG and 2pac. BIG's \\"Life After Death\\" sold 10 million albums worldwide and is claimed as the best selling rap album of all time. Sure the guy can rap, but would he have achieved the same status if he was alive? I highly doubt it. Similar to BIG, Tupac has become a legend after his death. (Watch out Martin Luther King and Malcolm X) But ever since 1996, his releases after death have been nothing but money making propaganda. (Take this CD for example) His thug life gangster image has been portrayed over and over, presently paving the way to success for phoney up and comers like 50 cent. Is this what music is about? Image? <br /> <br />Greatest hits? More like the greatest reason why music has been going to sh*t <br />
B000BKVQTS|1.0|it gets one star for the short bits where no well payed actors played their roles, the kids showed more talent then the stars of this film. the rocky movies had more of a fariy tale effect then this movie could dream of. seems like a poorly planned cash rake off the backs of movies like lord of the rings . very sad both the main actors , have been good in allmost every other film they have been in, with exeption of knights tale . wouldnt recommend watching this movie even if life depended on it , death would be a sweet release from this Z class film. and while the CGI was very bad not even a 500,000,000 dollar budget could save this flick , even the french mockery was lame .
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold draws you in with the first chapter when the main character dies of rape and murder (not ruining anything for you).  After that, go along with Solomon on her jurney in Heaven as she watches her friends and family move on without her in their life.  Also, watch as the murderer/rapest tries to hide his dirty deed from just about everyone.  Out of my favorite top five books, this one is either tied for first or slightly in second.  Hard to choose. <br /> <br />I also recomend a book called \\"My Sister's Keeper\\".  That is the book I can't decide if it ties with for first.
0307276902|3.0|James Frey's memior is a powerful tale of hope, stories made up, and keys lost....and found. Frey says this is just the way he remembers things, but some of these stories seem to be made up. After abusing drugs and alcohol in college, James says he was arrested for an incident involving assult with a deadly weapon, drug posession and beating up the entire school, the police force, confederate ghosts, a pack of bucking clydesdales and The Rock. (It was probably for selling kittens without a license.)<br /><br />He flees to Paris, where, during a savage game of \\"Knockout Kings\\" on the Playstation, Frey almost beats a man to death. The author recounts his harrowing battle with his Hulk-like \\"Fury\\" which was caused by exposure to gamma radiation during a high stakes S.E.A.L mission to eliminate a COBRA general. During the mission, Frey also became addicted the powerful drug \\"Children's Robitussin,\\" which leads to his dismissal from the team.<br /><br />Back in the states, he tries to start over by becomming a bouncer a \\"road house\\" bar called the \\"double deuce\\". He becomes head bouncer thanks to his S.E.A.L sharpened leadership. \\"All you have to do is follow three simple rules. One, never underestimate your opponent. Expect the unexpected. Two, take it outside. Never start anything inside the bar unless it's absolutely necessary. And three, be nice.\\"<br /><br />But he cannot shake his vices, and is destroyed by the murder of his buddy, Sam Elliot and the collapse of his hallucination induced marriage to a poster of actress Pam Anderson. At his most suicidal, he becomes addicted to drinking Cappucchino...and chasing it with Pepsi!!! His will to survive reminds me of Hank Williams Jr, who fell off a mountain, but recovered thanks to the love of all his rowdy friends.<br /><br />Frey checks into a rehab clinic to beat his demons, namely the Devil, and a demon named Steve, who owes Frey money from a Super Bowl bet. When they meet again, everyone in the rec room is watching \\"Ultimate Fighting Championship.\\" Steve hits James with the TV set, but James is so tough, when Steve asks him how that felt, he says \\"Like a kiss.\\" And then he beats up Steve because James's life is the the real toughman contest.<br /><br />Anyway, you will love this book, since it is in the tradition of \\"The Bible\\", \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt\\" and other tell all exposes on the wild parties, double live days and steamy nights of a bad boy.ship.\\" Steve hits James with the TV set, but James is so tough, when Steve asks him how that felt, he says \\"Like a kiss.\\" And then he beats up Steve because James's life is the the real toughman contest.

B0009R1T7M|4.0|Excellent album that is spared from being perfect by the singer's almost forced sounding breathy voice.
B000AL730O|5.0|The real test of an excellent Cd is that you miss it when you lend it out or put it on first even when you have newer stuff to listen to. This cd is not an attempt to get people hooked on a couple of hit singles. Don't go by the samples.<br /> The samples are just OK - you really have to listen to the songs all the way through. There is not a throwaway tune in the batch. This is not pop rock like Wings, but a mature effort by a relaxed and confident musician. A musical treat is guaranteed for all (didn't I hear that sometime in 1967).
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Hollywood loves neurotic and psychotic characters, often romanticizing and rationalizing their screwed up behavior.  Typically, after we are introduced to these people, the viewer gets to watch their descent. The movie ends, the credits roll  and we wonder why we bothered.  Yet, we seem to gravitate to these anti-heroes. There are tons of movies like this: Grizzly Man, The Door in the Floor, Love Liza and Kiss of the Vampire to name only a few. So what separates the good movies from the bad? Story? Cast? Screenplay? Acting? All of the above. And the Machinist hits the bull's eye in all of these categories.<br /><br />In The Machinist, the acting and casting is top notch; starting with Bales incredible performance as the skeletal Trevor Reznick and right down to the management stooge that runs the grimy machine shop he works in. Both actor and director understand Trevor Reznick emotionally and physically.  We are shocked as this walking corpse's presence fills the screen. See Batman Begins first for the real Christian Bale. It's a fine movie, too and it will give you a pretty good idea of how hard this actor worked to create his character.<br /><br />The Machinist is a complicated, psychological study of the holistic nature of the human experience. Reality and fantasy are explored on all levels. But, in the end, we are treated to a gratifying conclusion as everything falls into place and finally the character makes sense to us. For me, this movie has a happy ending as Trevor is finally released. In Love Liza, the main character finally overcomes his fear. In the Machinist, Trevor is physically, spiritually and emotionally forced to accept change and thus a new beginning for our anti-hero and the rest his soul so desperately cries out for.

0393038912|5.0|I found this book to be highly interesting, historically accurate, and filled with critical analysis.  The author backs up his claims with strong arguments which are well researched.  He lays out the content of the book in a logical form starting with the clash of two civilizations: The Inca Empire and The Spanish conquistadores in Cajamarca, Peru.  This historical episode, though placed at the beginning of the book, is shown to be the logical culmination of 11,000 years of evolution of human societies.  The different rates of societal evolution form the basis of this work and are examined to reveal a few causal relationships which the author proposes account for the inevitable outcome symbolized by the massacre in Cajamarca.  Suffice it to say that I found this book so interesting that I've gone on to another work by the same author: 'Collapse'.

While I think the faces of the crowd and the calls of \\"More, More\\" during the encores and the faces of the Eagles themselves says plenty, I will add that for anyone who enjoys good, quality music instead of some of the rubbish that is available on the music market these days will not be disappointed in this DVD, it is first class!

I bought it the day it came out, tore the wrapping off with my teeth, popped it in and turned up the volume. For the entire length of the album my jaw was on the floor and after the last chord rang out on \\"Red Light\\" all I could do was whisper \\"wow.\\" There's a message here, a commentary on the world that anyone who truly understands The Strokes will find an affinity with. Brilliant lyrics, outstanding composition, and unbelievable performances. Simply amazing and a necessity for anyone who loves genuine and innovative sound.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I had my first exposure to Monty Python as a very young child, when their shows were first being broadcast in the US in the mid '70s and my folks would watch them.  Then I saw this movie on Cinemax around 1982...and again the following day.  (By the way, Spiny Normal gives it two prickly thumbs up...Dinsdale!)  After which I promptly went out and bought...*dramatic pause*...a SHRUBBERY!! *Dramatic music!*  I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants (well, all right, not really), I did a few Silly Walks.<br /><br />The genius of the Pythons simply cannot be overstated.  Holy Grail was made on a shoestring budget, yet the lads managed to wring the maximum amount of laughs and silliness out of the Arthurian legends to great effect on that budget.  From the use of coconuts to imitate the sound of hoofbeats, to the burning of a witch because she's made of wood and floats on water like a duck (\\"Cor, she turned me into a newt!\\" \\"A newt?!\\" \\"(Long pause)...I got better...\\"), to Castle Anthrax and lots of good spankings, to the Bridge of Death (\\"WHAT...is your favourite COLOUR?!\\" \\"Blue!\\" \\"Very well, then, off you go.\\"), there's nary a wrong step here.  The bonus materials are a bit of fun, too; I must add that the subtitles make the lines easier to understand as well.  They make it much easier for you and your friends to spend countless hours quoting the film back and forth at each other...and the lines are VERY quotable.<br /><br />And the general quality of the film in the special edition is greatly improved; the prior DVD release had muddy sound and murky images, and while the film was enjoyable nevertheless, you still felt a little cheated--after all, the DVD is supposed to be an improvement over the old VHS.  With the special edition, it is.  Clearer and brighter both in sound and images, Sony Pictures has finally given this classic film a new lease on life.  And the extra 24 seconds of footage are good for a chuckle or two.

With the cast that is on the DVD...<br /><br />I can say that the Live performance is much better than what is on the DVD, but I like the DVD anyway, because it reminds all magical moments of this fantastic play.<br /><br />Cats is a great musical. If you're reading this it is because you already know it. So it is worth buying the DVD, but don't expect high-quality image and editing, because you won't get. Buy it as a reminder of your live experience.<br /><br />If you have never seen cats... better going to see Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (another fantastic play) in theathers and just believing me that Cats is fantastic (but the DVD unfortunatelly cannot give you this impression).
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein is the most successful German metal group in the world, and their live shows drew massive crowds with their out-of-control stage antics and passioned performances. Indeed, Rammstein is a force to be reckoned with, and while SEHNSUCHT does incorporate more melodic parts, it does retain some of the crunch of the debut for the most part. However, what Rammstein have crafted here is not only smart, but sophisticated and very, very enjoyable. Guitarists Richard and Paul remain impressive axemen, and bassist Oliver and drummer Christoph keep the rhythm section lean and mean. All of this continues to provide a foundation for Lorenz's keyboard flourishes and Till's stellar vocal performance.  <br /> <br />\\"Du Hast\\" (\\"You Hate\\") was the single that exposed them to the masses in America, and with its crunchy guitar, keyboard blips, and thick rhythms, they overtook a nation still alien to metal from their world. But this song broke them through. Elsewhere, the title track gets your blood going with its full-on rush and anthemic chorus of \\"Sehnsucht!\\" (\\"Longing!\\"). \\"Engel\\" (\\"Angel\\") is one of the most catchy songs on the album, complete with female singer Bobo's breathy and surreal vocals bouncing harmlessly off Lindemann's slight snarl. \\"Buch Dich\\" (\\"Bend Down\\") retains some of the crunch from HERZELEID and remains the angriest track on SEHNSUCHT. However, songs like the soaring and playful crunch of \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" (\\"Play With Me\\") and the aching and painful sadness of \\"Klavier\\" (\\"Piano\\") show off some of the gentle side that \\"Seamann\\" only hinted at on the debut. The addition of the hidden cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Stripped\\" makes this collection very much worthwhile. They cover turns the original into a metal monster complete with Lindemann's english words, and he doesn't embarrass by any means. They actually succeed in remaining faithful while retaining a crunch, and the melodic keyboard and guitar bits of the song are actually kind of soothing.  <br /> <br />SEHNSUCHT remains as strong an album as any other collection in their catalog. Boasting huge choruses, snap-your-neck guitars, pummeling and lilting rhythms, this album should already be well snug in your ever-growing metal collection. Rammstein stormed America, and SEHNSUCHT is the album that gave them the exposure they truly deserved.
1400031087|1.0|the controversy over the book started as i was in the middle of it, but i had doubts regarding the story even before.<br /><br />if the story was based on real events, it would have been an amazing journey told with bad prose, but the fact that most of it is complete fabrication, makes this book lose all its appeal.<br /><br />james frey protrays himself as a tough, witty and sensitive hero. and the book is full with ridiculous dialogues, badly written characters that seem to have been copied from some bad mafia movies.<br /><br />if i would have not received the book as a gift, i would have went back to the store and ask for a refund.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book more than most others I've read in my life. Yann Martel shares this extraordinary account through the voice of Pi Patel. Pi's delicate, fiercely accurate observations about himself and his world forced me to think in a way that books rarely do, though the ones I love best challenge their audience to do just that. I often found myself scirbbling into the margins and then turning the page to find the next line brought home the exact idea the previous page had brought me to.  <br /> <br />Great writers are capable of this -- pinpointing an emotion or reaction of which the human condition spares none of us. Our emotional responses to the world are inherently the same, and only vary in degree and expression. Despite how one person might react differently than the next, we all feel the same pains and drives -- Martel's account of Patel's experience magnifies both our personal and biological choices. Pi survived despite soul draining circumstances and despair but his body would not allow him to die even when he was sure that, because he felt his spirit gasping, his life would end.  <br /> <br />This book awakened me to that hope inside each of us that disallows us to give up long after we have chosen to do so. I was amazed to fully realize that this inability to surrender to pain or fear, or even death, is part of our living bodies. It's in the blood of every creature to survive, and absolutely nothing can take it from us. We can live through anything.  <br /> <br />In today's world, we can all use to be reminded that it is in our nature to persevere. Martel's novel, beautifully crisp and lyrical, shares a real-life experience and asks all of us the question we most fear: Can I handle this? Even more terrifying, we're given the answer, that, Yes, we can.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I first saw this film at a Boston French Film festival. I didn't speak French at the time but even my friends who could were thankful for the subtitles because the crowd laughed so hard at certain points in the movie that you couldn't even hear the actors! I've seen this movie so many times that I don't even need the subtitles anymore because I have it all memorized. For subtitle-wary folks, this movie is well worth getting over that - My ex's 9 year old son used to beg us to watch it. Why? Because this is definitely one of the most exquisitely hilarious movies I have ever seen. It's not what one would reffer to as mindlessly funny or stupid/goofy funny, it's funny because of the intelligently subtle comic timing, great writing and direction, and the chemistry between the main characters. Lhermitte's ability to say so much with just a look will have viewers laughing throughout the movie. Pignon, the  bumbling, well-meaning but oft disasterous character brings the movie to a level of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry. (Not to give anything away, but the ending of a phone call that Pignon makes proves to be the biggest laugh in the movie and one that will go down in cimenatic history)They are supported by a cast with perfect comic timing and a well developed story with surprises. Given the limited locations (the movie is set almot entirely in Lhermitte's apartment) the movie holds your attention and keeps you laughing until the very end.
B000BC8STC|5.0|This dvd is one of the earliest live shows of James that I've seen so far. If only this technology was available back in 1963 when James in his prime. But The Godfather has gone through so many transformations, only a true fan would know what period WAS his prime! Just imagine this...this dvd of his performance is only a small part of a show that he use to put on. Much more dancing, more dynamics with the band and a much better band! But for JB fans who have only recently been converted in the last 20 years!  LOL! This is still a great dvd!  BUY IT! And then search for more!
1573223026|1.0|From the reviews this book got I expected much more.  This book was boring, predictable, and to put it simply just a whole lot of blah blah blah.  Don't read it, it's a waist of time.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|I stumbled across this music by accident as I was flipping the channels and saw John Mayer Trio Live on Directv freeview. It really caught my ear quickly because I do like some blues. At first I thought gee he sounds just like Stevie Ray Vaughn. After Listening to a few songs I was really digging it. The next day I went to the record store and bought the cd. I had no idea who John Mayer was before buying this cd. Im just now getting familiar with his old stuff, but hope he continues with the blues and I will keep buying and this guy will become a legend. I havent heard anything new like this in a very long time. Its a must have for Rock/blues fans. John Mayer Jams really!!
B000003S5H|5.0|I feel a bit stoopid for stumbling on this so late after its release, but there you have it.  I'm a dumbass and Air's Moonwalk is phenomenally brilliant.  My body just hums when I hear it.  It's a retro 70's sound with a bit of 90's sensibility.  It's got a completely innocent vibe, yet to 100% honest.  This is Cheetos-eating-Mary-Jane groove music.  Slightly poignant and beautiful downbeat.  The ultimate in ease for the synethesiate.  I think relaxing pink.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is one of the deepest albums available out there. The entire cd is made of slow songs except for Pet.  <br /> <br />The best songs on this cd are The Nurse Who Loved Me and The Noose. <br /> <br />By far the best cd from A Perfect Circle
B000BTJDG2|3.0|If your a gullible person!?! then this dramatic thriller might change the out-look of your tiny god fearing existence! If your like me and gods,devils & demons are no more real to you than 'Freddy Krueger''Chucky' & the Easter bunny then you should enjoy \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" for the fright factor wich is a pretty damn good factor in this film & just try to look past the shallow religious message. The EXORCIST is a masterful landmark horror movie! This film is just a very good dramatic thriller! The evil that the human mind creates is as evil as evil gets!\\"FACT\\" This young girls belief system is what killed her.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|I have a feeling that Pulse is going to be released on the eve of 'On an Island's release to spur sales. Only that can explain all the delay tactics. It's like PF's sales going up 1300% after Live8. <br /> <br />The 1 star if for all the delays. I haven't seen the concert or the bootleg, but by all accounts it should be a good ride.
0385512058|5.0|I found Keith's book very informative.  Let's face, business is personal.  To be really successful you have to be willing to give of yourself first.  Many of the friendships I've developed have been through business and not the other way around - although it is nice when that happens...<br /><br />Keith's book offers practical \\"how to\\" steps in most cases, which I found to be helpful.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Total garbage.  This band and their music is a mockery of metal.  I read the review by \\"Lobster Leno\\" calling this band the \\"heaviest band on the planet\\"; which is obviously a joke.  He names some death metal bands and calls them poser bands, even though the the bands he listed were around long before slipcrap.  Go hide behind your mask.<br /><br />SH*T for SH*THEADS
B00004RYZT|4.0|Seems everything is subject to interpretation and obviously there are those who have done it with Rammstein, seems to be alot of people misreading DuHast, the song is meant to say \\" you have\\" not \\"you hate\\" Till Lindemann himself has explained the song, go on their website and read it for yourself. If you want to be entertained, watch a great show and not try to \\"guess\\"  or debate or assume what they're saying this is deffinately for you, it has everything you would never see in this country,the band gives 100% into their performance and the enthusiasm and feedback from the crowd is something not to be missed. This performance is what made me a fan!!!!!!!

0684824906|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" jumps into the Lincoln arena and offers a new and somewhat different view of Lincoln's political success.  Instead of a straight timeline of lincolns's life (which can be found in other sources) or of the run-up to a single speech or event, DKG instead looks at how he handled his cabinet, and chose a cabinet composed significantly of those who opposed him for the GOP nomination in 1860.<br /><br />The book reads smoothly, and DKG easily handles the task of keeping the reader aware of what all the major players were doing at a given time.  Most of the facts here are not newly discovered, but DKG looks at it from a different perspective...and in doing so creates a book that should be of interest to historians, Lincoln enthusiasts, management specialists among others.  She presents history as a living creature, not a dusty artifact.<br /><br />A posting below brings up the allegations toward DKG some years back about plagiarism and suggests that as a result all her work is tarnished.  This is one view to take.  However, as the book abotu the Kennedy's that was impugned has been rereleased with corrections to address said criticism, and as this book was published several years after said criticism, I think it is unfair to say this book is automatically suspect.  The book is 944 pages in length, and 120+ pages are footnotes and other source references.  I think we are safe on this one.<br /><br />Buy it, borrow it, get it from the library, but read this book-you will find it a great read and a rewarding experience.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Sahara is an action movie that knows it is an action movie, and not in the good postmodern way. At one point, the hero's sidekick offers 'you get the bomb, I'll get the girl'. If i were the writer, I'd argue that the sidekick had seen too many dopey action movies. As the critic, I'd argue that the writer hasn't seen enough good ones.  <br /> <br />The film stars Matthew Mchoguney as an all-purpose action character, Dirk Pitt. Unlike James Bond or Indiana Jones, who save the world for a reason, Pitt seemingly only does it because as an action hero, that is his job. Often times he points at things and helpfully explains how they fit into the ludicrous plot, just in case we care. The film's action sequences range from boring to mildly entertaining, nothing that seems to justify the film's $130,000,000 budget.  <br /> <br />A range of not quite A-list actors chime in supporting performances, including the completely wasted William H. Macy as Dirk's boss and the atrociously miscast Penelope Cruz as a concerned WHO doctor. Sure, Penelope serves as eye candy, but when you only devote a solid sex seconds of the film to her traipsing around in a bikini, was it really worth having to listen to her phonetically pronounce her lines? For that matter, was just about anything in the film worth our time and $130,000,000 of Disney's money? <br /> <br />Sahara was based on a novel by Clive Cussler, who rejected numerous drafts of the screenplay, most notably the one that got put to use. Who can blame him? Either the film takes one of his stories and makes it grossly unbelievable and stupid, or it shows how grossly unbelievable and stupid his original work was. <br />
0307277674|4.0|We all most likely remember the controversy surrounding another bestseller, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" in which the author, James Frey, admitted that he fabricated and changed some parts of his memoir. This resulted in quite an attack by Oprah Winfrey, whom I've grown to despise but that's another story. The Da Vinci Code is similar in a way: using true-life events and adding to it some fictional elements. It's certainly quite an interesting book but at the same time you can deflate the entire thing at times.<br /><br />Robert Langdon(also the star of Angels and Demons) comes across an odd sight: a naked man killed inside the Louvres, Paris' famous mansion. Also written are several clues which point to works by Leonardo Da Vinci. Langdon and a French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, investigate the murder leading to a secret that's extremely well guarded and can derail people's beliefs, all while being pursued by a weird albino monk and a french policeman.<br /><br />I'll just say this upfront: I'm not a Catholic at all. I was baptized Roman Catholic but the only times I go to church are weddings and funerals. First, I live my life according to what I think it should have and contain, not rules and regulations imposed by a religion. And second, I never liked the fact that my entire faith is devoted to a book. People dismiss this book as trying to pass itself off as fact when it's entirely fiction yet we believe wholeheartedly in another book. So reading this I don't get filled with a sense of outrage at the sense of \\"blasphemy\\" in the book. We don't have to believe the Da Vinci Code as fact but completely dismissing it because it says some naughty things is quite ignorant.<br /><br />Now, as a book how is it? Well it's certainly an entertaining read. I literally finished it in one night. \\"One more chapter\\" I kept saying until I noticed I was nearing the end and just said \\"the hell with it\\" and finished it off. However, looking back on it there's quite a couple odd parts. A lot of characters remember important information at extremely convenient times. Mind you, a significant portion(or the entire portion, I'm not sure), happens within a span of 1-2 days or even one night and the idea all this can happen is quite preposterous. Also, there's a lot of background information on Catholic history throughout and if you're not that well versed(like me), you're gonna often re-read parts just to keep your facts straight.<br /><br />Is it a book worthy of your time? Sure, it's quite an enthralling read and quite addicting at times. Just don't start believing everything it says or you'll be one of those people with signs above your heads shouting chants very easily.arts.

0307276902|1.0|Let's set aside that Frey's writing style is pretty much Freshmen English. Let's set aside the fact that he wasn't a tough outsider rebel that everyone was afraid of, but a soft spoiled suburban frat boy so forgettable no one can remember him. Why it matters so much that he lied about the major incidents in this story, is that without those incidents, there is nothing to be particularly admired.  He got drunk, got a DUI, his parents paid for him to go to Hazelden. He whined about it. He got out. End of story. Now I'm glad he got sober, I'm glad when any alcoholic gets sober, but his story is not remarkable when you subtract out the incidents he lied about. Lots of people get sober. And they are grateful for it. And they recognize that humility is a necessary ingredient for sobriety. Frey, on the other hand, is like a lot of guys who came of age in the early 90's, myself included. We wanted to be bad muthas...we wanted to be gangstas...we told a lot of lies about ourselves to appear like we were wilding...but we weren't. We were just stupid and drunk and obnoxious and, well, ordinary. But some of us grew up. Frey still wants to be a gangsta, but he never will be. He'll always just be who he is, a not particularly memorable vanilla child of privilege. For his sake I hope he comes to terms with that.  <br />I would like to say to Doubleday, to Oprah, and to his supporters. Addiction is real. It is terrifying and it is deadly, and to say that lying about your recovery for the sake of making money and self aggrandizing doesn't matter is not just irresponsible. It could cost lives. Please think about that.

Great songs and the arrangements made this record a standout in 1987, I played my vinyl to death! and had to get this on cd! this record had five singles released, Chaka Khan loved 'Everywhere' so much that she recorded it herself in 1996, I have to THANK Mick, John, Christine, Lindsay & Stevie for this one!!!!!!

B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn is back with another new cd. Their latest release, not counting greatest hits, was Take a Look in The Mirror which was terribly average and forgettable. I really was worried Korn had lost it. With See you on the other side Korn shows they still have life. The album isn't a masterpiece but it is still a good effort from Korn with a lot of good songs. I like almost every song on the album but none really stand out from one another except for a couple. Korn's sound and lyrics in this cd is different and are not quite up to par to earlier albums. The vocals of Jonathan Davis are still rock solid. I think i good amount of Korn fans will like this album but it is still not as good as old korn. One other thing i was dissapointed about was not much of Jonathan Davis classic rampant screaming. There is a few seconds of it in one of the songs but it's forgettable. I think Korn is on the right track. But they can not abandon their roots.
0380807343|4.0|This is a story for kids and adults who anticipate suspense in every chapter. Coraline is a courageous young lady who leads a sometimes boring life of a child on summer holiday away from school. Little does she know that that summer is going to turn extremely interesting! With her wit and gutsy spirit she embarks on a journey of saving lives from an evil being. The beginning of the story is quite mundane but when the tale actually unfolds it becomes more and more chilling on every page. Together with jagged sketches that meant to be horrifying (and they are), Mr. Gaiman succeeds again in creating a narrative that deserves an ovation; he has once more crafted fascinating characters and brightly engaged them in bizarre situations with a great sense of humor. Until the final page, the story is stupendously told.

This something is cognition...and sometimes your hunches are right and someitmes they are wrong, but here are some cool stories about lucky guesses!  That is basically all Gladwell writes about.  He tries to impress you with stories of the rogue general who beat the big bad US, and about the classical archeologist who just felt something was wrong.  He tries to tell you about the 1920 election and the most perfect yet ugly chair.  He tries to explain that all of these ideas are related to a power none of us can control or really understand.  Well it is pretty obviousle that Gladwell himself doesn't understand these ideas, so only read this is you want to go no where and learn nothing.
0596007124|5.0|In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly-occuring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code; it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. If you are familiar with the \\"heads first\\" approach to learning, then you already know that the book teaches the subject of design patterns using humor, cartoons, lots of diagrams, and even crossword puzzles while keeping text at a minimum. I have to admit I was skeptical about this book given its goofy looking cover, but it is one of the few tech books I have read as though I were reading a novel and actually retained anything of value.<br /><br />\\"Head-First Design Patterns\\" assumes the reader is already familiar with Java programming and object oriented concepts. Its purpose is to step in and correct wrong-headed object-oriented design philosophy that the reader picked up either in school or on the job. The book begins by introducing you to Joe, who is working on SimUDuck, which is a simulator of ducks in a pond. Joe's job is to design the Duck class. At first Joe starts off using inheritance to create the different types of ducks, but finds that he has rubber ducks that fly. Next he tries to correct the problem using an interface, but realizes that he will be overriding the quack and fly methods for all types of ducks as they are added, forever. Ultimately, the best solution to the problem is to use FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior interfaces, thus favoring composition (\\"has-a\\") over inheritance (\\"is-a\\"), as the book recommends in most cases - which is the book's first design axiom.<br /><br />The rest of the book follows this same basic pattern of introducing you to a design problem, showing how the fictional programmer attacks the problem with usually bad results in the first few outings, and finally introducing the design pattern featured in that particular chapter and showing how it solves this design problem and those similar to it. Finally, each chapter shows actual Java code so that the reader knows exactly how each design pattern is implemented to solve each design problem.<br /><br />The style of the entire book is very conversational rather than the one-way approach taken by most programming books. I would highly recommend this book to any Java programmer that wants to really learn design patterns as well as good overall object-oriented design philosophy. After you read this book, \\"Effective Java Programming\\" by Joshua Bloch will make much more sense, as that book makes heavy use of the lessons you learn in this book and extends them. I know Bloch's book made more sense to me after I read \\"Head First Design Patterns\\". In addition, in my opinion, this book is required reading for a thorough understanding of software frameworks.

6305075492|3.0|I love this movie but I won't watch this version because it has been tinted in pastel shades. Also, if I remember correctly, the text has been changed to some ugly font.  I bought an unrestored, cheap DVD copy of the film in a pharmacy recently and would much rather watch that one than this one.  Bottom line:  Superb movie, but don't bother with this version.
B000002C2E|5.0|I forget which one of the Beatles answered when asked if they would still be listened to five hundred years from now that the only performer of his generation he was certain would be was Bob Dylan. I agree with that opinion, but for the longest time it looked like the jokerman was not after BLOOD ON THE TRACKS have another album that could stand comparison with his great work of the sixties. Who would have thought that when he did match that earlier work, it would be with an album that was more focused on aging and the ending of life than on anything else.<br /><br />This is a somber, reflective, deeply introspective collection of songs. Rock and roll has never been a genre that has focused on death, except in the going down in a ball of flame sorta way. But here there are no balls of blame. He isn't exactly going gently into that good night, but he isn't quite raging either. While many of the songs evoke these feelings of loss and the passage of life, the highpoint is clearly the extraordinary \\"Not Dark Yet.\\" No one who has read Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" knows how to spot a metaphor for dying (Frost actually denied that it was about death, but few have believed him) and it isn't hard here to know what Dylan is writing about. Shortly before the period in which Dylan was writing the songs for this album he suffered an extremely serious illness that landed him in the hospital and could easily have brought about his death. Perhaps the consciousness of how fragile his own life is is reflected in this song. He isn't in despair and he isn't welcoming death. As he sings, \\"I was born here, and I'll die here, against my will.\\" But he is aware that the end is near. It isn't dark yet, but it is getting there.<br /><br />But Dylan has always had individual great songs on even his weak albums. Even largely dreadful gospel album SHOT OF LOVE nonetheless had the serenely beautiful \\"Every Grain of Sand,\\" one of his greatest post-sixties songs, while the slightly better NO MERCY has \\"The Man in the Long Black Coat.\\" Here, however, every cut on the album is a winner, and several of them are standouts. The organ-driven \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" is one of the grittiest songs he has ever done, while \\"Love Sick\\" opens the album and sets the tone of all that follows. One of my favorites is the sadly nostalgic \\"Standing in the Doorway,\\" one of Dylan's finest love songs in a long time. The nostalgia comes not over the sense of love lost, but the memory of love lost. It is addressed to a former lover who left him (standing in the doorway) and while he has gotten over the hurt and may not even feel any bitterness, he is deeply conscious that her loss left his life changed forever. The song contains many lovely lines and Dylan's voice, ravaged by decades of heavy cigarette smoking, rasps out expressively every one. On paper the lines:<br /><br />Last night I danced with a stranger<br />But she just reminded me you were the one<br /><br />but in the context of the song you hear the loss and yearning underneath. The album ends with one of Dylan's great rambling epics, \\"Highlands,\\" the heart of which is an encounter he has with a waitress in Boston. Their dialogue reminds one of how very funny Dylan can be. My favorite part might be the waitress's apparent accusation of sexism after she dislikes the portrait she has badgered him into drawing:<br /><br />\\"That don't look a thing like me!\\"<br /><br />I said, \\"Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does\\"<br />She says, \\"You must be jokin.'\\" I say, \\"I wish I was!\\"<br />Then she says, \\"You don't read women authors, do you?\\"<br />Least that's what I think I hear her say,<br />\\"Well\\", I say, \\"how would you know and what would it matter anyway?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well\\", she says, \\"You just don't seem like you do!\\"<br />I said, \\"You're way wrong.\\"<br />She says, \\"Which ones have you read then?\\" I say, \\"I read Erica Jong!\\"<br /><br />Dylan had never really left the public consciousness before the release of this album, but it certainly reestablished him as the dominant artist of his age. It pretty much swept the various awards the year it came out and the great news is that it truly deserved them. Will Dylan come out with another album this good (some think that 2001's LOVE AND THEFT was on that level, but I think it is a notch or two below)? I don't know. He clearly at this point is intent on getting his house in order, writing his ambitious multi-volume autobiography (the first volume was excellent) and cooperating in the superb Martin Scorcese documentary NO DIRECTION HOME. He clearly isn't turning albums out at the pace he once did, instead taking time to craft a group of well written songs. But few performers from the sixties are even turning out original material these days, instead relying on their already well-established catalog of hits (there are exceptions, like Richard Thompson, the Glimmer Twins, Neil Young, and recently Neil Diamond). But I suspect that Dylan has too much pride to not try to turn out at least one more masterpiece. I believe he wants to go out proving once again what he truly is: the dominant creative artist of the rock and roll generation.pretty much swept the various awards the year it came out and the great news is that it truly deserved them.

He clearly isn't turning albums out at the pace he once did, instead taking time to craft a group of well written songs. But few performers from the sixties are even turning out original material these days, instead relying on their already well-established catalog of hits (there are exceptions, like Richard Thompson, the Glimmer Twins, Neil Young, and recently Neil Diamond). But I suspect that Dylan has too much pride to not try to turn out at least one more masterpiece. I believe he wants to go out proving once again what he truly is: the dominant creative artist of the rock and roll generation.

B0000844I8|3.0|STARGATE SG-1 and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER have one major thing in common:  both are highly successful television series based on far less successful television series.  STARGATE the movie had a fine initial premise for a Sci-Fi film, but it is a premise that actually lends itself more towards a television series.  The central idea is that a series of Stargates established by ancient aliens with a parasitic involvement with the human race, which they have enslaved and use as hosts, points more towards a serial narrative than a stand-alone narrative.  The very existence of a variety of Stargates establishes this.  This is one of those instances where a film has been reborn as a vastly more successful television series.<br /><br />Considered entirely on its own, however, this is not a terribly successful film.  It suffers from multiple problems, though it also has a few successes.  In the plus column goes the overall concept, the excellent performance by James Spader as Daniel Jackson, many of the sets and much of the art design, and the wonderful score.  The negatives are, unfortunately, more numerous.  I like Kurt Russell and have always regretted that he has not been in more major productions, but his incredibly wooden performance here creates a major energy drag on the film.  I understand that he is playing burnt out case, but I don't think the attempt was very successful.  He was a leaden in this one as he was in SOLDIER, where he played a futuristic soldier that had had all his emotions programmed out.  Another serious casting problem was the use of Jaye Davidson in the role of Ra.  Davidson was amazingly effective in THE CRYING GAME as a transsexual, but he simply does not have the screen presence to be an effective film villain.  He is also an extremely tiny person (around 5'3) and his lack of stature necessitated his not being filmed very often in the same frame as the other actors.  He simply did not manage to come across as a sufficiently menacing presence.<br /><br />By far the biggest problem with the film is the narrative.  The film works fine at first in laying out the existence of the Stargate and in showing Daniel Jackson at work in figuring out how it works, but once that is done the plot becomes fairly trite, as if they had come up with a premise but didn't really care what story they hung upon it.  As a result the second half of the film simply isn't very interesting.  To make matters worse, the final hour is poorly paced and directed.  In other words, the second half of the film told an uninteresting story badly.<br /><br />Still, if one plans on watching the television series--and if one enjoys Sci-Fi I strongly encourage it--then seeing this movie is recommended.  It helps to know where the series came from.  It also explains the relationship between Daniel Jackson and Sha're as well as O'Neill and Jackson to Skaara.  But even on its own, while not a good film, it is not an out and out bad one.nce.   <br /> <br />By far the biggest problem with the film is the narrative.

0385493622|5.0|I glanced through the pages, noted the absence of equations and proofs, and deemed Fermat's Enigma as just one more fluffy book on a widely publicized technical topic. I was absolutely wrong. Fermat's Enigma is a superb introduction to the \\"epic quest to solve the world's greatest mathematical problem\\".  <br /> <br />Fermat's Enigma is not a mathematics book, but a book about mathematics. Andrew Wiles' proof, more than 100-pages in length, is quite formidable, and not readily mastered by mathematicians. Nonetheless, Singh does a credible job of explaining the nature of the theorem, the obstacles encountered over the past 350 years, and the breakthroughs that made the proof possible. Not only will it appeal to general readers, but I suspect that undergraduate math majors would find it advisable to read Fermat's Enigma before tackling more advanced works. <br /> <br />This short book begins well and improves with each subsequent chapter. It offers drama, the fascinating story of the brilliant, confident, obsessive, and secretive Andrew Wiles. It is history, the story of a monumental struggle by great mathematicians during the past three centuries to prove an apparently straight-forward conjecture. And it is mathematics.  <br />  <br />Singh begins with more familiar topics like the Pythagorean theorem, the infinity of primes, and complex numbers. His clear, lucid explanations soon target elliptic curves (equations), L-series, modular forms, M series, and the critically important Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. He superbly explains two important kinds of mathematical proofs: proof by contradiction and proof by induction. He even explains Galois group theory, differential geometry, and the Kolyvagin- Flach method of solving elliptic equations with such ease that I felt that I was working alongside Andrew Wiles in his Herculean effort. <br /> <br />Singh's narrative account is an emotional roller coaster. I was excited when the young Japanese mathematicians Yutaka Taniyamaand Goro Shimura posed their unexpected conjecture linking elliptic curves with modular forms. I applauded Gerhard Frey's remarkable insight: proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would ensure that Fermat's last theorem was true. I cheered when Barry Mazur over a cup of cappuccino suggested to Ken Ribet that the way forward would be to add some gamma-zero of (M) structure. (It mattered not that I didn't understand why or how.) <br /> <br />On the downside I shared Andrew Wiles' anxiety as he continued his desperate efforts to overcome a fatal flaw uncovered by journal reviewers. The pressure on him to publish his proof, even though not finished, was unbearable. He (we) needed more time. I shared his despondency as time was running out and failure seemed likely. The suspense, even though I knew the outcome, was intense. I was more relieved than happy when Wiles suddenly saw his way clear. I was too tired to cheer. <br /> <br />Fermat's Enigma is an exceptional book.
B000001FKY|5.0|This band developed into a great band in the 1980s.  I think Hysteria was their peak performance.  It marked the beginning of Def Leppard's amazing soft songs, but still kept the amazing hard sound too.  An absolutly great cd.  I like every song without a doubt.  I cant listen to one song without listening to the rest!
0385510454|1.0|I would have to go with the people who gave this 1 star or even negative stars!! <br />I picked this book in an airport store, to read during my long flight from New York to San Francisco and expected it to be another Grisham classic but this one definitely doesnt live up to the hype. Its not like Time to Kill, The Client, The Firm. Grisham is not an expert in writing a spy novel. The first half is more like a tourist guide to small towns in Italy..You'll be hungry for traditional italian food in like 100 pages. He takes too long to build up and the climax is awful. nothing ever happens. <br />IF you want to read a fast-paced thriller, go pick a Clancy.
B000BYA5G4|2.0|In this movie it is a given that guns are bad, gun dealers are worse, and war is the baddest thing imaginable. Hitler,Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao and every other dictator would agree - all of them prevent or prevented citizens from owning weapons.  If you think they want this for the safety of humanity, there may be a spot saved for you in a \\"Peoples reeducation farm\\" somewhere. Nobody gets to be free or stays free long if they are not willing to fight, and the fighting is much more painful if you do not have weapons.  This country was not given to us as a birthday present by the British.  Without guns the struggle would have been even more painful.  Up guns and gunrunners.  Screw Hollywood.
0316921173|3.0|This is probably a good book, but it's just too damn long to merit the month of time it would take to plow through it. There are so MANY other good books out there to read that I gave up. Granted, there were some flashes of wit in the first 25 pages, but they were buried in gibberish. Sorry. I quit and returned it to the library.
B000B8I8X2|1.0|Despite a lot of the bad press Roadrunner has come into lately, for being a part of such artistically redundant movements as nu-metal (Slipknot et al) and the current bastardised version of metalcore (Trivium, Killswitch Engage at al), it's prolific past should never be ignored. It's back catalogue boasts bands as diverse and interesting as Front Line Assembly, Mercyful Fate, Type O Negative,  Sepultura, Nailbomb etc., has recently signed metal giants Opeth and was a key label during the 90's death metal boom. So, as we near the label's 25th anniversary, some form of celebration seems to be in order. The idea of collecting all (well, a vast majority) of Roadrunner artists, past and present, in one vast collaboration seems like a good idea on paper... Although grizzled death metal enthusiasts may be turned off by Matt Heavy and chums, they can find solace in members of Deicide, Sepultura and Suffocation's respective contributions, while younger music fans will enjoy the Joey Jordison etc. connections and potentially learn a lot more about the Roadrunner label. Basically, \\"something for everyone\\"! <br />In practice, however, this is a completely different story. With 4 \\"team captains\\" (nice marketing there, Roadrunner) handling songwriting responsibilities, you'd think this would give the album a nice flow, and make sure the record had a clear sense of sructure, but each songwriter appears to have opted for a set of embarrassing cliches in every instance. Thus, the album has a disctinctly \\"yeah, that'll do\\" feel to it, which seems to be selling the Roadrunner label a little short. <br />This is a formula evident on practically every song - take each vocalist's \\"public image\\", shall we say, and build a generic song around it, using an all-star cast to play the instruments. For example, Opeth are known for their expansive, 'clean' proggy interludes - so we'll have Micheal Akerfeldt providing the token ballad. King Diamond is famed for his wild guitar histrionics - so let's get an absurd, cringe-worthy lead and get him to warble over the top of it... It means we end up with a sanitized charicature of each musician. Check out the pseudo-Type O guitar slide on Pete Steele's track and you'll see what I mean... <br />Maybe, in some perverse way, this is intentional, as listening to an artist you're a fan of on here will make you want to go and listen to one of their classic albums instead (thus reminding you of how many good records Roadrunner have released), but to be honest, if this album is viewed as a \\"celebration\\" of Roadrunner's illustrious pressence on the metal map, it's a disgrace. <br />I really hope this isn't a sign that this label is on it's way out, as Roadrunner has signed some awesome bands (and is continuing to sign them, despite their insistance on flooding us with boring Ferret bands and garbage like Trivium). Their current output undeniably contains several strong releases (the new Opeth is jaw-dropping, the new Soulfly finally sees Max stepping out of Sepultura's shadow and successfully combining the tribal elements with the exhilerating thrash that made Chaos AD such a phenomenal record), but pails in comparison to, say, the current Relapse roster. It'll be interesting to see where they go from here, and I for one hope they can sort it out.  <br />Don't write off this label based on this embarrassing, over-hyped turkey of a CD.
B000002JSV|5.0|I don't care what the reviewers say, this is AC/DC at their peak. <br />All of the previous reviewers say that the last two songs on the album, \\"Up To My Neck In You,\\" and \\"Kicked In The Teeth,\\" are filler, and I am going to have to disagree. Those songs are dripping with classic Bon Scott attitude, just like most of the previous album, Let There Be Rock. They are the heaviest songs on the album, and I think it closes the album with a bang! This whole record is awesome. It's got better production than all of their previous work, but it's still very raw and sounds like classic AC/DC. The next album, Highway To Hell, was just as amazing, but at times it sounds slightly overproduced. This is when AC/DC were themselves, catering to nobody but themselves, going in the studio and knocking out an album in less than 2 weeks. A kickass, stripped-down rock and roll band, without tons of chorusing and backing vocals. It sounds like a band playing these songs, whereas on Highway you can tell they spent tons of time multitracking and overthinking things, catering to a radio audience (don't get me wrong, that's one of my favorite records too, but I prefer Powerage). Still a great result, but I think Powerage dwarves that album, and you can tell that they didn't overthink it. This is such an underrated album that most people do not know exists for some cruel reason. Down Payment Blues, What's Next To The Moon, Gimme A Bullet, Sin City, Up To My Neck In You, well, hell, EVERY song is amazing. There's not a filler track to be found. BUY THIS and you won't regret it. Buy two copies and give one to a friend.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies you'll never forget, yet you'll want to watch it again. Maybe not immediately after you just watched it. The subject matter is hard to swallow as it is depressing, but just so beautifully and brilliantly portrayed. The characters are all doomed and there is nothing you can do but sit back and watch them spiral out of control. Requiem, in addition to an incredible cast, features outstanding cinematography reminiscent of Drugstore Cowboy (and if you look at my review for Drugstore Cowboy, I think I mentioned something along those lines) but I'm happy to see that kind of inspiration shine through so successfully in another film. To me, one of the most touching scenes in this movie is when Harry's mother gets taken to the hospital for her diet/speed pill addiction and her friends from the apartments come to visit her. When they show the friends outside on the bench, crying and hugging, every single time I see it, I cry. Everyone in this movie does such an amazing job at making this seem very, very real and anything but a dream. Don't miss this movie! If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.
B000669GAI|4.0|I know I'm gonna get some not-helpful votes for this (Wah!  He didn't cream his pants over this band!  He sucks!) but I have to be honest with you: I never really saw the appeal in this band.  Now don't get me wrong.  They're a thousand times more talented than most of the mainstream bands out there but I have never really liked them.  I actually tried hard to get into them too but to no avail. <br /> <br />Why don't I like them?  Well, I'm just not impressed by them.  I don't think their guitars are really anything to brag about, even the solos (by the way, in the beginning notes of the solo in \\"Alive\\" is an exact copy of the ones from \\"Five To One\\" by The Doors), the bass is just kinda there, the drums are a bit on the boring side (I want faster fills, d**nit!), I've never been a fan of the vocals and the lyrics, well, they're actually pretty decent.  In fact, that's the best part of the band, the lyrics.  I gotta give them that. <br /> <br />But why the 4 stars then instead of 3 or 2?  Because unlike many bands nowadays, these guys actually put some effort into their work and they sound good live.  I also know they don't have to dance around on-stage like a bunch of drunken idiots ([cough] Sum 41).  Their longevity also speaks well of them.  But also they stand out from the crowd and have some creativity to them.  Some of their songs really aren't that bad but usually I end up changing the station or turning on the CD player (with Children of Bodom!). <br /> <br />Anyway, if you're a Pearl Jam fan but not a hardcore one you'll obviously like this album.  I can't go into the track selection as I really don't know this band as well as a fan would but it seems pretty good for the work they've put out.  The bottom line is I'm just not a fan of these guys but I do respect them because they do have talent even though I will probably never see why people like them so much.  But like I said, if you're a mild fan of this band that likes mostly what they hear on the radio,then please DON'T purchase the latest crappy album from s**tty bands like Disturbed or Korn and use your money wisely on this one. <br /> <br />If you're going to click \\"no\\" on \\"Was this helpful to you?\\" I don't give a s**t, but remember, at least I put down what was on my mind and was honest.
B00005JOHI|5.0|Being a Jane Austen fan, and especially a pride and prejudice fan, I was not expecting this movie to be better than the one starring Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle (which I own and love). In seeing it, I was supremely suprised how much this movie affected me. Me and my friend could not stop talking about the movie for the rest of the day, and I have been thinking of seeing it again in theaters since then. I loved Matthew MacFayden's Darcy, in particular. If it is possible, he made the character more like Darcy than anyone else has. The movie stuck close in dialogue and moved swiftly along, to get to the juicy parts that we all love (the first dance, fighting with Mr. Darcy, etc). My two favorite scenes, which are probably everyone else's are the fight between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie after she has refused him, and they freeze THISCLOSE to eachother, and you understand the passion that they are fighting against; and the scene in the meadow, while they are in their pajamas. I don't care, I am a romantic and this movie is awesome, aswesome awesome!!!! If I could give it more stars, I would...
1401307450|5.0|Anyone coming for an autobiography of the Red Hot Chili Peppers might be a little disappointed in this book.  Kiedis focuses more on his personal journey through life, and especially on his formative adolescent years.  The Chili Peppers are a part of his life, to be sure, but this story is truly Anthony's personal struggles to be a sober, straight-living man.<br /><br />Anthony spends a significant amount of the book on his teenaged years.  He was essentially his father's roommate (not his son, not his \\"charge) in Los Angeles from the age of 12.  He experienced more drugs and debauchery before the age of 18 than most people could live through in their entire life.  In describing his experiences, however, Kiedis used an inviting tone; he never bragged about his exploits or tried to paint himself in an excessively rosy light.  He simply invited the reader along to explore his personal experiences and emotions.<br /><br />Scar Tissue is truly a book about drug addiction, about the lifelong slippery slope of trying to obtain (and maintain) sobriety.  It is amazing that Kiedis can keep his dozens of periods of abuse and relapse straight in his mind, much less transform them into a compelling narrative journey for the reader.  Life on drugs was in no way glamorous--Kiedis spent many years at rock bottom, barely surviving, and scrounging for his existence.  He also fooled many people about his drug use, and managed to escape any arrest or scrutiny for possession.  Reading about how Kiedis has to consider and seize his sobriety each and every day (he's been clean since 24 December 2000) will surely inspire anyone who is struggling with their own personal demons.<br /><br />It's amazing that the Chili Peppers have been as successful as they are, considering their poor record management in the early days, the excessive personnel changes, and the rampant drug abuse.  I'd love to read a tell-all from Flea next!
B0000AUHPB|1.0|In the late 60's, this movie might have been reviewed as a \\"whimsical farce\\" or some other such nonsense. I saw it last night. It was a waste of time. Michael Caine is supported by a large group of poorly trained actors in a movie that looks like some kid directed it while his dad was out to lunch. The almost nonexistent score consists of a few random notes and a very boring refrain near the end of the movie. I have great respect for Caine as an actor and I've enjoyed his work in many films since, but this must have been one he had to do to pay the rent. <br />This is certainly one time where the remake is much better than the original.
0613338111|5.0|Not a fan of historical fiction, I was a bit skeptical about a novel set in 1600's Holland.  How would I relate to the characters?  And isn't the plot line a little unbelievable--a simple peasant maid becomes a painter's muse?  Upon picking up this novel, I was instantly hooked on the life of Griet, a young girl forced to leave home to work as a maid to support her family and disabled father.  Griet is a loveable narrator, and, as a modern gal, I was amazed at the strict social order and structure of her world, and how deeply she had to keep her emotions and actions in check when she was employed by an upper-class family.  Any change in the dynamic of her relationship with the painter Vermeer (her employer) was subtle and well under wraps.<br /><br />In this deceptively short novel, an amazing relationship blossoms between Vermeer and his maid, who gets promoted to be his assistant (much to the anger of the rest of the family).  Again, all the blossoming is suble, barely detectible, and nothing vulgar occurs, yet the entire scene would be absolutely scandalous to the outside world in thr 1600's.  Chevalier convincingly portrays the elevation of Griet's status in her employer's painting career.<br /><br />Chevalier tells a fictional tale behind a real painting.  In fact, Girl With a Pearl Earring is unique amoung Vermeer's catalogue because it is the only one in which the subject looks out at the viewer.  If you buy this book, be sure you get a copy with a reproduction of the painting on the cover.  Throughout my reading, I kept flipping back to the cover to absorb the painting.  The story behind the artwork is absolutely mesmerizing.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Director:  Darren Aronofsky <br />Cast:  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Janet Sarno. <br />Running Time:  102 minutes <br />Rated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence. <br /> <br />\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it is family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favorite red dress, which she wore to her sun's graduation, on television; however, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs. <br /> <br />The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at; Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'; all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.  Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast that some viewers may find it hard to keep up, and it will literally take your breath away when the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that audiences haven't felt much since \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"American History X\\".  As the title indicates, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness; however, it does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety. It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies.
B000002GB9|5.0|I did not own a single Styx album until recently - which is odd because the group was highly popular during the late 1970s/early 1980s when I was a teen (all 80s teens liked Styx right?).  My suspicion is that it may have had something to do with the fact that I was a Yes and Pink Floyd freak at the time and was unyieldingly provincial in my listening habits, although it may have been a subconscious observance of what I refer to as the \\"Styx stigma\\".  For whatever reason, I am sorry I waited this long because The Grand Illusion (1977) rocks like nobody's business and Styx is a darn good band.<br /><br />As a huge fan of progressive rock (I am still a raving Yes-head), the whole package appeals to me on many levels: soaring three and four part vocal harmonies by excellent high tenors; super Hammond organ work; blazing Rick Wakeman-esque Moog (synth) solos; great synthesizer tones; dynamic acoustic/hard rock contrasts; agile ensemble work (all of the musicians are very good); and to top it all off, wonderful harmonic and melodic development.  Mix in the heavily distorted guitar of Led Zeppelin along with the thunderous and tight rhythm section of Deep Purple and the blueprint for The Grand Illusion is pretty much drawn out.  Although superficially similar, this album is light-years ahead of previous works such as Equinox (1975) and Crystal Ball (1976).  In spite of the fact that those albums are very good (and recommended) they do not exhibit the compositional sophistication of The Grand Illusion.<br /><br />This is wonderful and crisply produced progressive hard rock and certainly provides me with a great deal of enjoyment - after all isn't that what rock is all about?  All in all, this is an engaging and superb album, a heck of a lot of fun to listen to, and is highly recommended along with Pieces of Eight (1978).  For those new Styx fans (like me) that enjoy this band and want to explore other progressive hard rock bands, the album Point of Know Return (Kansas, 1977) might also prove enjoyable.prove enjoyable.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Director:  Steven Spielberg <br />Cast:  Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Carl Gottlieb, Jeffrey Kramer, Susan Backlinie. <br />Running Time:  124 minutes <br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language. <br /> <br />\\"Jaws\\" is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another \\"Jaws\\", simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.  Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, \\"Jaws\\" centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in the most underrated performance of his career); a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins (Susan Backlinie) are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack (Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.  Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, inthe role that propelled him to stardom), an ichthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble. <br /> <br />Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis, where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds, is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.  <br /> <br />'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance ofstory and character.  That said the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.  The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark; by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.  \\"Jaws\\" succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe forthe malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Yes, to be sure, there are plenty of sonic references to all of her previous albums, I think I can pick out slices from all of them actually, but that still does not undermine the fact that this is one beautiful album, and, by itself, is a vocal masterpiece.  The first song is in my opinion, one of Enya's finest.  For true fans of Enya, this is a must have.  For those who complain about the similarity between all of her albums, if you don't like the similarities stylistically, why do you keep buying her albums?  All of her albums are very similar to an uncritical ear, so why pick on this one, which also has some of the best lyrics of any album to date.  Also, the Loxian language is incredible.  Enya would even make Dr. Suess angelic in Loxian.
1573223026|4.0|A touching yet humorous look at the faces behind suicide.  I was worried that this book would be too depressing but I was pleasantly surprised to find it more upbeat.  I liked the different characters from all walks of life and that they were able to overcome their differences to help each other out.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I remember growing up with these guys. I was so happy when I found out they were being released on DVD. I have all the series out so far (as of 1-17-06) and can't wait for the next one! I hope they put out all five years. I agree with some of the reviews I have read. It is neat to see the old stuff, dial phones and such. The car never gets old. I almost bid on one that was from the new movie, but it wouldn't have been the same. I had a Torino for a while, but it was a different year and it was brown. I never get tired of watching this series. If you don't own them yet.....what are you waiting for??!!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This CD has the classic strokes sound, but is also very melodic.  i love the song on the other side.  Great sound!  \\"It's like a seedless watermelon.  I like it.\\"  As quoted by Julian.
B00009N83U|3.0|All great film makers have their bad moments, and this film is Clint Eastwood's bad moment. The film could have been funny and it is just entertaining. The film could have been deep and thoroughly thought and it ends like a corny story for grown-up flunkies at the back of the classroom. Why did he miss all the potential of his situation ? Because he wanted to demonstrate something : extreme right racist ideas are bad and lead to crime, and nothing but crime, and crime leads to wasting one's life, and only wasting it. It is too obvious the film advocates staying right in the middle of the bull's eye of the squarest society one can imagine. Square and nothing but square. I must admit I prefer circles, stars of all types and golden rectangles, but squares are too simple for my complex mind. If you want to enjoy yourself somewhat without using your head too much, do watch this film and you will be able to noisily crunch many cookies without losing too much of the « lyrics ».<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I feel like I'm in the second grade again!  At best, this is my most favorite Madonna album ever.  At worst, \\"I love New York\\" is a little cheesy, but still a great track.  I really like the way the songs just 'melt' into one another, and this makes for a great work-out!
B00097DX3U|3.0|I REALLY wanted to love this CD, but I didn't even like it for the first five listens. Now I LOVE it! There IS an awful lot to like about this CD. There is SERIOUS depth to it, but it's a challenging listen. I'm not sure if everyone is up to the challenge. I'm changing my rating from 3 to 5 stars because I'm finally starting to \\"hear\\" this CD. Many other reviewers say the same thing, so it's not just me. If you take the time to \\"get in tune\\" with this CD, you will find it ABSOLUTELY worth the effort. Trust me on this.... You won't be sorry!!
B00001OH80|2.0|There's almost no such thing as a bad Bowie album, but \\"Tonight\\" comes close.  Recorded very hastily (reportedly the sessions concluded in less than a week), Bowie was clearly not that interested in the record, tossing it off as a quickie follow-up to \\"Let's Dance.\\"  Unlike the hit album, however, the production here sounds limp and lifeless, and the overall tone of the album is flat and dull.<br /><br />The title track has a provocative concept, one that you don't notice unless you listen closely to the lyrics.  However, it fails due to understated delivery.  \\"Loving the Alien\\" is the one strong tune, while \\"Blue Jean\\" is worth including on the various greatest hits package, but which sounds more like a \\"Let's Dance\\" outtake than a full-fledged effort.  The most interesting aspect of the song --- the 20 minute video --- has never been made available and is not included on the two-disc DVD which collects almost all of Bowie's videos.<br /><br />Fortunately, Bowie never got worse than this.  His next album was not a stellar effort but it was less formulaic, and by the end of the 1980s Bowie had gone back to basics with the formidable Tin Machine lineup.  He hasn't made a bad record since.<br /><br />I can forgive him this one.  In fact, since \\"Loving the Alien\\" and \\"Blue Jean\\" are on the greatest hits packages, I don't own a copy.
B00005JOIF|5.0|MOVIE: Steven Spielberg's gritty and emotional drama is in my opinion the best film of 2005. I don't remember the last time a film grabbed me and wouldn't let go like Munich did. Eric Bana plays Avner, who is hand picked by the Israeli government to track down and kill the Palestinian leaders of the terrorist group who organized the 1972 Munich hostage killings of eleven Israeli olympic athletes. Avner is a family man, he loves his wife and cannot wait for her to give birth to their baby daughter. He is then taken away from his family to fulfill this mission. He is the head of a group of five men, all with different specialties, and they must one by one track down and kill the Palestinian terrorist leaders. The film is a deep dark look into the nature of man, and you will be deeply moved by the actions taken and the journey that Avner completes. Spielberg gives the audience a lot to chew on, there are many different viewpoints expressed, but it's not solely a political film. Avner is a real character that people can identify with. His moral descisions and actions all paint his character for the audience to connect with. Geoffrey Rush turns in another brilliant performance as the man who secretly employs these men, and he represents the government's viewpoint in the film. All he wants is for revenge to be had. Avner enters this game with a similar viewpoint, he wants justice to be had for these brutal executions, but his character grows throughout the film and he comes to realize that violence as a tool is futile in the war to stop violence. We see two opposites in character with Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush, two people who will never see anything in the same light, and this gives way for the brilliant ending to the film. The film itself is made as if Spielberg spent months and months planning it, however they started filming in July of 2005 and had a December 23rd release date. That is simply amazing that a team of filmmakers were able to make a film this good in that amount of time. The scene structure is absolutely amazing. Spielberg will build tension within the scene by using a continuing shot and will not cut away. The camera tracking is unbelievable. Instead of having three or four cameras for one scene, he will use one. The camera will dolly, zoom, pan, and tilt to show the scene, but never cut away. The camera style is almost Hitchcockian, and it works to perfection. Every assassination that is carried out is intensly thrilling, and you will be coiled up in your seat for the entire film. It is gripping, emotional, intelligent, and raises enough questions for the audience to ponder. This is a master filmmaker at his best, the film is visually breathtaking and emotionally stunning.<br /><br />ACTING: Who knew Eric Bana would hold a leading role in a film like this, and pull it off with perfection? I don't see how he cannot get a nomination for this role, he was simply captivating. He handled this huge role and made it seem real, you feel every emotion that Avner is going through and that really helps the film's overall impact on the audience. The rest of the cast turn in great ensamble performances, and Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as always. The cast is perfect, no possible way it could have been better.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg knows exactly what's needed to create the perfect tone, and he can switch from heartwarming to disturbing in a blink of an eye and make it seamless. This film is gritty, violent, emotional, and will make you ask serious questions about the state of global conflict and the nature of man. This 2 hour 45 minute film will seem like an hour because there is not one dry spot in the entire movie, the audience is involved from the very opening to the closing credits. The film doesn't feel like a history lesson, it is an intense thriller made masterfully by Spielberg. It will stay in your mind long after you see it.t amount of time.

0385720920|3.0|This was my third Chuck book and I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Or a lot. I was never completely engaged in the story - I couldn't get hooked. Therefore it took me a lot longer than usual to finish the book. I'm a fan of addictions but the whole sexaholics thing never really worked for me. And getting anal beads stuck up your ass, well, I just saw that as kind of gross and unappealing. It could have been funny but it really wasn't. I enjoyed the very end of the book and the message that came across - but that was about the last three pages. It just wasn't up to par with his other works.<br /><br />I've read both \\"Diary\\" and \\"Survivor\\" and loved them, so I wouldn't start your Palahniuk reading with \\"Choke\\".
0792163710|5.0|This isn't my experience of life, but it's what I like to see. Things work out the way they ought to, not the way they do in fact. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how Alan Ladd succeeds in overcoming his indifferent physique, his knock knees, his double chin and his frilly shirt. I've watched this melodrama many times, and those things always irritate me, yet I have to hand it to him in the end. It must be his voice and his timing, and his pleasant expression. The homesteading family of van Heflin, Arthur and de Wilde, is just great. Walter Jack Palance is just great. The villains are just great, and so is the storekeeper. The rest of the homesteaders are so-so; and I could never quite place Elisha Cook in any of the many roles he played. The scenery is a star in its own right.  As for the story: well, trust an American to reach for your gut, wrench it out and hit it with a sledge-hammer. There is depth to the story, but I wouldn't call it overly subtle. Too bad. It still remains one of the most touching, memorable and satisfying films you could ever expect to see. You can recognize this in the reactions of the hard men who give it one star: they are simply in severe denial. Incidentally, why do so many reviewers think that a summary of the plot is a review? Surely one outline is enough?
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I'm a little tired of hearing 'this is just the same as -blah blah- song/album and it's horrible/boring'.  I love Ebadue and Africa i and ii, so I'm elated that 'the River Sings' has a similar feel.  I think it's an amazing song and my favorite on the album.  'Amarantine' and 'Somebody Said Good-bye' remind me of the vocal songs from 'A Day Without Rain'.  I never much cared for the songs with words before Wild Child, Lazy Days, etc, which are among my favorites from all of her works.  'Less than a Pearl' is hauntingly beautiful, and 'Semiregusa' is also very pretty.      I've always enjoyed listening to any of Enya's albums to relax from a long day at work, for yoga and meditation; this album will definitely go into that mix.  The above-mentioned songs will also go on my own 'Best of..' CD.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is what it's all about! This ROCKS! It has the spark, energy, excitement, power, fire, and most of all.... it's FRESH! Nothing quite like anything I've ever heard. These guys have so much potential. The best of RATM with one of hard rock's best singers. I loved this CD from the first listen, and even more each time I hear it. \\"OUT of Exile\\" is also an excellent CD but I had to FORCE myself to listen to it quite a few times before I really \\"got it\\". It's a deep, and challanging listen (like Cornell's solo CD) while this one is way more brutal, aggressive, and RATMish. Both are excellent CD's. Way to go AUDIOSLAVE!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|System produced a grand sequel for Mezmerize.  Four of the 12 songs have great rythm, harmonic structure, and lyrics for the genre: Soldiers Side, Lonely Day, Hypnotize and Holy Mountains.  The other 8 songs are a bonus.

B00005JOII|5.0|MOVIE: Do you ever sit and watch a movie and try and guess the ending? Do you ever try and guess what direction a film is going? Well, I dare you to try and guess this film's outcome, go ahead, I dare you. Match Point is Woody Allen's character study as to how luck plays a role in our lives. Match Point opens appropriately enough with a sideline view of a tennis ball going back and forth across the net in slow motion. The narrator is the voice of the main character, Chris, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He describes the game of tennis as luck, that once in a while the ball will hit the net. The frame then freezes as the ball hits the net, and he describes that luck determines which side of the net the ball will fall. Chris, who is an all-pro tennis player, decides to step down from playing and takes up teaching for awhile while he decides what he wants to do with his life. His latest student, Tom, shares a passion of opera with him and invites him to his family's balcony seats. There he meets Tom's sister, and he falls in love with her. However, he soon meets Nola, a beautiful woman who lures him in with her eyes. He soon finds out that Nola is Tom's soon to be wife. This is the film as it seems. Chris begins to have an affair with Nola, and after she breaks up with Tom they continue to romance without the knowledge of Tom's family. He gets married to Tom's sister and they are now expecting a child, his father in-law lands him a dream job at one of his corporations. Yet, it is still the lure of the temptress that calls to him. Woddy Allen sets up a dilemma for our main character that raises the question between love and lust, and luck and fate. While you may expect this film to be lustful drama, you have no idea where Allen takes you next. The brilliant aspect of the film, is that there is no score. I hate films without a score, I think music is 50% of a film's emotional effect on the audience, but where there is no original score there is opera. Allen uses opera to structure the scenes, since it is the one thing that ties Chris to the family. The opera changes in tone and emotion as the scene does, so it works to perfection. The film is interesting, you may find yourself debating about what happens in the end, but you realize it all ties in with what this movie is about. The film plot is something that you'd expect from Hitchcock, and it is a savory one at that. The movie is entertaining and thought provoking even if it doesn't seem plausible at times.<br /><br />ACTING: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does a superb job even though I think some of his dialogue seems stilted, but he's not to blame for that. He does a fantatsic job with what Woody Allen gives him. Scarlett Johansson is perfectly cast as the temptress, and she even gives her somewhat commercial character a human side as well. Great acting, even though the dialogue is stilted at times.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film will lead you one way only to make a sharp left and take you where you wouldn't expect. You have no idea what's coming, and I dare you to guess the ending before it starts to unfold. The film is intelligent and an interesting watch, but it really doesn't boast any technical highlights.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|There are three things wrong with this movie: <br />1. It was made for the fans of the Firefly show which means the rest of us are very confused <br />2. It felt as if I was watching a very long television episode <br />3. The ending <br /> The rest was unbelievable.  As in good, very good.  In my entire life there has only been two movies that I really like despite not knowing why.  This is one of them.  I am not a \\"Browncoat\\" nor a big sci-fi fan.  However I do enjoy the genre, despite being very cliche.  Serenity manages to avoid this by eliminating a fair number of them, and attempting to use science (still riddled with techno mumbo jumbo unfortunately) to explain the rest.  The only problems left is how the ship flies (it should blow up), something no series that I've seen has managed to explain, and having it be only 500 years in the future.  I do believe the technology could exist, but a multi-generational ship whould take time, plus the terra-forming decades, plus time for settlements, plus waiting until the US and China get along, plus figuring a way to make people psycic, plus the elevation of a prostitute like class, plus a population high enough to make colonizing another solar system worthwile.  I need about 800-1000 years minimum(of course I have yet to see the series) to fit it all in.   <br /> The movie manage to be realistic enough to make the viewer think it possible, but fictional enough so they realizes it wouldn't.  Also, unlike other sci-fi I've seen there is refreshing simplicity to it.  The crew isn't fighting to save the 'verse.  Rather they merely want to get on with what they do. (that sounds kinda tacky.  It isn't.)  In the three days I had it (rental) I watched the entire thing three times, and every feature including the commentary, the surprisingly entertaining commentary.  I will buy it, making it as the first movie that I buy not as a gift.   <br />And above all This movie does not live up to the hype, but to those with an inklink insci-fi Serenity offers a change from the typical fare.  To those who think sci-fi is a waste, try to borrow it, but don't get your hopes up.  Anime fans please be quiet and whatever you're currently mad about.   <br />*A note to this whose friends recommended Serenity: There is a section where Joss literally tells the fans to recommend it like crazy.  That was the add campaign.  Go figure.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Rarely does a movie come along that has the mass appeal of Mary Poppins.  Even more rare is a movie that can stand the test of time.  Still more rare is a movie that combines the two.  This is just such a movie.  The acting is great, the story is great and the music is great.<br /><br />I can remember watching this once or twice as a child and finding it good.  Now that I have 2 kids of my own I'm constantly on the look out for a movie that the whole family can watch without worrying about things like language, nudity, violence and other things that I don't think are appropriate for my 3 year old.  Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie to put in on movie night as not only is it entertaining for the kids but it's also very entertaining for the parents which I have to admit is a rarity these days as you can only watch the same movie so many times before getting tired of it.<br /><br />Great acting, great story, great imagination, great music, great movie, great buy.

B000002UB3|5.0|Of all the albums the Beatles recorded, Abbey Road is probably my favourite (especially side 2 which is absolutely perfect).

Brilliant.
B00005JOFO|4.0|MOVIE: When a movie has generated as much public interest as this one has, it's hard to go into the film with an open mind. Homosexuality has never been explored in a film in a dramatic way, it has always been comedic. While the love in this film is between two males, it doesn't detract the heterosexual viewer from the film. The story is genuine and it works on every level. Two young men find summer work by herding sheep atop Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. After spending lots of time alone in the wilderness a friendship is born that leads to a passion for one another. The movie's time span is several years, and personally I think the way it was done wasn't the best choice.. Everything happens so fast. One summer they are atop Brokeback Mountain, and then all of a sudden it's half a year later. The audience is closed off to the rest of the characters' lives from point to point. So the story focuses only when they meet back together to head back up and spend time together. For me, that pacing didn't work. It doesn't hurt the film overall, but I think the emotional impact could have been greater if we focused on a more detailed look into the characters. What Ang Lee does with this film is bring an immense appreciation for the setting and the surroundings. Cinematography is a sure win come Oscar night for Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee takes the time to stop and look at the beauty of nature and how it envelopes the characters in this paradise from the rest of civilization and the rest of their lives. This forbidden love soon starts to work against them when word gets out. Relationships with their wives are shattered, and society shuns them, which leads to the very emotional ending. It doesn't matter if your gay or not, the film is made in a way that allows it to be accepted by any audience. The film is very well done, but I was not fond of the jumpy storyline where we skip ahead a few months or a year every now and then.<br /><br />ACTING: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give great performances, but I don't think it's going to win them any Oscar gold. Michelle Williams gives an amazing performance as Ledger's outcast wife, who ultimately uncovers his secret life. The acting is top notch, all of them do fine work.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: When I go into a film like this I expect an emotional punch to get the audience really involved, however it may be hard for everyone to find an emotional connection with this movie. I was not as moved as when I saw character driven films like Million Dollar Baby or The Station Agent. The characters are fleshed out and they feel real, and that is what may make this the frontrunner for Oscar's Best Picture.l give great performances, but I don't think it's going to win them any Oscar gold.

B0002PZVH0|5.0|i find that some ambient music is structured to be incapacitating.  in this music, the composer's idea of a good time is making the listener sprawl out on the floor and stare while the music wraps itself like an opium-cloud around their head.  not that there's anything wrong with tripping on music BUT, sometimes it's not what i'm after. <br />other ambient music gets bored and puts in too many things to listen to.  it gets intrusive and ceases to be ambient at all. <br />the wonderful thing about brian eno's music for airports is that it's flexible.  he finds a magic balance between the two forces that plague ambient composers: complexity (the character of the music that is \\"interesting to listen to\\") and simplicity (the character of the music that makes it \\"ambient and unobtrusive\\").  ambient 1 can put me blissfully in dream land but i can also be functional while i'm listening as well.  there is enough complexity to the music that it doesn't just make you bored and sleepy.   however, the complexity of the music is presented in a beautiful, relaxing setting that isn't demanding.  which is what makes it absolutely brilliant ambient music.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Some of my earliest tv memories include the once per year showing of The Sound of Music around Christmas time.  I might have been too young to really get into it but I remember it being so incredibly long and not all that interesting.  Many years later I watched it again and fell in love with this movie.<br /><br />Depending on your point of view Julie Andrews is most popular for The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins.  Both are wonderful movies and seem to get better with age.<br /><br />In The Sound of Music Julie Andrews plays a Nanny sent to watch over a former military man's large household with his many kids.  The house is run the only way the kid's father knows: militarily.  With the power of her smile and singing she wins over not only the kids but their father as well.  This story line has been done and redone since and before but The Sound of Music sticks out as a leader of the pack.<br /><br />There are very few movies I would say to purchase immediately but this is one of them.

B000B0WODA|5.0|There should be a warning label on this album that keeps you from listening to it in the car. When I first bought it, I had no idea what to expect, and found myself dancing while trying not to run into other drivers. This is another instance of hooking you in and not letting go, and though there are a few slower moments, they are wisely few and far between. I also haven't laughed as hard at an album, not in the Weird Al sense, but at how fun the songs are. Yes, some of the lyrics are goofy (You're lucky lucky, You're so lucky!) but the songs themselves, the time and key changes in unusual places are jarring, but somehow flow with the rest of the song. Take Well That Was Easy, which goes from a driving rock tempo to a a more danceable tempo and back again. You're thrown for a second, but can easily adapt. The overall feeling you come away with from So Much Better is the infectious sense of fun, of what a great time it must have been to be in the studio with these guys. The record is full of little surprises that are always a delight, even after you've heard it enough times to anticipate them. <br />
B000BWI9U0|5.0|I've been listening to the strokes, ever since Is This IT?(the strokes first album) came out, which is the most classic album, and Room on Fire, there second album, is probably the most rock n roll album, THEN i heard First Impressions of Earth, and it just blew me away, the hard core solos and Julians (vocals) melodies, drifted me off to another world. When i heard this album, it made me feel different emotions, like i wanted to love someone one moment, and beat the them up the next haha, the strokes are my all time favorite band, I would KILL to meet them, Because of the hard work and effort they put in this album. Nick and Albert, have what it takes to be some of the greatest guitarist ever, because of this album. Some of the songs that feature this quality is \\"Vision of Division\\", \\"Ize of the World\\", and \\"Heart in a Cage.\\" Also lets not forget Nikolai Fraiture (bass)who has a magnificent bass rythm in \\" juicebox \\".....Its sad because The strokes are not getting the recognition they deserve here in the U.S., the country in which im living, I do not know many people who like them Or even know who they are. So this is why im writing this review....PLEASE BUY THIS ALBUM
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My brother in law got this series for me for Christmas and I immediately called him after watching it and thanked him for getting it for me. I did not know anything about firefly before, have not heard of it. F0X really did a bad job at advertising this because I am an avid Star Wars fan and did not even hear about this. I worked at an IT department and a lot of co-workers normally asked for recommendation from me when it comes to DVD's. I have told 10 co-workers about this and the following week 7 of them told me that they have bought and watched it and loved it. We then went on and bought the Serenity DVD and BAM!! I love it and looking for more. This is a highly recommended box set. A must own for every sci fi fans out there.
B00005JM02|5.0|My daughter (now 3) started getting into movies a little over a year ago and took immediately to Finding Nemo.  The film is just outstanding.  Great characters, amazing animation and a good, funny story.  There are many memorable characters in this movie.  It's just a classic from start to finish.  If you have a young child or are looking for a great gift for a young child go no further.  I have NEVER come across ANYONE that didn't absolutely love this movie.
0385512058|3.0|He really has something to say, but he stresses too much on his personal accomplishments.  The book seems to me very egocentric.  He is also very subjective and ambiguous in some of his maxims.  Sometimes I had the feeling that this book is part of his networking tools, using it to promote himself and friends.  But there is good information in this book; you just have to bear with the style to extract it.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I am so glad that I didn't buy the new DVD without reading customer reviews first! I am dismayed that the new release would cut \\"When Love Is Gone.\\" Other reviewers were exactly right when they noted the Muppets' version story turns on this scene because Scrooge (5-star by Michael Caine!!!!!) finally shows some remorse about his life. This scene is CRITICAL to understanding why Scrooge's life ended up so bitter in the first place! And Meredith, the actress, performed it beautifully, as did Caine in the short duet sequence. Those who disliked the song are probably those, like columnist Roger Ebert, who were unmoved by the classic Dickens story because, in essence, they just don't get it - the theme of a repentant heart. <br />This movie is a Christmas Eve tradition for me and my daughter,Rebecca, who also appreciates great filmmaking and classic music scores. \\"We're Marley and Marley\\" and \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" are all-time greats! <br /> <br />Neal J. Roberts
B000058BGZ|5.0|For those who bask in the romantic warmth of Mitsuko Uchida's Schubert, Beethoven and Schumann or marvel at the clarity and finesse of her Mozart, this recording will remind all that the fiendishly difficult Schoenberg Piano Concerto Opus 42 is one work that she owns.  She is able to find the arching lines within the myriad notes and remind us that the genius of the twelve tone music also gave us 'Gurrelieder' and 'Verklarte Nacht'!  Uchida, in perfect synchrony and vision with Pierre Boulez and the Cleveland Orchestra, offers the most brilliant reading of this great concerto on recording!<br /><br />To round out the recital Uchida stays respectfully within the framework of the 'modern' sound by electing to offer two sets of Schoenberg's piano works: Pieces for Piano Opus 11 and Little Pieces for Piano Opus 19. These complex works are lovingly performed with precision and delicacy.  Berg's Piano Sonata Opus 1 and Webern's Variations for Piano Opus 27 complete these echt Viennese school of music in performances that rival the finest.<br />Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06
0156027321|4.0|I had to read this for my book club.  It was a bit slow at first, but I became intrigued and eager to find out how Pi survived with Richard Parker.  Good book!
0553584537|3.0|I have to disagree with most of the reviewers here--this is not Gardner's best work.  I have truly enjoyed all her previous books, but this one was weak, and a little boring in sections. None of the characters is likeable, or even engaging, including the protagonist.<br /><br />The plot begins when the sniper, Officer Dodge, shoots a man during a \\"hostage situation.\\"  Was he justified in shooting the man?  This is really the question that drives the rest of the book.  He wrestles with the question, his therapist wrestles with it, his fellow officers....  You get the idea.  After about halfway through, I found myself asking, \\"who cares?\\"  I sure didn't.  And the ending was predictable.  I'd only recommend this to fans of Gardner's.  Newcomers should check out \\"The Other Daughter, or \\"The Survivor's Club\\" for more tantalizing fare.  I hope her next effort has more effort to it.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First Impressions of Earth (F.I.O.E) is the new highly anticipated follow up album to Room On Fire by The Strokes. The CD calmly kicks in with the beautiful palm muted guitar of Albert Hammond Jr. which is followed by the always semi distortioned Nick Valensi. As Julian Casablancas croons over the steady beat of Fab, Nick, Albert, And Nikolai. Then the heart pounding Spyhunter influenced Juicebox kicked in with Julian pleading, \\"why won't you come over hear. We got a city to loooove.\\" Nikolai's bass beat is just heart pounding while Nick is pounding away at those power chords. The CD than breaks into almost perfect songs such as Heart In A Cage and Vision Of Division in which one of the greatest guitar solo's i've ever heard is delivered. While the CD does slow down in songs like Ask Me Anything and Killing lies, it doesn't look back after those songs. After Fear Of Sleep it blasts into the sort of Bar Drinking worthy 15 minutes which starts out as a simple crooning song but than just explodes into what i can only describe as one of the best rock songs i've ever heard. After the incredible 15 Minutes it turns into Ize Of The World which is such an amazing song. The Strokes Define themselves with this song in every way. They prove that they are not the little punk new yorkers that recorded Is This It but they prove to be incredible Musicians and singers in Ize Of The World. It then finishes with Evening Sun and Red Light which finishes a great album. This is by far the best Strokes CD yet. I would 100% recommend it to all of you to buy it.
B000294SFW|5.0|Motorhead has been around since 75 and everyone forgets them after Ace of Spades. Ace of Spades isnt even there best record and there work in the 90's and beyond is hundred times better then Ace of Spades. Lemmy is sixty friggin years old! He still rocks harder and better then anyone other front man in the history of music. Im so sick of people putting Lemmy as an after thought, he is the real deal. I mean do you see Lemmy doing a reailty show? Did he lose his voice? no and no! Forgert Ozzy, I know they are good friends but Lemmy is far more talented then Ozzy.  This album proves it, and im sure there is much more Motorhead to come. Lemmy doesnt seem to be quiting anytime soon (I hope not)
055357342X|4.0|I have been devouring the books of ASOIAF so far, and this one is by far the best.  Although at this point in the series I'm getting a bit frustrated by Martin's style (frankly he's infuriating me!) the fact that this is the first fantasy series since \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\" that I can't put down has got to count for something...thus the four star rating. <br /> <br />I'm starting to find George RR Martin a *bit* predictable. (By the way, you just *know* that he put that second \\"R\\" in the middle of his name to sound like Tolkien!) <br /> <br />I realize that many people praise this series for breaking out of the typical fantasy \\"good versus evil\\" archetype and for Martin's willingness to kill off beloved characters.  However, by book three most savvy readers are onto this ploy, and frankly we know what to expect.  We realize that none of the characters will ever achieve the goals that they have set out for themselves.  In fact, you can usually tell that a character is about to be killed off right around the time that it seems like they're about to finally achieve their goals or get revenge for an injustice.  In addition, any sympathetic character that isn't central to the plot is sure to die eventually.  For example, although I have absolutely NO inside knowledge that this is true, I'm POSITIVE that Martin will eventually kill off Davos in one of the later books... <br /> <br />In addition, the length of this series is starting to give it a very melodramatic tone, other reviewers have compared it to a \\"soap opera\\", and I think that's a spot on description of what this series is.  We're given drops of information VERY slowly regarding some of the main plot twists, and this keeps you coming back for more, but it's not very filling.  \\"Who tried to kill Bran?\\", \\"Was Rhaegar Targaryen a bad guy?\\" <br />\\"Who poisoned Jon Arryn?\\"...\\"Who shot J.R.?\\"  Thankfully, most of the plot questions from \\"A Game of Thrones\\" are finally tied up in \\"A Storm of Swords\\".  Theproblem is, Martin hasn't really created anything to replace them, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the rest of the series will suffer as a result. <br /> <br />I'm also finding the sadistic treatment of House Stark to be wearing pretty thin at this point. Here's the formula: Lannisters will always win, but their victories will be hollow, and Starks never win period (except once at the Wispering Woods). I threw the book across the room after a certain crimson matrimonial incident...you've got to hand it to Martin though; he knows how to tweak his readers. <br /> <br />Bottom line, I'll read this series through to the end, it's endlessly enjoyable, but those who put it in the same class as Tolkien or Donaldson are a bit off base...those writers knew when to quit.  In many ways A Storm of Swords is the end of the trilogy, and although I haven't started a \\"Feast for Crows\\" yet, I have a suspicion that the whole structure of this series is unraveling quickly.
0805211063|3.0|The translation itself is very fine, and you can read the translator's preface yourself to see what he was aiming for, to recreate the real Kafka and get away from the \\"Dickensian\\" (as he calls it) flavor of the Muir translation.... However, reading this I was horrified to find certain passages had been abandoned that I'm too attached to from the older version to give this new one a fair chance. For instance, when K. arrives in the village and sleeps at the Inn, they call the Castle to verify his appointment as Land-Surveyor. There's a paragraph or two about the strange hum on the phone-line \\"like a thousand voices singing\\", something like that, that always struck me as so jarring and and surreal and perfect in its placement at the beginning of the book catching you right off guard, -- well, I can't leave it alone. Maybe this is the \\"purer\\" version of Kafka to some readers. But going off what another reviewer said here, that Kafka's books grew like a wild plant, sprouts, branches, shoots off in every direction making any conventional finish & completion practically impossible, I feel like, ahem, this has been clipped too much with the editor's shears, ah, if you will. I feel the alternate versions, snippets, unfinished extra chapters, etc. are vital to the work and for that I still prefer the Muir translation, inaccurate as the text itself is. So I would like to see then a new version that includes all the alternate chapters and versions and so on but in this new translation.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|This movie was unexpectedly good--I expected it to be silly fluffy fun but was surprised how much I liked it.  Sky High is the story of Will Stronghold, son of two legendary superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream.  Will can't admit to his parents that he is still waiting to find out what his powers will be--or if he'll have any at all.  But either way he's off to the school for fledgling superheroes and sidekicks, Sky High, to experience what freshman year is like for paranormals.<br /><br />The daily ins and outs of a world where superheroes exist and are taken for granted add a great deal of fun and humor to the movie (I especially loved the traffic update:  \\"Evil struck the morning commute in the form of a giant robot downtown...drivers are advised to take alternate routes...\\"), as are the typical highs and lows of high school.  The incoming freshman are immediately divided into the \\"hero track\\" and the \\"sidekick track\\", with the sidekicks routinely looked down upon.  Will finds himself having to figure out how to tell his dad that he's a sidekick, and then later, when he is reclassified as a hero, trying to maintain his true friendships with the sidekick cabal while finding the hero group overwhelmingly superficial and not so nice.  There's a quasi-suspenseful subplot involving Will having to save his parents and the whole school, but that's not where the heart of this movie is--it's in the life lessons about being proud of who you are and your abilities (even if it's only being able to turn into a guinea pig or a puddle of goo) and that everyone has something to contribute.  Typical kid movie fare but done in a more than usually imaginative and fun way.  There were plenty of laugh out loud funny moments in the storyline, including some fun pokes at the superhero genre (Dave Foley was priceless as the former kid sidekick turned teacher, who yearns to get back in the game.)<br /><br />The kid actors do a decent job in the movie but the real pleasure for this older viewer were the smaller adult roles with some fun familiar faces--Kurt Russell as the proud dad, Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald (\\"Kids in the Hall\\") stealing every scene they are in as teachers at Sky High, Bruce Campbell as the obnoxious gym teacher, and (swoon!) Lynda Carter as the principal.  Man, she needs to be in  more roles, she's still got it!<br /><br />But I digress.  The effects are low budget and fairly cheesy but it's pretty easy to keep your disbelief as suspended as Sky High itself, even without the antigravity machines.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this for kids, say about age 8-9 and up, and it's a family friendly movie that won't have adults clawing their eyes out or crying for insulin afterward.  Good fun!
B000002OCP|5.0|I bought this LP a year or two after it came out, and to my Hendrix/Cream/Page 'energized' ears, Muddy Waters never sounded better!<br /><br />Either you accept the electric guitar - and all the possible sounds which it can provide - as a valid blues instrument... or you don't.<br /><br />If you don't then perhaps a lifelong stay on a desert island with only the Robert Johnson double CD is the equivalent of heaven.<br /><br />A few years ago I put together a CD for myself that I called \\"Blues.\\" Of the 18 tracks, 7 were from \\"Electric Mud.\\" None were by Hendrix, but only because he had created his own place on Mt. Olympus. Two were by Robert Johnson: \\"Hellhounds on My Trail\\" and \\"Crossroads.\\" Two were by Howling Wolf \\"Back Door Man\\" and \\"Smokestack Lightning.\\" Butterfield Blues Band \\"One Last Mile.\\"<br /><br />Personally, the blues purists should consider a more sedate life, perhaps they could rent space from some Amish sect: before electricity GOOD, after electricity BAD.<br /><br />Or, even better: why not actively seek the repeal of ALL civil rights legislation so that the black artists who play the blues are much more likely to actually FEEL BLUE!!! A whole race mired in poverty and ignorance, treated like commodities... but, hey, what's a little pain when it creates REAL BLUES!!!???<br /><br />So, having determined the place of the purists: desert island with Robert Johnson; boarding with the Amish; sitting in the Bush family museum of southern politics... I hereby declare \\"Electric Mud\\" to be one great album, maybe the best combination of blues vocals and spare but high energy, driving electric blues guitar.<br /><br />So, make your choice: Amish blues or one of the truly great blues albums of all time?
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent came into the game strong as most rappers did. Examples: NaS, DMX, Mobb Deep etc. this was a true work of art, nobody should give this album less than 4 stars if the reson is because you dislike 50 cent's personalaty. Dr. Dre experimented with 50 by makeing beats that were diferent, like in the song heat. this album is from top to bottom a tru classic. 50 will never be able to make another get rich or die tryin' just like NaS will never make another Illmatic, but that doesen't mean their future albums won't be good. it makes me angry to see people rate a masterpice like this 1 star cause they support Game or NaS or Kiss or maybe even Joe or simply cause of 50 absence in Southside Queens. Put your self in his position, would u go to where people are jelous of you and want to kill you? true you could be a \\"gangsta\\" and kill your enemies but a man of 50 cent's popularaty wouldn't get away with murder.  <br /> <br />over all review of the album song by song:  <br /> <br />1.

B00001ODGR|5.0|Simply put It was way better than I expected. Excellent sound & video quality.
B000BNI90O|4.0|When I first bought the FELLOWSHIP soundtrack released at the time of the movie, I was disappointed with what was missing.  That CD featured an opening track that I have yet to find in the film (and was missing the beautifully haunting Ring theme that opened the discs for the other two films) - and there was an entire stretch that was missing from the soundtrack which covered the beginning of the journey of the Nine and was missing the trek over the mountain, the doors of Durin, and the early part of the Moria journey.   <br /> <br />But now we have all of this music restored, as well as the additional music from the extended cut of the film, and basically EVERY piece of music in the film!  I for one feel that the $50 is a worthy price, for this is more than just music slapped on a CD and sent out in a cheap case.  You can HEAR the work that went into restoring the complete soundtrack!  I believe that much of this music was likely re-recorded for this release.  Furthermore, the packaging does not scrimp on the niceties - you get a Box that (like the Extended DVDs) is made to look like a book on your bookshelf.  Inside, you'll find a seperate \\"book\\" containing the three audio CDs, a nearly 50 page booklet with notes concerning the themes and motifs from the score, and the DVD itself which contains the entire 3 hour piece uninterrupted and in 5.1 stereo surround (assuming you have the equipment to play it).  All this is covered with art and photos from the film as well.  All told, it is a splendid package, and is great for any fan, or for a gift to a fan. <br /> <br />With this complete score, one can now completely lose himself in the brilliance of Shore's work, rather than the chopped up \\"best of\\" bits that we got with the original soundtrack.  In fact, you can sit back and relive almost the entire film in your mind (since ALL the music is here in sequence, and almost every scene in the movie contains music).   <br /> <br />Despite my praise, I do have three quibbles with the set - not enough to ruin my enjoyment, but enough to stick in my craw a little: <br /> <br />1) I agree that the DVD storage is annoying.  It is on a thick plastic nub glued to the inside cover.  Once you get it off, you'll never feel like you can quite get it back on right again. <br /> <br />2) I understand that they wanted to keep all three audio CDs at equal length - however, in an attempt to be anal, they kind of screwed up the flow a little.  Moving from disc 1 to 2 is no big deal, as it corresponds to somewhat of a break in the film narrative (corresponding to the \\"cut\\" between the hobbits leaving with Strider at the end of Disc 1, and picking back up at the campfire atop Weathertop with Disc 2).  But it is the transition from Disc 2 to 3 that bothers me a little more.  Basically, you are following the score along through the Mines of Moria and up to the battle in Balin's tomb, getting all absorbed in it.  Then you have to stop and switch to continue the \\"scene\\" as they encounter the Balrog.  Imagine you are watching the DVD and the group have battled in Balin's tomb, are running for their lives as Orcs poor out of every nook and crevice, and then they hear the gutteral growl of the Balrog. Then the DVD stops and you have to get up and change discs to pick the scene back up again as they run for the Bridge.  That would really break the mood, would it not?  Well, that is what the soundtrack does.  Seeing as how each disc is only 60 minutes and could hold 20 more minutes, why could they not shift the Bridge track back to Disc 2 and have Disc 3 pick up with the approach to Lorien?  Seems like a much more natural transition to me.  I know it seems like a minor quibble, but I just think it should have been done this way for the continuity of the music - as it stands, it seems like Disc 2 is \\"incomplete.\\" <br /> <br />3) My final quibble is the most significant to me.  It seems a decision was made that EVERYTHING that is musical in the movie must be on this disc.  Thus, even a snatch of singing from one of the characters is included.  So, as you are losing yourself in the pastoral beauty of the shire in your car, SUDDENLY Ian McKellan is in your backseat singing very poorly a muttered version of \\"THE ROAD GOES EVER ON\\" - and later Ian Holm does the same (only this time not even in tune with the music).  This in itself doesn't bother me, except that the mix is AWFUL!  When the singing comes in, it is TOO LOUD and nearly covers the music completely!  If they had been incorporated more as background or \\"offstage\\" as they were in the movie itself, I may have actually enjoyed it.  As it is, it is a booming distraction from the music, which is what I really wish to hear!  Furthermore, the later inclusion of the Hobbits Drinking Song sounds like it was recorded off of a TV speaker, and again seems \\"inserted\\" into the score rather than part of it.  And, much as I appreciate the inclusion of the Elves singing as they leave the Shire (from the Extended cut), it is here at about two minutes longer than it was in the film for some reason, and . . . well, the repeated melody gets old pretty fast! <br /> <br />But, these are all minor annoyances next to the joy of having the full 3-hour score to enjoy!  I recommend this set at the $45 to $50 price - absolutely!

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|As I peruse the fancy flip book of lyrics and listen to the new album \\"First Impressions of the Earth,\\" I am amazed. To capture The Strokes' music or to describe my feelings about the music is impossible.  The whole experience is a positive, magical escape from the doldrums of everyday existence. The perfect convergence of crazy lyrics and stylish guitar in `You Only Live Once'  to the pounding rhythm of the bass in `Juicebox' to the exhilarating, thrusting scale in `Ize of the World' combine to make an excellent album worthy of purchase and many listens.  Even if you are deaf, the album has a masterpiece of a flip book that is a trip by itself with an enticing `Explicit Content' warning on the cover. The warning should excite you even more about the album.  While The Strokes have produced two previous albums, this third album shows maturity with a balance of creativity and ingenuity. What I want to say is `buy all their albums and singles and EPs now', but if you have a lack of funds, buy them all anyway. \\"For a while it was nice but it's time to say goodbye\\"
0307276902|5.0|This book is amazing. The storyline is intense and the way James Frey writes is out of the ordinary and captivating. It's definitely a must-read, have fun trying to put it down, each page leaves you waiting for the next, it's a great book - an excellent addition to any library of books. It is a conversation starter, a lender - in all, it's terrific. I've read it twice and since have not gotten my hands on it, as my own copy has travelled through many of my friend's hands and is still being passed around.
B000000OS2|5.0|I have heard some good live albums, but nothing beats this. Not only is it difficult to make a live album, but to have it be aqoustic......AMAZING. I would have never thought Tesla's music could be THAT good being done aqoustic. This is a must have.
1573223085|4.0|There are new ways of thinking that are becoming more important today than in the past.  And these new ways of thinking are what will be relevant and recognized in the future, so says Pink, an accomplished writer with an impressive past resume.<br /><br />Part business book, part futuring book and part self-help book, lays out an interesting premise in two parts.  First, he lays out the context for his argument in a section called The Conceptual Age and then in the second section he outlines the Six \\"Senses\\" he feels will be required for success as an individual and as a nation.<br /><br />Each part is unique and worthwhile reading.  The second section includes a very interesting set of exercises and resources to help you understand and strengthen each of his identified senses,<br /><br />I believe this book is a great example of a raising new genre of books.  In the mold of Gladwell's The Tipping Point and Blink,  it is well written, filled with interesting anecdotes and examples, and is a meaningful read as a business person.  At the same time this book (and the genre) has application to a much broader audience and purpose.  A Whole New Mind raises questions, creates insights, as well as providing specific ideas and action steps.<br /><br />Any book that can provide me ideas and make me think about things that matter to me is worth reading.  Consider this as your next business read or to read on the beach - it will fit either mindset and be well worth your time.
B000BYRCRY|5.0|I'm so glad I got this extended unrated version.  I have the original widescreen DVD that came out first, but with this copy there were so many extras that I decided to grab it also.  After watching both of the versions I've decided I'm going to keep both as they have different commentary tracks.  The commentary on the extended version with Len, Kate and 'Speedman' was quite funny.<br /><br />I usually would be very annoyed with having to own more than one copy of something to get all of the extras, but in this case I wasn't too urked, considering the great deals I got on both DVDs.<br /><br />I picked my extended one from best buy for only $15, and it came with a movie ticket valid for up to $10 off of one ticket for Evolution (only at best buy).  I believe the other one was around that cost also.<br /><br />If you're a big fan who owns the original DVD of the movie I would definetly recommend getting this version too.<br /><br />I already know what will happen once Evolution comes to DVD: I will run out and buy it immediately, only to buy the new extended, unrated version a year later. ;-)
B000BJS4BM|5.0|It's been about 23 years since Madonna first entered our lives with her first songs. And it's been almost 8 years since she released her wonderful album \\"Ray of Light\\". And now, in 2006, this 47-year-old lady ain't done yet. She's just released a CD that gives \\"disco dancing\\" a whole new meaning. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is probably 2005's best album, after \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" and (in the Philippines) \\"Nina LIVE\\". What more with the limited edition? You get a cute slipcase shaped like a book, a Madonna-ized diary, a 1-month trial membership in ICON, her fan club, and the CD, which is in a book with pictures of a disco Madonna.  <br /> <br />The Limited Edition does not just feature those goodies. It features a bonus track, \\"Fighting Spirit\\", a very beautiful dance song. It makes the CD's length exactly one hour long, as a matter of fact!  <br /> <br />My three most favorite tracks on the album are \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Isaac\\", in that order. \\"Hung Up\\" is really catchy, especially that line \\"Time goes by so slowly\\". What made \\"Sorry\\" wonderful were the many languages crammed into the song (Sorry in those languages, BTW) and the line \\"I've heard it all before\\". And \\"Isaac\\" has the \\"mmmmm\\" like the \\"mmmmmmm\\" in Frozen, and the foreign thing at the start of the song.  <br /> <br />Truly, Madonna is the Goddess of Re-invention and Pop. I hope that this album will beat \\"Ray of Light\\" in popularity and \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" in sales. It just seems to have a little bit of everything in it (though disco dancing is prioritized!).
B000B63EZG|5.0|This is Heavy, Melodic and Powerful.(HIT THE FLOOR, TEARS DON'T FALL and ALL THESE THINGS I HATE are masterpieces.)
B0000AOV85|5.0|For me, Roger Waters' explanations of the themes behind the album are the highlight here. He seems to think deeply about life, but is also able to express his thoughts simply and eloquently. I'd imagine he would have made a top-class psychologist if he hadn't taken the rock and roll path. He definitely has the aura of a leader, defining the piece and it's direction, while the other band members seem content to talk about the musical aspects of the album, as well as the circumstance of its making. This is valuable too, in its own way, and Rick Wright seems especially good at describing his influences and music-writing process. There's also good input from Alan Parsons and Chris Thomas, as well as the occasional long-haired jounalist giving their commentary on the album's impact. There's some on-stage footage, but don't expect too much; this is, after all, a documentary on the making of an album, and it stays well focused on that task. The bonus material is exceptional; highlights include a Roger Waters demo tape of \\"Time\\" that is radically different from the finished album track, and David Gilmour giving some virtuoso solo performances. Its hard to imagine how it could have been much better.
076790382X|4.0|Bryson originally wrote this collection of essays on the quirks of the American lifestyle as a weekly column in a British publication.  Each chapter is a a single week's very short musing, anecdote, or tirade, succinct, funny, and wildly divergent in subject from the previous one.  It's easy to keep thinking, \\"just three more pages,\\" and suddenly finish the whole thing in one sitting...which is just what I did.  But it's probably better enjoyed in small morsels. <br /> <br />The book suffers some from the serial format -- Bryson himself attests to how hard it was for him to come up with good content under time pressure, and some of the resulting material is hackneyed.  Bryson's bellyaching about lawsuits, taxes, the postal service, bureaucrats, consumerism, junk food, malls, police officers, and computer usability is nothing we haven't heard before.  But the tales of his personal bumblings make even the most dull topic an entertaining read.  Bryson's friendly, self-deprecating sense of humor always comes through, and consistently made me smile.  While there's no narrative thread, the recurring themes, like Bryson's yearnings for old-fashioned, small-town Americana, do give the book a sense of unity.  And some of his observations were fresh and novel. <br /> <br />At any rate, if one story fails to amuse, there is always the next one, just a few pages later.  Anyone who likes Bryson will get a kick out of it; in fact, it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't.
0060763280|5.0|Truly an outstanding book!  It made me think about what I already knew in new and creative ways.  Aside from the great contrast between the financial mindset of the rich vs. the consistenly poor, there were two concepts that effected me.  First was how our beliefs and assumptions about ourselves create a \\"thermostat\\" that tends to keep us at a certain financial level.  Then, building on that, how those beliefs and assumptions can be modified so that our results tend towards a new, higher level.

0767805712|5.0|\\"Gattaga\\" is a masterpiece. Firstly, it is a timeless movie. Released in 1997 you would expect it to seem dated by 2006 but it is far from it. Instead of using \\"futuristic\\" clothing and hairstyles, etc the director chose to give the movie a classic feel with hints of the 1920's and 1950's with just the smallest \\"futuristic\\" twists. The result is a movie that doesn't make you cringe at what people then thought the future would look like.  <br /> <br />As we delve further into genetic science, what \\"Gattaga\\" portrays is more thana  little bit likely to happen. There will be a new kind of class system and a new type of discrimination...all of which will be decided by a simple blodd test mapping out the sequence of one's DNA. <br /> <br />I am 27 years old and have had cancer twice. Had my husband been able to discover at the beginning of dating me that one year into our relationship I would be having surgery and radiation therapy due to the cancer I wonder if he still would have considered me a candidate for a mate. Since the cancer (and reading up on how hereditary it is) he now thinks if we have children we should get someone else's eggs (not mine) to \\"ensure\\" our children to not receive my defect.  <br /> <br />This is the subtle beginning of what Gattaga is all about. I am not into sci-fi very much but I adore this movie onb every level: plot, character developement, cinematography and especially the music (score).
0452282152|2.0|Did you ever watch a movie and know that if you could see round the corner of the set you would see cardboard details and wood supports holding the facade up? This book feels like that. You constantly hear the author's voice rather than the character's and it feels like the author is pushing these cardboard characters around her plot in a forced and obvious way. I was left with a feeling of \\"Where's the beef?\\".<br /><br />That said, it was very easy to read and it did make a pretty good movie.
B0006IF92U|4.0|I aggree with most of the positive reviewer that this Album is significantly darker and personal etc, but as soon as I heard this \\"Almost Here\\" on this CD I bought as an OZ Import, I thought: \\"Ohh my god...What is this thing?!?...This is not Delta but this horrid sounding Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden here\\" Such a beautiful Album incl gorgious \\"electric storm\\"  and this horrible \\"almost here\\" - Doesnt sound like Delta but Westlife obviously, and was utter dissapointed with this one, and had to skip it, as I havnt heard such a horrid song ever, with this horrid sluring Brian who sounds much like having just come out of a pub into the studio. Poor Delta, she didnt need to do herself this (sounded much like a let down of herself when I first heard it) - And how this \\"almost here\\" came to be #1 in OZ, is a unexplainable mystery, as I found it the worst song on this so good album, and other Delta fans agreed with me. I only hope gorgious Delta gets her whits together, and never sings such rotten bad Duets which one can not really say as being a duet but Brian McFadden featuring Delta, thats what it is! For this reason alone, I give Mistaken Identity 4 instead of 5 Stars, because of this cludge with almost here. I hope Delta leaves her fingers from such endevours in future, and concentrates on her solo work, where she is best, in all regards.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Patton was the best war movie of the 70's.  This film deals with Patton's career during WWII.  It begins with his Africa campaign and takes it through Italy and ends in Germany at the conclusion of the WWII.   <br /> <br />This film shows both Patton's brilliance as a general and his flaws of as a man.  Patton's was a man of passion and was more interested in what was most effective than what was politically correct (as in office politics not social politics).  His career is shown against his good friend Omar Bradley's career.  Bradley followed the rules and advanced quickly and surpassed the maverick Patton. <br /> <br />George C Scott was a leading actor on stage but until Patton he was only a featured performer in movies.  This raw performance made Scott the first choice for these types of roles in the future (but he was better at comedy!) <br /> <br />Karl Malden was already a star and Oscar winner but his performance of the by the books general lead him to a successful TV sereies. <br /> <br />This is a well made film and for many involved was their finest hour.  One thing most people who are into film music unanimously agree is that Jerry Goldsmith's score was one of the greatest film scores ever. <br /> <br />This is a well balanced film and well made.  <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: Audio Essay on the Life of George Patton <br />
B000094DUP|5.0|What a beautiful, heartfelt, emotional touching debut album, from such a sweet talented singer who could become the OZ Celine Dion and more - Delta easily leaves Kylie & Co behind, and is no Britney sorry - As Delta without needing to take the clothes of like Brit, can sing, and Britney not. This Album should be on every Pop Fan shelves - She is hot, and dont let the \\"Neighbours\\" Tag fool you, she got professional Classical Music and Singing background, where untalented wanabes like Britney/Jessica Simpson have not, and she writes her own songs, many dont. So please if you've not already got it, buy it now...This so talented GIRL is so good...I seen her at a concert, she just rocks one of the best concert I've seen, and Delta pulls it off no sweat! (Minus that jucky Brian stuff obviously) ...SO please Buy this Album Innocent Eyes now, you cant go wrong! :)
B000063JDE|2.0|There are enough opinons about this movie to make it mandatory viewing for anyone who likes things a bit off center. It has interesting characters and visuals, but is short on plot and acting. Kyle McLachan and the rest of the cast are not very interesting to watch; Dennis Hopper is, but goes over the top to the point where his character is almost comical. Some satire going on here too, which not everybody \\"gets.\\" Watch it once to see what all the fuss is about, but it's more something to render judgement on than to enjoy.
B00001OH82|3.0|Tin Machine was a hard rock band fronted by David Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels and Hunt & Tony Sales.  Bowie and the band wrote all songs, other than a cover version of John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\".  It's a decent album, although Bowie's voice is buried in the mix.  I hate to sound like an old fogey, but I like Bowie's early stuff better.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|The cd is perfect, every single song is great from start to finish. Panick! does sound like Fall Out Boy, but I think that they are still better than Fall Out. I have both cds, and Panick's cd is much better than Fall Out's. This is the best punk rock cd i have ever listened to. Deffinately get this cd, you will not regret it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain flowed really well, the soundtrack was great.  I find this movie hitting closer to home than other love stories because this could pass as an sincere true event.  One, Ennis,  is fearful of the public finding out, thus wants all to remain a secret. The other, Jack, ignoring what the times approved of.  It was acted very well and with Gustavo Santaolalla's compositions accompany the movie very well. I only have one beef with the film. We know how hard translating a book onto the big screen can be.  Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter just to name a few omited alot of things, yet Mortal Kombat Annihilation tried to fit everything (e.g. introducing a charater or two, then they never return, or naming a few characters that never are seen) in to cover all.  Either way, the end result can be better, or worse.  In brokeback mountain, that only true sex scene between Ennis and Jack was a little too \\" in your face\\".  I think it would be more accepting to have just left it to the viewers what they did in the tent, instead of throwing in  2 minutes of what was shown.  Other than that, i liked the movie greatly.
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a towering achievement. Finding new and different ways to honor Lincoln's statesmanship isn't easy after 140 years, but she succeeds. <br /> <br />The book develops as four parallel biographies, of Lincoln and his main rivals for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination: William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. Mrs. Goodwin shows that Lincoln was hardly a reluctant dragon where the presidency was concerned, but as a one-term Whig Congressman whose opposition to the Mexican War had cost him public favor, and as a twice-defeated Senate candidate, Lincoln remained a dark-horse possibility at best behind the popular and esteemed Seward. <br /> <br />The immediate prologue to the nomination reads like a novel in Mrs. Goodwin's skillful hands. A clever politician, Lincoln knew that subtle differences in their positions on slavery meant that his three rivals had potential baggage. But instead of \\"going negative,\\" as is the custom today, Lincoln praised his rivals while at once highlighting these differences in his speeches. Having been dismissed in the press as a \\"prairie lawyer\\" and worse, Lincoln benefited from genuine surprise at his eloquence. His handlers skillfully \\"worked the convention\\" in Chicago, and as Seward's enemies quickly sought a second choice, Lincoln won a third-ballot nomination. Seward was devastated. <br /> <br />Because Democrats were fatally divided over slavery questions, the Republican nomination was virtually tantamount to election. But before Lincoln had left Springfield for Washington, South Carolina had seceded, and immediately after arriving yet before his inauguration, Lincoln faced the question of whether to reinforce Fort Sumter, Union property now in hostile territory. <br /> <br />Lincoln somehow persuaded the bitterly disappointed Seward to aid the transition government. No fan of Lincoln at that point, Seward nonetheless agreed. He accepted the job of Secretary of State. Chase,even more ambitious than Seward and more contemptuous of Lincoln as a politician and statesman, became Secretary of the Treasury. Lincoln's \\"Team of Rivals\\" became like a football team that played well despite having little or no regard for its coach. <br /> <br />The book proceeds as a chronology of the Civil War. Throughout, Mrs. Goodwin shows how Lincoln's \\"people skills\\" carried the Union through early battlefield defeats, the complicated question of emancipation, and eventually victory and plans for Reconstruction...which failed miserably after Lincoln's murder. <br /> <br />One minor cavil with the author: In what George W. Bush would surely applaud as approbation of his own habit of referring to Iraq dissent as \\"harmful to the troops and unpatriotic,\\" Mrs. Goodwin refers to Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandingham as a \\"demagogue of defeat\\" for his encouragement of troop desertion. <br />Vallandingham had been arrested by Union General Burnside inside his home for merely excercising his free speech rights, and Burnside's action was unanimously condemned by every member of Lincoln's cabinet (who rarely agreed on anything). Lincoln had Vallandingham released without criticizing Burnside...a statemanlike act of compromise that Mrs. Goodwin cites but without recognizing the present-day irony of referring to war protestors as \\"demagogue(s) of defeat.\\" <br /> <br />
B000003CKH|5.0|I am not much of a fan of modern rock, because most of it just stinks!  But Cake has got it right.  They have a very unique sound, they don't sound like they're trying to be something they're not, or imitate another band or sound.  They do their own thing and they do it well.  The lyrics are great and the music is put together well.  If you've never heard of them, listen to the samples here and then become a fan!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Every great record is overrated. That being said, this is only overrated slightly. I do not see it as the best Dylan album lyrically or the most revolutionary Dylan album: lyrically, Blonde on Blonde is the best and Bringing it All Back Home is the most revolutionary. But this time, everything fits; his voice, as one reviewer described it negatively, is a \\"whine\\"; I do not see it as such, I just see it as a cry. Like Lennon's teary-eyed lonely screams that highlighted his  \\"Mother\\", Dylan's voice perfectly expresses his emotions. Every song is a gem, from \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" to the beautiful guitar on the finale \\"Buckets of Rain\\". I must admit that \\"Lily Rosemary...\\" drags on painfully, but it is just overshadowed by the rest of the album. This album shows Dylan at his high musical point and the guitar is wonderful. To many people (including myself) this is not the best Dylan album; I like Highway 61, and most people love Blonde on Blonde. Nevertheless, this album is wholly amazing and should be in everyone's collection.
B000BGH22W|3.0|I am in love with the Harry Potter books and all the characters in them. The first two movies went along with the books great.  <br /> <br />Then number three came out and i liked it because it was Harry Potter and it had all the same characters and the same music theme but it was starting to slide off track a little.  <br /> <br />Then a few weeks ago i went to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I honestly wanted to cry after I walked out of that movie theater. To a serious Harry Potter fan, that was a shot to the gut. They didn't have the same Music theme, it was more dark and serious. No Mrs.Weasley. I love Mrs.Weasley. And of course everyone knows that there is a new actor playing Dumbledore. Plus the noticable lack of Harry's arch enemy Draco Malfoy. He was only in the movie for a few shots.  <br /> <br />This movie had great special effects. Lord Voldemort was amazing. Just not enough credit to the stupid insignificant things that happen in the book. Such as Hermoine and her S.P.E.W.  <br /> <br />Little stuff made the movie lack the magic of the book. This movie was very serious and dark. Don't get me wrong...very good movie. But like I said, coming from a true Harry Potter fan, very disappointing.
B00004XONN|5.0|I never really liked the singer's voice before this album which was given to me by a friend. Since then I listen to it all the time, it's very catchy. Radiohead rocks.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What's to be said that hasn't been said already?  Some people mentioned a few problems, such as the level of technology (suggesting that technology wouldn't be that high in 500 years... to which I respond, look at how far technology has come in the past 50 years, and it's accelerating exponentially.  I don't think that level in 500 years is a stretch at all), character development (I felt pretty comfortable with who these people were by the end of the movie) and being confused if you haven't seen the series. <br /> <br />In response to the final point, I haven't seen the series but didn't feel at all confused to the point of distraction.  I felt the necessary things to know were explained well enough and at appropriate times.  In short, Serenity is a great movie -- easily one of my top 5 -- and is highly recommended!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Someone sent me the mp3 of the song Precious. I'm 57, and listening to it with headphones is just amazing! It gets right in your head so you feel like you're a part of the music. I'm going to buy this album and I recommend it highly. If you love Depeche Mode, you will love this.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|I'm not used to see kung fu movies i hate them, but when i saw this one i thought it was awesome, so funny .. not \\"stupid\\" funny like typical american movies, this one was good and mixed with the kung fu was perfect. i Laugh my ass off, but it didn't have spanish subtitled so my friends had a dificult time trying to undestand the english subtitles. But its a MUST see.
B00023B1LM|2.0|You've seen all these elements a hundred times before: karate fights, shootings, car chases, romantic interludes....  It gets kind of old, doesn't it?  The director throws all the elements above into a Waring blender, crossing his fingers that the resulting incomprehensible mishmash will prove \\"exciting\\" and marketable.  This movie relies upon holding back information from the audience--information needed to understand the motives and actions--to represent itself as mysterious.  To be fair, the sound engineering and editing are high quality, but breathless pace alone does not make a good movie.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Although i'm not a big fan of country music, i fell in love with this cd, it was so many great songs, and eventhough i didn't like very much the \\"that dont't impress me much\\" dance version, it's the best cd of Shania Twain. a MUST buy!! all her songs are great!!
0307276902|5.0|Despite the criticism that was issued in the press about this book, it did not change my view of the book.  It is an excellent read.  The words open minds to the destruction of addiction and at the same time instills a greater empathy and understanding in the reader.   Whether all the events were true or not, the story shows a very realistic picture of the devistation of addiction and the struggle to stay sober.  This book gave me a new appreciation of my own life and the people in it.
0596009208|3.0|From an experienced software engineer...    I wouldn't say that this book is bad.  About half of the jokes are funny.  If you like puzzle books you might like the exercises.      This book teaches Java using a self-proclaimed \\"engaging, entertaining, image-rich, conversational approach.\\"  Translation: Games, cartoons, and jokes.  It could be suited for beginners, but I found presentation gaps that would confuse a novice.    I sold the book shortly after I started reading it. I need a more concise presentation, or at a minimum, a way to get at the meat material quickly.  _Java in a Nutshell_ is my recommendation for a tutorial/reference.
B0002858YS|5.0|Despite the \\"post-punk\\" label being stuck to these guys, or whatever the label-du-jour is, this has got to rank up there with one of the best debut albums ever.  There isn't a weak track to be found here.  This release is just dripping over the edges with power and intensity.  The Killers will be *hard pressed* to come up with a follow-up to this, but I for one am eagerly awaiting. <br /> <br />It doesn't really matter that they are one of the group of bands doing their best to resurrect that new wave/punk sound.  The fact is that they pull it off while still exhuding a style all their own.  Sure, there is some similarity on the surface between the Killers and Franz Ferdinand, but once you get past the radio fodder, it's obvious there are different forces at work. <br /> <br />Whether The Killers turn out to be a flash in the pan or long-time contenders, I think it's safe to say this album will always rank up there as an incredible achievement.
B00027JZ3E|5.0|You Want to talk 80'S? This has to be the ultimate 80's horror teen flick of all time. Corey Feldman? Corey Haim? Anyway Santa Cruz was never really a safe place right? Now its inhabited by lurking vampires, and you know who is going to stop them, the frog brothers thats right! Kiefer Sutherland and his gang of thug vampires also including Alex Winters (Bill and Ted's)pretty much own the Santa Cruz boardwalk. They encounter a young charming Jason Patric (Cory Haim's older brother) who is lost and vunerable. He and Corey Haim lurk the creepy Santa Cruz boardwalk and falls upon a sexy innocent Jami Gertz. Unfortunately Jami Gertz leads him into the gang of vampire thugs and he becomes one of them by drinking a pint of blood, or maggots, or worms whatever..I won't give away who the master of all vampires thats for you curious horror fans to decide, but let me tell you this movie is packed with great 80's tunes such as Eddie and the tide and INXS. I bought the movie and the soundtrack well worth every penny. This two-disc special edition comes in pretty handy as well. First off the film is remastered and the sound is upgraded so you can really feel the 80's when Jason Patric smooths talk Jami Gertz and eventually gets some booty. (Cry little Sister) Amazing Song. Besides the picture and sound being upgraded the best bonus feature is how Corey Haim and Corey Feldman met. Its pretty funny but sad how there careers took a drastic land slide.   Watching Corey Haim talk about his good old times being a hot teenager in the 80's was pretty sad, because now he pretty much has nothing. But anyway its hilarious..you'll get a few kicks..deff. worth the buy or the upgrade from the previous release!!
0062502182|5.0|This is the kind of book that changes your life. <br />AMAZING!
0307276902|1.0|I believe Mr. Frey's book is dangerous reading for alcoholics and addicts because it plants an idea that a person can find permanent sobriety mostly through personal will power. This is directly contrary to my 12 year experience as a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous. <br /> <br />In a number of instances throughout the book Mr. Frey writes about his distain for the program of recovery outlined by Alcoholics Anonymous including the 12 Steps.  He almost brags about not doing his Fourth Step and Fifth Step even through completing the Steps was a requirement of his treatment center. I have personal known individuals who went back to drinking and eventually died because they did not complete these vital steps. <br /> <br />If alcoholics and addicts get the idea they can recover through personal will power continues many more will die. I'm not saying it is impossible to get sober without AA's 12 Steps and program of recovery.  I'm only saying it's dangerous to try. <br /> <br />As a recovering alcoholic I can relate to much of Mr. Frey's experience about the consequences of his alcoholism; however I do not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the \\"solution\\" to the disease. <br /> <br />
0446577383|4.0|I'm afraid this plot is not picturing \\"fiction\\"...In todays world it could actually happen somewhere.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|I rented this as soon as it was released on DVD and was very disappointed.  It could be due to the fact as a recently divorced father, it hit close to home.    The story centers around Jennifer Connelly and her daughter looking for an affordable place to live after a seperation.  She finds an apartment on dreary Rossevelt Island and soon begins to hear noises from the apartment above.    The whole setting is dark and depressing from it constantly raining, the lack of color anywhere to the depressing situation that the single mother and her adorable daughter are stuck in.  I won't ruin the end but it was extremely sad and dark.    Rent this movie if you are feeling down and it will surely keep you there.
0743455967|5.0|I've been looking at this book for years, trying to decide if I wanted to read it or not.  I've only read a few of King's short stories so I am definitely not a fan, but I enjoyed the stories.  Also, a number of people have told me that the book is good.  So about Christmas time when I had a Gift Card for a local bookstore, I decided to pick the book up (it was in theme with the rest of the presents I got with the card:  a moleskin notebook and pen).<br /><br />I found myself enthralled by the narrative of his life.  Stephen King is frank about the way he portraits his life and the challenges he faced in the formation of his writing career and his life.  He does not pull any punches.  In fact, that is one of the rules by which he writes by:  always tell the truth.<br /><br />The writing section is too the point.  He sets a point and illustrates why he feels it is important and how.  He is big fan of Strunk & White and continually refers to the Elements of Style.  In fact, it has encouraged me to dig my old book out.  King tells you what he likes and does not like.  He also tells you to be true to your writing.  He does not beat about the bush on any matter.<br /><br />Most importantly, he does not say this how to write.  The book is about how he writes and what works for him.  He acknowledges that each writer is different and functions under different conditions and by different rules.  He is just setting down what works for him to help the reader find what might work for them.<br /><br />The final section tells about his accident in 2000 in which he almost died.  The trial he went through for regaining his life and writing this book.  The section is very moving and talks about how he came back to writing after the accident.<br /><br />The book is a great and brief read.  Pick it up and devour it.  I cannot do it justice with any summary.  It is a great insight into one of the popular writers of our day.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|When I put this CD in my hard drive i didn't know what to expect. After already hearing \\"Juicebox\\" I was definetly excited for what people where calling \\"the new Strokes\\". To be honest I felt like I was the only one in the world who loved Juicebox, every review I read gave it a horrible rating. So skipping right to \\"You Only Live Once\\" I found myself instantly grooving to the muted guitar and caught on with every word \\" Some people think they're always right\\" I couldn't agree more. I then ventured on with Electricityscape due to the fact that the name intrigued me, I then listened to the song 2 more times because I was simply blown away by the change in sound. I read somewhere that \\"Razorblade\\" was Julian's least favourite song, I found myself disagreeing with him as everything from the simple and yet clever lyrics to the catchy guitar rift in the back was sticking in my head like you wouldn't believe. While I can't say I don't like \\"Killing Lies\\" and \\"Fear of Sleep\\" I often find myself skipping over them for the simple reason that every other song on the album outshines it by far. To be honest I could carry on about every song on that album forever but theres only so much I can type. So I'll end it with saying The Strokes are by far my favourite band and while I respect the opinion of those who think otherwise I can't help but strongly disagree. The Strokes never fail to satisfy all of my music needs and being a musician myself I can say I have a lot. The Strokes are my therepy, my inspiration and everything else in between. First Impressions of Earth is nothing more or less then a classic in my books and I thank The Strokes for making music like this. If there is a band out there better than The Strokes I don't want to hear them. <br />        Dylan
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest compilation of any artist I've seen. As an avid fan of Sir Elton John, I own nearly all of his CDs, and this set has as many of his \\"greatest hit\\" as one could fit onto two CDs. The only problem is that it leaves out several of my favorites.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Looking for an action-adventure shoot-em-up that features Nicolas Cage jetting around the world, battling bad guys, and getting the girl? Then you'd better find a different movie. Lord of War is as thought-provoking movie as I've seen in a long time, and I'm convinced that the critics that savaged it were expecting Cage's usual fare (National Treasure, Con Air, etc.).    I knew this movie would be different before it even started - in the audio setup menu, I saw the Amnesty International logo in the background. I'm sure Amnesty protects their logo, so I can't imagine it being there by chance. Another oddity that you'll notice right away is that Cage narrates the movie. He's not teaching, preaching, or anything close - it's like he's sitting with you in your living room discussing his life as Yuri Orlov.    This was wonderfully written. I'm sure that the Hollywood rule book stipulates a tale of redemption with clear-cut divisions between good and evil, but apparently the rule book wasn't read in this case.    Cage was perfectly cast as Orlov. Just the right proportion of dark humor and deadpan delivery will make you believe that the role was made for him. The supporting actors did a great job as well (Eamonn Walker was fantastic as the Liberian dictator). Orlov's \\"trophy wife\\" (played by Bridget Moynahan) was anything but a trophy - she came across as thoughtful, smart, and tough - not adjectives usually associated with the breed.    I highly recommend this movie!
B000AQBA1W|5.0|Finally got my CD yesterday and played it as soon as I could tear off the wrapper. Previous reviewers have gone into detail about all the songs so there is no need for me to duplicate their efforts. I prefer to simply provide my emotional reaction to the CD. Halfway through the first song my eyes became wet and my cheeks damp as I became transported by the beauty of the music. My wife came into my den and observing my state said softly \\"you got your new Corrs CD didn't you?\\" The only thing left for me to say is that this music and performance is truly Magnificent.
B0000640VN|5.0|Time travel has been used so much that I had seen this movie a few times (in the last 24 hours) before I even thought of how often this plot was used in the TV series `Quantum Leap.'  Though the audience might be expected to laugh occasionally, the characters are utterly serious, and the outstanding cast of agile actors have an uncanny ability to match Meg Ryan's zest, and to be on, interesting, and believable as unexpected events, such as elevators disappearing on the day that their inventor falls into the future, crop up.<br /><br />Though `Kate & Leopold' is obviously a fantasy, with a plot that is basically a *stranger*in*town*comedy set in New York City, it can compete with `Midnight Cowboy' for the number of unusual insights into the nature of modern characters.  People who can enjoy hearing every possible approach to the theme of this story explained will like having a DVD with director James Mangold's comments about how the magic of movie-making works.  I liked how music maintains the dramatic continuity even in the midst of such mind-boggling activities near the end of the movie as intercutting scenes taking place in the same building (now a rented ballroom) on April 28, 1876 and in the year 2000 as a couple who faced modern despicabilities for a few days try to meet again in a time when elevators have not been invented.<br /><br />James Mangold believes that a comedy should not run longer than two hours, so the theatrical version and a full director's cut both run 118 minutes.  I liked the test screening of a movie in which James Mangold plays a director blasting market research and polling at the beginning of the version that is only available on the DVD.  The commentary places a tremendous emphasis on the theme of the story that this movie is trying to tell.  I watched the deleted scenes before I played all the deleted scenes together with the director's commentary, and the disclaimer on the DVD which explains that James Mangold speaks only for himself is so obvious after awhile that you begin to wonder if anyone could think `Kate & Leopold' might be a better movie if theater audiences had spent a minute listening to the moans of an injured man at the bottom of an elevator shaft.<br /><br />All of the bonus materials on the DVD sound like effective advertising for the film after you have learned its lessons about promotional activities.  Sting contributed a song after watching a rough cut in 2001, and he must have realized that the theme of the film was stolen from a song, `Time In A Bottle' written by Jim Croce in 1971, which had some lines:<br /><br />But there never seems to be enough time to do the things you want to do once you find them.<br /><br />I've been around enough to know that you're the ones I want to go through time with.<br /><br />Sting starts his song singing about capturing the world in a bottle.  Another verse begins with capturing time in an hourglass.  A clock at the beginning of the movie is striking the hour in 1876, but that hardly seems as close to the theme as Jim Croce's line, \\"I'd save every day like a treasure and then again I would spend them with you.\\"  Only a fantasy world 1876 could be that time, but in `Kate & Leopold,' 1876 is that time.  Giving away the plot here should not be as objectionable as some people suggesting that a fantasy character turning his girlfriend into his great-great-great grandmother violates standards of decency which apply to comedy in a way that is non-ludicrous.lf is so obvious after awhile that you begin to wonder if anyone could think `Kate & Leopold' might be a better movie if theater audiences had spent a minute listening to the moans of an injured man at the bottom of an elevator shaft. <br /> <br />All of the bonus materials on the DVD sound like effective advertising for the film after you have learned its lessons about promotional activities.

0821221841|5.0|Recently bought a DSLR, and really needed something to help me improve my knowledge on photography. Since lots of pros online recommend it, I got this book.    This book helped me understand the most important fundamentals of the camera. After reading other photography books, I learned a few things like smaller aperture causes a greater depth of field. All I got to do was set the aperture to the largest or smallest possible in my point-and-shoot aperture priority mode. It is because other books never taught me why apertures can affect the depth of field, and the explanations are largely insufficient for the reader to understand how to use the intermediate aperture settings (which ranges will become out of focus, for instance). It is not until this book that I got the \\"that's why it is like that\\" enlightenment.    I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand photography. Some people may find the book too academic, and the pictures here are black and white. But I learned more from this book compared to those that have very nice colorful photos. Some don't even have captions with the aperture, shutter, ISO, etc. used. But even if they do, without adequate explanation on why they chose those particular settings (never mind understanding them), it is really difficult for novices like me to improve our photography skills. This book solves that problem for me.
B000002H6C|4.0|\\"And Justice for All\\" marks the end of the old school Metallica. This record is one of their heaviest and most profound. The lyrics dip into more political themes while maintaining their hard edge bitterness that makes them such an outspoken band. Often referred to as the last album before they sold out, there are no songs here to sell pop records. If you love the hard edge of Master of Puppets, this record picks up where they left off.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This was incredible. I cannot wait for this to come on DVD. I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is arguably one of the best album released in the 90s. The record's content includes some unrivaled rap tracks, some catchy pop tracks, and some of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard. She is undoubtley a contemporary equal of Aretha Franklin. The record takes you on a ride of agreesive hip hop to beautiful love songs. This album marks the benchmark for female R&B artists as a goal to aspire to. If you like hip hop buy it now, if you like pop buy it now, if you like good music buy it now!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is like no other television program.  Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the \\"fair and balanced\\" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting \\"reality\\" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be \\"yes\\".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, \\"why\\".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.<br /><br />Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.<br /><br />While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were \\"shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom\\", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled \\"Serenity\\".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.<br /><br />The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative \\"western\\" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is anexcellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a \\"priest\\", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, \\"Shepard Book\\".<br /><br />George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.<br /><br />I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?

B000003TB6|5.0|The first Roots album that I purchased was the Tipping Point and I loved it. I soon heard that it was one of their weakest albums. I started buying the other albums and was blown away by the caliber of talent. When I picked up \\"Do You Want More\\" I had no idea it was going to be as good as it is. The Roots prevail as hip hop jazz artists on this album. The lyrics are tight, the instruments are played well, and the sound encompasses funk and hip hop with a jazzy undertone. I am not a huge rap fan, but I love this album due to the thoughtful talent and ability that shines through.
0345440900|5.0|This book has great guidelines and advice, teaching you to trust your judgement, watch your child and respect them. If you're looking for the Bible or Magic Pill for baby care - keep looking (and if you find it, tell someone).  But using the GENERAL ideas and background principles helps so much and most importantly, gives you somewhere to start.  I realize, that as the mother of a Touchy Angel and Angelic Spirit is already a lot better off than another mother of say, a Sensitive Grump (we prefer Sensitive to Touchy, but hey), but they're both so different and there are so many practical ideas and things to try.  I have the great luck to live overseas and be able to afford childcare, and we have our child care providers read this.  WE re-read it (especially the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers now) to reconnect with the basics on occasion.  I did not find this book (or apparently read it to mean) militant schedules (in fact, I think she says to be flexible about it) or not advocate breast-feeding (which I did until 12months for both children, adjusting the recommended solids and introductions accordingly) - but I also disagree with the idea that moms 'instinctively' know because goodness knows I didn't.  We tried a few things (Babywise - too rigid, Attachment Parenting - too flexible), and this worked for us. I hope it does for you.
B0007M22TI|4.0|We saw the production on PBS and couldn't wait to order both the DVD and the CD. The music fills the heart, and the DVD would have been exquisitely done if only the director wasn't in love with overly-quick jump-cuts.    My only complaint: the DVD is marketed as a live concert. A live concert to most people means just that: a seamless live performance from beginning to end, with all the bells and whistles, and the occasional small bobble of performers or musicians or director somewhere along the line. It's disingenuous of the producers not to inform the public that the concert DVD is a collage of performances. A dead giveaway is the clunky, not-very-subtle audio shift in the midst of Lisa Kelly's spine-tingling \\"Send me a Song.\\" You won't find this effect in the CD, thank heavens. The other obvious giveaway is finding Meav miked first on the right side, then the left in the middle of a \\"live\\" performance. Not likely . . . .    These are small complaints, but I believe in honesty in marketing and we didn't get that as consumers. Still, if you haven't bought both the DVD and the CD, they're both well worth your time and your money. Just be aware of what you're getting in the DVD.
0345440803|5.0|I have two totally different babies (imagine that).  You'd think that one being (per Ms. Hogg) a Sensitive Angel and the other being an Angelic Spirit, that at least some things would be the same - they're not.  But this works for us and how.  This book has great guidelines and advice, teaching you to trust your judgement, watch your child and respect them.

However, working with manners and, above all, recognizing your own behavior and how if affects them is invaluable.  We tried a few things (Babywise - too rigid, Attachment Parenting - too flexible), and this worked for us. I hope it does for you.
B0000942QL|5.0|In 1984 I made the original purchase of this classic album. It was a massive double-vinyl L.P. in a beautiful gatefold sleeve with perverse, yet oddly charming, artwork of woodland animals engaging in a massive orgy. This album was an amazing release to me back then and it became the kind of album that stayed with me through the years. Of course I upgraded from vinyl to cassette and then from cassette to cd but the music always remained the main focus. This 20th anniversary reissue is a welcome, and long overdue, edition to my modern cd collection. The new digital transfer brings new life and depth to each track. The sprawling 13 minutes that is \\"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\\" has never sounded so good and the amazing bass response makes the classic tracks like \\"Relax\\" and \\"Two Tribes\\" bring you right back to the club. I do however have to agree with the previous reviewer, when I made my upgrade from cassette to cd, the cd contained the track \\"Happy Hi\\" (which was the title track's b-side), an amazing 9 minute version of \\"Two Tribes\\" and a remixed version of \\"Wish (The Lads Were Here)\\". That original cd is long gone and these tracks would have been a welcome addition to this package. Overall this is a cd you should not pass up and a repackaging you will be incredibly happy with. I felt that the music here was always ahead of it's time and I think that if you are new to it you will feel the same. To those of us that have been fans for the past twenty-something years it will be a great refresher course of our youth.
6304711891|4.0|I Recently added this DVD to my collection having seen it before many times. I won't go into plot details, you can read the synopsis or other reviews for that. I will once again state how great of an action movie this is with intense actions scenes, great visuals, a pounding musical score and just sheer entertainment value. I am EXTREMELY dissappointed with the DVD release which is horrible. Single Disc? Non- Anamorphic Widescreen? No DTS? Trailers and Gallery a Special Feature?. This movie is begging for a proper release. Hopefully we'll have a 10year anniversary edition or something in 2006, at a reasonable price of course. Maybe that's aiming a little high - its nice to dream though.
B00000DRXW|3.0|No no no! <br />JM's adventures in LA are misleading. Shakti's albums are amazing journeys, For the live album i pick Between Nothingness & Eternity. <br /> <br />Funny postcards, jammin' the pink panther's theme, but far - so far from Mahavishnu's best standards.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I came in not really knowing what to expect with this album.  There was so much hype on it and my tastes are pretty shallow in general (agreeing with the critics' pics a good portion of the time) so I was half expecting to be completely blown away.  Yet when I listened to some samples in stores, etc, they didn't appeal to me too much. <br /> <br />So it could go either way.  After some listens, though, it didn't. <br /> <br />Impressive?  Yes.  Musically, lyrically, atmospherically (the feel of the whole).  There are some memorable moments.  'Rebellion (Lies)' is undeniably brilliant.  But on the whole, I just don't get it being some 5 star, top 10 in the 2000s type of album.  Don't get me wrong...it's better than 95% of the stuff out there, hence the 4 star ranking.  It's just, this isn't like 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' (apologies for the multiple Wilco references), where you listen to the thing everyday multiple times for months on end, and ponder giving up life as you know it in order to get to every Jeff Tweedy show possible.  Or even Sufjan Stevens' 'Illinois,' where you look deep within yourself and ask, 'how am I so fortunate to be able to hear these amazing sounds coming from the speakers?'  Obviously, these are pretty heady examples to be throwing out there, but given the reputation of 'Funeral,' I feel they're justified.   <br /> <br />I can't get enough of their Merge-mates Spoon, but the Arcade Fire's 'Funeral' just doesn't live up to the hype.  It's good (loud...play it loud).  But not perfect.  Or imperfectly perfect.  <br /> <br />
B00006LLNU|4.0|FIVE PLUS STARS!!    I have just decided to update this.  ( ) has become my favorite Sigur Ros disc, simply stated - it's a masterpiece.  Epic!  A must own, for so many reasons.  It's darker than \\"Takk..\\" but it's also deeper.    =============================    This cd is a lot like \\"Takk,\\" and yet very different.  I first came to know Sigur Ros via the Takk cd, and have since moved on to their earlier works, and ( ) is the first that came up.  The way I interpret this album is it's a lot more ambient, and definitely a lot darker than Takk.  Some reviewers have said that they see the 8 tracks on this album all being part of one continuing theme.  I can definitely see that.  From the simplistic and beautiful sereneness of tracks 1 thru 4, to the end track 8, which is the longest and most intense of the album, you do feel that 8 is supposed to finish this 'story.'      There isn't as much singing on this album as Takk.. and each of the songs on ( ) are longer than the average Takk track (believe it or not).  But if you are like me, and found yourself completely caught off guard by the flat out beauty of Takk, you will want ( ).  I am moving on now to get Von and Aegtis Byrgum.  I am convinced that Sigur Ros is for real!
B0009RJPC8|1.0|James Blunt song \\"Beautiful\\" is the worst song I think I have ever heard in my life.  It is worse than \\"Fish-heads\\" (at least that song was amusing).  He has no talent.  Simple songwriting has produced some of the best pop/rock songs ever, but simple and low quality just equals bad.  I actually find this CD insulting.  Record companies wonder why no one buys CD's anymore, it is because of \\"singer-songwriters\\" like James Blunt.   <br /> <br />\\"You're beautiful. You're beautiful. <br />You're beautiful, it's true. <br />There must be an angel with a smile on her face, <br />When she thought up that I should be with you. <br />But it's time to face the truth, <br />I will never be with you.\\" <br /> <br />I bet there are over a million 13 year old girls in this country who could write better lyrics than that...
B0002Y69NG|5.0|To me, the Matrix collection is the best there is when it comes to sci-fi movies, especially since I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars. And in this, the Ultimate Collection, you can get all four movies for no more than forty dollars.<br /><br />If you're buying this collection, then you don't need to know the story of the Matrix. I'll speak instead of the content of the box set. It contains, of course, all three theatrical movies, as well as the Animatrix, which bridged the story gap between The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded using anime as its style for doing so. In each of the movie packs except the Animatrix there is one disc of supplemental material to help you better explore that specific movie, while the final three discs, found in the pack called The Matrix Experience, contains a final heaping of special features that helps in explaining the world of the Matrix and what's to come. All put together, more of your time will be spent watching the extra features than the movies, making this collection one of the best overall for content alone. There's enough here to keep you interested in the Matrix universe for a long time.<br /><br />If you liked the Matrix but have yet to collect the movies, now is your perfect opportunity. Considering what all is offered in this box set, I would have expected it to be closer to a hundred dollars. But it's not, and the value and what's offered makes this an excellent collection to own.
0307276902|1.0|Frey was urged by his agent from novel to non-fiction because he couldn't sell it as a work of fiction. Then it sold. Bam!    So basically people are reading a fiction labeled as non-fiction, and this idiotic shadow play passes for okay. And of course Oprah (who's morally fallen flat on her face) has to enable this liar because his book \\"resonated\\" with her, never mind that the book wasn't at all true and therefore the resonance has to be false.     How Alice and Wonderland-ish America has become, when fiction must be dressed up as fiction to sell.  If only truth had been allowed to prevail this mess would never have occurred.     Ah well, welcome to the sinking ship that is modern America. Ancient Rome in its final death throes had nothing on us!
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Like Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso takes a different direction than what we've come to expect from Miyazaki. There is no young female lead here, nor are there many children to speak of. In many ways, it's a romance of sorts, though filled with some rather intense action scenes, usually involving sky high gun fights.<br /><br />Unlike Princess Mononoke, this movie is not serious. The main character is a pig-faced legend of a pilot who wants nothing more than to reverse the curse on himself. Still, even with the curse, his skill at flying is unrivaled, and he proves it constantly when he battles sky pirates. Finally, frustrated at constantly losing against Porco, the pirates hire Curtis, an ace American pilot that matches up pretty well against Porco. But it's when Curtis goes after Porco's love interest that he really begins to take things personal, and so the battle intensifies. What's funny, however, is that their battles doesn't end in the sky. This was a surprising twist, and the fight, truthfully, is hilarious.<br /><br />This is one of the those movies that can't be judged until it's seen. The cover doesn't do it justice. The animation quality, like in all Miyazaki films, is top notch, the story is as touching, if just a notch more mature, as his other stories. And, the new format for what is obviously a Miyazaki film is refreshing. Though not the best of Miyazaki's films, it ranks well with other anime films and, if not for Studio Ghibli's constant stream of masterpieces, Porco Rosso would be a legendary anime. Plus, Disney applied their considerable weight and got some top voices for this movie, including Michael Keaton. Pick this up if your an unbiased fan of anime.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Alvin Straight doesn't offer mind boggling advice nor does he claim to possess a mystical knowledge of people's emotions. Instead he spends the trip reflecting on his own life that's near end. He learns things about himself but most importantly learns one ultimate truth: Sometimes your family is all you have and you must treasure them. Along the way he meets other regular people and gives some fatherly advice but also is equally affected by them as well.  <br />You can't go wrong with this picture. Enjoy it
B00005VPI6|5.0|Freddy, the hero of this book, is the embodiment of numerous secondary Heyer characters. Not too bright, not too good looking,definitely not an athlete. In most of her books there <br />is a Freddy read-alike stuck in just for fun, and fun we have. <br />It is a tribute to Miss Heyer that she could take a character who she would normally be having a ball with and turn him into a very creditable hero, enough so that we can with no problem see what Kitty, the heroine,sees to fall in love with him. Another triumph for Miss Heyer. If only she were still alive to appreciate the respect her books have finally received. <br />

B000089CJI|2.0|I was hopeful about this album but once I heard it I fell into a downward spiral. A friend of mine was very influenced by the album and she was excited to let me hear it but I was let down. <br /> <br />This is just another in a long line of 'EMO' albums that aren't very good musically but many people can relate to the lyrics. Unfortunately this album falls short even on the lyrics and sounds like a high school kid in his basement making the entire album. I was sure this was an album entirely made an produced by one guy on a keyboard and a sampler but was disappointed to find out who made it. <br /> <br />If you like The Cure more than you like Johnny Cash you may like this album but it seems to be more on the level of Ricky Martin fans. If you are over the age of 18 and have mature feelings and tastes in music you will probably feel as I did hearing this album 4 times in a row - completely upset and knowing that any sucker can make an album and someone will buy it! It simply gets 2 stars because it doesn't suck as bad as most 'pop' albums do.
6305428050|5.0|This movie cracks me up.  Anyone who has ever had to babysit can relate.  Not that we have ever had to go through the things that Chris goes through in this movie.  Thank goodness!  F.Y.I.  check out Anthony Rapp as the tag along friend Daryl Coopersmith.  He went on to star on Broadway in the original cast of \\"Rent\\" as well as in the recent film version.  He played Mark.
6305327084|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT.  The epitome of all low-key, Sunday afternoon, curl up on the couch movies. First off, you have to live in New England to fully appreciate this movie.  A lot of people out there don't \\"get\\" this movie, and that's ok. Of those that do, we are very passionate about it. You'd have to see it to understand.<br /><br />You have to watch this during winter, or at least with a little snow on the ground.<br /><br />As for the movie itself: It features Matt Dillon before he became, MATT DILLON.  Timothy Hutton who is by far one of my favorite actors.  He is underrated in Hollywood and we need to see more of him.  Most everyone in the movie is SPOT ON.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was perfect for her role, but delivers some of her lines incorrectly: \\"your brother's missing that thing that thing that having a mom gives you\\". She could have been an even more powerful character if she just slowed down her lines a bit. Still, I loved her in this movie.<br /><br />The movie is about these old buddies, and the women that surround their lives in different ways. Men, in general, are obsessed with beautiful girls.  And it's rare that you find a girl who is IT for you (ie: Moe is the only happily married of the bunch, but even he lusts after Stinky's cousin). The men have different issues with women, from commitment phobias to cheating with married women, and this movie brings these issues to light.  There is no hollywood-happy-ending, I would hate this movie if it did wrap everything up like that. It's a real move about real people and real issues. Something we can all relate to.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" finally arrived in Tallahassee on January 6.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes, it was.  The film, an adaptation of a story by Annie Proulx, is a thing of beauty.  Exceptionally faithful to the source material, Ang Lee, director or of the gay comedy \\"The Wedding Banquet\\" (among many other notable films), has fashioned a classic love story - one I feel sure will endure.  Why am I so confident?  Because rather than being groundbreaking, I found the story to be a simple variation on the classic formula which has fate conspiring against a pair of lovers.<br /><br />Is it really groundbreaking in 2006 for a film to depict the passionate love between two men?  The Fundamentalists are acting like this is our first time at the rodeo.  The truth is that we've been seeing films as explicit as this one for three decades.  In 1971 (thirty-five years ago!) staright actors Peter Finch and Murray Head played a passionate love scene in \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday.\\"  1982 saw Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean lock lips in \\"Making Love.\\"  In 1985 Manuel Puig's \\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\\" was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and William Hurt won Best Actor as the film's openly gay protagonist.  In 1987 we saw the landmark Merchant/Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster's \\"Maurice,\\" a love story that featured not only a happy ending, but James Wilby and Rupert Graves in a simulated sex scene which included full frontal nudity.  Has the Radical Right forgotten about the love scenes and nudity in \\"Love! Valor! Compassion!,\\" \\"Angels in America,\\" \\"Wilde\\" or the deservedly controversial \\"Priest\\"?<br /><br />Over the past three decades there has been a virtual explosion of films dealing with gay people: \\"Torch Song Trilogy,\\" \\"My Beautiful Launderette,\\" \\"Prick Up Your ears,\\" \\"Longtime Companion,\\" \\"Philadelphia\\" (for which Tom Hanks won the Best Actor Oscar), \\"Gods and Monsters,\\" \\"Jeffrey,\\" \\"High Art,\\" \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (for which Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar), \\"Before Night Falls,\\" \\"Far From Heaven,\\" \\"The Laramie Project,\\" \\"Capote,\\" \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" \\"Mysterious Skin\\" and \\"Transamerica,\\" to name but a few.  Other gay inclusive Best Picture Oscar nominees have included: \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" (which won the award in 1969), \\"Cabaret,\\" \\"Dog Day Afternoon,\\" \\"The Crying Game,\\" \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" \\"The Full Monty\\" and \\"The Hours.\\"<br /><br />There's an old show business adage that says \\"any publicity is good publicity.\\"  Perhaps films like \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" would never achieve \\"must see\\" status without the Radical Right calling special attention to them, without which they would simply come and go with little or no fanfare.  Though I can't figure out why \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" should be considered either controversial or groundbreaking, I highly recommend it, and would love to see it win this year's Oscar for Best Picture.  Now THAT would be groundbreaking.ight Falls,\\" \\"Far From Heaven,\\" \\"The Laramie Project,\\" \\"Capote,\\" \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" \\"Mysterious Skin\\" and \\"Transamerica,\\" to name but a few.

0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson's In a Sunburned Country is among the most entertaining books I have ever read. Not only does Bryson paint an extremely vivid picture of the beautiful land of Australia, but he also gives an equally engaging explanation of the little-known history of this country.    Sunburned differs from a contemporary guide book in that it is told from a first-person viewpoint and told in such a way that you would think you had gone on the trip with Bryson. His witty remarks and comfortable narrative makes this book a must-read for anyone interested in travel or just a good laugh.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'll preface this review with the fact that I was a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and over the summer a friend of mine introduced me to the boxed set of Firefly, so I wasn't going into this movie with a blank slate. I will also divulge that I'm a big Joss Whedon fan (except for Alien Resurrection, what the heck?). This review will of course be biased. <br /> <br />I'll get through the problems with this film first (there aren't that many). The biggest hurdle that Whedon had in transferring his show into a movie was characterization, and he doesn't quite clear it. There are nine main characters in the show, and how are you going to juggle nine characters in a two hour span when you're used to having years of examining each of their intriguing facet? I have no clue, and apparently neither did Whedon. Whedon's able to differentiate everyone because he's a master of dialogue, but for the uninitiated I don't think the major points of drama in the film will resonate like it will with those who watched the TV show. For those who are familiar with the television show it's really a treat to find out how everything ends(?) (*dun-dunn-dunnn*). <br /> <br />As for the rest of the film...it was great! (I was having trouble holding in the inner fanboy). Having a larger budget really allowed Whedon to show what he could do with a bigger brush. I must admit that I was worried Whedon might be too acclimated to television to handle the Big Screen. These worries were thankfully unfounded. Whedon knows how to use action without supplanting the story. There's some good choreography, and he's smart enough of a director to allow the viewers to follow the action instead of substituting quick cuts thinking he'll trick the audience into thinking they're excited. Towards the end the kind of action expands but I never felt I was lost in the spectacle of special effects. <br /> <br />This was also a great film for Whedon to showcase his visual talents. With a relatively small budget (I think itwas 40 million) he is able to immerse us into a believable and unique world. He is also smart enough to vary the landscape. The viewer is treated to a Hong Kong style city, the familiar border towns, and a place that looks like it came out of Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination. <br /> <br />There is a very Whedon feel to this movie. As anyone who has watched Firefly or Buffy knows, when you're watching those shows you feel that not only are you getting to know the characters on screen but the creator behind those characters as well. One of Whedon's great abilities is to make sure the audience is never complacent. For example, the opening consists of a scene where River is being taught at school, but soon we find out that this is going on inside her head and we're really being treated to a scene where her brother Simon is breaking her out of a secret government facility, but wait, this turns out to be merely a surveillance video (hologram?) the villain is watching of their escape. It sounds very clumsy in print, but is used to great effect as the movie's opener. There are plenty of other surprises in the film, but I don't want to spoil anything more. <br /> <br />In closing, Firefly fans will probably be more pleased than novices, but whoever you are I guarantee you'll be entertained. Oh, and there's an allusion to \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" and I can't tell you how long I've been waiting to hear that in a science fiction western originating on television.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Great cinematography, great writing, it's simply a great movie.  Hitchcock never ceases to amaze me.  This goes on the list with a few of my favorites including Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\" and \\"The trouble with Harry.\\"
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of the best CD's out there today.  I loved many of the songs on the album.  What is great is I loved most of the songs, while on most other CD's I'll just like 1 or 2 songs.  I personally loved \\"Harder to Breathe,\\" \\"This Love,\\" \\"Sunday Morning,\\" and others.  \\"Sunday Morning\\" has a jazzy tune to it, while \\"Harder to Breathe\\" is more rock, and \\"This Love\\" has Pop to it.  Many of their songs hit different Genras!  What's also great is you can dance to the beat of many of their songs too!  I recommend everyone buy this Album!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|An excellent follow-up to the \\"firefly\\" series.  Devoted fans will, of course, love it.  Someone who's never seen the show will also feel right at home with the way the movie brings in the viewer without feeling as though he's missed something.  5 Stars.
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.<br /><br />Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen.
B00000JQFM|1.0|Whuts up people??  All my friends know me as that crazy head-bangin' guy who likes guitar dominated rock bands, the wilder the better!!  Some of my favorites include Munky from KoRn, Mike from Staind, Wes from Limp Bizkit, Billy Jo from Green Day, all the musicians from Linkin Park & Slipknot, as well as solo performers like Avril lavigne and Ashlee Simpson!!  Well a friend of mine told me to get this album cuz I might like it.  Even though I wasn't familiar with any of the tunes from MTV or the radio, I still gave it a chance.  Boy that was a huge mistake, now I see why MTV never plays any of this Joe Satreani's muzik, its boring, slow, goes nowhere, and don't have singing!!  This stuff may have been cool long ago but no one cares about playing like this anymore, get with the times!!! Why wood you listen to a band that don't have singing??  Plus none of this Joe Satreani's stuff is catchy, if it don't get my attention in the first 1-15 seconds, forget it, its worthless!!  Put on anything by Disturbed, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Taking Back Sunday, Good Charlotte, KoRn, Atreyu and Slipknot for great guitar rock!!  Go Bengals!!
0307276902|5.0|Regardless of the truth behind this book it is a work that is both inspirational and spine-tingling and well worth the read. <br /> <br />James Frey depicts his version of events surrounding his drug and alcohol addiction in a heart wrenching rhythm that will leave you breathless even after it is over. Frey's writing style is full blown stream of consciousness and rivals such greats as Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf with its intensity. From page one Frey grabs his readers and the addiction begins. The story is raw and often sickening especially if the reader has ever dealt with the horrors of addiction in any form. However the most amazing aspect of this book is its ability to relate towards raw human emotion and the frailty of human beings when faced with dire circumstances.  <br /> <br />As for the controversy....I read this book prior to the \\"outing\\" of Frey and while I understood it to be a memoir I also could see seeds of elaboration. The fact of the matter is that this book was written by an addict and his memories may or may not be as factual as those sane enough to criticize this piece of work. It felt far fetched to fully believe Frey's story even prior to the controversy but as a reader I was willing to go with the elaboration in order to reap the benefits. Yes it's hard to believe a man with a gaping hole in his face and a blood filled shirt could manage to board a commercial plane but stranger things have happened! The wonderful thing about this book is the suggestion that an individual can find recovery on their own will given the right direction. The \\"cult\\" therapy organizations are not the only answer and I applaud Frey for braving his critics in order to express his views on this subject. Any individual can overcome any circumstance if their heart and mind is in the right place....I believe Frey's is. With rare emotion Frey captures finding his center within and without typical beliefs in addiction therapy. Don't shun Frey's work for the slam campaign but rather appreciate his words as the inspiration they were meant to be. The truth of this book remains in what a million other works have never been able to explain....the responsibility lies with the individual. I imagine Frey is fully aware of that fact. <br /> <br />  <br />
B00000CQJZ|4.0|Now, I'm one of those few people who in general finds displeasure in Hitchcock films, because far too often the basic story is repeated and, sometimes, simplistic.  However, it's hard to fault, and I won't try, Hitchcock's breakthrough, The 39 Steps. <br /> <br />First off, although Hitchcock goes with his typical mistaken idenity theme, this is the first time he uses it, so it is not yet overdone.  In addition, although the movie is now quite old, many of the ideas were revolutionary, especially in terms of visuals and sound. <br /> <br />What it all comes down to, as many movies do, is that the story was just interesting.  You have to realize that, unlike Bond movies, little matters about the actual goal, in this case the 39 steps.  Still though, we are so intrigued by the chases and near-getaways that one feels like the movie was worth it. <br /> <br />And so it is.  The film was worthwhile then, and it's worthwhile now.
B00003CWPL|1.0|Sorry...I've tried to watch this, I just fall asleep. Maybe it's the best classic ever, but I can't find out. I cant rate the DVD extras because I've only seen the VHS years ago.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Now, there's nothing like seeing a film which you have no idea what it is, about, or anything like that and then bowled over by how great it is.  This is one of those films, and come to think of it even if I had some forewarning it still would've suprised me, becuase this anime covers so much. <br /> <br />Still though, to give you heads up this story is about three homeless people: a upper middle age man, a young girl recently runaway, and a transvestite.  Now, right of the bat the movie should seem interesting, but probably plot less.  However, the story picks up when the three discover a baby and, over very little time, their fate somewhat becomes intwined with it's fate.   <br /> <br />See strange, right?  Somehow though, the ecclectic characters and the Holiday theme keeps it all together.  Through laughs, of which there are a plenty, and even some tough times the movie will keep you latched in.  And why not, the characters could be the start of a joke all on their own; this is true.  However, this movie is no joke.  Instead, it is probably one of the best animes (not relating to machines and robots) that I've seen yet.
0553382179|5.0|In just two short weeks, this book has changed my life, my house even my brain from complete chaos to orderly and peaceful.  It is easy and it is fun.  It is written so you can't fail.  Just focus on the \\"baby steps\\".
B00005JMAH|3.0|I rate it higher than I should but that is based upon the computer graphics which are stellar. Typical Potter fare with no surprises in plot development nor characters' behaviors. The 'novelty' of twisting time to turn back on events has been done previously and better. Sorry, but if your are a devoted Potter fan then you will absolutely rave over this. Every body else will just try to stay awake.

0307276902|5.0|I read this book before the negative press loomed around Jim Frey and accusations of it being untrue accounts. I still hold firm my belief that this is one of the most inspirational, humbling and moving stories I have ever read. Anyone who has struggled or been close to someone who has struggled with any kind of death, addiction, failure, and success can relate to Jim Frey's accounts. The book is written the way it is to be read, fast and not always structured and was impossible for me to put down. <br /> I have recommended this book to friends and family and will continue to.
B0000009SF|5.0|Hi guys! I'm just one of those hated Jazz snobs the last reviewer was talking about. Just Joking! But I'm really into Jazz old and new, that is my cup of tea. But I like Zappa's music too, because IT IS JAZZ for the most part (at least in albums like this one). I am completly aware that Zappa was a very talented music writer, intelligent and creative even if sometimes over indulgent with himself. But absolutly not here. And anyway we have to recognize that he produced an incredible amount of music in his lifetime and that he couldn't write only masterpieces of course, noone could. But here he did it! This is a masterpiece. Without any doubt. It's an instrumental album very entertaining, very sharp, not too much absurd (still considering it's a Zappa's record so a little it is but in a positive very refreshing way!). I love Zappa's instrumental music. He's so into the future. His music will always be light years ahead of our time. Varese, Barthok, dodecaphonic music meets Jazz harmonic sophistication and pulse and rock aggression. Plus the Z factor. The ZAPPA factor, his weird but extremely fascinating personality. The records that are much focused on his musical ideas instead of his irony and grotesque are the ones that I really prefer. This is one of the best. The opener or the last tune here for example are sooooooo good! But this whole album is a masterpiece in music! He was so great when he wrote things like these ... I'm listening to this album right now for the thousand time ... 4.00 of the first tune .. just a word, fantastic.<br /><br />Some weeks later ... I want to add something to my review. (I want to say something about each tune). The more I go deep inside Frank's musical universe the more I find this album THE PERFECT GEM in his catalogue. Neither Waka jawaka, which comes second to me, could be considered beautiful as this one. GRAND WAZOO IS THE THING for me. Neither Hot rats which is splendid is as much great as the Wazoo. Now something about each tune.<br /><br />1 Grand wazoo<br />Incredibly catching fusion of styles. Extremely melodic and groovin. Everything is here. This tune is exceptional. Some called it the Zappa's answear to Miles \\"So what\\", but this is a lot more than a D pedal (maybe was \\"Blessed relief\\"? the answear ... I don't know but who cares?). Sure it is a modal tune (Frank hated chord progressions to solo over, he liked modal vamps only) but there's more here as I told you. The theme, the rhythmn and the orchestration parts are far more elaborated and solos are no less fantastic than the \\"So what\\" excursions by Trane, Cannoball, Bill Evans and Miles. The bridges are equally superlative. I mean. This is one of my all time favourite tunes. ALL TIME FAVOURITE. The trombone solo here is something UNFORGETTABLE. Pure splendid jazz! And behind you can hear the orchestra pumping, growling, roaring wanting to come up front. Oh my god, GRAND WAZOO. This is really among my all time favourite tunes. FRANK, THANXS FOR THIS TUNE.<br /><br />2 For Calvin<br />Pure Zappa's extravaganza. In the melody, harmony and orchestration. It starts weird and ends weirder. If you are not accustomed to strange harmonies and melodies this one can shock you a little bit. Anyway Zappa's awkward but splendid sense of melody and atmospheres is very clear here. The tune swings slow like a broken toy, or a broken watch ... at a certain point there are dissonations going on, you may think you don't know were you are, then a siren shout! These moments of entropy, of chaos are sublime, I swear, sublime. The drums is still alive behind, giving the pulse, confirming that the tune is not dead yet. Slowly we go on, following the trombone and the trumbet which are saying strange things, than the tune accelerate, you are completly disorientated .... than a genial absolutly genial orchestrated bridge part arrive!! I mean this is Zappa at his very weird best. Another crescendo! The tune comes to the end. Frank you did your VERY VERY bestfor sure in this album.<br /><br />3 Cletus<br />A strange very melodical romp begins at the end of Calvin's song, it's Cletus. And here we are again with Frank's melodical genius. Piano is up front here. Than strange voices take the first places. It's delightful. Something that you can't miss. Its pure ingenuity is something marvellous which only a true pure genius can communicate without sounding childish.<br /><br />4 Eat that question<br />George Duke steals the show here. This is quite an unbelievable tune. This is fantastic. A funky fist in your face, the more challenging tune of the album from a technical standpoint. The melody is perfect, catching, hard, a really fantastic riff played in unison by the electric piano and the guitar. The rhythmn section works effortlessy on this hard funky vamp. Everything flows easy and hard at the same time. Duke's solos on the Fender Rhodes range among the very best jazz stuff I have ever heard (I own and Know thousands Jazz records). The energy of this tune is so dramatic! Exceptional. What a band! When you think the tune is over the theme returns harder than ever. Wow! It leaves you speechless! What an orchestrated riff! I mean. No words here. THIS IS PERFECTION IN MUSIC! (Frank's fuzz guitar tone here is expecially cool too).<br /><br />5 Blessed relief<br />This tune closes one of Zappa's greatest achievement. GRAND WAZOO. Blessed relief is a calm, soft, delicate tune, unforgettable. It begins as a dreamy ballad but then evolve in a magic melodic line and after that in an unbelievable spotlight for the soloists. When the theme, the melodic line returns you wonder where you have been in the last minutes. Away. Lost in a beautiful dream.<br /><br />This was Frank. Grand Wazoo is Frank at his best.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I have now seen Brokeback twice. The first time I went home not knowing what I thought. I went in expecting a nice love story, and it really isn't nice at all. It shows how awful it was (and in some places still is) to be gay in America. I guess I was sort of mad that they we not happy, and then missed some details in the movie. After seeing it for a second time, I picked up a lot of details and ended up loving the movie. People complain about the \\"love\\" scene, and I did at first, but they were just trying to make it realistic. While I personally don't think more than 1% of gay guys jump into sex quite that quick, or in that way, they do do \\"that.\\"    I have talked to LOTS of people who have seen the movie, and while it was not everyone's favorite movie of the year, everyone has liked it.    See it before you judge it, and I think chances are you wont feel cheated out of your money.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Funny i laughed and laughed, but i gave it a somewhat harsh score for its cheesy ability to make me laugh and some scenes that make you realize its a lame movie, i loved it, but it was lame, cheesy... Some people won't undersatnd that until they see it... its absolutely hilarious and my friends and i quote it all the time and jove it like the classic \\"You can read minds?\\" Well, thats a cruel but funny scene... I suggest see it and possibly buy it like i did but be prepared to have mixed feelings... <br /> <br />***/***** <br />3 out of 5
0060556501|5.0|My three year old daughter is captivated by this intriguing and beautifully illustrated rendition of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This book has sparked her imagination beyond words! She talks about the \\"white witch\\" during the day, and the poor Mr. Tumnus turned to stone, and is enchanted by every page of this book. We read it every night, every single word. I do not find the text broken up and difficult to follow. The pauses that occur from one page to another allow discussion of the book and create eager anticipation! It has also sparked conversation about God. I really can't say enough good things and encourage all readers to delight in this fantastic fantasy.
0887307280|5.0|I've read the E-myth as part of a business<br /><br />coaching program that my partner and<br /><br />I did. I cannot say enough good things<br /><br />about it.<br /><br />The whole concept of the book is to build<br /><br />a business that eventually can work without<br /><br />you. In other words the part of business building<br /><br />is becoming a business owner not self-employed.<br /><br />In one review a writer Peter Hupalo criticized<br /><br />the book for a myriad of different things.<br /><br />For one he said that most business cannot<br /><br />be systematized. I disagree. I also think<br /><br />that most SHOULD. How many times have you<br /><br />gone in for a haircut and then 3 weeks later<br /><br />go in for another one at the same place with the<br /><br />same stylist and the experience is different!<br /><br />I think all businesses that sell more than once<br /><br />should have a duplicate experience for a customer<br /><br />(Provided that is a good experience).<br /><br />Another thing that Mr. Hupalo knocks, is the idea<br /><br />of a fast food franchise and that most owners work<br /><br />behind the counter. There is a big difference between<br /><br />a lot of people doing something and it being the BEST<br /><br />thing for them to do. What if they could WORK ON their<br /><br />business instead of making the fries? What if they could<br /><br />hire a manager so that they didn't have to do it? And spend<br /><br />more time with their kids? I believe if a 20 year old kid can<br /><br />do it I don't think it is THAT important.<br /><br />Owning a business where you show up and collect a paycheck<br /><br />can be done. But I think the problem doesn't rest in<br /><br />how hard we work or our business but in that organ between our ears.<br /><br />The more I build my business I learn that it is not the business that needs<br /><br />to change but the way I think and view the world. So my recommendation is to read this book and be prepare yourself to shift some paradigms!
0446677450|5.0|Ok. I saw this book displayed in a bookstore some years ago. Opened it. Got interested. Bought it. Couldn't put it down because it made so much sense.  <br /> <br />It gives you a different perspective or, if you are already in the world of investments, an insightful viewpoint. it explains why your house is not an asset--yet why it can  be one, as long as it brings you passive income on a monthly basis. It explains the ignorance of the majority of population to investing. It explains why it's important to do well financially. Because as one wise quote goes, \\"Sure, money doesn't bring you happiness. But poverty doesn't either.\\" <br /> <br />To all you negative reviewers out there--damn it, do you really expect one book to give you all the answers? Go and find the answers yourself. Get educated, watch the news; read up on finance. Find out on your own. This is not an investment bible stocked with advice, nor a Suze Orman type of proclamation, it's an account of a life of one person who was lucky enough to get a great financial education from his best friend's Dad, learned it, applied it, became wealthy, and wants to share the secrets of his success. When was this ever a bad thing to do? <br /> <br />It is an inspiring book. It makes you think. It makes you want to change your financial situation. How many financial books do you know of that make you want to think and figure things out on your own rather than just giving you templates? In your personal financial well-being, there are no templates. This book just gives you a different outlook. See for yourself how it suits you. It clarifies things you instinctively knew; it shines light on things you thought confusing; it gives you a different perspective on what really is a liability and an asset. <br /> <br />Please, do yourself a favor and read this book. It will change your thinking. It's a fairly easy read; it won't take too much of your time--but it might change your financial life completely.
B000006T9M|5.0|Just a quick drop on the ground to all my deceased friends. JOHNNY! We all miss you, see you underground kid!<br /><br />OK, anyway... HIGHWAY TO HELL was the last one by cosmic friend BON SCOTT. The title track was amazingly a fitting title for the mans last album, as he would die tragically by choking on his own vomit less than a year after its release. We are all sure that he must be making it, in the Promised Land, looking over my buddy Uncle J. This album is great.. as are all AC/DC albums. It was the first album to really sell in the U.S. due to the money that went into its production. Compared to earlier albums this one has a lot more polish on it, but it does not hurt the bands integrity at all. The title track was the big single, but there were other big ones here too, TOUCH TO MUCH is sort of like Satans answer to disco (AC/DC has lots of rhythms that are strangely danceable) WALK ALL OVER YOU is another good example. NIGHT PROWLER is a twisted blues jam. BON SCOTT is sleaze rock. He created it. He did it right. God Damn!

Something caught my attention, the music?  The sound of him laughing?  I peeked in, and was hooked. <br /> <br />I love this show!  It's intelligent and wildly entertaining, with wonderful characters, clever scripts, and great music.  Buy the set; you can't watch just one episode.
0553801503|3.0|<br />George R.R. Martin needs an editor.  The successful applicant will possess the ability to pare meandering, bloated prose without sentiment and without regard to the writer's fame and/or publishing clout.  The successful applicant will possess the ability to refine a dull 800-page manuscript into an outstanding 400-page published book, thereby financially benefiting Mr. Martin by producing an accessible and engrossing work. (Position also available for Tom Clancy.) <br /> <br />Seriously, I loved the first three books and I eagerly awaited this one.  Sadly, all of the stylistic excesses of the previous books are present in this book with little of the emotional interest that made those excesses previously forgivable.  Each of these books cries out to be slashed in half; they could have been so transcendent ... <br /> <br />
B00005JO1Y|4.0|The genius Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson, pays homage to his all-time favorite film. Special effects and jaw-dropping adventure make the new remake of King Kong a success in its genre.<br /><br />Adapted from the original story and placed evocatively in the original 1930s, the new Kong also expands the story, giving us new plots and adventures on the expedition, as well as details about the Depression, Broadway and the vaudeville worlds.<br /><br />The result is a dazzling, but very long movie. At three hours and seven minutes, King Kong provides us with the most astonishing special effects ever put on celluloid. Of course, the many moments of action and emotion help propel the stunning spectacle.<br /><br />Though visually stunning, the new Kong isn't totally perfect. Jack Black and Adrien Brody roles were, to my opinion, catastrophically miscast. The first one can't seem to escape his comedic expressions and shallowness, while the second one is just plain boring and depressive. Still, there are enough treats in KK to divert us from wallowing in these not so forgettable mistakes.<br /><br />Three memorable performances give heart and warmth to the film, including Naomi Watts as the heartbreaking Ann Darrow, and Jamie Bell as the sweet offbeat kid Jimmie.<br /><br />The third performance is Kong himself, a character recreated for the computer by Andy Serkis (Gollum in LOTR). Kong is a marvel of emotional expressions. He moves and leaps with boundless energy, he jumps easily onto cliffs and buildings, and easily fights dinosaurs at once. He can show passion for Ann Darrow and then provoke in us the same sadness his eyes portrays once he's taken from his world.<br /><br />Besides Ann, he's one of the other deep characters in the film, and even without a single line to utter, this creature surprisingly has the depth to move us emotionally to the point you just want him to get the girl, in spite of the river of differences that divides these two kindred spirits.wo kindred spirits.
B000AARKOO|1.0|Ridley Scott should have studied David Lean's Laurence of Arabia a little more closely before making this movie. Despite the epic backdrop of Lean's picture, the character of T.E. Laurence is never compromised. The film still feels intimate even though it is loaded with dozens of speaking roles and hundreds of extras.     Kingdom of Heaven, on the other hand, is mired in its own epic-ness. The film has 1,997,301 speaking roles, and not one of these characters is introduced properly or memorable, including the film's protagonist, played by Orlando \\"Legolas\\" Bloom. I suppose a more gifted actor could have shined through the muck, but Bloom, while reliable in supporting roles, is too timid and, frankly, not really a star.  He doesn't say much, either, but, even worse, you get the impression that even if he did say something, it wouldn't be very interesting.     It's like those \\"Where's Waldo?\\" books. You forget to look for Waldo sometimes because there are so many other exciting things to look at. Similarly, Kingdom of Heaven fails because the pretty pictures upstage the characters, and you never really learn to care about or for the protagonist. Everyone, including Bloom, are helplessly swept downstream by the film's raging special effects and sets.

Now I know exactly how some of my favorite films were produced.

0143036556|2.0|This is an important book because a lot of people are reading it, as evidenced by over 200 Amazon reviews of the hardcover version.  The book doesn't deserve its popularity. <br /> <br />Jared Diamond seems to be a nice man.  He likes birds and trees, and knows a lot about them.  He writes nice descriptions of primitive societies.  He is concerned about the environment, and about the future of our society.  He has a PhD in physiology but now teaches geography, a science overrun with greenies.  Whatever his scientific experience may have been, his language is now characteristic of the social scientist:  flabby, with constant use of the conditional tense, weasel words, and speculation. <br /> <br />Diamond is unable or unwilling to elaborate a logical train of thought and doesn't distinguish association from causality.  He would benefit from one of those introductory courses given by philosophy departments called \\"How to Think\\".  And he needs a good editor. <br /> <br />His vignettes of failed societies are interesting, but he gets into trouble as soon as he tries to draw conclusions.  Here is a typical example: <br /> <br />\\"I picture the scene at Gardar as like that in my home city of Los Angeles in 1992 at the time of the so-called Rodney King riots, when the acquittal of policemen on trial for brutally beating a poor person provoked thousands of outraged people from poor neighborhoods to spread out to loot businesses and rich neighborhoods.\\" <br /> <br />So he constructs a picture in his own mind of the last days of the starving Greenlanders, compares them to the Rodney King riots, and then expects us to take him seriously as a social thinker!  This happens repeatedly whenever he gets away from the specifics of his descriptions and tries to draw conclusions from his data.  <br /> <br />His treatment of climate change is equally careless and intellectually dishonest.  In the beginning of the book, on p.12, he lists the known causes of global climate change: changesin solar energy output, the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation, atmospheric dust due to vulcanism, and changes in the land/ocean configuration due to continental drift, never mentioning greenhouse gas levels.  However, on p.492, as he gets to his conclusions and starts to talk about global warming, his previous discussion of the major causes of climate change are forgotten.  Human production of greenhouse gases and Bush-bashing are the only subjects worthy of discussion. <br /> <br />For some obscure reason he makes up a new word, \\"reafforestation\\", using it several times before reverting to \\"reforestation\\" in the appendices.  \\"Reafforestation\\" isn't in the dictionary.  He has combined \\"afforestation\\" and \\"reforestation\\" to make a non-word.  A good editor could have helped him here. <br /> <br />On p.425 he says, \\"Politicians use the term 'creeping normalcy' to refer to such slow trends concealed within noisy fluctuations.\\"  Well, no, Jared, politicians don't use the term, YOU do:  A Google search shows you originated the phrase.  Why blame it on the politicians?  I suppose it's a way of trying to disarm critics, but it just seems stupid to me.  And, by the way, the frog in the pot of water will try to jump out when it gets too hot, just like a human.  <br /> <br />In the final section he tries to refute what he calls \\"one-liner objections\\" to his thesis, but I don't know how anyone can object to his theses because he never presents one clearly.  Deforestation, water pollution, soil depletion, racism, war, disease, are all bad, Diamond tells us, and most reasonable people will agree.  But what are we to do about these things?  Balaguer shot loggers in the Dominican Republic and the Tokugawa shogunate enforced its forestry laws via a police state.  Diamond disapproves of these methods, but the only alternative he presents is a wordy version of that famous political philosopher Rodney King's plaint, \\"Can't we all just get along?\\" <br /> <br />All I can say is, when the collapse comes I won't call Dr. Diamond. <br /> <br />Zero stars for the actual book, two stars because a lot of people are reading it.
1400031087|1.0|As a \\"memoir\\" this book is a total failure. I have heard that Frey wanted to market this book as a novel. In an era of \\"Reality\\" programming fakery, the only reason Frey's publisher touted it as a \\"non-fiction\\" book was to get it on the best seller list (with a little help from a naive Oprah). The strategy seemed to work. <br /> <br />Novels of addiction are plentiful, memoirs are always subject to doubt. Not having any anaesthetic during dental surgery is about as far as the truth can be stretched (to point to just one \\"Piece\\" of Frey's Million). <br /> <br />Some of the writing is just plain dull. It's of the \\"See-Spot-run school.\\" See Spot get high. See Spot get arrested. See Spot act tough. See Spot go through de-tox, etc. <br /> <br />For a better memoir on recovery, try Augusten Burroughs's \\"Dry.\\" No one has proven him a liar yet, but at least he can write sentences and form paragraphs. <br /> <br />Another memoir of note is Jim Carroll's \\"Basketball Diaries.\\" <br />At least there is some poetry behind Carroll's prose. This you can't make up. <br />  <br />The William Burroughs classics \\"Junky\\" and \\"Naked Lunch\\" are also more jarring and realistic than any memoir could be.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|That headline is written on the album's back cover.  It gives you a pretty good idea what to expect on this disc.  The lyrics are the usual \\"I am such a tortured soul!\\" stuff characteristic of Depeche Mode and similar bands like NIN.    The single \\"Precious\\" is about a band member's divorce and is written to his child.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good song, but it's very much a typical DM song.  It sounds similar to \\"Policy of Truth,\\" though another listener might remark that it sounds similar to a few other DM hits.  That single is still the best song on this album, and is track number 5.  Most of the good radio-friendly songs are on the first 5 tracks, and the rest of the album contains the dark, meandering, overlong tracks.    Most songs do tend to be the same sort of \\"I'm such a sinner\\" lyrics and, when no vocals are present, they tend to dwell too much on sound effects and many songs are too long.  However, the songs and lyrics are indeed very dark, which can be good or bad depending on what you're doing and what mood you're in.  This is the sort of music that would be absolutely perfect for a gaming soundtrack!  Imagine if the game Quake came with such a soundtrack back in the day.  Actually I think it did come with a NIN soundtrack now that I think of it, but I had the pirated version back in the day, so I didn't get the music that came with that game.  I don't play video games anymore anyways.  But I am digressing.    This album is excellent for gaming background music but probably isn't so great in the car (unless you're high) or at work.  Soon I'll get around to listening to DM's breakout album, \\"Violator,\\" which is the grail of DM albums (of original release material) from what I've heard.  \\"Violator\\" has \\"Personal Jesus,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" and \\"Policy of Truth\\" on it and is only 9 songs long.  \\"Playing the Angel\\" has 12 songs, half of which go on too long.

Unfortunately, I can't find another way to send feedback to the reviewers. <br /> <br />I've found it so very odd that all the reviewers of a French text have written their reviews in English. None addresses the advantages of the original text over a translation. So my question is: have any of you read the French version or are you reviewing the English text?  <br /> <br />I am not trying to question your proficiency in  French, but I suspect the Amazon system may be lumping all reviews together without regard for the particular version or edition reviewed.

He showed wit, anger, compassion, and understanding.<br /><br />This is definately worth every penney to add to your collection. It reminds us all that we should be thankful to all of our veterans for their courage and strength.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|Many people are understandably angry that this is now out in a new-fangled boxed-set edition and while that IS sort of cheesy on HBO's part, I think the focus should be on the show itself and not the packaging.  I own the original plastic-cased editions as many others do and that's fine because the episodes are all the same.  There may be some slight extras in the new set but really, the episodes are the important thing, no?<br /><br />Sex and the City was a very addictive show with both relatable and non-relatable story lines and characters.  I think that on some level, if you were a big fan of the show, you found something in each of the women to relate to at some point in time - especially, if like me, you were a single girl in her 30s living in New York City when this show was airing regularly.  I do admit that much of what was portrayed was a bit far-fetched and shallow at times but as a show, it was very funny for what it was and quite entertaining.  The women were a bit self-centered, yes, but they were also compilations of many types of women out there and at least they were each independent and educated.  While many of us could or couldn't relate to, say,  Carrie's clothing and shoe addiction (I have that one) or Samantha's voracious sexuality, for example, the show really was a nice retrospective of what could possibly happen to any one of us or, in some cases, what actually has happened to any one of us, and in other cases, what would likely never happen to any one of us (for instance, having a famous artist sketch and paint your c**t for a gallery exhibit of c**ts, or having your one-night stand leave $1,000 on the nightstand before ditching you).<br /><br />Personally, I loved that the series was filmed in New York City because it showed the rest of the world just how amazing NYC is.  And also, that it emphasized the friendship aspect of these women over time (considering we've all known women who drop their girlfriends whenever a man shows up).  As unrealistic as it was that these four career women had so much free time to spend with each other, the basic core of their friendship was most important and meaningful and was the heart of what carried the show through all of the seasons.<br /><br />So, to offer my two cents, I say that if you don't already own the series (or if you are a serious collector), then this is the set for you.  But if you already own the original editions, I would keep them.  They fit on the shelf nicely with all of your other DVDs, they are the same episodes in the same order anyway so why pay all of that money for what you already own.  HBO doesn't need the dough, the girls don't exactly need the royalties and you could probably use it on something else - like cute new shoes or a boxed set of some other series you love and don't already own.p).

0553801503|3.0|I absolutely loved books 1-3. They were page turning masterpieces that kept you enthralled throughout.<br /><br />So what happened to book 4 and Martin?<br /><br />First off, gone are Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and Stannis. In this book we are left with Cersei and Jaime (who are getting less interesting), Victarion Greyjoy, Euron Greyjoy, Brienne, Samwell and Arya.<br /><br />Its tough enough when Martin kills the interesting characters. But when he removes the remaining interesting characters which are still 'alive' for book 5, than it becomes a problem...<br /><br />Brienne easily takes up 1/6 of this book and her story goes nowhere. She hunts here, she hunts there, finds out she has gone someplace for nothing, turns back, finds a new clue, goes there... yawn. All for her chivalrous 'oath.'<br /><br />Then we have Arya, who was always interesting, watered down into uninteresting chapters. She has an entire chapter solely devoted to selling clams and mussels. 20 pages on who buys her seafood!<br /><br />The only thing i really liked about this book was the buildup and whispering/rumor talk about dragons across the sea. I really cant wait until Dany lands in Westeros...<br /><br />Still, this book is falling just like so many other fantasy writers. They know they have a goldmine and try to milk their series for its all worth, by making up new sublots, new characters, and new books... all of which strain their series too thin and that no one cares to read about.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is an excellent example of a movie done the right way. An imaginative idea, a well written script with a mix of action, emotion and humor and a good cast to carry it all off. <br /> <br />Serenity is the name of a ship with a crew of semi-outlaws who have been protecting a doctor and his young sister River who is telepathic and has been severely damaged psychologically by the Alliance as they used behavior modification to turn her into a weapon. The crew is about to let her and her brother behind because they have become a hindrance, when they get a look at what she can do. She is subliminally induced into another state and proceeds to beat the living crap out of a room full of men in a bar. Before going into her fighting state she said the word \\"Miranda\\". They find out Miranda is a planet and decide they must go there and discover the secret behind what the Alliance is doing. To do this they must get through the Reavers, humans that have gone mad and become cannibals. Add to this an assassin from the Alliance who is tracking them to get the girl back to continue their experiments on her. <br /> <br />Serenity is exciting, funny and beautiful to look at. It takes little time for the movie to draw you into its world and have you care about the crew and what happens to them. The special effects are excellent and the fight scene between River and the Reavers is worth the price of admission alone.
0060763280|1.0|A friend bought the book and we went together to the seminar. The biggest waste of time ever. I have lost a great deal of respect for others in the field who recommend this con-man.

B000AL730O|4.0|One of the overlooked CDs from this year. Maybe it will win CD of the year from the critics, but this CD did not receive much if any mainstream radio airplay. I guess that's what happens when record companies and radio are all about the marketing. If Paul were 25 and this were his first CD he would be called the next Bob Dylan. This is his best work in years. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is the most beautiful song I have heard in many moons. Buy this or somehow listen to it because this is good music.

B000006TRV|3.0|\\"The Wall\\" was a very ambitious project.  2/3 of the album is quality Pink Floyd.  The rest is, to be nice, NOT.   <br />Pro's: Excellent music on every song (occaisionally shaky lyrics) <br />Intelligent story, very bold on Roger Water's part to tell his own story. <br />Full length songs.  They incorporated Pink Floyd's flowing style and genius lyrics, Especially \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". <br /> <br />Con's: The story is not clear enough.  Unless somebody tells it to you, it is very muddled. <br />The short songs.  They are only there to briefly fill people in on the story, and are very rushed.  Except Vera, it's very good.
0792151712|1.0|This is like the most over-hyped movie in the history of cinema. How could a guy who brought us such great hits as Terminator, Aliens, and True Lies have made this stinker? <br /> <br />From the beginning, I questioned why this movie even needed to be made. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. The boat crashes and sinks. Yes, that's a horrible disaster but it can hardly become a story, let alone a 3+ hour movie.  <br /> <br />So we have a contrived story then. Rich, snobby white girl meets poor, grubby creep, sees the good in him, rejects her good-girl upbringing and joins the dark side. She becomes a promiscuous tramp, and she does it for love. <br /> <br />So basically what we are saying here is that this movie has virtually the same plot as \\"Grease\\". Only a heck of a lot more boring, with no cool music, 50's cars, or leather jackets. <br /> <br /> <br />I find it interesting that evidenced by this movies' stunning box-office sales, many Christians seemed to have no problem with the morality that it protrayed. A girl meets a guy, has a good time, decides that she likes him, strips for him, gets horny, and the next thing you know they are having sex in the back seat of a car - literally. (What the heck was a car doing on the Titanic anyway? But I digress...)  <br /> <br />This is considered \\"TRUE LOVE\\". In other words, what would be called a quite sleazy one-night stand in any other context is here embraced as a love story, apparently because some expensive jewelry and a dead artist are involved. If you take out the necklace and the handsome dead guy, you've basically got the same plot as a typical \\"Penthouse Letters\\" magazine story. <br /> <br />It just goes to show you how fleeting the morality of the religious types in this country truly is. Apparently, morality is only important when it is convenient. If it gets in the way of telling a so-called \\"love\\" story, then it can be ignored. We can overlook the fact that they shacked up before they got married, because it waslove right? It must have been true love, because we have a necklace to prove it. (A STOLEN necklace, by the way. Must have cost the guy a lot, huh?) Also, what woman would have obsessed over a guy for 50 years after the fact if it wasn't true love? It MUST be true love. Heck, it's romantic right? So let's forget all this morality stuff. <br /> <br />Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm all for consenting adults doing whatever it is they want to do. I just can't stand the hypocrisy of people who want to tell us how great this movie is on a Saturday night, then head for church on a Sunday morning. I mean, give me a break. I'm not THAT dumb. <br /> <br /> <br />Even if you love this movie, if you're honest with yourself then you've got to admit that it is just a teeny bit over-hyped. Come on, admit it! <br /> <br />I have yet to meet a guy who really likes this movie. All men I know who have seen it did it as a favor to their significant other. They watched a chick flick to keep their woman happy. In that regard, this wouldn't be a bad movie if only it were not so dad-gum long. <br /> <br />After this movie, I couldn't stand pretty-boy Leonardo Di'Caprio for the longest time. Mainly because of all the women I saw fawning over him because of this movie. It was only when I saw \\"The Aviator\\" that the man redeemed himself in my eyes. As an actor, he truly did an outstanding job in that movie. <br /> <br />My recommendation: Watch a documentary about the Titanic instead. It will be much more interesting, minus the sleaze.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|THE BROTHERS GRIMM follows two traveling German brothers, one a believer and one a naysayer, who spin fairytales to swindle villagers, but run afoul of a French general and are forced to take on a real fairytale. That's the plot, but the scenery and bizarre humor are much more fun. <br /> <br />Director Terry Gilliam, of the Monty Python camp, picked up this script and decided to give it some extra oomph. Gilliam insists this is not a movie about the real Grimm brothers or their tales. Not really, just slightly. This interview, plus deleted scenes and behind the scenes clips of muddy geese wranglers are on the additional disk of goodies. <br /> <br />The medieval styled costuming and textured, atmospheric scenery are a visual treat. The German village complete with wandering geese and a communal well, looks authentically grubby and worn at the edges, and the enchanted forest is suitably foreboding with crows and gnarled trees that stand up on their roots and move. There are tantalizing glimpses of real Grimm fairytales when we see Little Red Riding Hood and Gretel venturing through the forest. The Pythonesque humor, such as the string quartet in the dungeon to accompany Cavali, the torture \\"artiste,\\" while he works, is satisfyingly dark and witty. <br /> <br />To improve viewing pleasure, Heath Ledger could have worked on his articulation. Luckily, Ledger's aptitude for physical comedy makes up for his mumbling. <br /> <br />Fairy tales can be grotesque, and THE BROTHERS GRIMM is no exception with some exceptional imagery of kidnappings of small girls. Despite the fact that this is not a horror movie full of gore, parents should take note of the PG-13 rating and not use this movie as a babysitting device for young children. For adults, anyone who enjoys well executed period settings and the black humor of Monty Python will find this a pleasing DVD to watch once in a while. <br />
0897500482|5.0|Excellent guide to Bruce Lee's thinking and approach to training. Many of his ideas are pretty widespread now, and I don't think he gets enough credit for literally changing the way people approached martial arts thanks to his influence.
B000255LIY|3.0|I'm such a big fan of the 1968 version, I was really leery of watching this, but I'm not sorry I did.  The costumes and the set of the castle of Chinon are wonderful.  I thought Glenn Close was every bit as good as Katherine Hepburn - they are different actresses of course, but I admired Glenn Close's performance just as much.  I really liked Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as King Philip -- his performance is excellent.  And I appreciated the way all the characters delivered their lines in this teleplay - for the most part, their delivery was natural, and the words flowed like actual conversation; less like a \\"play\\", with more reality.<br /><br />BUT. I had a problem with Patrick Stewart's performance.  It's good enough, as far as performances go. I kept trying not to compare it with Peter O'Toole's, but I missed that triumphant bellowing, that presence, the \\"oomph\\".  I thought Patrick Stewart was a little too down-key - perhaps too reserved.  He has such a marvelous voice, I would have liked him to use it to its best effect. In the quiet scenes, he's OK, but he really needed to turn on the juice for the anger, the hurt at John's betrayal, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't care for the actors who played Richard, Geoffrey and John.  None of these performances stood out, except perhaps the Geoffrey character was successful in showing the hurt he suffered from his parents' ignoring him all his life.  He was twisted (as he's referred to in the teleplay) by this neglect, and at least a viewer has a sense of that from this performance.  But on a whole, the actors who played the sons in the 1968 film gave much better performances.<br /><br />All in all, I liked this teleplay, but I love the 1968 version.  That's the one I have to wholeheartedly recommend.
B000002UD0|5.0|This has always been my favorite John Lennon album because the production is fantastic and the songwriting is ecclectic and creative... <br /> <br />I also believe that this is probably the most consistent post solo-Beatle release because of all fab four post solo recordings, the album's production is flawless... <br /> <br />In 1973, Lennon told Rolling Stone that he had really enjoyed Paul's Band on the Run because he felt it was conceptual... thus, I've entertained the possibility that this album is in part, a response to Band on the Run because it displays conceptualism  and ecclectisism.  <br /> <br />Like Band on the Run, Walls and Bridges displays The Beatles' unique ability to go from beautiful lush ballads to rocking rockers... at times, I feel like I'm listening to the White Album....the pentatonic 'Going Down on Love' tracks to the up-tempo, brisk, jazzy 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night'... then, there's the soft Harry Nilson assisted number 'Old Dirt Road'... then John immidiately answers this mellow country song with 'What You Got' (which feels kind of like 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey') and so on ... it has been suggested that John's '#9 Dream' was a subconscious tribute to George... I love this album because I feel that John is in harmony with his other Beatle compatriots  and that he's no longer bitter with his past like he was on Plastic Ono Band..  'Surprise Surprise' with Elton John even has a quotation from a Beatle's song... see if you can guess what it is...!!! <br /> <br />This is the first post Beatles album that really really sounds like something the Beatles would have been truly worthy of producing (unlike Band on the Run that although was a milestone for Paul only sustained mediocre production!!!) <br /> <br />This is also a fun album and along with All Things Must Pass and Tug of War, it stands as the best produced post Beatles recording.. If you're a Beatle's fan but think that there wasn't any good solo Beatle's album.... sit down on a quiet Sunday evening with a friend or two in front of a fire with some hot cocoa, sit back, and enjoy a great album!!!
B000002AGB|5.0|Never has a band put on such a show.  No band at any venue will ever top this, and I saw the Stones last night.<br /><br />I may be a bit biased, I think the Who are the greatest band of all time, but trying to look at this objectively, this performance is the reason people remember the Isle of Wight festival 1970.  Sure, Hendrix is an amazing guitarist, and Tull was great, but the energy on these two discs is worth at least double the price.<br /><br />Anyway, now for something useful.  If you liked Tommy and you liked Leeds, then you will love this performance.  It's like the best of both albums.  The Tommy set at this concert was enough to leave the crowd of 600,000 in awe.<br /><br />Tommy aside, the final track, Magic Bus, is a wonder within itself.  Nothing like the Leeds version, this cut has the most incredible harmonica solo I've ever heard roaring over the equally impressive instruments behind it.  And this comes from a true Dylan fan.  In addition to the classics, such as I Can't Explain and Heaven and Hell, there is a great My Generation/Muddy Waters/Twist n Shout medley.  As if this wasn't enough, some lesser known hits, particularly Water, is enough to leave you speechless.<br /><br />The only reason not to buy this album is because there is a DVD.  Watch it.  I did three times in a row.  This is good stuff.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I managed to get a subtitled version and I can not begin to tell you how much I love it!!!!!<br /><br />This movie is so good and wastes no time getting to the point.<br /><br />And for all of you who are fans of the Turks (like myself), rejoice; they have a major role and are just as cool as one would have hoped!<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it actually puts to rest lots of questions left open at the conclusion of the game.<br /><br />Buy it!!
B000002OVJ|4.0|If this were the only live Who album ever recorded, than this would be a five (or maybe six) star review but, in the same year, 1970, the Who also played at the Isle of Wight festival, making the concert famous forever.  Check it out. <br /> <br />Not saying this is a bad album, because before I got Isle of Wight, this was on my stereo at least three times a week.  Like any live Who album, except the Royal Albert Hall, it's a wonder these gods, I mean musicians, can create such an unbelievable sound.  Quite honestly, this is the best group of musicians ever put into one band, and when let loose, you get Leeds.  The musical abilities finally get the justice they deserve, the chance that isn't found anywher on a studio album. <br /> <br />IN SHORT, this one disc collection is a must for the casual fan, <br /> <br />                                 but <br /> <br />the hardcore Who fan needs the delux edition, which includes Tommy, or the Isle of Wight
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis was the phenomenon which started the great rock and roll movement and i am quite fond of his songs like all shook up and hound dog ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|The whole cd is kick ass. My personal favourite is number 11 (Battle of One), they seriously need to make more songs like this on their next cd. The whole copy-protected thing, for some reason isn't on my cd! Just buy it already.

True or False:  zombies are afraid of fire <br />Answers:  1. d crowbar  2. b. military complex 3. False 4. True 5. False <br /> <br />This quiz doesn't even begin to cover the topics explored in the ZSG, but my friend if you answered even one of those five questions incorrectly, it signals that you do indeed have some serious gaps in your knowledge. The ZSG is a good primer for preparing yourself for that inevitable day when the undead rise with an insatiable appetite for fresh human flesh; not a complete education by any means, but it will point you in the right direction for further educating and training yourself in the event of Class1, 2, and/or 3 outbreaks.  At the very least, the ZSG outlines some indispensable plans as well as supply and equipment lists for various survival and tactical scenarios. <br /> <br />The final section of the book contains synopses of recorded zombie attacks thoughout history.  From @ 60,000 BC in Central Africa to 2002 AD U.S. Virgin Islands, the stories of more than fifty documented attacks and outbreaks are summarized here chronologically for our convenience.  What we can learn from reading this section is how various people either survived or failed to eliminate their zombies.  Knowing what worked (and what didn't) can give us greaterunderstanding of our undead foe. It also underscores the importance of following the recommendations outlined in previous chapters of the ZSG to prevent the further spread of the virus (oh, you didn't even know it was a virus?  Then you're really in deep without this book!). <br /> <br />A footnote to scriptwriters here:  many needless deaths - and undeaths - may have been prevented if so many Hollywood  zombie movies had not spread misinformation among the world's population.  IF you wish to better serve mankind, as well as write a logistically accurate zombie screenplay, you should consider using the ZSG as your production \\"bible\\".  Just a thought... <br /> <br />If you are the type of person who believes in readying for emergencies such as fires and earthquakes, then why wouldn't you safeguard yourself and your loved ones against the statistically realistic possibility of zombie attacks. Absolutely every home should have a copy the Zombie Survival Guide! <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Kreator is back and with a vengeance. Enemy of God has got to be one of the best thrash albums released in the past 10 years. Everything on this album blends together so well. Really this is a perfect thrash album. No fillers in this one. Clocking in at about 55-56 minutes, this is the longest metal album I've heard in a long time. And with 12 songs here you're getting a good cd. Here's a song by song review. <br /> <br />1. Enemy of God - 10/10...great song with some killer guitar work. <br />2. Impossible Brutality - 10/10 - the single off of the album. We all know this one rules. <br />3. Suicide Terrorist - 10/10 - an instant classic. This song is wicked as hell. <br />4. World Anarchy - 10/10 - cool sounding chorus. Just a killer song. <br />5. Dystopia - 10/10 - ALL HAIL DYSTOPIA!!! Awesome song. <br />6.Voices of the Dead - 10/10 - great song with a catchy chorus. One of my favorite tracks. <br />7. Murder Fantasies - 10/10/ - an awesome song. This song has my favorite lyrics off the album.  <br />8. When Death Takes It's Dominion - 10/10 - yet another great song. <br />9. One Evil Comes - A Million Follow - 10/10 - and the thrash keeps on coming. <br />10. Dying Race Apocalypse - 10/10 - great intro on this song. Just awesome. <br />11. Under A Total Blackened Sky - 10/10 - UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE WE HAVE TO LIVE BENEATH A BLACKENED SKY!!! This song is a classic.  <br />12. The Ancient Plague - 10/10 - Perfect closing track. I love this song. It's just pure metal. <br /> <br />Overall this is a wicked thrash album. Kreator does it again. If you liked this one also see Exodus new one \\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\\" Long Live Kreator! <br /> <br />\m/
B000002U82|5.0|I've read through some of these reviews and I have noticed a pattern concerning the 1 star reviews...  They're all from kids. <br /> <br />Honestly, the first time I heard this, I thought it was weird, a lot of it boring, and I didn't get it; however, after I watched the Pink Floyd Live 8 reunion, I became absolutely hooked.  You really do have to be musically mature to get this.  I just reached that point after turning 18, myself.  I had heard this was the greatest album ever made, and now I understand why.  It's timeless, about the pressures of everyday life and how they can turn one to madness.  The albums of Pink Floyd's golden period all had a quality that they would acknowledge some faults of the world, and not offer a solution, but hope that things will turn out all right in the end.  The music accompanies one through the pressures of life. <br /> <br />Dark Side of the Moon and Pink Floyd in general have completely changed my life, my view of the world, and has also made me want to take up the guitar, which I have taught myself.  I play a Fender Stratocaster like David Gilmour.  Before I became obsessed with Pink Floyd I never paid attention to lyrics in music.  I mostly listened to Jazz.  The pleasing sound of Pink Floyd drew me in and the lyrics that really make one think are what got me hooked. <br /> <br />I'd also like to recommend The Wall (A VERY close second to this album to me), Animals, Wish You Were Here, Meddle...  oh and to the kid who said Ummagumma was their debut album..  it wasnt...  each member was given an LP side with which to experiment, so they could find themselves artisitically, but their first album was actually The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. <br /> <br />I can only hope you kids will one day understand the pure greatness of Dark Side of the Moon.  I one day tried to think of ways it could be improved..  I had nothing, it is absolutely perfect.  Oh, and Pink Floyd isnt really stoner music..  Roger Waters once said \\"You don't have tobe stoned to enjoy our stuff. But it can help.\\" <br /> <br />I'll see you on the Dark Side of the Moon..
B00008OLIO|4.0|my only complaint is the way that vince sings on with the show, it sounds out of tune, but other than that, great cd. highly recommended
0671027573|5.0|This is probably my favorite Linda Howard book and I have read them all.  Sam is rough and sexy and Jaine is very entertaining.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say, is that it became a little emotionally draining when all her friends kept getting killed off.  One would have been enough.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes have diversified and explored entirely new ground on their latest album, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\".  In comparison with their earlier releases; \\"Is this it\\" (2001) and \\"Room on fire\\" (2003); \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" offers the listener an entirely different sound and far more expansive content.   <br />In this latest offering the diversity of tempos and melodies is far greater and new themes, such as depression, fear and paranoia, are explored through the lyrics.  In contrast with previous releases, the cleaner sound ensures that frontman Julian Casablancas' pensive and at times dejected vocals are front and centre.  The album's first single, \\"Juicebox\\" utilises amazing riffs and an undoubtedly retro sound while the opening track, \\"You only live once\\" is as infectious as it is melodic.   <br />Overall \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" showcases the development that the entire band has undergone and confirms that the Strokes are still the very last word in garage rock.   <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|It amuses me to read the customer reviews for this album.  People who like it point to the energy of the title track, the style changes in \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" and the quality of the lyrics and emotion throughout.  Reviewers who don't like the album are mostly those who can't spell and whose only argument is some form of \\"GrEEN day SUX there songs r ALL THE SAME y dont u listen to REAL music like MEGADETH!!!.\\"  I notice that many of these people are using the review form for children under the age of 13.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong - the album isn't perfect, and I can see what some listeners would dislike about it.  And I have nothing against Megadeth.  But I'd like to answer to the critics who complain that Green Day's music is too simple, that they only use power chords, and that it's, like, so easy to pick up a guitar and play their songs:  that's how it's supposed to be.  They have written hundreds of songs using less than half as many chords.  I think they are perfect in their simplicity, so talented that they don't show it - and they are the only band that can truly pull it off.  Forget what they wear or what they do offstage; if we shunned every artist with poor morals we'd be left with freakin Clay Aiken.  <br /> <br />I've had \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" stuck in my head for weeks; the tempo changes and lyrics are just great.  Listen to the way the energy shifts during \\"Wake me up When September Ends\\" - indicative of emotional turmoil.  Sometimes you can read a lot from something inherently simple.   <br /> <br />So if you want a strong political message, you'd better stick to Barack instead of Billie Joe - he does tend to bash the President for the sole purpose of getting a good cheer.  And if you truly care about the punk scene (which I do not), then an obscure, out-of-tune garage band might better suit your taste.  I don't mind that Green Day's newest album is more mainstream, and whenever something comes on the radio that isn't Jessica Simpson, I appreciate it.
0440241588|2.0|Not the John Grisham I used to like. This was formulaic, and it seemed as if the author were writing with an eye toward having this made into a movie thriller. Except...um...it wasn't thrilling. I just couldn't care all that much what happened to Backman. Very little character development in ANY character. <br /> <br />It'll kill time on the beach or while traveling, but it'll be pretty easy to put down when it's time to go to bed at night.

B00005JOFO|5.0|At the center of Brokeback Mountain is that love does not make one's life happy and can be a curse rather than a blessing.  This is at the core of the relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist who have a love that is painful in the long separations and impossible to fulfill because it is a forbidden love.  Brokeback Mountain is filled with powerful performances but it clearly is Heath Ledger's film.  His character (Ennis Del Mar) is the focus as he goes from his days herding sheep with Jack, to his marriage, the birth of his daughters, his divorce and attempt to live with his love for Jack while pretending they are just fishing buddies.  Ennis is a brooding character of few words who prefers to suffer in silence.  Heath Ledger is truly remarkable in his ability to convey the emotional depths of his character with facial expression and body language alone.  Jake Gyllenhaal is equally excellent as Jack Twist, giving us a restlessness that comes into conflict with the acceptance of Ennis that their time together is limited to the infrequent fishing trips.  The scenes between Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are among the best on film for their emotional range and how well they can convey the hope and fears that each character has for the other. <br /> <br />Ang Lee has directed a sensitive and full portrait of a doomed love in small town Wyoming where Ennis and Jack face the potentially lethal encounter with those who would rather lynch homosexuals rather than attempt a peaceful existence.   Ennis recalled the murder of a gay man when he was a boy and was taken to the corpse by his father, probably to act as a warning.  The editing of the film was of interest to me because many of the scenes are of short duration and convey some little detail about the characters, just a moment of time that may seem trivial but adds a detail.  Brokeback Mountain is well told in its presentation and is beautifully filmed.  This is a film that one remembers and things about for avery long time. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000002KK2|5.0|This has got to be one of the best debut albums of all time.  Released in 1979, it features song after song that tell unique, funny, and sometimes sad stories with a cast of characters you won't soon forget.  Jones' songwriting and delivery are stunning.  \\"Night Train\\", about a mother fearing her child will be taken away, will break your heart - - as will \\"Company\\" and \\"Last Chance Texaco\\".  \\"Chuck E's In Love\\", \\"Easy Money\\" and \\"Danny's Old Star Joint\\" will make you smile, and \\"Coolsville\\" will haunt you.  A great album that sounds as good today as it did back in 1979.
B000001GS4|5.0|Most listeners will come for the Tchaikovsky First Concerto and stay for the two-piano version of the Nutrcracker Suite. I think it should be the other way around. Argerich is a great devotee of piano duets, of course, and has had many partners over the years. In this 1983 performance she found the best of all in Nicolas Economou, the gifted Cypriot pianist and composer who died tragically in a car accident. Their partnership sounds as if one inspired musician were playing, which is the highest praise one can give a duo. It's a unique, celebratory reading.<br /><br />The piano concerto, recorded live in 1994, begins with the most thrilling first movement I ever hope to hear--not only is Argerich at her spontaneous best, but Abbado joins her in a rip-roaring orchestral accompaniment with the Berlin Phil. It really is a sahme that DG's sonics are cramped and clattery, but they hardly matter. The last two movements I would say are decidedly lower in inspiration, and the finale in particular seems to find Argerich doing nothing special beyond, of course, playing in first-rate style. Still, I will return many times to this Nutcracker (too bad there's only 20 min. of it!).
0307276902|1.0|A blown up exaggeration from trivial events from his past...  Should be under fiction... <br /> <br />Excerpt from an extensive investigation by The Smoking Gun into Frey's past. Red the the whole story with police reports and interviews at: <br />  <br />[...] <br /> <br />\\"While on foot patrol at about 11 PM on October 24, Dudgeon was standing in front of a knick-knack store called the Tole House when he spotted a 1989 white Mercury pull out of a nearby bank parking lot. The driver then attempted to park in a no parking zone directly across the street from the Granville firehouse and a few doors down from a bar/pizzeria popular with Denison students. The vehicle's right front tire rolled up onto the curb, missing a power pole by just a few inches. <br /> <br />[Click here to see a photo of the Ohio crime scene, complete with arrows showing the path of Frey's Mercury. TSG snapped the image last month in Granville.] <br /> <br />Dudgeon, then 32 and on the Granville force for 3-1/2 years, approached the car and told Frey that he was in a no parking zone. Dudgeon noticed that Frey was slurring his words, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and he smelled of alcohol. There was also a half-full, 12-ounce bottle of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer between the car's bucket seats. After Frey exited the Mercury at Dudgeon's request, the cop administered several field sobriety tests, which Frey failed. Dudgeon then arrested the 23-year-old. Since Dudgeon was on foot, a second cop came and drove Frey the few blocks to police headquarters. There, Patrolman Charles Maneely reported, Frey declined to take a blood alcohol test. <br /> <br />Since headquarters did not have a cell or any kind of secured holding area, Cartnal explained, Frey would have been placed in a paneled room with chairs and a fold-up table upon which sat the department's Breathalyzer machine. And Frey would not have been handcuffed unless he was being unruly, added Cartnal <br /> <br />Frey was issued two traffic tickets, one for driving under the influence and another for driving without a license, and a separate misdemeanor criminal summons for having that open container of Pabst. He was directed to appear in Mayor's Court in 10 days. Frey was then released on $733 cash bond, according to the report, which was written at 4 AM on October 25. So, Frey's time in custody did not exceed five hours. <br /> <br />To review: <br /> <br />There was no patrolman struck with a car. <br /> <br />There was no urgent call for backup. <br /> <br />There was no rebuffed request to exit the car. <br /> <br />There was no \\"You want me out, then get me out.\\" <br /> <br />There was no \\"f'ing Pigs\\" taunt. <br /> <br />There were no swings at cops. <br /> <br />There was no billy club beatdown. <br /> <br />There was no kicking and screaming. <br /> <br />There was no mayhem. <br /> <br />There was no attempted riot inciting. <br /> <br />There were no 30 witnesses. <br /> <br />There was no .29 blood alcohol test. <br /> <br />There was no crack. <br /> <br />There was no Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Assaulting an Officer of the Law, Felony DUI, Disturbing the Peace, Resisting Arrest, Driving Without Insurance, Attempted Incitement of a Riot, Possession of a Narcotic with Intent to Distribute, or Felony Mayhem.\\" <br /> <br />
B000001GQD|5.0|There is nearly unanimous consensus that Richter's 1959 recording of the Rachmaninov 2nd rises to a height challenged only by the composer himself. Richter's ability to play the fastest passagework while moving from soft to loud and back again is breathtaking--speed doesn't change his control over dynamics one bit. But that's to pick out a single aspect of a performance that is by turns noble, lyrical, passionate, and poetic. One could spend the whole performance marveling just at the independence of Richter's two hands. He rescues this thrice-familiar work from its fulsome reputation. Rowicki conducts well, but the recorded sound is thin, and the Warsaw Phil. decidedly provincial. None of which matters a bit.<br /><br />Reviewers here echo the Amazon critic in disparaging the Tchaikovsky First from 1963, although it is in better sound than the Rchmaninov and played better by the orchestra, too--Karajan had a special relationship with the Vienna Sym., a sorry ensemble under most conductors. I like this performance a great deal. Richter isn't highly individual--he plays for strength and dignity in the first movement, not for Horowitz's burn-down-the-house virtuosity, and in the last movement he applies restrained delicacy. Since the Tchaikovsky First is  the deadest of dead horses to me, I liked hearing such thoughtful musicality. As for Richter and Karajan being on different pages, they sound together to me. Taste, what can you say? Five stars for both performances.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|This might just be the most boring movie I have ever seen.  It would be a real close race between this one, Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers, and Swimming Pool.  Do you see a trend forming here?  All of these movies were \\"Focus Features\\" films.  I have given up with these title and will most likely stay away from Focus features in the future.  What the critics seem to call artistic, and visionary, I just find absolutely mind-numbingly boring.
0679746048|3.0|Like many other people, I read this book after watching the movie with Winona Ryder.That was a big mistake, since the book hasn't have a plot. No Daisy committing suicide, no Lisa running away with Susanna, no affairs with male nurses etc,etc.. <br />However, this book deals with a young girl's quest to know what is really happenning to her during her stay at Claymore.She explores aspects of her illness as she takes the reader into the world of mental patients.Descriptions of her daily experiences at this mental Institute, her ordeal after \\"losing\\" an entire year of her life locked up make this book a very interesting account of what goes on in the world of psychiatry.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon has a deeper meaning to it. If thought about it is based on the Veitnam War. Speak To Me/Breathe is when a solder is shoot. On the run symbolises him being picked up a by helicopter to medical facility <br />Time is when he is on the opperating table. The great gig in the sky is a senario of whart happens next, This sennario is that you die. Next is MONEY which is about why we have war the answer money. Us and them is about different perspectives fo the war. Any Colour you like is about how the government trys to calm people. Brain Damage is anothewr senario where you r mentally distraught after your surgery. Finnaly there is Eclipse in whish you are in a coma if you barley suviver your operation. <br /> <br />Buying this album will make this much more clear. But this is probably the best and always be the best album in the world every song good and meaningful i beg you to by this album because it really makes you think!
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I would say that this is the best Korn album since \\"Issues\\"  It's got the maturity and growth in production that one would expect after seven releases.  My liking of the band has definitely tapered off since \\"Issues\\" but I find myself listening to them a lot more now.  I can listen to this cd over and over and not get tired of it.  It is very different from their older stuff.  Jonathan's vocals are amazing.  The growling lyrics are still there, but many of the songs are beautifully sung, making the music just as powerful, even though it's definitely not as heavy as \\"Korn\\" \\"Life is Peachy\\" or \\"Follow the Leader\\"  It may be because of the one guitar set-up, but I don't think the music is lacking in any way.  The album is different, but surprisingly good.  Worth the money if you can accept the changes and growth in this band's music over the last few years.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Great movie for it's examination of a serious and very real drug testing issue and also a glimpse into African life.  However, as an exciting thriller, the movie falls short.  The book does not and I thoroughly enjoyed the suspense that is built up within the book.  I felt none of that come out in the movie.  To be honest, I have to wonder how people followed the movie without reading the book first.<br /><br />The highlight for me was one of the deleted scenes of the African riding his bike whilst African music is playing. Another deleted scene shows amazing acting by Ralph Fiennes as someone is murdered right in front of him. Stunning scenes and it is a shame they ware deleted.<br /><br />My recommendation, read the book, it is a great read.
0307276902|5.0|At first, I did not want to read this book, because I wasn't in the mood for something depressing and didn't think I could handle something so graphic. Surprisingly, it really grabbed me from the beginning and I found myself whizzing through the 425 pages! His writing style is original, and the story is beautiful and profound.  <br /> <br />I loved the way he gave subtle clues of his healing and transformation throughout the book, but still managed to articulate the difficulty and reality of his struggle until the very end. I also enjoyed seeing his relationship evolve with different characters and how he managed to humanize each character, despite their faults. In that sense, I really appreciated his encouragement of acceptance and non-judgment of others.  His therapy sessions with his family were also touching, and gave some interesting insight into the phenomenon and psychology of addiction and resentment.  <br /> <br />As for the \\"controversy,\\" I think it is a tremendous waste of time. Calling a book a Memoir is not an ironclad label guaranteeing that every word is 100% accurate. In terms of validating this book, I couldn't care less whether it turns out he spent 2 hours in jail or 3 months, whether he was polite or uncooperative during his arrest, or whether he inadvertently hit a police officer with his car or only hit the curb. These disputed incidents are so irrelevant to the overall story, and it is a shame that by reading the headlines, some people assume that the whole book was a lie.  This is an inspiring book about self-control during tough times and finding the inner-strength to make the right decisions.  <br /> <br />There will always be something to criticize, but that shouldn't diminish all the great aspects of this book.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Ms. G. Avery \\"georgia\\" (Directly below) is utterly right. <br />This film packs everything that makes films great. <br />Some have mentioned that the rockets are not the right size as they should be - however the rockets are new and experimental in the film plus. Who has that much time and that little to do that they have to argue about the size of rockets. <br />Are we seriously arguing Rocket size guys, doesn't sound right. <br />Makes me worry about those people. <br />Anyway the film is great, the music is brill, special effects top notch, acting perfect, filmed amazingly. This is a very good film!! <br />Reccommended and then some.
0894803123|3.0|This book is okay, but the texture is gritty and it improved when I COOKED the custard......... <br /> <br />RATHER disappointing, cos the ice cream melted very rapidly, so it was like \\"eating\\" or should I say \\"drinking\\" milkshake....nothing like what they sell in the store..... <br /> <br />The good thing about it is the number of flavours and variations you can make
0767805712|4.0|More worth while seeing than most, is : Gattaca.  A prescient film, that works to thrill and inspire.  In a world where, depending on whether you're born normally or with help from science, determines who you can be and what you can do, a man denies the system. Taking the identity of a friend who can nolonger live in the real world, he heads out to fulfill his dream. But when someone commits a murder and it becomes clear to police that someone is there that shouldn't be, it is a race for time, trying to reach his goals and keep himself and those he loves safe.  This movie carried the message: \\"Believe then do\\" and its a great feeling to leave with.  Its story is well written and well imagined and it makes me wonder about some of the trash coming out of cinemas today.  I love films that drag you in and make you give a damn about the characters and this does it in spades. Its worth more than just a look its deserves a standing ovation.  Give it a try, you'll see what i mean.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Cast Away is a great survival movie that also promotes Wilson sports gear and Fedex. Tom Hanks is a wonderfull actor. His character Nolands liquids and diet are so meager that you feel sorry for him. The daring escape from the island he is marooned on after four years there has some great cinematography of an ocean going freighter juxtaposed against his tiny raft. Back in the world Noland seems disconnected and not very enamoured with the seafood at his welcome home party. Check out Tom Hanks other films as well.
0780622553|4.0|We're being tinkered with. Twisted and changed. A unknown force wants to make itself immortal and thinks it can find out by discovering what makes us tick and why we are the way we are.  So every night at midnight the world stops and a few people are shifted around. New memories given and old lives erased.  Their biggest mistake, however, was taking a man with a happy life and giving him memories to make him believe he's a murderer. The memories don't take, and he wakes up before things are finished.  And now they're after the one thing capable of disrupting everything they have been working for.    More original that my last attempt at dinner and a darn sight more tasty. This is freaky stuff but very cool and acted superbly.  It twists, it turns and you are, for better or worse, pulled along with it. The end is even more cool because its sad, but happy.  How? You ask?  Don't ask. Watch.    When i started my DVD collection this was a must. And it still sits proudly on my shelf, except of course when i'm watching it.  New and inventive, the film never fails to thrill and is a beautifully done piece of work.  Something you'll enjoy alot, but little known in the world of film. Why? We'll never really know. But its one that is hard not to enjoy.
1400031087|1.0|While reading this book, I kept asking myself, Is this real?  Starting with the first few pages, I questioned the reality of what really happened to James Frey.  Come on, who in the pre-911 time could board a plane in his condition, without someone accompanying him?  He's got no ID?  He just keeps talking and talking and talking about all the spit and snot and urine and vomit and blood, this doesn't seem real. <br />After reading and reading and reading, I just became more skeptical of this book. There are too many contradictions in this memior.  Then I saw him on Larry King Live.  He looked like a deer in the headlights!  I don't think he was very forthcomming in his answers.  Although he stated that he embellished some of his experience, I don't think he told told the entire truth. There are many passages in this book that seem too unbelievalble to be true.  His exageration of incidents seem obvious to me, and there are just too many of them to list here.  I would venture to guess that his \\"embellisments\\" would be a betrayl to those people who are seeking or needing help with addiction and recovery.  This story is just not real and just not real and just not real. <br />I believe he went through rehab, but not in the manner in which he tells it. <br />And I can't believe OPRAH did't see this!  I thought she was smarter than this.  Blaming the publisher for labeling it non fiction?  HellOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  James need to be more forth coming about the accuracy of this book.  He chose not to.  And now he's raking in the $$$$.  Thanks to his lying and OPRAH'S recomendation,they are both laughing all the way to the bank! <br />I can't wait to read the Leonard book.  Oh wait!  It has a disclaimer about accuracy!  LOLOLOL.
0060012331|4.0|I bought this book a couple of years ago to read to my little brother and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. There were places i literally had to stop because i couldn't catch my breath for the laughter. <br />I've been a fan of the discworld idea for a while now, having played games and watched an animated production of Soul Music. But this was the first book i'd fully read. And i have to say that it lives up to the hype. <br />Following the exploits of a boy, a cat, and a group of rodents who go town to town acting like pied pipers. I couldn't get over how they worked the scam. At this next town they're heading to though they get caught up in a little bit of a muddle and it really doesn't dissapoint. <br />With insane antics the whole way through. Even at one point having the Cat, Maurice, standing face to face with Death and them both going: \\"Not You Again!\\" <br />Its a sweet piece of insanity that i looked forward to coming back to every time we read a new chapter. <br />I would definately recommend it.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|I am a consumate fan of movies. I love them, and even those that aren't particularly good will earn my respect so long as they prove entertaining.<br /><br />This movie was unique in my whole movie viewing life. Never, ever, have I purchased a movie that managed to put me to sleep. And it did so on three attempts at watching this tripe. I tried really hard, but the film simply is so dull and boring, it lulled me into unconsciousness every time I tried to watch it.<br /><br />This movie is scintilating, action packed and exciting in precisely the same way that watching grass grow isn't.<br /><br />I sat down expecting to be entertained, not rendered comatose. When I brought it home, I was far more entertained putting it into the DVD player than I was when watching it. When I fell asleep the first time, I figured it had to be because I wasn't rested enough. Not the fault of the film, eh? But the second time it happened, I was much better rested. Same result. The third time I tried to see it, I had company over to share the experience. She was drawn so profoundly into the movie that she went home halfway through, stating she would not tolerate another minute of this drivel. Before she left, however, she first had to awaken me.<br /><br />This movie is dull. Not your standard, run-of-the-mill dull, but exceptionally tedious and unbelievably dull.<br /><br />I should have known better, considering Matt Damon is one of the leading actors. After suffering through Gerry, I was ultimately surprised to discover that Damon had more dullness yet within him. Just when you think Gerry was the most dull and braindead film you've ever seen in your life, along comes Brothers Grimm to prove that the dullness of Damon knows no bounds.<br /><br />Needless to say, I do not recommend this film, unless of course, you need a good nap. I had morphine once after surgery, and am confident that this thing put me to sleep more rapidly than morphine did!<br /><br />It may be the sleeper hit of the decade. Emphasis on sleeper.the sleeper hit of the decade. Emphasis on sleeper.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I read Kristal Magallanez \\"cheapreads\\" review. I wonder if she actually saw the film from how she reviews it.    This film was classic. In this society feeling emotions is the highest of crimes and demands the death penalty immediately. A new arm of the law is created to wipe out those denying the new world order. But one of their best has just forgotten to take his dose. And now he's feeling.    The story pulls you at breakneck speed, you care about these characters, you don't even have time to think about \\"i hope this or that happens\\" because you'll miss something great in those few seconds.   At first i wasn't sure but when  you let it gets going, wow, wow and wow!   The action is phenominal.  This is a great film that is acted and scripted to brilliance and uses ideas that make you wonder \\"why did no one ever do that before in films!\\"  It puts you on edge like nothing else.  This is a fav of mine and i'd recommend it no matter what you like.  A great film. What else can you say.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Well, I rated this a five today, because I just bought the album, and I'm always a little obsessed when I get something new, but I really think this is their best. I don't understand so many negative reviews by the critics. I didn't buy it at first, because I didn't want more of the same (like the first two albums) and I was starting to be afraid The Strokes were a one-trick pony. Not to mention Casablancas' lyrics always confused me or left me feeling like the uncool kid at the party. But First Impressions impressed me. I listened to it online and decided OK, it IS different, and yet it still explodes with the same rising energy that we fed off of the first two times around. But this album is so much more layered, more complex, more nuanced, to me. All the songs sound a little different, from Ask Me Anything, which is more moody and reflective than anything they've done in the past, to 15 Minutes, which sounds like a channeling of Shane McGowan and The Pogues. Some slower tempos were welcome, as was the lack of vocal distortion. Casablancas has never been the greatest vocalist, but he has a cool rock and roll voice, alternating between detached and yearning, and it's much more on display here. Plus he seems to have added something more whimsical to his vocals and is even more fun to sing along with. The lyrics are still silly at times, sometimes still cryptic, and mostly still jaded, but overall are more mature and insightful than the earlier ones. The subject matter is certainly more interesting to me. Oh, and the artwork inside is interesting too. I've loved The Strokes all along, for what they were, fun and exciting. But now they're a little bit more, and that's a nice change. But they're still just as fun as ever!
0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" By Lois Lowry is very interesting and very confusing at the same time. The book is based on a utopia type world where everything is the same and everyone is very courteous and polite. It is one kids duty as receiver of memory to learn about all the horrible, painful, and also fun memories from the past. This book was very interesting to read because it is based on something so very different from the real world, so it makes it very unique. Some confusing parts of the book were when it is talking about how they can't see color and Jonas, the main character, learns to see color. In conclusion \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry was a very interesting book and is good for anyone from age nine to sixteen.
B00005QDW5|5.0|You don't listen to anything before 1981? So is it Kajagoogoo or the overrated Nirvanna and Green Day that you give your time and money to? I've been playing bass for 22 years and have been in dozens of bands,  and never once took any kind of drug EVER, and have loved Pink Floyd's music that entire time. You don't have to be stoned to appreciate their music. It's unique, inspired and original songcraft, more than what you can say about today's bands (except Coldplay and The Killers, which are great). The misconception that one has to do drugs to \\"get\\" Pink Floyd's music continues to amuse me through the decades. It's not stoner music. It's GREAT music. Period. <br />Peace!
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|2005 was a very good year for death metalheads. But even if Nile, Burn the Priest, Six Feet Under, Behemoth, Bloodbath, Black Dahlia Murder, Napalm Death, and Bolt Thrower (to name a few) hadn't all released new albums (which ranged from solid to great), it still would have been a great year, because Cryptopsy released a new one, entitled \\"Once Was Not.\\" With this, their sixth record, Cryptopsy definitely deserve the right to be in the same league as giants like Behemoth, Nile, and Death. And, even though they sometimes sound a bit too much like those bands (especially Nile), Cryptopsy are different because they incorporate some of Meshuggah's meticulousness, and the type of technicality that Dying Fetus have made famous. The first and tenth songs on here are thrown in to break up the monotony and consist of pretty acoustic arrangements. But, barring an occasional prog-ish breakdown with Primus-esque noodling (as in tracks four and eight), every other track on \\"Once Is Not\\" makes for a very brutal and punishing (yet oddly satisfying) assault on the listener's ear drums. The vocals are deep and gruff, somewhere in between growling and snarling. And the great, scorching riffs and ridiculously fast and heavy blast beats make many of these songs (like \\"In The Kingdom Where Everything Dies, The Sky Is Mortal\\" and \\"Keeping The Cadaver Dogs Busy\\") have jackhammer rhythms. Highlights include \\"Carrionshine,\\" which is an explosive tune with thunderous, rapid-fire drums, the careening guitar solo and absolutely insane drumming on \\"Adeste Infidelis,\\" and the lightning fast drumming on \\"Frantic Pace of Dying.\\" Track five, \\"Curse of the Great,\\" is another standout because it begins slowly, but its airtight, machine gun double bass drumming eventually makes the song speed up. So, this is a great album, and essential listening for all death metal fans, because if it wasn't the best death metal album of 2005, then it was definitely a close contender.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Adaptations are not always great, especially when they've been done before.  Les Liaisons Dangereuses was made over once before with Glen Close and Michelle Pfifer in a movie called Dangerous Liasons.  I thought that movie to be quite boring and over rated.  Cruel Intentions puts a nice Next-Gen spin on this dark study of human behavior and the lust for being in control and getting what you want, when you want it.  Sebastion is a playboy who has fun sleeping with the daughters of socialites and building his reputaion as 'the boy your mother warned you about'...His stepsister Kathryn is a witch with a capitol 'B' and has built herself the reputation of clean, proper young woman with a bright at the sun future, the only problem is it's all a facade and she is really a terrible person (but Geller proves she's a steller actress...oh my god did I really say that???)  Anyways, enter the new deans daughter, played by Witherspoon, a girl whose swarn to save herself for marrage.  This sparks Sebastians interest for if he can sleep with her, well then he will solidify himself as GOD amoung men...If he could woo the celibate hottie, well then so be it.  And so the wagers begin and Sebastion (who also would love to bang his stepsister) bets his car against her sex and the games begin.  He never banked on falling in love did he?  The dramatic climax is heartbreaking and although it differs greatly from the book it's adapted from it's worht every minute you wait for it.  Performances are great across the board but it's Phillippe and Gellar that blow me away for we all know the Witherspoon is a great actress (I mean she's GARENTIED the oscar this year...well, I won't say that for sure..I say that now and then theres some fluke and Huffman takes the prize...) ANYWAY, to me it was Gellar and Phillippe that broke out of there norm and proved that they do have talent...even if it's short lived.  Good performences by smaller roles in Blair as the ditzy love-lorn and inexperiance Ceciland Jackson as the gay friend of Sebastian...I loved this movie and think that most will too.
B000000WA4|5.0|My personal favorite album of all time. Before I listened to this album the music I listened too was shallow bubble gum pop, I was more of a casual listener of sorts. The moment my sister showed me the album when she was about to check it out at the register I scoffed at the idea that such a wierd-looking album could produce what she called \\"prime music\\", and a double album none the least, I was like the hell!! I had a bad impression of the band from the start, I thought they were just a gothic band judging by their \\"Bullet with butterfly wings\\" Music Video which I watched when I was about ten. Damn, I just wish I could have fully appreciated this band in their hey days when they were all the craze. Thats how I felt after I gave this album a thorough listen, I realized how skewed my vision of music was... all this time I was listening to shallow music, but out there, beyond MTV were the deep pumpkins, and could they kick it to the wicket man! On the drive home we popped it in the cd player and I listened intently cause I expected my sis too have a much more sophisticated taste in music than me... and there it went... tonight, tonight with its beautiful orchestral accompaniment, I was like the F***! wheres the blaring unmelodic guitar riffs!? then then its signature guitar strings went off and I was like damn... beautiful... and what the hells up with that guys voice!?  <br /> <br />I mustered enough courage and commitement to finally listen through the album one night I popped it in my cd player and went to bed with it... and we made beautiful music together, for two hours! The diverse array of styles blew me away and the consistency with the songs, I was amazed. From the emotinally moving \\"tonight, tonight\\" [ my favotite song of all time] to the bleak \\"zero\\" to the soothing sounds of 1979 and \\"porcelina of the vast oceans\\" , never once during the whole listen ok maybe except twice was I let down. The next day I bought the album for 30 bux from my sister 5 bux overthe sticker price, I was crazy about em'. My life was changed from that moment I have idolized billy corgan and the pumpkins, I have all their albums and b-sides. Its just that this band showed me what a rock band was capable of. The heavy experimentation, the lyrics  <br />THey won my respect, they awakened me to the world of music and I will be forever grateful to them, i have even picked up guitar. Their other albums were just as ambitious too, check em' out siamese dream, adore, all of them! I listne to them on a daily basis.. the pumpkins are my anti-drug!  <br /> <br />Buy this album, after that you will be praising them just as enthusiastically as me!  <br /> <br />To the best band ever SP FOREVER MAN!!!!!!  <br />By the way their getting back together!!! boooyah!
B00000K31Q|5.0|This teen adaptation of 'The Taming of the Shrew' is histarical and a great watch.  If your fans of the teen comedy genra you'll love it.  It blows films like 'She's all That' and 'Can't Hardly Wait' away (although the latter is one of my favorites as well)  ANYWAYS...the premise is two young girls, Bionca and her older sister Kat, live with a very strict father who says that they can't date or party or anythign for fear that some scum of the earth will impregnate them.  Kat is fine with this but Bionca wants to be popular and you can't be popular if you can't party and don't have a BF...Cameron is in love with Bionca, he's knew and shes hot and he wants her but because of her father he can't have her...so he sets her up with the school bad boy played by Heath Ledger.  Kat is resitant by Patrick won't give up and she eventually falls for him and Bionca is free to be wooed...but she's not interested in Cameron who is just 'the nice guy' but not 'the cool guy' and so she picks 'the cool guy' and ends up heartbroken and leaning on Camerons shoulder...and then Kat finds out Patrick was paid to date her, but he really likes her but it looks like all is lost because of a pay-off...It's funny, predictable maybe, but funny and smart and the acting is quite good for the type of film it is...I liked it alot and think most people will as well.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a wonderfully condensed adaptation of the book (which I've read).  I've also recently seen the BBC version of P&P and though I did enjoy the five hour version, I believe this two hour version tells the gist of the story very well.  Keira Knightly is a bit \\"cuter\\" than the book describes Lizzy, but she does an excellent job of being feisty and strong-willed.  Matthew McFayden is a brooding Darcy and portrays the character very well.        In this movie version, I believe there are a few scenes that are very touching and set it apart from the miniseries.  The first is when Darcy assists Lizzy into the carriage when she and Jane are leaving Netherfield.  It's as if Lizzie and Darcy immediately feel a spark when their hands touch and when Darcy walks away and has to flex his hand from the touch - wow, it's great.      Also, when he proposes to her in the rain and she rejects him.  Before he leaves, he looks at her and his eyes reflect the pain, hurt and anger that he's feeling and he burns a stare right at her for a split second, as he turns to leave, it's heart wrenching.    The one scene I definitely enjoyed more than the miniseries (and the book for that matter) was the ending.  I found it very touching and preferred it to the miniseries.  In the miniseries, yes, they kiss at the end, but it's almost casual, there's no spark.  In this version, they playfully caress each other, as Lizzie is suggesting terms of endearment, that Darcy can refer to her.  I was happy with the ending.
B00094ARZ0|3.0|Okay...so this movie will never win an oscar, but if you ride horses at all you HAVE to appreciate the skill Bo demonstrates in this movie. Her riding ability takes center stage here and it should not be overlooked. It is inspiring!
B0007PAMR4|2.0|it turned out to be a little weird.... and whats with all the people annoyingly whispering and thinking to themselves...
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is an outstanding movie and sad story about two cowboys who fall in love with, of all people, each other.  Neither considers himself gay, and neither understands why this happened to them.  And both try to resist it and bow to social pressures by maintaining the facade of a traditional married life. But neither of them can escape the intense love and longing they have for each other and carry on their illicit affair over the course of 20 years.  The endlessly hopeful Jack insists that he and Ennis can build a life together as \\"ranching partners,\\" but it is the realist Ennis that resists such illusions (after all, it takes place in a time that was less-accepting of gays).  But both continue to long for such a life with each other.<br /><br />It's a sad story in that their intense love is never allowed to be realized except in their occasional encounters on Brokeback Mountain.  The tag line \\"Love is a force of nature\\" really says it all.  We can't help who we fall in love with, and it's especially tragic when our own attitudes and the attitudes of our society prevent that love from being realized, with unhappy consequences.  It's about people who don't fit in, and how they cope with that.  This movie is highly recommended, IF you're ready for it.<br /><br />(And don't believe the sensationalistic reactionaries screaming that it's \\"gay porn.\\"  There are more heterosexual sex scenes than gay, and there arene't even very many of those!  The one gay sex scene is only about 15-20 seconds long and shows not much more than faces and arms.  Those people are just reacting to their own biases and ignorance.  Neither does the movie \\"promote\\" adultery.  Instead, it shows what can happen when you can't be true to yourself, so it must be viewed with this in mind and within the context of the years [60's-70's] when it takes place.)
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Alright, dude just has chops. This was a great stylistic film to start out with. On top of that, how can you not love RR? Whether you are a film maker, wanna be film maker, or just a film lover, he consistantly puts out some of the best special features on DVD, which is why I run straight out and buy whatever he puts out. 15 minute film school rules, commentaries rule, and the all green screen version of the film is pretty cool too. I always finish watching his special features feeling like I have really learned something about the film making process. You gotta love a director who really seems to enjoy helping others to learn about the craft. Thanks Robert!
1573223026|1.0|I loved High Fidelity and enjoyed the movie About a Boy, but this was horrific.  The main characters are extremely unlikeable, and in some cases, absolutely pathetic.   The plot was incredibly unrealistic, particularly when they all decide to take a vacation with one another, despite the fact that none of them actually like or enjoy each other's conmpany.  This novel just dragged.   Several of us read this for a book club and none of us had anything interesting to say about it - it was just plain boring.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana: The Most Underrated Overrated Band <br /> <br />Like one poster pointed out before me, yes, basically everyone has owned this album at least one point in their life. And why not? \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is no doubt one of the most important rock singles of all time. Do we all like it? No, but that doesn't take away from the importannce or impact that it had on our culture.  <br /> <br />Yes, Nirvana went on to create better albums: \\"In Utero\\" was a punk/noise masterpiece, and \\"Unplugged in NYC\\" is classic Nirvana stripped down. Despite all that, this album has it's charm. Catchy, noisy, rocking and beautiful all rolled into a delicious package complete with a naked baby chasing a dollar on the cover.  <br /> <br />Yes, we all have grown EXTREMELY tired of this album, and quite frankly, who hasn't. But that doesn't take away from the fact that the excellent songwriting is still there. Listen to the haunting \\"Something In The Way\\", and you'll realize Nirvana was more than the unlikely singles which spawned generations of imitators which would ultimately lead \\"grunge\\" to it's overexposure.  <br /> <br />However, songs like \\"In Bloom\\" inspired bands like Puddle of Mudd to exist. Kurt Cobain would be rolling over in his grave. People often forget songs like \\"Territorial Pissings\\" or the secret song off this album, a noise-filled punk band influenced by the Sabbath and the Melvins, ready to shove the hook right in your face.  <br /> <br />It's easy to just brush this album aside due to it's popularity, but inside there is one of the most classic albums ever created, not a bad song on it. Maybe somebody did it better, maybe Nirvana stole some riffs, but they weren't Nirvana, and they didn't put out this album.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Well, that title is perhaps a cheat, as I believe it was actually released in most of the world in 2004 and South Korea in 2003, but I've noticed that some real critics like to go by the year the film came out in their country, so I'll let it slide.<br /><br />Though 'Oldboy' certainly isn't popular, it has gotten quite a lot of underground buzz, and it seems like it always gets compared to the work of some better known director, either Fincher or Nolan or Tarantino or Miike or whoever.  Comparisons can be useful, but they tend to suggest that the film or director is clone or knockoff, and thinking this would be a grave disservice to Chan-wook Park and 'Oldboy'.  This is a strikingly modern film, slick and beautiful in its hyper-technological, urban setting, with an occasionally fractured narrative filled with both dark humor and gruesome violence .  So the comparisons are fairly accurate, actually,  but Park has a knack for putting it all together that it's clear that he isn't imitating anyone else.  It all holds together underneath, with strong storytelling and genuine human interest beneath the attractive surface.<br /><br />You've probably already heard to premise: A drunken and surly, but still seemingly good-natured man named Dae-su spends a night at the police station just before he is abducted by a mysterious stranger.  He's placed in a small apartment devoid of any human contact for 15 years, until he is suddenly released one day.  Dae-su wants revenge, but he perhaps even more than that, he wants to know why this happened to him.  During this he meets a young lady, Mi-do and quickly finds the man responsible for his imprisonment, Woo-jin.  Woo-jin makes a sort of deal with him: If, in the next 5 days, Dae-su can find out why all this happened, Woo-jin will kill himself.  If not, he will kill Mi-do, along with every other woman that Dae-su ever loves.  This may make the film sound rather plot-intensive, but it actually isn't.  Dae-su actually solves the bulk of the mystery fairly easily, the plot generally moves quickly in leaps and bounds between the moody, surreal scenes and various setpieces.<br /><br />`Oldboy' is perhaps the best looking film of last year.  Park composes his shots with great care and it's all sleek, fashionable and modern.  And though it isn't an action movie is still has some cool fighting.  There is one very rough, extended single-shot fight that is becoming quite famous, and rightfully so.  The use of music is also fantastic, with various repeating themes manipulating the mood nicely.  You need great music in order to build up a sorta operatic grandiosity and intensity which this film has in its best scenes.<br /><br />The performances are all great, particularly Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu as Dae-su and Woo-jin, respectively.  Most notably, though they are hero and villain, both of these characters prove to be exceedingly likable and sympathetic once you find out all there is to know.  Dae-su is definitely one of the best protagonists in recent film history, combining an undeniable bada**ness with inner turmoil and self-doubt.  Woo-jin is interesting in that he is rather non-threatening looking and has a fairly playful demeanor that he rarely drops.<br /><br />There are plenty of movies out there that I really like simply because they have so many neat ideas and look so good.  `Oldboy' works on this level, but it also has some real human interest and emotional impact that most films are lacking.  You can really feel the pain of being locked away for so long with no contact, and the scene where Dae-su and Mi-do say goodbye before he heads of to confront Woo-jin is really quite powerful, as are a number of things which happen during the climax of the film, though I can't go into specifics.<br /><br /> I've heard some complain that the ending is slightly drawn-out, and while this is something of a problem it's pretty much the only real concern I have with the film, and it barely matters.  I mustnote that the denouement will likely put some people off, and not without good reason, as it is rather strange and perverse.  I was sufficiently into the film that I went with it despite the disturbing implications, but others doubtless will not. (Judging by the critical response, however, I believe that most people will go along with it.)  Also, the film does have a significant twist in it, but it's not totally the heart of the film. Well, I should say, it's crucial to the plot, but the whole point of the movie isn't simply to have the rug pulled out from underneath you at the end.  I'm interested to see how they'll deal with this twist in the American remake, as I'm sure execs will assume that such a twist will be upsetting to many viewers, but if you change it you pretty much have to come up with a whole new plot.<br /><br />I guess I'm tired of writing.  Check it out, and whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!! I repeat, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!!!<br /><br />Grade: Aome people off, and not without good reason, as it is rather strange and perverse.

B000BOKJLA|5.0|Epic...outstanding...grandiose... ambitious...visionary... theatrical... majestic... monumental...exciting...classical... timeless... fantastic... mythological... emotional...breathtaking... electrifying...exhilarant... eye-popping... far out... fine... flashy... hectic... compelling...impressive... intoxicating<br /><br />How does one describe the greatest rock album of all time?<br /><br />When Born to Run was being made Bruce Springsteen knew it was his shot at the title and he went for it with an indefatigable passion. The pressure was on. His backers at Columbia had moved on...the sales of \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\" and \\"the Wild the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\\" had been less than impressive though both albums were critically well received. Bruce and his band mates new they were in danger of being dumped from the label if they didn't come up with a triumph.<br /><br />Springsteen had a sound in his head, a big sound and a big song in Born to Run but getting that song and sound to match what he was hearing in his mind was proving to be frustrating and taxing. With meticulous dedication and grueling sixteen hour days in the studio and overdub after overdub after overdub Springsteen and the E Street band were finally able to achieve the Spectorish \\"Wall of Sound\\" they had been searching for and a classic was...well.... born.<br /><br />In the process two band members were lost, Springsteen's then manager Mike Appel was at the beginning of the end of his business association with Bruce and John Landau, the man who was to write that he'd seen the future of rock and roll after seeing Bruce perform, came on board beginning a collaboration of like minds that has lasted to this day. Despite all the pratfalls, if asked if he'd do it all again I imagine Bruce would not hesitate because the end result took him to the top and enabled him to get everything he could have hoped for and more out of a musical career.<br /><br />I was a kid when I fell in love with the album. I heard Born to Run blasting through the radio and had to have it for my own. It was the first song (that wasn't a nursery rhyme) that I remember having any investment in. Thirty years later with this special commemorative edition I now have eight copies of it.<br />First obviously was the original LP then I had to have it on cassette for the tape deck in my parent's car. The third version was the LP again when I just had to buy a copy when the family was on an extended Christmas vacation at my grandparents' house. Then CD's were invented and of course it was the first CD I brought. My CD player back then was a five CD disk changer and Born to Run had a permanent place in the number one slot. This proved to be problematic when I got a CD player in my car so along came version number six. Then I met my future wife and had to buy her a copy so she could learn to<br />some extent what she may be getting herself into, of course we live together now so it's `our' copy. Then there's this latest, greatest edition in remastered digital sound with the terrific extras.<br /><br />Obsessed?<br /><br />Maybe.........a little anyway.<br /><br />Born to run is more than just the collection of individual songs....it's more than the wall of sound...it's more than the beauty and poetry of the lyrics....it's more than the passion and promise that the album contains.....it's a sum of all it's parts.<br />The themes of freedom, escape and redemption that are evident throughout are intrinsic to those that lay at the heart of rock and roll. The promise of that magic in the night, the question of is love real. Somehow less becomes more as the album was stripped back and condensed in comparison to what Springsteen had done before. His previous releases had been wordy and verbose, the byline for Greetings stating that Bruce was a performer who could put more into one song than most artists put into an entire album. Here he was able to tell more story in less words and the words he usedconveyed a cinematic imagery with characters that we can all imagine with lives and hearts and minds of their own. Lives and stories that for a brief moment we can invest in and feel as if they contain a little piece of ourselves.<br /><br />Thirty years on and the album still resonates as much now as it did back then and this latest edition is a fitting tribute. The packaging is terrific. Of course the iconic cover of Bruce slumped over Clarence's shoulder complete with impish grin, his Elvis badge and the famous Esquire telecaster slung alongside like an old West gunslinger. Inside the album itself is packaged like the original LP in a gatefold sleeve. The silver part of the disk is black and the picture side is made out like a record complete with grooves. Another CD cover containing the Born to Run single and the B side Meeting Across the River is set up to look like a record in it's sleeve.<br /><br />The picture booklet is a collection of photo's from the Born to Run era as taken by photographer Eric Meola who was responsible for the classic image that became the albums cover. Somewhat disappointingly the intro to this booklet is an exert from Bruce's book songs rather than something written originally for the release. For mine it would have been interesting to hear what Bruce feels about the album thirty years on and what it means to him today.<br /><br />The sleeve for the DVD of the E Street bands first concert abroad at London's Hammersmith Odeon is more satisfying as it is originally penned and in fact written the day before Bruce's birthday this past September. Bruce talks about how he felt about the hype and the marquee and the tearing down of the posters and the tension before the show. The DVD itself is the first official full release concert from the preceding century. Though the release proclaims this is never before seen footage there is quite a few bootleggers who would beg to disagree. Bruce acknowledges as much when he mentions that the\\" legendary performance marked only in memory, bits of bootleg tape and `I was there when' stories\\" For those that have the bootleg concert I would suggest that both versions are from the same source as it has the same grainy elements and camera angles. For those that have not seen it, this is not the buff Springsteen who muscled his way through the Born in the USA tour but a taut, skinny, hungry performer going for broke to win over a foreign audience with an impassioned delivery. It highlights why Springsteen and the E Street band garnered their reputations for being the premiere live performers in concert that they remain to this day.<br /><br />The third disk is a wonderful little documentary titled \\"Wings for wheels\\" which was one of the original titles for the song that came to be known as \\"Thunder Road\\". The disk contains archival footage from the making of the album and current footage from all the key players including ex band members Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter and David Sancious as well as the production team. Highlights include some of the versions (both good and downright cringe worthy) that didn't make the final cut, modern acoustic versions of select songs with detailed explanations in the mode of the recent Storytellers DVD and the Somerville theatre benefit shows from 2003 and a small segment that has Bruce showing of the famed Esquire telecaster.<br />The DVD concludes with a live three-song performance from 1973 including Spirit in the night, Wild Billy's Circus story and Thundercrack.<br /><br />All in all it's a great testament to the greatest album and while I'm aware that most everyone who will purchase this is probably as bad as myself when it come to all things Bruce I congratulate those who are about to be introduced to Mary, Wendy, Terry, Eddie, the Magic Rat, the barefoot girl, Scooter and the Big Man for the very first time.

B000089RV6|4.0|You already know if you want this album.  You've heard 'Hell's Bells' and 'Shoot to Thrill' and 'Back in Black' and 'You Shook Me All Night Long' and  'Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution' on the radio.  If you want the album with those songs on it, and 5 other songs that sound pretty much like those ones, here it is.  I dunno just how many AC/DC albums I need, but they are a lotta fun and this one is definitely worth the cash.  It's hurt by opening too strong; 'Hell's Bells' is the best song on the album, easily, and probably my favorite AC/DC song, with the possible exception of 'TNT'.  'Hell's Bells' is one of the more different tracks here, with some great atmospheric guitarwork and Johnson's best vox.  In general the singles are the best songs, with 'Back in Black' having the best riffs and 'Shoot to Thrill'  the best chorus, but everything here works with a good enough chorus and at least one great stomping riff.  AC/DC may not be the most sophisticated band out there, but they have no pretentions and know how to have fun, which is worth quite a lot considering what popular music is frequently like nowadays.
B00000255F|5.0|Im 14 years old and when my Dad and Uncle introduced me to the only amazing Springsteen album i thought this is amazing. Bruce remindes me of everything good about America (And at this point theres not much good in Amaerica at the moment with the incompatant Bush and the dumbarse war).<br />From The Cover of \\"Born to run\\" with Bruce and his signiture Fender Esqire to \\"Thunder road\\" to \\"Born to run\\" to the epic and overblown but at the same time wonderful \\"Jungleland\\" and everything inbitween, this ablum never fails to please me.<br />Im sure almost everyone who owns this album knows the story behind it: Bruce was about to be droped from his recored lable but then he recoreded this album and it saved his career and that is pretty much it in a nutshell.<br />One More Thing i would like to say is that the people writing the reviews giving this album 1 star and talking about the Iraq war are completely right in one respect and sort of wrong. They are right in saying that this album is wrong because it signifies America and the bad things there doing but there wrong because its just a CD and although i think Bush is the worst move America could of made, i still love this album.<br />About 6 months ago i think, my Dads friend gave me a old copy of \\"Nebraska\\" and he said somthing like that this is as good as \\"Born To Run\\" and let me tell you now its not and from what ive seen no other Springsteen album is or will ever be. This album is a once in a life time epic masterpiece and it looks like something like this will never be done again.
0307276902|5.0|i read this book many months ago, and was completely enthralled-Not because i expected every word to be true, but because it was beautifully written, and very moving.  It is a memoir, not a statement in a court of law-  i hope people can get past all the controvery,and get back to what made this book so popular-a well written account of soemone's battle with addiciton-
B00005LK95|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVS! <br /> <br />I was bought up watching this and the original and I never repeated any of the language in the movie, if any language at all there's very little swearing after all it is PG13... <br /> <br />It's one of the greatest sequels of all time, having a good story and casting whilst also keeping in touch with the originals heart warming moments and humour. <br /> <br />This movie shouldn't be watched to be judged like some of the other reviewers have...it's there to be watched and enjoyed by the whole family big or small.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Based on the incredible Amazon reviews I bought both the Firefly series (also 5 stars) and the Serenity movie.  I watched the movie first and then the series though it really doesn't matter in what order they are viewed.  As I stated in my comments for the Firefly Series DVD, I think the concept is great.  While it is a retread of the 'ole sci fi western (ala Star Wars), just because a story has been told before doesn't mean it isn't worth watching again.  The manner in which Mr. Whedon weaves his story is amazing and quite engaging.    Having said that, I became very curious as to whether we have seen the last of Serenity/Firefly.  Here is where the bad news comes in.  In an interview of Mr. Whedon before the movie Serenity was resleased an insightful fan asked him if we would see more of this storyline after the movie (e.g., a reincarnation of the tv series, a mini-serieis or a sequal to the movie).  Mr. Whedon replied as follows \\"Hard to say. The Movie has to be a hit before these questions become relevant.\\"    I decided to do some research to see if the movie was a \\"hit\\".  According to rottentomateos.com:      Serenity's   Box Office Total: $25,335,935     Box Office Opening: $10,086,680     No. of Weeks in Top 10: 2     Highest Ranking: 2     VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARY    VHS Rentals Total: $5,320,000     VHS Rentals Opening: $1,640,000     Highest Ranking: 25      This was described as \\"modest\\" and \\"not quite meeting the expectations of the producers\\" by other web sites.    Not giving up hope, I decided to see what type of numbers warrants a sequal.  I chose Underworld since the sequal to that movie is opening soon.  Now, if you have not seen the original Underworld, let me just say ... it sucks.  Other than a hot lead actress and some interesting visuals, the plot stank and the acting was subpar.  Unless you are a horny 13 year old male the movie does not warrant more than a half star.    Having said that the movie did well enough to warrant a sequal: Underworld 2 Evolution.  So I checked on the numbers for Underworld to see if we had any hope of a Serenity sequal.  According to rottentomatoes.com (which gave the movie a \\"ROTTEN\\" grade):    BOX OFFICE SUMMARY    Box Office Total: $51,483,949     Box Office Opening: $21,753,759     No. of Weeks at #1: 1     No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3     VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARY    VHS Rentals Total: $3,600,000     VHS Rentals Opening: $1,340,000     No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3     Highest Ranking: 5     What can I add?  The numbers speak for themselves.  A sequal to Serenity which deserves more attention will probably never happen, while I am anticipating an Underworld 3, 4, and 5 ... at least.  As Clint Eastwood said in Unforgiven, \\"Deserve ain't got nothing to do with it.\\"
B000E1YVZU|3.0|First I liked the stage version a lot.  I thought the whole Christmas Bells/It's Beginning to Snow sequence was brilliant.  It doesn't even show up in the movie.  First the good things: 6 of the original 8 leads from the original B'way production are in the movie playing the characters again.  Rosario Dawson makes a much better Mimi than Daphne Rubin-Vega (a great improvement -- I can't stand Rubin-Vega's mealy-mouthed delivery - it sounds like she's chewing her words, or maybe just the scenery).  The plot such as it is has been streamlined, though some of the songs tend to ramble on and outlive their welcome.  The bad: 6 of the 8 original cast members made the movie. Most look too damned old for the roles, except Anthony Rapp, who still has a baby face and probably could play Roger again when he's fifty. Adam Pascal's hair: he looks like Jon Bon Jovi caught out in the rain; I know this is a source of contention amongst female fans that a lot like him with the long hair, but long hair doesn't look right on a 35-year old, even if he's supposed to be a rocker. Much of the original recitatives have been turned into spoken dialogue which sounds flat. The ending seems forced, and I agree with one other reviewer: Roger's \\"one great song\\" is a dud. Pascal is best when he's ripping his voice to shreds, not crooning a sappy ballad.   <br /> <br />Will I still buy the movie on DVD? Probably; it's better than most movies out there. But if you want the real Rent experience, go see the show on Broadway.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|yes, she is the best singer,and her incredible voice proves it....with this album mariah have reassure she has the best voice ever....(also check her former hits to confirm it)....this album is really great and songs like FLY LIKE A BIRD,CIRCLES,JOY RIDE,I WISH YOU KNEW,..well as most of them sound really great is difficult to say which one displays most of her talent...personally i like JOY RIDE, there she show us the variaty of her vocal range,....though i rather her whistle in I WISH U KNEW.....the fact is that most of the songs in this album besides having a great work of production they do sound better with mariah's voice.....certainly it would deserve to win the principal grammy nominations it has been given...especially album of the year......
0140288503|5.0|I read \\"Black Hawk Down\\" a year before I saw the motion picture. After watching the movie (which i thought was very well done) i re-read the book.  Although the movie attempted to be as true to life as possible that was simply not a possibility.  They blended people and changed locations and situations to make a movie with a plot that is able to be followed. Mark Bowden wrote his book to be a rough time line and running story of what happened in the events. It is easily read and understood despite his habit of bouncing from place to place rapidly. I suggest that anyone who saw and enjoyed the movie read the book for it gives a much more accurate but equally exciting version of the events that took place in Somalia.
B00005JLSE|1.0|That's NOT Entertainment, folks. The plot's thin even for a movie musical, with murderess Velma going to jail for murdering her lover interspersed with musical numbers meant to show her dream of being a jazz star. It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot. Don't waste your time.
B000050HTO|5.0|I was introduced to Bob Dylan not long ago, when I bought one of his cds on a whim. Truth to be told, I liked it so much that I wanted to buy another one, if possible a cd that would allow me to listen to some of his best songs without having to buy too many cds at the same time.<br /><br />I am happy to say that with this cd, \\"Essential Bob Dylan\\", I managed to do just that. Among the wonderful songs included in this cd you will find jewels such as \\"Like a rolling stone\\", \\"Blowin'in the wind\\", \\"Subterranean homesick blues\\", \\"Positively 4th Street\\" and \\"The times they're a- changin'\\".<br /><br />I am pretty sure that I will go on buying Dylan's cds, as I enjoy his songs, and specially the the fact that his creativity knows no limits. All the same, I certainly don't regret buying this cd, and I strongly recommend it to all those who like Bob Dylan, and to those who don't know much about him but want to give his songs a try.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Mild-mannered British diplomat Justin, desperate to solve his beautiful young activist wife's brutal murder, stumbles into a hotbed of lies and greed that crosses international borders. The director blends flashbacks seamlessly into the story, and the viewer can't help but share Justin's grief and admire his wife's courage. The exquisite scenery and horrific warfare of Kenya and the Sudan make this mystery even more thrilling. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I heard many friends raving about Bob Dylan, but... I didn't pay attention. My loss, as I discovered not long ago, when I bought \\"Blood on the tracks\\" on a whim, just to see what Dylan was about. Truth to be told, I just wanted to listen to some of his songs in order to discover why so many people of different ages love him so much. Now I know...<br /><br />This album has very good songs with lots of feeling, songs that leave you feeling somewhat blue, but never indifferent. It is quite difficult to choose my favourite songs in this cd, but I suppose I like \\"Tangled up in blue\\", \\"Simple twist of fate\\" and \\"Shelter from the storm\\" a little more than I like the others.<br /><br />All in all, I heartily recommend \\"Blood on the tracks\\" as an excellent cd you will listen to again and again. If you are looking for an introduction, this cd will do nicely, but \\"Essential Bob Dylan\\" might be even better. Of course, you could buy both of them :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000002UB3|1.0|This is more music for druggies. The Beatles should be ashamed to put out this album. I saw Paul Mcartney live last year and he was better than this album, and the other Beatles weren't even there. But the stage show was boring, there where no pyrotecnics or girls. When I saw Motley Crew during there Dr. Feelgood tour they at least had Fireballs and dancing girls. Plus Mick Mars destroys George Harryson on guitar!
0684857219|2.0|You know, I always hear about people quoting this book with stuff and as a knowledgeable bodybuilder I must say that this book has a lot of BS in it that unfortunately keeps bodybuilding myth growing much more than it really should. <br /> <br />Let's understand something: Arnold was a good bodybuilder because a.) he was on steroids and b.) because bodybuilding was his life.  That right there was the reason that he was so big, not because he knew how and why bodybuilding actually works. <br /> <br />Arnold's focus on 'pump' and the 'burn' is ridiculous at best (since when does lactic acid in your muscles cause more muscle growht?) and his workouts will have you doing 4x as many sets as necessary. <br /> <br />In a way I suppose his bodybuilding career is like his political career... he doesn't know exactly what he's doing but it takes a lot to really screw things up so that you fail.  Go to your gym and workout for a few months and notice how a huge portion of gym-goers will appear for a few weeks and then disappear for months (if not years).  The reason for this is because 'professionals' like Weider and Arnold have helped to popularize/spread bodybuilding myth that is quickly accepted by amateurs and when these people don't see results from taking the advice of Arnold and Weider... they get discouraged and stop going to the gym. <br /> <br />Honestly if you want to read this book then good for you, it's better than nothing (but what isn't).  But some time just do a search on the internet for 'Bodybuilding myth' and find how many busted myths Arnold believes.  If you want to actually learn a lot about lifting based on hundreds of people's experience then go checkout a bodybuilding/weightlifting forum on the internet, there are quite a few good ones.  Widespread anecdotal evidence of average weightlifters and supported by scientists is a lot better than advice given based on one man's anecdotal evidence (by 'anecdotal evidence' I mean advice given based on one's ownexperiences). <br /> <br />Below this review they are going to ask you if this review helped you or not.  Do yourself a favor and don't vote until you've been doing Arnold's program in this book for a few weeks and find that you've made hardly any gains and can hardly get out of bed because you've been overtraining. <br /> <br />BTW I am a certified trainer (not that it bears any authority anymore these days) and have literally thousands of posts on certain Weightlifting forums so I feel that I know my stuff very well (and naturally I base most of my knowledge on scientific studies).
B000A0GP4K|1.0|Bob Dylan thinks putting out of movie of him talking is supposed to be cool? Granted there are some performances but its all in black and white!!! And sometimes there's no band, just him and his boring guitar and harmonica. He doesn't even try to solo. I've seen much better rock performances by the likes of Dokken, Ratt, or Poison (take your pick). At least these newer bands look like they're trying to have fun. Bob Dylan just mopes and poses but never rocks out. Funny thing is people just seem to gobble this suff up. Sometimes there's no accounting for taste :(
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is Avenged Sevenfolds best release...City of Evil is their worst.  Buy this over COE, that is, if you want to hear the real A7X, not the new, sell out A7X on TRL. <br /> <br />Waking the Fallen > Sounding of the Seventh Trumphet > My dogs poop > City of  Evil
B000002UJQ|1.0|Where's the rocking solos? I just see a bunch of whiney losers listening to this album in their bedrooms, alone on a friday night. Well quit crying because nobody cares. Maybe if you listened to some music that ROCKS like Motely Crue then you might have some friends but in the meantime keep crying!
B00004U2EZ|5.0|When I first saw the perfomance of Notre Dame de Paris by original francophone troupe of singers for the first time, right away I fell in love with the music of Riccardo Cocciante and the gorgeous voices of the singers.       Being lucky to be able to understand the lyrics, I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome lyrics of Luc Plamondon, even if the lyrics are not necessary to understand the mood and the emotions that the songs transmit, knowing the words helps you to completely immerse into the play and feel the same emotions that the play characters, to live the story yourself.      With \\"Bohemienne\\" we see a clear picture of a young gypsy girl wandering in the mountains and valleys of Andalusia, playful and free, a little sad because she lives only for the present, every tomorrow is a new mystery, a new journey.      \\"Belle\\" depicts a stunning young woman, with sensual moves and penetrating eyes, dancing on the square while all the men are ready to do anything to be with her.      \\"Tu va me detruire\\" demonstrates the unconrolled desire of the priest towards Esmeralda, the man who dedicated all his life to sience and religion who now is ready to surpass all his beliefs, descend to hell only if she would be his. While he is discovering his dark side, Esmeralda falls in love with a beau captaine, Phoebus, who is betraying his fiance with her.      Meanwhile his fiance Fleur de Lys is reflecting on how to get her loved one back : in \\"La monture\\" she makes plan of vegeance to Esmeralda, she is calling her a witch, the hatred and jelousy are overtaking her  while she says to Phoebus \\"I will come back to you only if Esmeralda will be executed \\".      As the story ends the spectator/listener is taken over by   the desperation of innocent and proud Esmeralda before being executed, the depth and the eternity of Quasimodo's feelings.      I really love all the singers and ever since I have Notre Dame de Paris I don't miss an album by any of the singers from the musical.I have discovered for myself such great artists as Garou, Bruno Pelletier, Patrick Fiori.       It's a must for everyone!
B00063MBU8|1.0|I heard these guys were a pretty good Canadian rock act but when I got the CD into my stereo and pressed play all I heard were power cords and singing that sounded put to tape without rehearsal. These guys have no chops. For better singing buy some Motley Crue. For better guitar playing buy any Poison or Warrant album. Those are real ROCK bands who put out quality music, not this rock for skate board kids. HAIR METAL rules!!!
B000B5QWKG|4.0|First off, I promised myself that I wouldn't comment on this kind of thing any more, but since someone else mentioned it, I'll add MY two cents. I agree with reviewer James that people shouldn't give a great album like this one star because of the DualDisc technology. We're supposed to be reviewing the actual music on the album, remember? (And just for the record, I've had absolutely no trouble playing ANY DualDiscs on anything I own: computers, walkmans, DVD players, etc. I don't know; maybe I'm just lucky.)<br /><br />Anyway, I checked out Franz Ferdinand's self-titled debut album on a whim and found myself enjoying it greatly. Although it's still true that the music isn't for everyone, the guys continue with their great sound on their second album. There are several funky tracks to find as usual, like \\"Evil And a Heathen\\" and \\"The Fallen\\". Another good one is \\"Well That Was Easy\\", which sounds a little like Men Without Hats' \\"Pop Goes the World\\".<br /><br />But the best tracks on here would have to be the final track, \\"Outsiders\\", and the irresistible first single, \\"Do You Want To\\". What really surprised me, though, is that they can even score with mellow tracks. \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and \\"Fade Together\\" are wonderful escapes from their regular fare.<br /><br />Like on their first album, there's also one song on HERE that I can do without, which is \\"This Boy\\", because I don't think the lyrics make any sense. Now, some people may say, \\"When do ANY of their lyrics make sense?\\" which is a fair argument, but I think the lyrics in that song just don't work very well. Other than that, there's really no way you COULD have it so much better.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000028U0Y|1.0|I don't think anyone should be rewarding a convict by buying an album they made while incarcerated. Plus this music is depressing, isn't fun and doesn't rock. He even has an song glorifying Cocaine! While I'm sure Motley Crew and Warrant did there fair share of Cocaine at least they rocked and stayed out of prison. Plus the guitar solos are boring and use no effects like a wah wah peddle. Not recommended for fans who want to ROCK
B000002MIY|4.0|Nearly up there with his Nightfly CD, but not realy there at 5 stars quality. Nuff said. From the slick and funky  Track 1 Trans-Island Skyway, to Track 8 Teahouse on the tracks this one delivers. So what`s the magic with Donald Fagen ? First of all it`s very well produced by Walter Becker, who realy knows what \\"buttons\\" to switch on to get what we can called<br /><br />\\"the slick,jucy, and tastefull\\" Fagen sound, which should have been a quality trademark, like Coca Cola. The real thing. It`s very funky in a way, like Track 2 Countermoon is a good example of. Track 3 Springtime is one of my favourite, which brings me an ecco of Steely Dan at theire best. Track 4 Snowbound is an \\"overcool\\" joy to listen to.  Track 5 Tommorow girls is a funky and more upbeat Fagen at his best. On the rest of the tracks, it`s overall very stylish to listen to, but Track 7 On the Dunes, is a let down, but Track 8 Teahouse on the Tracks delivers. All in all Donald Fagen delivers once again. In other words this music realy surround`s you with joy, and delivers happines inside you. Fagen quality, in other words.
B00005YXZH|1.0|Well I heard these guys were influenced by country music so it was a relief to hear this album and find no fiddles or banjos but I've still gotta give it only one star because there's still no ROCK on it. There's some electronic bleeps for a while and it sounds like the rock may come but it rarley does. When it does it stops just as suddenly. When finally HEAVY METAL DRUMMER roles around its not heavy at all :( Instead it sounds like pop. Plus the solos are out of tune when they crop up at all. As a fan of rock music like Poison, Ratt or Cinderella I was very dissappointed with this release and do not recommend it to rock fans at all. Buy only if you want an album to put you to sleep.

B00005YUPO|5.0|My daughter is 6 months old and she absolutely loves this video! <br />If she is in the middle of crying and as soon as she hears the introduction for the video she stops and turns toward the TV. My 3 year old son will even sit down to watch it. Key words are SIT DOWN. He also sings along and repeats the foreign languages. <br />It's great to have something they can bothwatch. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of the Baby Einstein series and highly recommend them.
0307276902|3.0|hard to get thru,whether it's all true or not, because of his simplistic,raw style \\"and it hurt, and it hurt, and I cried and it hurt ,and I cried\\"...

B0002WZTOI|3.0|I was in the Navy for 10 years. Ten long years, and I can say I spent at least five of those years in some barracks, in some remote part of the United States, drunk watching a plethora of ever present war movies in the TV room. I hate war movies! I mean it from the bottom of my heart. War movies as a general rule are clich&eacute; ridden and rife with recycled plots and dialog and well, cheese. If you were like myself and actually worked on a nuclear submarine you would quickly realize just how god awful fake they are on top of all their other damning traits. But... there were two movies I always liked.<br /><br />One was 1982's 'An Officer and a Gentleman' starring a young and still good looking Richard Gere before he unleashed Julia Roberts on us in 1990's 'Pretty Woman'. The other was this movie right here. I don't think it was because these movies are about Navy Pilots in particular. Since I have difficulty seeing the great difference between Navy Pilots and Air Force Pilots as far as being some different breed or such. No, there had to be something that maybe I did not quite understand at first glance.<br /><br />Then came Quentin Tarantino's hilarious monologue in the 1994 movie 'Sleep With Me' where he sums up the plot description of 'Top Gun' with the line \\"It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality.\\" I have never ever been able to watch this film in the same way since. I don't know if Quentin was simply coming across with some demented comic jag for effect when he went off on this movie but ya know. If you honestly watch it closely and get beyond the basic music video imagery and listen to the dialog and focus on the subtle actions, it will happen, it will dawn on you.<br /><br />I'm sure you all know the story or have some idea of what it's about. The movie opens with Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards playing the parts of Goose and Maverick flying wingman to John Stockwell who plays the bit part Cougar. Cougar gets mentally screwed up after a close encounter with a Russian MiG and barely flies the plane back to the Aircraft Carrier while staring at a picture of his wife and kid. Anyway he gets back and promptly quits stating he loves his wife-and-kid too much. Here's your first clue. I mean, why does \\"wife-and-kid\\" suddenly become an issue?<br /><br />Next thing you know Goose and Maverick are heading off to Top Gun School because it's so realistic to send people with disciplinary problems to these expensive military schools you know. The next memorable scene is the famous bar scene where Maverick starts singing 'You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling' and all the other pilots in the bar join together to provide what now seems like a gay men's chorus. I mean who does this type of thing?<br /><br />Then there's the first time we see Viper played by a still good looking \\"older man\\" Tom Skerritt talking to the Top Gun students and the pilots are shown sitting paired up in twos in leather love seats. In each seat one guy has his arm draped along the back as if in some suggestive embrace. The pilot Hollywood whispers to his close buddy Wolfman beside him in the leather love seat \\"This gives me a hardon.\\" Wolfman leans in real close and says, \\"Don't tease me.\\"<br /><br />Here it is folks we are down the rabbit hole and don't go thinking it gets any better if you keep watching. Maverick is initially portrayed as a loner. A confused young guy who, unlike the rest of the Navy flyboys, does not seem to fit in, does not seem to understand the intimate relationship the other Navy pilots expect of him. Goose tries to talk to him. Goose tries to make him understand there is something he's not getting. Something about caring for the other pilots, about men being men with men. Maybe he wants Maverick to realize they are all spending an awful lot of time standing around the locker room half naked in towels for more than just plot points and male boob shots. Heh! Then more dialog take us further out into the void.<br /><br/>Charlie (The main female love interest, yeah right.) played by Kelly McGillis approaches Goose and Maverick in a hallway Goose sees her and turns to Maverick saying \\"Okay, well, don't be late again. You look great honey.\\" Maverick replies \\"Thanks, dear. See you in pre-flight.\\"<br /><br />Then the big bare chested volleyball scene. Poor Goose, the guy's won't let Goose play volleyball without his shirt on. While all the rest are proud to show off their sweaty pecs and trim abs. All the while the music bumps and grinds its way through Kenny Loggins (Yeah there's a butch guy for ya) singing 'Playing With The Boys'. I loved the scene where Goose pleads. \\"One more game, Please, For me?\\" If this were any other movie wouldn't Goose know where Maverick was going? He probably does and is just unwilling to let Maverick go that easily. I mean all the guys are there and they're all sweaty and maybe tonight...<br /><br />Maverick and Charlie have their first date and basically Maverick eats and runs saying he needs to get a shower. Does she not have a shower there? Plumbing problems perhaps? Not the right equipment? Next up is the elevator scene where we see Charlie decked out in a very masculine ball cap and leather flight jacket. That'll get him to notice her. Then Gooses wife-and-kid show up to present us with the fact that gay guys can have covers, I mean \\"families\\" too without conflicting with their most important relationship, the other Top Gun pilot. Carol, Goose's wife, seems to be trying real hard to sell Charlie on how fun it is to be married to a gay guy, I mean a Top Gun pilot.<br /><br />So I hope I am not spoiling anything by mentioning that the big drama in this movie is that Goose dies. Yep, that's too bad really because I think Goose was just about to get his way with Maverick on some sleepless night. Oh well, Viper poignantly consoles Maverick telling him about his valiant daddy and saying he would fly Maverick, I mean \\"fly with Maverick\\" anytime.<br /><br />Now, here's where I disagree with Quentin Tarantino and allot of other commentators. At the end of the movie, we may have gotten that big scene between Val Kilmer who plays Iceman and Mavericks main competition, the all around humpy, critical, fly-by-the-book type to Mavericks rebel-without-a-date. Yes, Iceman and Maverick do have a brief moment at the end of the film, after the gay Navy guys beat the Russians with their joy sticks, where Iceman finally indicates to the rest of the pilots by hugging and making doe eyes, that Maverick is finally now one of them.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />What does Maverick actually do? He runs back to Top Gun school to become a flight instructor and work under that stud daddy Viper. Yeah, you can think all you want that Maverick is gonna be with Iceman or even that oh so remote chance of ever happening, Charlie. That is, if you ignored everything I just pointed out to you. But in my twisted mind its Tom Cruise and Tom Skerritt flying off into the sunset mano y mano. That humpy older guy showing the young guy the ropes deal. Because as we all know if it was good enough for dad, then it's good enough for Maverick.<br /><br />The thought of Tom Cruise being Tom Skerritt's sex toy should make Brooke Sheilds feel a little bit better..  <br /> <br />Charlie (The main female love interest, yeah right.) played by Kelly McGillis approaches Goose and Maverick in a hallway Goose sees her and turns to Maverick saying \\"Okay, well, don't be late again.

B00005NGZX|5.0|Not that I could really add anything to the argument at this point as to why this is such an amazing and astonishing album, I thought I'd go ahead and add to the endless praise that this album receives. And believe me, it deserves every ounce of it. On every level of craft, be it lyrically, musically, atmospherically, or any other word with -ly at the end which you can think of, \\"Jane Doe\\" amazes. At some points you may catch yourself wondering how can Converge keep up this insanely intense and chaotic atmosphere throughout the course of a whole record. Very few bands have ever been able to match the intensity that Converge displays not only on their records, but in their live shows as well, let alone surpass that, and \\"Jane Doe\\" is a shining example why. Search the endless sea of hardcore and metalcore filler that is all over the music scene at the moment, and I guarantee you'll never find a record that closely equals this one in musicianship or feeling. If you've never listened to this record at this point, then stop reading this now, and simply purchase it.    In past albums Converge had suffered with problems in their recordings, whether it be production issues or something else, and even though every record they have put out has been amazing, the production on \\"Jane Doe\\" really takes the cake. It's rigid and raw just like the music, and it adds so much to the mood. Hits like the scorching opener \\"Concubine\\" and \\"The Broken Vow\\" take this increased value in production and leap forward miles. Vocally Bannon pulls out every trick he can muster this time around, as shown from his raging witch-like screams and his haunting melodies that creep in occasionally (check \\"The Broken Vow\\" and the title track for examples of these chilling melodies). I stick by my word when I say that his voice has never sounded better than it does on this recording. Kurt constructed some of the most technical and brutal guitar compositions of Converge's career, and it's shown off well in places like the raging \\"Bitter And The Some\\" and the disturbing, slow-moving \\"Hell To Pay\\". And if you happen to never have listened to this record by some chance, you should buy it simply for the title track alone. It's undoubtably one of the best written and most accomplished metal/hardcore songs ever. Ben continues to amaze on the drums (one of his best performances indeed) and shows why he is one of the most regarded musicians in the heavy music world. \\"Homewrecker\\" and \\"Phoenix In Flight\\" are great examples of his extraordinary talent. Coupled with Nate's untouchable bass playing, Converge has one of the best rhythm section's you're likely to hear. Period.    I could never really do this record justice, even if I went on for days about how good it is. This is simply a must own. Not a must listen, a must sample, or anything of that nature, A MUST OWN. If you're a Converge fan and you don't own this, I have to question why (although maybe you began with \\"You Fail Me\\", which is ok, and in which case you should purchase this immediately). If you're a fan or heavy or extreme music, then you most likely know the name Converge, and if you don't, what better time than now to uncover it. Those expecting typical sub-standard metalcore full of breakdowns and catchy choruses need not apply. This is a whole 'nother ballpark. Otherwise don't even hesistate to get one of the best records of the last decade. Believe the hype. You won't be sorry.
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer's true tale about a young man with wanderlust that takes him to the Alaskan bush will provide you with plenty to think about and ponder.  Krakauer writes a brilliant book with just the right tempo and feel to it.  I love it that this guy's story is told even though a lot of people would view him as an abject failure.  I thought he could teach us all a few lessons - recommended for all readers.
B000002HMH|1.0|Plain and simple, this is not metallica, this is cowboy music.<br /><br />Not only have they released crappy albums, they destroy all their old material when they play them live.  I really hope they call it quits or die.
0553801503|3.0|I just re-read A Storm of Swords in anticipation of receiving A Feast For Crows. In such a detailed story this is usually useful in making character connections, but I find that it didn't help me one bit. The characters in Feast For Crows are constantly referencing conversations from 2,500 pages ago, leaving me with the feeling I get when I walk into a movie 15 minutes late. <br /> <br />I have read some of the reviews for Feast and they were getting my ire up. I thought to myself, \\"Give George a break. He's written 3 books, over 3,000 pages of sheer delight. He hasn't been well, and in every life (fictional, too) there has to be a little downtime.\\" I now suspect that the pressure of all of us fans screaming for our next fix affected the quality of this book. Some of the conversations, which have flowed so naturally in the past, just seem so forced and, well, phoney. What is up with the rampant overuse of the word \\"nuncle\\"?  <br /> <br />NOUN: Chiefly British An uncle: \\"Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\\" (Shakespeare).   <br />ETYMOLOGY: From the phrases an uncle, mine uncle  <br /> <br />I actually pulled out the last 2 books to make sure it wasn't used commonly by the iron born in the past. In this book, almost everyone is using it in place of uncle (and there are a lot of uncles). It's everywhere, and while annoying when Jaime uses it to refer to Ser Kevan, it becomes really odd when the Greyjoys use it constantly in their chapters. I am not an English major, but the phrase, \\"...my nuncle...\\" just seems to be an improper use of the word. The first time I saw it in the book I thought it was a typo, and by the middle of the book, it's overuse was affecting my enjoyment.  I also had to look up valonqar, since Tyrion was strictly \\"The Imp\\" or \\"the dwarf\\" in Storm, and did anyone else feel unsettled by how useless nipples are on a breastplate? With all the talk of making this book smaller than the last and all the people that had to be involved in it's culling,I think someone should have felt the awkwardness, that really has nothing to do with it being a book about half of the characters. Sure, I miss Bran and Rickon, and I would love to know more about Ayra. But I am a grown up, and I can wait for the next chapter in their lives to come together naturally. <br /> <br />I am hoping this is just a stepping stone to a much anticipated Dragons. Write on Mr. Martin, in your own sweet time, in your (usually) wonderful way. <br />
B00020X88O|5.0|...to show in full just how great this movie was. By great, I mean F-ing hilarious, because the movie was so bad. But, sometimes infamy is a very good thing; Plan 9 from Outerspace, for example. <br />Despite the shoddy content of this movie, it doesn't mean that I don't enjoy it. From the puking scene in the beginning, the pool scene, Nomi's constant drama and, well, mental-ness; seriously, she kept being the victim, even though she screwed up everyone's life: the one black guy who tried to help her so many times; her friend Molly, though unintentional; Crystal Conners, suffering a severely broken hip; Zach, getting a loogie in his perfectly coiffed hair. She shows no remorse throughout. Oh yeah, I forgot the lapdance scene; she also ruined a pair of Zach's dress pants. ;P. <br />Anywho, I mentioned the NC-17 version because it spares no detail. Some of the scenes are pretty graphic; I won't say what they are, but rest assured, they're not in the R-rated version. This version is the only version worth seeing.
B00009V7P8|2.0|First off, i would like to say that this is NOT a bad album.  I'm not sure why people say he has a bad voice.  I think its very good.  I had heard the blower's daughter and cannon ball prior to the purchase of this cd.  I thought they were both great and figured he would have some harder songs to go along with it.  Mixed in with some poppier songs, this album would be great, but after about the third track it just bores me to tears. Definately not an album for \\"rockers\\" The other down cd is that it just seems so freakin depressing at times . . i'd feel less depressed if i lost both my arms.  Thats all
B000002L7R|5.0|I love Prince music.  Some looked at this album as a step down from Purple Rain but that is complete b.s.  It is more of a creative artistic move from Prince and The Revolution.  My personal favorite track is The Ladder.  The back up vocals are superb from Wendy, Lisa, Susannah, and Taja Sevelle.  I love it.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|THis moive deserves kudos for treading a new course in the way vampires and werewolves are percieved. To give the two a common ancestry and to focus a movie on that alone allows a freedom to have a viable plot apart from the lame hunting and slaying of humans. <br /> The weaving of Nighy's and Beckinsale's history into the film grants a humanity that extends the scope of acceptance to viewers who are not intimately familiar or even remotely interested in Vampire or Werewolf lore. As well extending the plot beyond the baseless erradication of one \\"species\\" by the other to the bloodline experiment that results in the creation of a \\"new\\" creature is genius.  <br /> Provided that the writing of the sequel is of equal calibre I will be camping outside my local AMC or EDWARDS CINEMA; unless I have to work.  <br /> I own this movie because the writing and acting were phenomenal. Though I grant that supernatural beings can combat each other without the aid of pistols and sub-machine guns; is it too far a stretch that these characters take advantage of technoligical advance to wage war. That assertion is as absurd as aking that The current Iran Invasion be fought in trenches as in the second world war. Is it also too taxing on the imagination that over centuries a werewolf be able to master the change, as to not be affected by the moon and to change at whim, it detracts little from their cause as these werewolves are very much embracing their state. (a characteristic less oft displayed of those bitten.)  <br />  <br />Let's be serious, these are ficticious creatures to begin with, the reasoning of which is left to the writer to invent. To discredit the movie because the Vampires elect not morph into mist, or bat is childish. write your own movie and the creature can behave in a manner befitting of your expectation.   <br /> <br />Hope this review aids your dicision to rent or OWN this classic-to-be. <br />

0345357116|5.0|I am fascinated with Tolkien's linguistic ability, as well as with his incredibly active and creative mind. This book, in conjunction with several of his other titles, helps put proverbial meat on the bones of the Lord of the Rings triology and gives insight into the depth, complexity, and seeming historicity of the trilogy. Delving into Unfinished Tales is like diving into a pool that looks deceptively shallow, but the further in you go, the deeper it becomes. No wonder Middle Earth feels so real; these stories show that Middle Earth truly existed - in the author's mind.<br /><br />I sometimes find Tolkien's many characters and terms difficult to keep separate (it took me 2 or 3 tries to get through the Silmarillion), but his lore is very rewarding and worth the wrestling!
B0000640SA|5.0|I must admit Memento won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I honestly think that this is one of the best movies ever made. To swoon on, I think it's the BEST moviescript EVER written. I see Memento as a perfect circle; you can join the story at any given point and it would make structual sense. But at the same time you can join the story at any given point and it would still leave you with lots of questions of what happened before, what happened after and what is the actual TRUTH. The more you watch the movie the more answers you will have, but at the same time still more questions will arise. Isnt that what we ask of a movie - to keep us entertained after multiple viewings? If ever aliens visited earth and wanted  samples of our movie industry, I would be sure to include MEMENTO as one of the prime examples of human achievement. If you love movies and havent seen this one yet - let me go back to the beginning (little Memento humour) and remind you to see it.
B00006LLNU|4.0|To be honest, i had never heard of Sigur Ros until i seen Vanilla Sky. I became obsessed with the last song they play at the end scenes of the film. I later found out it was (Njosnavelin) track 4 on the () album, so i ordered the album and listened to Njosnavelin over and over again thinking to myself \\"no way could the rest of the album be like this\\". I was wrong for all the right reasons. This album is genius, i've listened to it countless times, feeling inspired and uplifted like no other music i have listened to before. This is music for any hour of the day, every week of the year. If Sigur Ros produce another album as powerful as this one, it's mine no matter what other music critic's say about it. Do yourself a favour, BUY THIS ALBUM.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had not heard of this series until it was already out on DVD. Upon finding it in the TV section of my local Blockbuster, I was curious enough to rent the first disc, solely to watch the pilot episode. Little did I know that I would wind up staying up until 2 in the morning to watch the entire disc!!! I was enthralled with this totally original, totally funny and totally fun sci-fi gem. The next day I rushed out to rent disc 2, I just had to see what happened next. <br /> <br />While not what one would consider a traditional futuristic science fiction premise (People still use horses as a prime means of transportation 500 years from now?), Firefly has enough of something for everyone from hardcore Trekkers to those who have little or no sci-fi experience. The cast is superb. The stories are fun and engaging, and the special effects are excellent. I dare anyone who watches this show to not be singing (humming, at least) the title song (Ballad of Serenity) for days afterward. <br /> <br />I'm sorry that the series lasted only 13 episodes. It is a far greater credit to creator Joss Whedon than either of his previous series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel (Apologies to fans of those shows. Nothing against them. I'm just not a vampire fan.) <br /> <br />Imagine my delight when I unwrapped this set on Christmas morning as a gift from my wife. One of the best presents ever!
0385510454|4.0|I truly enjoyed the plot of this book....in addition to being an interesting piece of fiction, it actually inspired two new year's resolutions for me - one, to learn the Italian language, and two, to plan a trip to Italy.
0786715103|5.0|THE TRUTH IS ALL PEOPLE ON EARTH ARE ARRANGED BY TWO MEN INTO PATTERNS  THAT PLEASE THEM. THE PATTERNS SPELL NO NO NO BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO  WRITE SYMBOLS. YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT ACTS WITH YOUR BODY.    One of the most refreshing thing about this book is that unlike an American, General Dallaire absolutely refuses to talk about religion and to God-wallop.    An American general would be spewing his religion about the shop to no effect in a Rwanda where people took refuge in Christian churches, only to be killed. Fortunately, the only reference to religion is in a sardonic Canadian army name for the morning briefing, morning prayers.    This is symptomatic of a deeper honesty and a refusal at any time to strike humanitarian poses.    Dallaire's mission, it appears from this believable source, was deprived absolutely of the resources they needed to prevent the Rwandan genocide of 1994 nor by example subsequent genocide in Sierra Leone and Rwanda itself (in 2003).    At the end, they were eating expired German rations and in firefights had to count their rounds.    Nonetheless, the US and Britain today are plotting to \\"re-engineer\\" the UN.    Any corporate employee knows what this means. It is the use of the pseudo-scientific language of tradeoffs to deprive the operational people, the people who engage reality as did Dallaire, of what they need to do the job...and then blame them for \\"defects of character\\" when they, like Dallaire are discovered in their sorrow and anger passed out in a park in Ottawa.    One tradeoff is mentioned by Dallaire. A Pentagon analyst called him long-distance and in the course of the conversation, mentioned that his rule was that one American soldier equals 85000 Rwandans.     The pseudo-science makes it hard to even recollect that considering one person a fraction of another person has a long history in America: its original Constitution rated black people at 3 fifths of white people.    Dallaire's book is a *cri de couer* from a man who's enough of a man to be unashamed of being either Francophone (with the French language's ability to remember that \\"evil\\", as in \\"faire mal\\" is a transitive verb that demands the naming of the victim) or scarred by what he saw.    He's indeed unique as a soldier of flag rank to be victimised by post-traumatic stress and he speaks for thousands of soldiers from America and elsewhere who do the dirty work and are ill-served, in America, by the Veteran's \\"administration\\".    Of course, he speaks from his own position and experience and can always be said not to have the \\"big picture\\". But it appears that the big picture is the pleasure and convenience of elites in the metropolis whose leaders always insist on separate commands and won't provide for any UN intervention between \\"section six\\" (unarmed peacekeepers who are ineffective when one or both of the warmakers are Fascist thugs) and \\"section seven\\" (a self serving invasion of a country by regular troops: a specialty of the French and now, in Iraq, the US).    No actual sacrifice need be made for black people or people with the bad taste to be Moslem, in other words.    The book is also an excellent introduction to the Rwandan situation which clearly was the war of a capital F Fascist group (the RGF and Interhamwe, with the latter thugs doing the dirty work) and a group which, like the Bosnians, evolved to small f fascism in response (the RPF under Paul Kagame who is now the leader of Rwanda).    \\"Even-handedness\\" and Mercutio's overused and out of context line from Romeo and Juliet, \\"a plague on both your houses\\" produces, we now can conclude, a Fascist group to whom it's only natural to respond in near-kind. The leaders of the world then watch like dull schoolboys as the two condemned men roll in the mud, hoping their trousers don't get soiled.    They then rush to ingratiate themselves with the winner, except in cases of clear and documented mass murder, and sometimes even then. In Rwanda's case, Lake Victoria had to reek of the dead before the US got around to expelling the Rwandan embassy, and this was after communiques from General Dallaire that spelled out who was doing what.    The invisibility of the victim, and their subsequent celebration in maudlin visits by Western \\"stars\\" is recognizable on the streets of America. It was recognizable in an America where President Bush had to be forced to watch Rwandan style videos of bloated black bodies before his feeble response to Katrina.    This is because President Bush is clearly himself a thug who in the situation that obtained in Kigali would do anything to ingratiate himself with the RGF. The response that Dallaire documents was beyond hypocrisy, so beyond as to be a type of brutal honesty.    Some people matter, and some people don't. And one is wise, if one is a North American homeowner, not to get to hot around the collar about victims lest one joins them.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I don't get cable, so Firefly was one of the many TV shows that pass me right by.  But there were rumblings and references out there that caught my attention.  Libertarians remarked on this series that involved a doughty little band of scavengers trying to make a living under the noses of the ultimate bureaucratic do-gooders, the Alliance.  (The Alliance is a sort of Big Nanny alternative to Orwell's harsher Big Brother.)  There was even a glowing review of the series in a self-reliance-type magazine.    So I saw the movie \\"Serenity\\" first, which was everything I thought it would be.  Now I've watched most of the Firefly series and find it highly addictive.  The characters are interesting, the dialogue snappy and funny, and the mix of the old, wild West and outer space intriguing.   This is one of the best TV series I've seen since the \\"Paper Chase\\" in the late 1970s.  Unfortunately both series suffered cancellation after one season, a drastic comment on the American public's tastes.      What a shame.  TV shows like Firefly only come along once in a very great while.  What a gold mine of viewing pleasure this show could have been for years, if given the chance.
0307276902|1.0|Frey's \\"story\\" comes on like a locomotive , fast and strong, and hopes to swoop up the reader for a thrilling ride into the world of addiction, rehab, and sobriety. But even before the Smoking Gun expose lots of people with authentic addiction and rehab experience sniffed Frey's book out as fabrication and characteristic of the user who wants others to believe that they were \\"heavyweights\\" or some type of olympian addict with a superhuman appetite and capacity for substances complete with  <br />the outlaw image.  <br /> <br />For your information , rehab centers are full of pathological liars who change their stories to suit their audience in an effort to arrive at a version that delivers maximal shock value to the listner. It seems to me that the bulk of Frey fans appear to be people with little practical experience with addiction and rehab and the fight to stay sober - so they don't really know if he is on the level or not. They just enjoy the roller-coaster ride he offers and ,like some roadside car wreck scene, they just can't turn away. Frey sounds very much to me like a merely average average addict who wishes to be \\"somebody\\" even if it is an anti-hero who must lie and deceive to get the attention and status they want.  <br /> <br />Another thing. Some Frey supporters say things like \\"well what difference does it make ? Its still a good story\\". Look. Frey's <br />fabrications devalue the real experiences had by real addicts and people who have fought their way to a clean way of life. A major concept in rehab is to strip away the bulls***t in one's life and stop the lying and self deception that is characteristic of the addiction lifestyle. So Frey dumps on that and especially dumps on it when he suggests that 12 step programs aren't effective and that he somehow muscled his way to sobriety through sheer will. <br /> <br />When The Smoking Gun story broke he categorically denies all allegations that he fabricated or embellished yet on LArry King (just two days later) he admits that he did these things and spent the bulk of the show attempting to show literary precendent for this \\"practice\\". But which is it ? One day you say you didn't do it then two days later you say you did ? And if you admit that some of the content was embellished or fabricated then to what extent was it accomplished ? This will never end. This book is written in a calculated style to sensationalize his alleged lifestyle as an uber-addict that was at odds with society and the authorities - a modern day James Dean. Nice story but is it true ?
B0001MDPV8|5.0|The word \\"classic\\" is thrown around quite abit. What makes a classic? If it has acceptable lyrics, is it a classic? Does it have to have inspiring beats? Does it have to be accepted by underground hip hop heads? Does it have to cross a 10 year period for it to obtain \\"classic status\\"? Not necessarly. Nasir Jones debut \\"Illmatic\\" was a classic the day it was released. It was accepted by everyone. Reading all the respectable reviews on this album, everyone seems to know what an impact \\"Illmatic\\" was in the hip hop generation.<br /><br />In 1994, Nas lead the Golden Hip Hop Era with his debut of street poetry and intellegent street rhymes. Tracks like \\"NY State Of Mind\\" and \\"The World Is Yours\\" (Produced by Pete Rock) is just some small examples of perfect lyricism. \\"Life's A B****\\" features AZ comming off hungry on the mic and Nas carring out the second verse with rhymes like \\"When I was young at this, I used to do my thing hard/robbing foriegners, take their wallets and jewels, and rip their green cards/dip to the projects, fast, in my quick cash/got my first piece of (...), smoking blunts with hash...\\", while his father Olu Dara closes off the track with a trumpet solo. Q-Tip produced the dedicated lyrical letter \\"One Love\\" to Cormega who was incarcerated at the time, that carries a nice xylophone beat, makes it one of my favorite tracks on this album. Another one of my favorites is the head nodding last track \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\", ending this album off on a good note. Production is curteosy of DJ Primer, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, Large Professor.<br /><br />And if you purchased this in 2004, it has been remastered (for people like me who were too young to buy this at the time) with a bonus disc. The bonus disc features some remixes of some of the origonal tracks, and some newly recorded tracks that Nas made. The remix tracks I like is the \\"Life's A B**** (Remix)\\" and \\"The World Is Yours (Remix)\\", because they are able to match the origonals in a way, but stll allowing them to matain their clasic status. \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell (Remix)\\" and \\"One Love (Remix)\\" are good too, but to me, they don't carry the vibe of the origonals. The recently recorded tracks \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"On The Real\\" are good additions to the bonus disc, as neither track fails.<br /><br />To think, many people were raised off of classics like these. Every track is rememberable in it's own way (even the opening skit is rememberable), as Nas' street poetry, and the production in this album takes hip hop into a new height. We all know Nas (or anyone else) has never topped this album, but he has came close to it under many ocassions. Whats really sad about this is that there are people out there who claim to listen to hip hop, but never heard this album at all. Well, if you don't have this album and you claim to be a \\"Hip Hop Head\\" shame on you. If you're new to hip hop (not rap people!) and are looking to start a classic hip hop collection, I recommend that this will be the first album you pick up, then go from there. Hear how a classic is really made.<br /><br />Lyrics: A+<br /><br />Production: A+<br /><br />Musical Vibes: A+<br /><br />Overall: A+<br /><br />Favorite Tacks: They all stand out and my favorite in its own way, including the remixes.ng them to matain their clasic status. \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell (Remix)\\" and \\"One Love (Remix)\\" are good too, but to me, they don't carry the vibe of the origonals.

B000006045|5.0|This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  \\"Angel,\\" \\"Risingson,\\" \\"Teardrop,\\" and \\"Inertia Creeps\\". \\"Angel\\" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. \\"Risingson\\" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. \\"Teardrop\\" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. \\"Inertia Creeps\\" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.
0446577383|2.0|My husband was raving about Baldacci's books so I finally decided to try one. I heard some vague rumors about the Camel Club being a timely story (it was an interview, I think), and the conspiracy afficionado that I am I picked it up. And then... I put it down after forcing myself to read through about 1/3 of the story. Now, I fullheartedly agree with those who describe America as the ultimate rogue who replaced the soviet as the number 1 evil and would've loved to read an intelligent, if fictional story about it. Unfortunatelly Camel Club read like something the author had tossed off over the weekend, with predictable and shallow characters and such poor writing it was hard to believe it came from somoeone who sold \\"millions\\" of books.  <br />This was my first and last Baldacci story.
B00000255F|5.0|Such a shame that certain prior reviewers have allowed their political beliefs to warp their musical judgment.  Their utterly foolish remarks hardly warrant any further comment, other than this:  I am so sorry that you are unable to appreciate the achievement that \\"Born to Run\\" represents.  This one of the finest records ever made.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is a great film that will age well. In one respect it soars above most military and historical epics. It does a better job than any film I know of in getting at the philosophy behind what the military calls \\"the warrior ethos.\\"  It illustrates that philosophy and psychology better than any of the U.S. military services' assorted creeds, codes and oaths. Historically the Just War Tradition has always centered on protection of the weak and unarmed, those unable to defend themselves. Scott elevates the ideas of selflessness and defense of the innocent to the controlling ideas of the film. A maturing sense of honor is the driving force behind development of the main character Balian (the Army should pay to use this epic as a training film). <br /> <br />In the film Saladin is a reluctant cynic who has morally resigned himself to the dirtiness of his business while doing his best to avoid war. His counterpart among the Jerusalem Christians is the character Tiberias, the king's military commander, portrayed well by Jeremy Irons. The uneasy peace held tenuously together by Saladin, King Baldwin, and Tiberias keeps the ideological dogs of war at bay.  <br /> <br />When everything they've struggled to maintain falls apart, one pure knight (Bloom as Balian) is able to salvage some order from the chaos. I disagree with those who think he is miscast. His laconic humility fits the script well. When Saladin decides to besiege Jerusalem, Balian's speech to the forces defending the city ranks with Shakespeare's Saint Crispin's Day \\"band of brothers\\" speech put into Henry V's mouth at Agincourt. In my opinion Balian's words are better, certainly more profound if not more poetic, and the humbleness of his character is key to his message. <br /> <br />Other aspects of the film that ring true are Balian's and Saladin's respect for their own dead and regret over the losses of war. The despicable manipulative influence and interference by churchmen in the film also strikes an important chord: priestcraft emerges as the root of all evil. One cannot escape the images of superstition in the film and how they variously work to undo reason and order. Balian rises to the occasion in the image of a world-weary savior, one whose moral compass has escaped the trammels of religious prejudice. <br /> <br />The film is loaded with fine acting. From my perspective, Ridley Scott just gets better with age.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I first saw this documentary on my local PBS station when I was in the hospital. The first thing I did when I got home was order this DVD. I still watch it frequently because there are so many subtleties that you need to see it again and again to appreciate what a truly masterful piece of work that Scorsese made here. My musical preferences were forged during the 50's and 60's folk revival era. Perhaps the most important new figure to have arrived during that time was Bob Dylan. This DVD paints a rare portrait using tones and settings that are indescribably effective. For instance, while riding on a train to who-knows-where, Tony Glover tells of how Dylan came back to Minnesota from NYC able to pick and play the harmonica as if he had made a deal with the devil at the crossroads.  Dylan jokingly corroborates the story. And, Liam Clancy relates his Dylan anecdotes over a pint of Guiness at a bar where a mural of a very shocked looking visage of Dylan Thomas presides. Rare performances and very early recordings punctuate this most riveting documentary.  <br /> <br />Pete Seeger referred to the folk performers of that day as all being \\"Woody's children.\\" In this documentary, Scorsese has put together a very fine family reunion  <br /> <br />        <br />
B000002OX3|4.0|Like so many mid-60's UK groups the Who saved their best songs for their singles. The group's first two albums are a varying inconsistent mix of great-to-weak originals and cover versions. Despite those drawbacks, \\"A Quick One\\" is a legendary British Pop album, and a necessary listen for Who fans to find out how this band quickly evolved to create their later masterpieces. Get around the weaker tracks and you'll discover the amazing title track (foreshadowing \\"Tommy\\" by 2 years) and the Power Pop classic \\"So Sad About Us\\" which was later covered by The Jam.    This CD has come out in the USA in 3 Versions - all from MCA.    1) The original \\"A Quick One (Happy Jack)\\" CD from the late 80's - with a \\"Compact Disc-Compact Price\\" ad on the insert and a generic green design back with a simple track listing. The sound quality ranges from tinny to muddy due to MCA's using of the old LP master tape (and some tracks appear in simulated stereo just like they did on the original Decca/MCA album). No bonus cuts, but it does have the original version of \\"Happy Jack\\" which SHOULD have been included in the remastered version to keep us American fans happy. If you're curious about this album you can pick this CD up dirt cheap...but I recommend the later versions.    2) The remastered CD with notes and bonus cuts from 1995. But most of this CD used the mono mixes instead, along with some cuts in stereo and simulated stereo. Producer Jon Astley told ICE magazine that he used the mono mixes because he thought they sounded better. The original master tapes were stored at former Who manager Kit Lambert's house in France and were possibly destroyed in a flood decades ago, so Astley couldn't remix them.     3) The remastered album with the same number and packaging, but now back in Stereo. My copy had a sticker that said \\"CLASSIC WHO remixed & remastered in STEREO for the first time\\". If it doesn't have that sticker don't buy it. Since 1995 copies of the master tapes have been discovered and the entire album has been remixed almost in true stereo (Almost because \\"See My Way\\" appears once again in fake stereo). The rest of the album has never sounded better. Tracks like \\"Heatwave\\" and \\"Don't Look Away\\" that were originally in distorted fake stereo now jump out of the speakers with a powerful true stereo presence. This is the version of \\"A Quick One\\" you should buy.
B0000004V2|5.0|The hearing of this work - for me 1990 - was a benchmark in my experience of popular/alternative/dance/rock music.  Quite amazingly as well, was hearing for the first time, about the same time, Joy Division's Closer (both from Factory and Manchester) - two guiding hallmarks of the finest virtuosity - in lyric and music - still to this day.  Even if it's not within your regular musical tastes - it's worth, at least, one hearing...
0064407667|5.0|since this is the 1st book in the series, its got to be good so you can look forward to reading the rest. <br /> <br />The book has a unique writing style. A good chunk of the book is Lemony Snicket telling readers about how his life is as unfortunate as the Baudelaires, or about things you should never ever do in your life. <br /> <br />The book does a good job on portaying how evil a person Count olaf is, and the ending makes it clear that this story is far from over. <br /> <br />Although a realy good series, I'm suprised that its classified as a childeren's book. Later books can be quite violent and at least 1 person dies in most of the books. I guess its classified as \\"children\\" based on its difficulty, not content. <br /> <br />Read it and if you like it, there's plenty more in store for you
0307276902|1.0|James Frey's controversial memoir, \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" tells the tale of Frey's battle with drug and alcohol addiction. Told during Frey's rocky rehab stay, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is nothing if not emotionally charged and jolting.<br /><br />With that being said, I did not like this book at all. I don't even care, and will not go into the debate about fictionalized aspects of this book. Judging the books solely on its content, writing style, readability, I have to say that this book was very disappointing. I commend Mr. Frey for conquering his demons and whatnot, but maybe he shouldn't have written about it.<br /><br />The book is poorly written. I am not at all sure what the irregular capitalization is about, but it is very hard to read. That working in conjunction with the almost complete lack of punctuation makes it even harder going. I had to re-read so many sentences, trying desperately to figure out how the sentence was supposed to read, that I didn't want to go on at times.<br /><br />Frey came off as completely arrogant. I didn't like his \\"voice\\" at the narrator of this book, nor did I care for how he belabored points and detailed the endless minutia of rehab life.<br /><br />Basically, thanks to Oprah, this books has gotten way more hype that it deserves. I wouldn't recommend it at all and Mr. Frey can cut me a check for the $8 I spent on this waste of paper and words.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I took a date to see Pride and Prejudice, and I expected to sleep through the whole thing.  The girl I took was a huge Jane Austen fan, but I never was.  My parents love the A&E version, but I never could get through it.  I went in with the same expectation and was completely wrong.  Keira Knightly's performance is her best to date.  If she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, something is wrong.  The film is bright, cheerful, and funny.  The supporting cast is wonderful, but Rosamund Pike and Donald Sutherland stand out.  Guys, don't worry.  I usually hate chick flicks too, but this is one that guys could handle taking dates to.  So don't have too much pride or predjudice, judge it for youself.  And I will buy this one on DVD.
0385334206|5.0|This book is quite possibly the best Vonnegut has ever written.  He is already my favorite author, but this is simply stunning.  However, this book is not a good first if you are just getting into Vonnegut.  The style that makes it as good as it is can be hard to digest for people not used to Vonnegut. <br /> <br />This novel, in more ways than one, is a work of art.  Vonnegut's novels are like a giant collage.  He takes a bunch of meaningless junk, adds some humor, and puts it together to build a coherent picture that tells a powerful story.  (Anyone who thinks penis sizes isn't meaningless junk cannot appreciate this book). <br /> <br />All in all, an excellent story, full of witty drawings by Vonnegut himself, that is well worth the time and money.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I rate this movie 4&1/2 stars. The movie surrounds 3 major story lines that is not your typical linear film but does eventually connect,  like Pulp Fiction or Go. I first saw this movie with low expectatcions due to all the negative vibe surrounding the film from word of mouth. Some of these critics are much too hard on films that is not meant to be taken seriously!! It's a comic book movie with an ultra violent tone and is not for everyone. If you like movies like Fight Club, Four Rooms, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, I think you will not be disappointed. What are we all so politically correct that we have to set proper guidelines to make it a good movie?  The tone of the movie is very well done with the scenery of the set, the black and white vintage feel with emphasis of color on eyes, lips and other features that I feel are important characteristics that bring out the characters and style.  The mood and music is very well done! Also an extremely good all star cast for the film.  Jessica Alba is supper hot, and so is Rosario Dawson in this film.  5 stars on the film scoring for Robert Rodriguez.  One of the best films of 2005 for sure!!
B00000I5Y6|4.0|I bought this for my brother. He said it sounded good, but it wouldn't play on one of his CD players. He tried it on another CD player and his computer and it played just fine. Go figure. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Director:  Milos Forman <br />Cast:  F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Charles Kay. <br />Running Time:  160 minutes <br />Rated R for some violence, nudity, and language. <br /> <br />Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amadeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.  The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says \\"Ah, how about...?\\" he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying \\"Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!\\" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with an emotionless face \\"I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank. <br /> <br />Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constance played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constance is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music.  Like other landmark movies, \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"Psycho,\\" \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,\\" and \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Amadeus\\" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard; the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it. <br /> <br />Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constance, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.  That's a good way to describe \\"Amadeus,\\" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well. <br /> <br />Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is, it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism, as \\"Amadeus\\" is one of the most beautifully constructed, eloquent films of the last twenty-five years.  Truly exceptional, entertaining, and engrossing even if you aren't a Mozart fan or a devoted fan of music in general. <br />
B000CNEO1G|5.0|I purchased this CD at a recital Ms. Balsom was performing at.  After having had the privilege of not only hearing this CD, but hearing her perform in person and meeting her for myself; I can HIGHLY recommend this CD.<br /><br />Ms. Balsom's mastery of the trumpet is obvious in this CD.  She sings beautifully throughout the instrument's full dynamic range, and her technical prowess is certainly as good as any of the \\"larger name\\" recording artists of today.  Her interpretations are very solid as well.<br /><br />This is a great CD to buy for anyone looking for a good recording of Bach's music rearranged for trumpet (the modern trumpet had not been designed yet in Bach's time).  It's also worth mentioning that many of the arrangements performed on this CD were arranged by Ms. Balsom herself.
0783225857|5.0|When my children were about 9 years old, as part of their reading assignments (not assigned by a school), I gave them a copy of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" to read. I am Black and I raised my children to be proud of being Black. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" serves as a good platform to discuss racism, friendship, & discrimination (both racial and special disabilities).  One of the DVD reviewers stated something about the topic of dated racism in the depression era - Well there is nothing \\"dated\\" about racism in the South or anywhere else.  Although much progress has been made, events in Jasper,Texas and New York in recent years serve as reminders that we have a long way to go and much to learn.  I'd recommend everyone to see this movie at least once, and to discuss at length.
B0000069NM|3.0|An enjoyable but somewhat repetitious foray into jazz-funk land. If you're familiar with the sharp-nine chord, that will tell you everything you need to know about this recording and its feel. For me, it became refreshing on the rare cuts where a different harmonic pallette was used. I got the sense that most of the tunes were throw-aways that may have been concocted on the fly. Nothing too wrong with that (see Kind of Blue), but if you're looking for something more, look elsewhere. Good party record, though.
B000286RKW|5.0|1st of all if u havent seen this then get out of your shell.<br /><br />i watched a doc about henry hill not to long ago and the movie is about 95% true if not more..<br /><br />  see this movie now, buy it now!
B00005ATQF|4.0|Director:  Stanley Kubrick <br />Cast:  Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Dorian Harewood, Kevyn Major Howard, Arliss Howard, Ed O'Ross, John Terry. <br />Running Time:  116 minutes <br />Rated R for extreme violence and extreme language. <br /> <br />The training of war ends up being a darkly humorous adventure for the men going into the Vietnam War. A crazed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) puts his men through hell on Earth. The Tet Offensive becomes a story of its own. Men develop dehumanized personalities and others lose their minds. Turmoil prevails. Gallows humor and war violence erupts on the big screen. This is \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" raw, hard, and one of the best war movies made in the last quarter century.  One of Stanley Kubrick's best, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a unique take on the Vietnam War, and while it isn't the best war movie out there, it is certainly amazing: Breathtaking cinematography is one of the film's strongest aspects, and a fantastic performance by R. Lee Ermey pulls the movie into a kind of interesting feel, where the strengths of the production are so vibrant and memorable that you start to forget about time and just appreciate the movie for what it is.  A whole line of young men play the different soldiers in the film, and while none come even close to matching Ermey's performance, they are all fantastic in their own right. A stunning amount of dedication and energy is present in \\"Jacket,\\" making for an unconventional and humorous take on one of the world's weirdest wars. <br /> <br />The first half of the film, dealing with the training of these raw soldiers, is hilarious and frightening. Ermey's crazed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the funniest characters ever put on film, and all of his lines are hysterical and impressively effective. Dark humor triumphs in the first half like war movies very rarely achieve, and this is part of what makes \\"Jacket\\" such a unique and wonderful movie. The second half calms down a bit, which is ironic because this is the half of the film where the combat takes place: This is the half with the Tet Offensive, and it's a disturbing, sobering and breathtaking piece of cinema. Truly excellent acting comes into play here, as do important political messages and a round of unique character development that takes it a step further from what the first half left us with. Though not as funny or entertaining as the first half of the movie, it is still a glorious piece of cinema, and it looks tremendous even by today's standards. <br /> <br />This is one of Kubrick's most entertaining efforts, and not quite as polarizing as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" or \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Instead, it uses different film-making techniques to define itself, and its purpose is very, very clear: All the traditional messages of war movies are here (That wars are contradictory and often silly), and a lot of fascinating scenes can be found as well.  All the characters have a grounded \\"real world\\" feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil, beyond-hope look he gives later on remains as the most frightening looks ever seen depicted onscreen.  A haunting, humorous, and often horrendously difficult film; however, it sparkles in its own way despite its flaws and sadism. <br />
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Like others, I'm waiting to see if this \\"extended edition\\" is the horrible TV-reworking of Lynch's film (with its high-camp, MALE replacement narration) or a more complete, original theatrical film, with the original narration voice intact and with director Lynch's participation.  I absolutely loved this film when it came out, and have been waiting and hoping to see it in its lengthier, originally-intended glory.  So MUCH was left on the cutting-room floor.  <br /> <br />Five stars if Universal has done the \\"right thing.\\" Otherwise, what a waste, and ZERO stars. <br /> <br />Ken
0060543884|5.0|In the book \\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho, a boy named Santiago is away from his family and faces life as a shepherd. To travel the world was his dream and he would have a dream that would lead him to pursue his Personal Legend. That same dream made him visit a Gypsy who interpreted his dream and told him the dream was telling him to go in search of treasure, his Personal Legend. With the help from a man that called himself \\"The King,\\" Santiago was told his treasure was close to the pyramids in Egypt, far away from his homeland. He then sold his belongings as he left for Egypt. The adventure then begins. After the troubles of having his life savings stolen from him and working nearly a year to gain back his belongings, he was thinking of returning to his life as a simple shepherd without realizing his Personal Legend. But second thoughts made him go and cross the desert to reach the pyramids and claim his treasure. With the help from an alchemist that he meets on his way through the desert, he is pointed in the right direction towards riches, discoveries and his treasure and fulfilling his Personal Legend...The Alchemist is an excellent novel with a powerful theme. The theme is to believe in our dreams and the importance of following our hearts. With its interesting twists and turns, it's a good fiction novel that will keep you interested in reading the whole book. The way the book is written enabled this novel to receive an Eliot Rosewater High School Book Award Nominee. --Batsirai Shumba--
B000BNX3B4|1.0|So, how bad can a movie with John Cusack and Diane Lane be? Trust me--pretty bad. It's not touching; it's not funny; there's no chemistry. Nothing. And the writing is just awful. Every attempt at humor falls flat. I found myself wondering why this movie was even made. Don't waste your time.
0440241588|4.0|Back to good ol' Grisham. Not much subject, but a very good reading.
B000063JZQ|4.0|Overall I would have to say that this is quite a dark and disturbing movie, but one that is done quite well. For the era it also has fairly decent production values, but sometimes the sound got rather grainy and crackly. Also, naked old witches and young children were getting just a little disturbing.
B000AP04FG|2.0|well how about it kiddies another cut up dvd courtesy of hollywood.to many cuts not to go unoticed for me. MOSTLY ANGELINAS SEXY SCENES,i would hope you noticed the trend in the cutting of movies once they leave the theater.
B00005JOFO|5.0|From the 1st moment I sat down in the theater, well after the final credits and up to now, there has been a knot in the pit of my stomach. There was a subtle undercurrent of suppressed violence throughout the film that was both tantalizing & disturbing. Brokeback Mountain, the story of a pair of rugged, hardscrabble young cowboys, icons of the American male who fall in love in 1963 Wyoming opened my eyes wide, sometimes in horror at what men who love other men had to endure. Victims of their place & time, yet their love did endure. The real power of the story is that this love came from the unlikeliest source; a pair of Calvin Klein underwear models in the canyons of Manhattan just wouldn't have the same impact. I have never been so moved by anything, either on film or in the written word as I was by this story. When the film ended I was emotionally drained, taking several days for the full impact to hit. It would seem the best talent in the industry went into its making. Ang Lee, Heath Ledger (astounding!), Jake Gyllenhaal (also astounding), Michelle Williams & the haunting score to name a few. Probably the most poignant scene I have ever seen in a movie is the scene where Jack (Jake) is standing at a campfire, hands in his pockets, Ennis (Heath) walks up & wraps his arms around him from behind, just holding him & gently rocking, their eyes closed. Gay, straight or whatever, we all yearn to share a moment like that of pure unfettered love. Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.
0307276902|5.0|There is a tremendous amount of controversy about this book, but whether it's truth or fiction, I found it to be an incredibly fascinating, absorbing read - so much so that I read it all the way through without stopping.  The story begins as a 23-year old James Frey (the author, now in his 30s) wakes up in an airplane.  His 4 teeth have been knocked out, he has a hole in his cheek, and he has no idea where he's going.  He has been addicted to alcohol and crack for many years, and he soon learns he had jumped from his friend's fire escape while blacked out.  The friend got James on a plane headed for Chicago, where his parents pick him up and take him to a 6 week stint in rehab.   <br /> <br />The entire book is about those 6 weeks in rehab - the physical torture his body undergoes as he detoxes, the colorful characters who become his friends, the girl he meets who gives him hope for the future, and the painful family therapy he undergoes with his parents.  James learns that if he continues to do drugs he will soon die, and he embarks on a path to sobriety - not through AA, which is what the people at rehab want him to do - but on his own terms. <br /> <br />Frey writes in a stream of consciousness style, so there is little punctuation - it is almost as though you are right inside his head, experiencing his thoughts and actions as he does.  I found his story completely absorbing.  Even though he had done a lot of terrible things to other people in his life, I found myself rooting for him, happy to see that as the weeks progressed he got better, and started to heal emotionally. <br /> <br />In the last week or two there have been allegations that parts of this story are made up, and I can see how some people were more captivated by the story when they thought it was completely true.  That said, I believe anyone would enjoy this book, whether it's real or fantasy.
B000008FIR|2.0|Waiting for the Roar.<br /><br />This album slyly known as \\"Fastway finds synth\\" came out in 1986. I remember when I first heard it I knew the Fastway that I enjoyed was over with.<br /><br />This album has none of the warmth or swagger of the first album or \\"All Fired Up.\\" WFTR is reduced to sterile a 1980s drum machine sounding pop metal record. That totally flies against what the band had done in the previous two albums.<br /><br />I've read in later interviews by Fast Eddie Clark that this was David King's record. Mr. King was trying to be ambitious (synth etc.) and artistic. It simply does not work. The beauty of Fastway was the swagger and the attitude. Meaty guitar hooks with a great grooves and a vocalist that cut above it all with hair raising passion.<br /><br />That all gets blown up here. I still shake my head at why. Maybe pressures to be \\"80s\\" by the label. The first two albums had a more early 70s throwback edge to them.<br /><br />As to the material on the album. The title track is about the only remotely interesting cut to me. The rest of it is a textbook case in insipid joyless rock music. It doesn't inspire, it doesn't make you want to rock. David King doesn't even belt out anything too passionately. It feels forced - which is the tragedy.<br /><br />Some have complained this is too hard to find. That is for good reason. It sold poorly and alienated the fans of the first two albums.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes Fastway ended with 1984's All Fired Up. That is the last Fastway album you need to own.<br /><br />Waiting for the Roar is a souless, joyless excercise in rock music and should be avoided.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie has literally left me and emotional wreck. I have now seeen it 4 times and each time leave crying uncontrollably.  I never expected to feel like this when I went to see it.  It stays with me , I cry every day , not just shedding a few tears, I mean cry hard with the tears running off my face.  I felt this movie right to my core .  Jake Gyllenhall was outstanding as Jack twist and brought his character to life with such emotion , those eyes of his really impacted the character, he has such soulful, loving eyes.  I was devasted for Jack .  I never saw two gay men , jsut two people who fell in love very unexpectedly.  I cannot see another movie for some time now.  When I leave the theater , I feel like i am homesick and just want to experience it again and again.  Goe see this movie!
0307276902|1.0|When the New York Times discovered that one of its reporters, Jayson Blair, fabricated stories, they rightfully retracted his articles and fired him.  So why won't Doubleday recall Frey's memoir, which, according to the Smoking Gun, is loaded with fabricated stories and ficticious accounts?  Is money really more important than principle?  Is craft more important than integrity?  I saw this bozo on Larry King, and he looked guilty as sin.  As for Oprah, who endorsed this book, she should be ashamed of herself.  I, for one, refuse to reward an author who has no respect for honesty and integrity.  I'll be giving my money to a more worthy author.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Si bien ya esta mas que dicho la calidad con la que GOTAN PROJECT logro remezclar la musica de tango hacia sonidos electronicos, con ayuda por ejemplo de Thievery Corporation y Kruder & Dorfmeister, creo que si calidad es insicutible y le pongo 5 estrellas. <br /> <br />Les comentare por que me decidi a comprar este CD respecto al que existe en sudamerica (soy de Chile). Este CD a diferencia de la version que se difundin aca en chile viene con un Bouns CD en el cual se incluyen cuatro excellentes remezclas (REMIX) bastante Dance, y un Video (fome, bien fome) de 'Santa Maria'. Sin embargo valia la pena comprarlo, pues el precio en mi pais es el mismo que aca en amazon incluyendo el envio, y como les digo esta versin viene con 2 CD en su interior. <br /> <br />El packaging (envase) de este disco es hermoso, sin embargo presenta el problema de no tener una superficie contra la cual poner el CD, los cuales se colocan dentro de unos bolsillos de carton, en los cuales la primera sacada del estuche correpondio las primeras rayas del CD (mal, muy mal pensado), sin embargo es un envase bello que vale la pena asi que a tenr ojo y cuidar la superficie del CD. <br /> <br />Eso es por ahora, recuerden escriban en su idioma, es mejor para todos, amazon ya no es solo en ingles. <br /> <br />bye

B000002LGQ|5.0|Now when someone asks you whether you like Madonna, you're going to get strange looks if you say yes and aren't a girl. However, despite any guilty pleasure status Madonna may have for males, anyone with an open mind will recognize just how great of an artist she is (well...singer - she doesn't actually write or play any of the instruments). \\"Like A Prayer\\" is one of many classic pop albums by Madonna, and even though it sounds slightly dated (due to the 80's sound), it's still very high quality stuff. Madonna herself has a very energetic, fun and sexy voice that greatly enhances any song in which she sings - she's definitely extremely likable. The lyrics themselves are also well-written and fun to pay attention to - the hit \\"Like A Prayer\\" is a great example of a song that you'll probably love singing along to, too. Musically it doesn't sound like any other band ever, and it's distinctly 80's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's very well produced and very creative - a lot of heart and soul was put into this album along with many of her other ones. She's essentially the female version of Prince (sonically - again, she doesn't play anything). If you like any Madonna song in the slightest, or if you like pop songs at all, then this album will greatly satisfy you! Absolutely recommended!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br />\\"Like A Prayer\\"<br />the rest is great, too
0451199871|5.0|This book is a great starter for Miss Marple-readers. Though many will disagree and say that MURDER OF THE VICARAGE is (considering it was published as the first Miss Marple-book), THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY introduces an interesting plot, multiple settings, and suspects with multiple motives. It introduces the usual blueprint that surrounds Miss Marple mysteries. There is a detective or inspector who goes around asking initial questions and such. There is a chief who gives updates on a daily basis. Usually, they all have something to do with(or know about)Miss Marple.  <br /> <br />Miss Marple's great friend Mrs. Bantry and her husband Colonel Bantry wake up to a shocking sight: a blonde girl murdered brutally at Gossington Hall. The plot thickens, doesn't it always! Expect this book to give twists and turns at every corner and make you want to read every single one. This was in fact my first Miss Marple book, so I might be kind of bias. Buy this book with THE MIRROR CRACK'D {{sometimes referred to as THE MIRROR CRACK'D...FROM SIDE TO SIDE}} as Mrs. Bantry is introduced once again in this book and there's a new murder. Miss Marple is also involved in this one.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Accidently discovered this one looking up sci-fi stuff and seeing the RPG.  Bought the movie, watched with my wife, who isn't a sci-fi fan, and we both loved it.  Great chemistry between the characters.  Enjoyable. <br />Bought FireFly the series the next day.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I had always heard of The Strokes starting in early high school. In highschool things were different - I only supported the bands that I had more or less grown up with and liked for years. I remember hearing \\"Last Night\\" and dismissing the song as too noisy for me; my tastes were more conservative back then. I also remember really liking \\"Someday\\" but it wasn't enough to get me into The Strokes with my limited income. They were making enough cash without me anyway with all those kids who loved \\"Is This It?\\" <br /> <br />So in highschool I pretty much dismissed the strokes as just another trendy, MTV sort of band. <br /> <br />Now I am in college, getting older - expanding my horizons. It wasn't until a few months ago when a friend gave me \\"Is this It?\\" that i realized how much I really did love the song \\"Someday.\\" In a chain of reactions \\"Is This It?\\" grew on me enough for me to go out and get \\"Room on Fire.\\" <br /> <br />And so far in 2006, as I am becoming somewhat of a fan of the strokes - I am very pleased when I listen to \\"First Impressions of Earth.\\" This album immediately sucked me in, and almost just as quickly made me want to listen to old Strokes more. I love the songs - all of them. I don't understand how this album could get any bad reviews. It's rock solid to me. <br /> <br />From the first single \\"Juicebox\\" with that driving bass line, I was hooked. The sound was pure, the beat was steady and forceful. For me, this was a great start to a new year, musically speaking. Other songs that completely got me from first listen were \\"Electricityscape\\" (of course) and \\"Ask me Anything\\" but the more I listen to the cd the more I love all the songs. <br /> <br />I think anyone who dismisses the latest Strokes effort has simply not listened to the album enough - and I mean the album in entirety, not just the single or songs others recommended. Start at track one and let her play. <br /> <br />Right now the soaring guitar rhythms of \\"15 Minutes\\" are floating aroundin my head like I have known them for years. <br /> <br />When I am in the mood to rock lately, The Strokes \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" is all I need to satisfy the itch. Buy it...
B000002KO1|5.0|The Pretenders' debut album was a great and influential CD when it came out in 1980. NOTHING else sounded like it as it essentially started the signature 80's sound that people think of today. Every song here is great, although they'll probably have to grow on you - the most accessible song here is their hit \\"Brass In Pocket\\" which is a classic. Singer Chrissie Hynde has a slightly annoying voice at first, but it's one that grows on you - give it some time and you'll start to like it. It's similar to the modern punk vocal style. She definitely has a great personality, though, which the lyrics only help to emphasize. Speaking of the lyrics, they're all very well-written as they aren't simply a means to make the songs catchier - they're definitely gifted songwriters. As for how it sounds, it sounds like most 90's and even some 00s pop rock bands today with a lot of punk and some new wave mixed in - you can tell that a LOT of people were influenced by \\"Pretenders\\". It's very energetic and it's mostly a straight-up rock & roll album, but there's so many little additions to the formula that it rewards repeated listens. It's very creative and inspired as it doesn't feel like it was produced - it feels organic which is always a good thing. The production here is great, although it could probably use a remastering. All in all I think a lot of people will love this album if they approach it with an open mind. Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Brass In Pocket\\"  the rest are great, too
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens defies categorization. Most people have lumped him in with the freak-folk movement of Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom, and that doesn't feel like the right fit. However, he doesn't fall comfortably into any current pop music label. Combining swirling woodwinds, Charlie Brown piano and multi-part harmonies with what sounds like young folk, the feelings evoked in this album run the gamut from sheer joy to inconsolable sorrow, often several times within the same song. The song I am fixated on currently is the Predatory Wasp track, but all are equally stellar. One of the best of 05.
0893860220|5.0|I got this book some years ago, and I'll admit, at first it seemed to ramble, talk in circles, and seemed to be full of contradictions.

After discovering John Wheeler, and 'Sailor' Bob Adamson, the meaning became clear.<br />This may not be the best book to jump into cold if you are new to this \\"teaching\\".

Of course this copy could have been one in a million.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie is incredible, no doubt about it. From Taye Diggs to Rosario Dawson to Anthony Rapp to Idina Menzel, phenominal talent! I think though there is ONE performance that is worthy of at LEAST an Academy Award NOMINATION and that's Jesse L. Martin.  Martin offers most of the laughs from the movie as well as makes the audience cry unlike any other performance this year.  Martin's performance is exceptional and adds to the excellence of this incredible movie musical.
0440180295|2.0|Slaughterhouse Five is one of many novels we have from the World War II period, joining such other bestsellers as Jones' The Thin Red Line and Mailer's The Naked and the Dead. Like these, Slaughterhouse Five makes a contrarian, rather stupid implication: that is, World War II was useless, senseless and ignoble. Younger readers and undergrads especially will buy into the subtext. Nevertheless, to Vonnegut's credit, he has created an intriguing and lively absurdist tale with Billy Pilgrim. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the reality of World War II was quite the opposite of the themes in Slaughterhouse Five. Pearl Harbor, the Holocaust and Nazism are words that come to mind when I think of why World War II was fought. Like Jones and Mailer, Vonnegut has discovered that if one takes any human act and removes all historical context, it will then seem senseless and absurd. Vonnegut himself must have realized that at some point in the writing, and those omissions are what make Slaughterhouse Five spurious. Hence the two stars. It is 'pretty' to think war is useless, but in the real world war is sometimes a necessity. Consult the track record. Take 'poo-tee-weet' with a grain of salt. <br /> <br />With that said, the book mixes up an interesting concoction of science fiction, humor, autobiography, history (however narrowed the scope), and clear writing. Millions of high schoolers read Slaughterhouse Five annually, but that probably owes more to our mainstream counterculture attitudes than any literary merit. It probably will not endure past the next century or so, but in the meantime Slaughterhouse Five is worth the read. For World War II readers, I recommend Erich Maria Remarque's A Time To Love And A Time To Die...a superior novel. <br />
B000001DTM|5.0|I remember the Cole Porter tribute album that came out late?90 , the nail crunching \\"re-tooling of U2\\" years. There was a U2 cover of \\"Night and Day\\" on it. Watching the video of that song on MTV I realized there and then what these guys were secretly up to : Buried in that somber little tune lay the glowing, electric, ember-seed of what was to become Achtung Baby. There it was,  Achtung's DNA. I remember calling up a friend and putting my phone up against the TV \\"can you hear the drum machine ? Well can you ?\\" I asked. \\" You're nuts dude !\\" he said \\"U2 will never ever go techno\\". Well nuff said. So when I first heard The Fly on the radio, I was like  \\"Ho- hum , been there done that\\".     Seriously though, I like this CD because it totally exploded onto the music scene back in '91. The album, the tour, the U2-ZOO TV media frenzy. '91 also turned out to be an amazing year for rock all around. U2, Nirvana, Metallica, GnR, all put out ground breaking records then.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Before I start talking about the music here I have to make a few things clear: Yes, the members of this band's names sound like horrible wrestler names(i.e. Synester Gates, Johhny Christ,etc.), yes the singer has a platinum grill, and the band is all over TRL played with the likes of Madonna and Hillary Duff. Now with all of that (and a little more) aside, this band should be praised for bringing some talent back into popular music. Their new cd, City of Evil is the best new metal release I have heard in forever. They have two awesome guitarists that seem to have been schooled in Iron Maiden and Pantera 101 anda drummer that is technically proficient(no Mike Portnoy but can hang with the likes of Dave Lombardo). The bass has alot to be desired, but does shine on a couple of tracks. Personally, I didn't really listen to their music before this one, so I can't really complain about the vocals(but I like singing rather than screaming).  <br />1.Beast And The Harlot- A great opening song. Definitely has some Maiden-esque factors in here. Plus, the solo is amazing. Very nice feel to the chorus. <br />2.Burn It Down- When I first heard this song, I immediately thought of how much this sounded like Dream Theater. Definitely one of my faves on this album. Very melodic and kick ass att the same time. <br />3.Blinded In Chains- Very fast paced, but not up to par with the last two songs. <br />4. Bat Country- Even though this song has been getting alot of play lately, its still not that bad of a song. Probably the most accessable song on the cd. The dueling solos definitely remind me of Judas Priest.  <br />5. Trashed and Scattered- Not one of my favorite songs on the cd, but the breakdown is the first time you really hear any bass so far. <br />6. Seize The Day- A very nice ballad. I like the hints of piano that they use. It really changes the pace of the album. Has a somewhat Guns N Roses feel to it. <br />7. Sidewinder- The first 2/3 of this song are pretty good, but then at the end comes a huge suprise, an acoustic breakdown with classical guitar. This track shocked me and shows how credible this band could be. Yes people, this band has actual talent. <br />8. The Wicked End- The beginning is the only \\"solo\\" the bass player actually gets. Towards the middle of this song is a Danny Elfman-esque symphony piece, which I thought was ver unique. Which is topped off by the band playing with the symphony. Very nice. <br />9. Strength of the World- It starts off western-like, then goes into a very anthematic song. Again, another song that becomes ballad like at one point in the song. <br />10. Betrayed- Another great song on the album. Nothing notable that hasn't already been said about the other songs. <br />11. MIA- Great ending with the chantable \\"whoas\\". Sounds like it would be great to see in concert. <br /> <br />Well that about sums up my review for this album. I can truly say I'm a music lover and this band is on its way to becoming great. <br />
B000005RTG|4.0|Come Taste the Band, the Deep Purple album featuring Tommy Bolin's plunging guitars, is a fine record, easily worthy of the band's past recordings and a pretty solid reply to anyone who still thinks that Purple without Ritchie isn't Deep. There are so many guitar tracks that it sounds as if Bolin is doing everything. The group backs Bolin very well. Though a little more of Jon Lord's keyboards would have been nice. Ian Paice's drumming is magnificent as always. Singer David Coverdale sounds really strong and Glenn Hughes is killer on bass and great on vocal duties. But while Bolin's guitar work breaks down the walls of your mind, there's a mellowness here, too. The album's key surprise is the instrumental, \\"Owed to G,\\" a jazz-rock track that must have sounded very far out while being recorded. Bolin also collaborates on most of the tracks on Come Taste the Band, thereby taking over another position Blackmore held so dear, that of ruler. Even though the whole band makes the music, the spotlight is on Bolin.<br /><br />Highlights: Comin' Home, Gettin' Tighter & You Keep On Moving
1577311523|4.0|Something in your head goes click. Or else it doesn't. <br /> <br />Down through time, there have probably been thousands of natural mystics, who more or less fell into a state of enlightenment in one dazzling moment, and never lost it.  <br /> <br />There have been millions who have glimpsed such a state, accidentally, or through chemical enhancement, or through spiritual practice. And they may or may not find their way back to it now and then, and they appreciate whatever help is on offer to \\"cleanse the doors of perception\\". Many millions more are seekers, who have heard the rumor of enlightenment and hope for a connection to it. <br /> <br />Tolle clearly and authentically belongs to the first group. He makes it all sound very easy, which of course from the enlightened side of things it is. He doesn't seem to have a very solid grasp of what a slow plod it can be for most of us in the other two groups. Still, the advice and the method are the same for everyone. <br /> <br />There are plenty of texts that will give one version or another of the same advice, from Brother Lawrence to the Upanishads to the Gurdjieff work to Zen. A distinct advantage Tolle's account will have over most of the rest, for many readers, is the fact that his own dazzling burst came to him independently of any particular spiritual tradition. And that frees him to explain the way to arrive at the same peace and self-control, without imposing any dogma, and (for the most part) in simple, everyday modern language. It's not surprising that, for so many readers, this freedom and freshness have made the message click for them. <br /> <br />In its radical refusal to mix in any esoteric religious paraphernalia, its quiet and patient return to the same monotonous core prescriptions of silence and non-judgmental attention to the present, _Power of Now_ is most reminiscent of the style of Krishnamurti. And that's a high recommendation. <br /> <br />By the same token, it isn't surprising that for manyother readers the book just sounds like more of the same self-help hype. The central insight is extremely simple, and it's all-or-none. You get it, or you don't. This is one more chance to get it, more straightforwardly expressed than most. And if you've already had your glimpses, it's a useful, friendly reminder to return to your spiritual practices, and the value they've had for you. <br /> <br />True, there's nothing new here. There's nothing new about sunrise, or falling in love, either. That's hardly a serious fault in any of the three.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|it's enya therefore it can't be below 3 stars... but it just doesn't excite me except for 'sumiregusa', 'the river sings' and the opening track. those three are BEAUTIFUL. the rest is slightly different than what she's done before in that it's average-sounding. it's like music for people in their late 50's rather than dreamy music for everyone. ADWR was dreamy but boring. this is just boring. i can't get into this one but i still don't hate it. maybe time will change my opinion...
0307276902|5.0|I think that this book is great and it is really compelling. It doesn't matter wheter its true or not, it's still a great book. Plus, the mystery of it all makes the book even more worth reading., I like how the author isn't afraid to take risks and be different and how its like no book i've ever read.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|i was like half of her fans who wasn't impressed with this album on first listen. <br /> <br />...and then it helped to form a bond between my friends and myself. we all realized we loved her and planned to see her during her afterglow tour. one night we decided pop in this cd to get used to it even though we weren't really that impressed with it. out of nowhere, it's like something magical happened and it found its way inside our hearts and minds. 'hey, this is pretty good!' 'hey, this is awesome!' 'why didn't i like this on first listen?' <br /> <br />i think it's her best yet. 'train wreck' is super awesome with that great line: could your eyes/ like midnight fireflies/ light up the trenches where my heart lies?  yes, yes they can. anything for you, sarah. <br /> <br />it's soooooo good. she is my favorite singer-songwriter and i love what she did here. she makes everything better.
0316168815|4.0|The book, The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold was a very interesting suspense-filled mystery novel. It was really enjoyable to read this book because it was very different from other novels I have read. It was interesting to see the author's different view on heaven and what she might imagine it to be like. This book kept me reading with its very well described situation and its thought-provoking suspense. It raises many issues dealing with the outside world, such a child molestation and murder. It gives you a glimpse of the pain and grief that grows within a family who has had this type of terrible tragedy arise. Although the book was fiction, many issues in The Lovely Bones have happened frequently in real life and in ways could be considered a non-fiction novel. This book was a very good book, and very suspenseful, although, at certain points, it was kind of slow.
0312979479|5.0|This is the first Agatha Christie novel I have read since I was a child.  Although I don't think that many people will consider it \\"great literature,\\" it is nevertheless a compelling read.  Christie's best plots - like Murder on the Orient Express - take the mystery genre and turn it on its ear.  This one will keep the reader guessing until the end (unless the story has been spoiled for him).  Usually, there is only one murder to solve - here, there is quite a big body-count.  Usually, to find the guilty party, one must simply look for the least-likely suspect.  I don't think that formula will work here.  The setup: ten party-guests (the titular \\"Little Indians\\") are invited to an island off the English coast.  They are informed by an unseen \\"Mr. Owen\\" that they are about to be punished for their crimes.  Saying anything more would be too much.
B000B5QWKG|1.0|Being a Franz Ferdinand enthusiast I agree with the previous reviews as to the musical content of this recording. However Amazon does not alert that the DVD side of the dual disc is Zone 1 and cannot be reproduced in other zones. I bought the Dual Disc of the Ferdinanz recording as I wanted to listen to the enhanced high resolution multichannel version, but I just couldn't because of the compatibility problem mentioned. Besides, although the Dual Disc can be played in my CD player it makes a nasty noise. Not a format I would recommend.
0446577383|3.0|Nobody writes a conspiracy thriller like David Baldacci, and The Camel Club will keep you turning pages at breakneck speed.  Unfortunately, his latest is not without some flaws and while many of his books defy belief, this one is even more of a stretch.<br /><br />The Camel Club consists of four misfits (nearing senior citizen status) who form a secret conspiracy watchdog organization.  The ringleader is \\"Oliver Stone,\\" a man with a very secret and mysterious past. While meeting in a park during off-hours, the four witness the murder of a Secret Service agent, Patrick Johnson.  Unfortunately, the two killers realize they have witnesses. Because of their checkered backgrounds, the Camel Club decides not to report this to the police.  Instead, they go on the offensive, trying to discover not only the identity of the killers but also their motivation.  At the same time, Secret Service agent Alex Ford is assigned to investigate the death of Johnson, but runs into trouble with the various agencies also looking into the murder (FBI, Metro Police, NIC, etc.).<br /><br />As if this isn't enough going on, a group of Islamic extremists is plotting a terrorist act involving the US president.  But not all of the plotters are Islamic or Middle Eastern.  In fact, some are working from the inside.<br /><br />Much of The Camel Club is very relevant to post 9/11 America.  The FBI, CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies are being forced to combine information, but infighting, jealousy and guarded secrets are still common.  Government agencies are involved in illegal activities.  The war is still raging in Iraq with Americans split on the issue.  The issues are very similar to today.<br /><br />But The Camel Club has just too many flaws.  When three different sets of characters were introduced in the first three chapters, it took some time keeping them all straight.  Between the FBI, CIA, NSA, NIC, etc, the spy organizations caused some confusion.  It was made even murkier because Baldacci would often use the same initials for different things (NSA was either National Security Agency or National Security advisor).  There was way too much going on in the plot.  And as mentioned previously, much of it was totally unbelievable.  The romance angle with Alex Ford and a young justice lawyer was especially unconvincing.  Even the small details were far-fetched.  For instance, the terrorists plan a major assault, but use tranquilizer darts so as not to kill anyone.  Also, not to give away the plot, but what happens to Oliver Stone's daughter is just too incredulous.<br /><br />So while I enjoyed The Camel Club and couldn't turn the pages quick enough, it's not the best Baldacci work.  But even a mediocre Baldacci is better than the efforts of many other authors.ecause Baldacci would often use the same initials for different things (NSA was either National Security Agency or National Security advisor).

0689853637|5.0|Robert Sabuda is a gifted, gifted man. These pop-ups (and the others he's done) are astonishing. My first-grade class literally gasped, oohed and aahed as I turned each new page. They ask me to read the pop-up books at least once a week. And, I read them myself even after the kids have gone home for the day. What a treasure these books are!
B00005JOFO|4.0|1.  In Michael Bronski's anthology \\"Taking Liberties: Gay Men on Sex, Politics....\\", there is a great essay about how rooms function in gay male literature.  Since male homosexuality is stigmatized, much of it has to take place in closed, private spaces.  The author points to Baldwin's \\"Giovanni's Room\\" as a classic example of this.  \\"Brokeback\\" takes that idea and turns it on its head.  Instead of a cramped room usually in some big, anonymous metropolis, the lovers here have a huge open area as their private sanctuary.  There are no doors or walls in the film, yet they have their relative unseen special place.  I only saw Van Sant's \\"My Own Private Idaho\\" once.  That's the only other film that I can think of as remotely using open space as a metaphoric \\"gay room.\\" <br /> <br />2.  Of course, I'm obsessed with the representation of gay men of color in film.  I have an Amazon.com list called \\"A Gay Minority Man Walks By.\\"  It lists many of the movies where a GMOC appears and then disappears just as quickly.  There's a crow who only speaks one line and who is supposed to represent a GBM in the adult cartoon \\"Fritz the Cat.\\"  \\"16 Candles\\"' Long Duck Dong plays a stereotypical GAM in \\"Booty Call.\\"  \\"Brokeback\\" is a virtually all-white movie, even though Texas (one of its locations) has many people of color in it.  Jake G. picks up some trade in Mexico.  If you blinked, you would have missed it.  The hustler says nothing.  This potentially, and problematically, renders a man in the developing world silent.  However, if he said, \\"Hey, Big Daddy, wanna good time?\\", it would have been seen as equally problematic.  Plus, many prostitutional transactions may be done without words, especially in international tricking/sex tourism.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|What is all this chatter about the 'original' Phantom?  Andrew Lloyd Webber explained his choice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom: he said he wanted a 'rock star' persona, and Michael Crawford, no matter what age, would not have fulfilled that requirement; Gerard Butler did.  I have seen the stage play, and the movie several times, and I own both the London stage and movie soundtracks, and one thing that stands out is the emotion in Mr. Butler's version, which does not come across to me in Mr. Crawford's version.  When Gerard's Phantom is sad, you know it -- when he's angry, you REALLY know it!  I also believe Emmy Rossum is about as perfect a Christine as there could be . . . how lucky was that?  She's divine!  And how about Minnie Driver?  What a hoot!  I love her \\"these things do happen\\" routine, who cares if she doesn't sing?  What professional opera singer could they have found who could have played the role 1/2 as well?    Anyhow, forget 'the original' for now.  Give these fresh new people credit for breathing new life and excitement into the most successful musical of all time -- they have certainly earned it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers by John Cleese and Connie Booth is one of the finest British television shows ever produced.  Following the venerable, yet annoying tradition of producing a very minimal set of episodes, this series manages to be one of the best comedies on television.  Ever.<br /><br />Basil Fawlty (Cleese) stars as a hotel owner/operator with a bone to pick - with everyone he meets.  His wife, Sybil, (Prunella Scales) is equally hilarious for her total snobbish disdain for Basil.  In truth, the hotel stays afloat only by the hard work of the inept Manuel (Sachs) and the artist Polly (Booth) - but don't tell Basil that.  He is convinced that he is the pride of Fawlty Towers.<br /><br />The series episodes contain a healthy dose of slapstick comedy to offset the ever-present dry British wit that underlies the entire program.<br /><br />As an American viewer, I find the series fascinating, and my quickest 'boost' when I am having a bad day.<br /><br />Hilarious, funny, and always entertaining, this DVD set is the perfect way to experience Fawlty Towers.
0316776963|5.0|This book was hysterical! I knew when I read the first chapter that I would love the whole thing. So many times I laughed outloud, and I had to tell people around me what was so funny. I think im going to buy this book, so I can read it when Im down. I can't believe that someone would not like this book, at least a little. The only thing I can say negative about this book is that I feel that the second part,\\"part deux\\" was not as funny as the first half. Still I would give any one of his books a try!
0893860220|3.0|This book consists of dialogues during which Sri Nisargadatta answers in the Spirit. He sees himself as an incarnation of God. He speaks as I AM, not as a person with a gigantic ego. What struck me, was that he said that whether you are sad, suffering or happy, the Universe is unperturbed. It still functions OK.<br /><br />This is in contrast to teachings in The Course in Miracles, where the Course tells us that we are joined, that there is only one mind, and that when we realize our real nature, our brothers and sisters benefit as well.<br /><br />I AM THAT essentially gives us what every God-realized teacher conveys. We are not an ego, we should not work on our selves, because working on the ego is a waste of time. We must<br /><br />re-discover (i.e., be reborn) ourselves as spirit, or Being. This can be experienced instantly.<br /><br />The dialogues were redundant I felt, because this book could have been much shorter.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|Wanted to, so badly.  I've always defended Depp's work, but the focus of the plot of the movie is so sappy and self-absorbed that I can't sit through the entire movie.  The children's performances shine through, but Depp adds nothing to the movie. <br /> <br />I rented the 1971 movie a few weeks after we purchased the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I fell in love with the Mel Stuart/Gene Wilder movie all over again.  The new movie will never be the classic that the 1971 has become.
B0008F1146|4.0|Ok let's face the obvious; Roadrunner has been constantly spitting out these 25th anniversary Re-releases as an easy cash grab from the fans.  Since they already re-released the rest of the albums from Max Cavalerea years, why not re-release roots?  Well, when I had first heard this news, I was excited and jumping with joy.  Roots was my first Sepultura album and one of my personal favorites, I practically have the thing memorized word for word and note for note.  Now I realize this is a long review so if you want a short version, then skip to the last paragraph.  If you want all the details, then read on from here.   <br /> <br />I checked websites weekly for updates as to what the bonus track would be on the second disc.  Roadrunner stated that it would be 15 songs, but they didn't release the track list till months later.  When they finally did, I was shocked to see that it was 13 songs instead of 15.  I looked back at the roadrunner website and there were still banners up on the website claiming that it would have 15 songs!  What happened to the three missing songs?!  And to top it off, most of the songs were previously released on the B-Side/Live disc Blood Rooted.   <br /> <br />Now I'm a Sepultura fanatic so eventually, my curiosity got the best of me and I gave in and bought it.  This is the third time I've bought Roots.  I have the original copy, the rare import The Roots of Sepultura and now this one.   <br /> <br />The most interesting part of the whole package is probably the artwork and the 23 page booklet.  The lyrics part of the booklet has been changed, having the colors screwed around with (it actually looks pretty cool) as well as pictures of Jon Davis, Mike Patton, the tribe, Ross Robinson, members of the band and so forth.  The main problem was that most of it dealt with the recording process so much that they weren't able to include all the info they could have.  The Re-release of the Soulfly album does a better job (in terms of the booklet) because it gave some info about every song.  The Lyrics for Lookaway are still not present because they were written by Jon Davis.  They don't mention the guitarists from Korn helping out with Ratamahatta on percussion, nor do they mention anything about Carlinhos Brown (who also played on Ratamahatta and Ambush).  A large portion goes into the recording process for the untitled track at the end of the album.  This 13 minute improve jam goes by two names.  The booklet refers to it as Canyon Jam, if you insert it in your Computer or look online it comes up as Little Wood-Music, so which is it?  There are other things included such as their journey to the Xavantes tribe, but there are still several things that are left unanswered to the die hard fanatic.  Like with the bonus material, why did they decide to cover Celtic Frost and Bob Marley? They are great songs but I would like to know why.  It feels incomplete and a bit of a let down.  Just compare the booklets from Roots and the Soulfly album and the Soulfly one ends up as the winner.  It was simply done better.  However if you compare the overall music, Roots annihilates the competitor.   <br /> <br />Alright, enough with the booklet, does the bonus material make it worth the cash?  Well let's go over all the previously unreleased material and that which was left off Blood Rooted.   <br /> <br />5. Mine (Andy Wallace Mix): I don't understand why the reviewer Wobby praises this track as much as he did, but this is not a remix, this is an extended Mix, not a remix.  There is an additional 4 seconds at the beginning and probably a minute and half added to the end.  If there is an actual difference, then it's not easily noticeable.   <br />8. R.D.P. (Demo): I'm convinced that this is demo cover of a Ratos De Poro song, but I'm not too sure which one.  Sepultura previously covered their song Crucificados Pelo Sistema.  It's Definitely an awesome song.   <br />9. Untitled (Demo): An instrumental that was never improved on, probably the best song here, it could have been a second We Who Are Not As Others.   <br />10. Attitude (Live): This was on an Ozzfest CD so its nice to have it on an actual sepultura CD for the first time.   <br />11. Roots Bloody Roots (Megawatt Mix 1): very strange, not too good, but definitely better then the next track.   <br />12. Roots Bloody Roots (Megawatt Mix 2): absolutely unbearable.  It sounds like a really bad Soulfly remix.  With the exception of Max yelling, you couldn't be able to tell what this was in the first place.  Horrible, horrible remix.  I will bet that these two remixes were made recently at the last minute by someone at Roadrunner.   <br /> <br />The next time Roadrunner decides to release some old Sepultura rarities (which they probably will within the next five years) they better just make a Blood Rooted vol. 2.  There is plenty of live bootleg material that they can place on it and if you look hard enough, there is a rare Desperate Cry Vinyl Single that has a track titled Sweet Leaf (probably a Black Sabbath cover) and I'm sure there are plenty more demos.   <br /> <br />Alright here's my conclusion as to whether or not this Re-release is worth the money.  If you do not have any version of Roots, then definitely buy this version.  If you already have the original version; you can skip this entirely or buy one used at a cheap price or get it as a gift.  I personally do not like to support these cash grabbing re-releases so that's what I did; I received it as a gift.  The music is definitely worth 5 stars, but the overall letdown of unreleased material removes a star.  Hoped this helped and thanks for reading.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Firstly, after reading some other reviews, a few things came to my attention.  <br />Disturbed Scots, June 16, 2004 <br />Reviewer: R. A Rubin (Eastern, PA United States)  <br /> <br />\\"It appears that the Scots of Braveheart have deteriorated in a socialist country.\\"  <br />This is the kind of person that makes us Europeans think Americans are ignorant, seeing as Braveheart was <br />1. Written by an American, who being not Scottish, doesn't get the whole Scottish identity. <br />2. Based very loosely on fact. <br />And 3. Based hundreds of years ago! Is Scotland supposed to have stayed the same? And you are seeing Scotland from the viewpoint of junkies and taking their opinion as fact! <br /> <br />And another: <br /> <br /> Still holds up after all these years..., June 14, 2004 <br />Reviewer: Cubist (United States)       <br />\\"When Trainspotting was released in 1996, it took the world by storm and caused a sensation not only in its homeland of England, but in the United States as well.\\"  <br />Its 'homeland' was Scotland, not England. Films go on national release over here to all the countries in Britain which are Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. <br /> <br />The film itself is brilliant, an accurate portrayal of heroin addicts in Edinburgh (they are not Glaswegian as another reviewer has said) and is well worth owning, the book is even better. <br /> <br />P.S thick accents? i would recommend never actually coming to Scotland as those are the actors not going into a broad edinburgh accent!
B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"OK Computer\\" was released almost nine years ago, but still managed to garner over 1800 reviews on this one web site.  I've heard that numerous personal web sites and blogs are dedicated principally to this one album.  Some of the most remarkable Amazon reviews speak of those who have repeatedly listened to this album in order to help pull that person out of depression.  I just read in the N.Y Times Magazine of a Japanese boy whom, after locking himself in his room for months, credited Radiohead for his finally being able to escape from his self-imposed exile.  Obviously, this band, and \\"OK Computer,\\" their greatest achievement, have had a great deal of effect on many people.    Out of all of Radiohead's terrific albums (everything after \\"Pablo Honey\\"), none of them are more dramatic, innovative, and consistent than \\"OK Computer.\\"  Let's start with the bizarre artwork, credited, in part, to \\"Stanley Donwood\\" who also maintains a very strange website.  According to Wikipedia, such a person actually exists, though many, including myself, think he's Yorke's alter-ego.  In any event, what does the art-work mean? (My favorite sketch is the robot-like couple sitting at a table).  I could see fans of \\"Lost\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" spending hours debating each sketch.    But let's consider the songs themselves.  One thing I've noticed about Yorke's style is that he'll repeat a phrase until it takes on an almost metaphysical quality.  For example: from \\"Paranoid Android\\": \\"Huh what's that\\" and \\"Rain down on me from a great height\\"; from \\"Karma Police\\": \\"For a minute there I lost myself, lost myself\\"; from \\"Exit Music\\": \\"We hope that you choke, that you choke\\"; from \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien: \\"\\"They're all uptight.\\"  It doesn't seem to mean all that much, until you hear Yorke sing the phrase over and over again in that curious wail of his.    As far as the quality of the songs, to me, no Radiohead track (other than \\"Optimistic\\" on \\"Kid A\\") can match the power of \\"Paranoid Android,\\" with its different sections and unexpected change of pacing, or the dreamlike \\"Karma Police,\\" with that great ending, which sounds sort of like an alien ship landing.  These two songs also contain some of the band's most brilliant lyrics. For instance, in P.A.: \\"When I am king you'll be the first against the wall, with your opinions which are of no consequence at all.\\"  From K.P.: \\"Karma Police arrest this man he talks in maths he buzzes like a fridge he's like a detuned radio.\\"  Parts of \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" \\"Exit Music,\\" and \\"Let Down\\" are nothing short of sublime.  And, the band can rock too when they choose to (\\"Airbag,\\" \\"Electioneering\\").     So, what is the deeper meaning of \\"OK Computer?  I'm not really sure, but I think that when Yorke wrote the lyrics to these songs, he had on his mind some of the following themes: Orwell's \\"1984,\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (especially with \\"Paranoid Android\\"), safety issues relating to transportation (e.g. \\"Airbag\\" and \\"Lucky\\"), daydreaming (\\"Homesick\\" and \\"Karma Police\\"), advanced technology potentially surpressing the human spirit, and perhaps many other thoughts that, for now, escape me.      I just know I love this album.  Bands have certainly attempted to emulate Radiohead, but, like U2, REM and The Cure, they remain completely unique.
B0000931QR|5.0|I dont know exactly why this music goes directly to the heart...The seducing voice of Amaia montero? or maybe this sadness in the lyrics in a rythmic soft rock sauce? I can't stop listening to this CD since more than one year...I recommend also El viaje de Copperpot, with beautiful songs like Paris, la soledad....and the french version, with the same cover...i regret however the bad pronouciation of Amaia montero in French...
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a great book that goes very deep with each of the characters.  After the first couple chapters I really got to know about the characters and by the last couple chapters I was trying to guess what was going to happen.  The main character Ender (Andrew is what his mother would say) is put through many tough tasks that test him mentally and physically.  It was nice how Card went from character to character in each chapter to help you understand what the person is thinking and why they did something.  After about halfway through the book you understand what Ender is going to have to do but you have no idea how he is going to accomplish this task.  This book was a great book to read.  The theme of the book is anyone can do anything they really commit themselves to.
0812550706|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read, but there is one problem with it. I think that this is book that a person needs to read, for atleast the first time, when they are in middle to high school. I read this book first when I was in 6th grade and maybe it was my age was so close to those that are in the book but the characters just hit a nerve in me. I felt like me and my friends could in that book. I truely believe that if you read this book for the first time when you are older after you have your childness that you can no longer get into this book like a younger person can. I know people who read this book almost once a year just because once they first read it they felt as if Ender was a real person. I just hope that everyone is able to read this book when they are young enough to truly get into.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|OK, here's the scoop: multinational pharmaceutical mega-corporations don't give a flying f*ck about anyone or anything other than maximizing profits and increasing stock values; there are tons of corrupt politicians/bureaucrats/cops in not only poor Third World countries but also morally hypocritical Western countries who are all too ready to collude with these evil corporations; Africa's massive, starving and diseased poor are used as unwitting human guinea pigs for drug testing while Western governments continue to coddle Big Pharma in about a million different ways; nobody but a tiny sliver of determined activists knows about all this and actually tries to do something about it before they are silenced, persecuted, or even snuffed out.<br /><br />Got it? Of course this being based on a work of fiction, a certain amount of embellishment and poetic license is to be assummed, but the overall Big Picture is mostly spot-on: ruthless and shameless megacorporations run most Western governments these days, there is no shortage of ruthless and shamless Western politicians to help them along, and finally (this last point is not emphasized much unfortunately) the vast majority of the Western populace is ignorant, willfully ignorant, or downright apathetic about it.<br /><br />Those are most of the economic and political revelations that this film tries to convey---the problem is, instead of doing so in a straightforward documentary format it feels compelled to bundle it together with a clumsy thriller/love-story of a potboiler plot that is woefully predictable and pious.  Rachel Weiszc plays the requisite sacrificial virgin/crusader while her meek, complacent but sincere husband (Ralph Fiennes) first begins to doubt her fidelity and then her sanity, before events lead him to join her in anti-Big-Pharma martyrdom in some properly scenic desolation of a dried up African lake.<br /><br />Oh well, I suppose if this is the only way to get the word out to a mass audience then there are worse things in life than a contrived plot.then there are worse things in life than a contrived plot.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|I personally found this CD to be repetitive.  Seeking a group decision I took it to work where 20 other people, ages 20 to 45, kept looking at me asking why should they be tortured listening to my mistake purchase.  I can take the Euro/Techno sound but give me a little variety.  I swear they used only one maybe two pads on the drum kit, no bass drum.  I would also say they only used about a quarter of the whole keypad of the synth.  The lack of any muscians( check the last page of the inner sleeve, only the last song used guitars), proved to be too much as I had to remove this after about seven songs.  I kept thinking of Cher's \\"Believe\\", but most of the songs on this CD are slower in tempo and beat.  As with most strictly club CD's this loses all of its appeal outside of a club when most of the listeners are sober.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I have fallen in love with this album. Not like I have in a long, long time.  A truly original voice.  Finally.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I'm writing this review as a person who only knew about the novels of Sin City but never read any of them. Like some people I wanted to see this movie but got a little turned off because it was in black and white. Even though the picture is in black and white It's a nicely done picture. It's extremely smooth and crisp and it becomes beautiful when some color is added to make certain things stick out.<br />After seeing how well done it is you can't stop watching. It needed to be in black and white to show the ruggedness of the film and it really couldn't have been done any other way. Like instead of blood being red it was white and for some reason it looked cooler. The story is self-explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing. It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that. Basically if you're looking for a movie that has a deep story and is in every way different than any other movie out then you need to see Sin City
B000AA4M9U|4.0|BB King still sounds wonderful after 50 years of performing. This happy birthday tribute doesn't disappoint.  King teams up with musicians from pop, rock, folk, and jazz to re-create his greats with interesting results.  Probably my favorite is his teamup with Slowhand Eric Clapton on \\"Thrill is Gone.\\"  However, Gloria Estefan's clear, sweet voice adds a different and unexpected note to \\"There's Got to be a Better World Out there.\\"  Perhaps it's not King's best, but it's definitely an exceptional addition to any blues collection.   <br /> <br />Happy Birthday, BB, and may you rock on for many more years!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Stuffy apartment crowded with roommates that can hardly communicate in the same language, away from home for the first time, tons of bureaucracy at every turn, girlfriend trouble, overbearing mom, crowded European concrete jungle of a city, school professors with nationalistic attitudes that you couldnt care less about, a future job in a matchbox of an office... what more can you ask for to live your twenties happily?  Yet you do. <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|It's a shame that zero stars is not an option here.  Frey knew the hustle and ran a masterful con job that allowed everyone involved to go to the bank.  Editor Nan Talese: \\"Oh, please, it's not like he sold weapons of mass destruction.\\"  Huh?  Does this ludicrous justification make Frey's despicable conduct <br />any more palatable?  Or Oprah, who got taken hook, line and sinker on dry land: \\"It still resonates with me.\\"  But now she's blaming the publisher for poor fact-checking.  The lesson to be learned here is that reading for pleasure is a pastime that must compete with myriad other diversions, and when the publishing industry pushes lurid, over-the-top trash as fact, the industry shoots itself in the foot out of pure, naked greed.  People do have choices, and reading will not be one of them for those who feel they were conned and scammed by the publishing industry.
0307236722|4.0|Martha Stewart's \\"Baking Handbook\\" contained over 200 recipes for baking cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, cobblers and crisps, yeasted baked good as well as pastries. Stewart also provided useful information such as baking tips, baking equipments and baking techniques at the beginning of the book and this was helpful especially for the amateurs.  <br /> <br />This would be a handy book to have especially for both the experienced bakers as well as people who would like to try baking. Some recipes are harder to make than the others but there are also simpler ones. I especially like the cake chapter. In that cake chapter, there are also information on making and baking wedding cakes which would be helpful for those who want save money on getting their wedding cakes. Highly recommended for those who have interests in baking.
0307276902|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was amazing.  The way James Frey writes is so different from any other writer.  He makes you feel like you are there with him in rehab.  I know there is controversy going on right now about him, but I don't care.  This book is great even if the whole story wasn't true.  I have had a couple of friends who went through rehab and this really opens your eyes to what it is like on the other side.   <br /> <br />Great Job James, I loved this book!!!

B00005JO1P|5.0|Who can forget movies like \\"The Nashville Rebel\\" with Waylon or the one where (I forgot the name of it) Jeff Bridges plays the part of Jr.Johnson the stock car legend. This well done piece of work has really put a true Country Music Husband & Wife in the forefront for the world to see. Being a fan of this Great family of Country Music(I'm going back to the days when June's mother-Maybell was recording in Bristol with her cousin Sarah and her husband Alvin Pleasant (A.P.Carter)in 1927). <br />   This movie was a real tribute to Johnny and June. If a person who does not have a lot of knowledge really listens to the different conversations during the course of the movie one can really learn first hand about their life as many things that are being talked about are true to life. Take for example when June sees Johnny in the Diner and they speak for a while about June's singing and June exclaimes,\\"My sister Anita is the singer,she is the one with the pipes\\". Every Real Carter Family Fan knows that Anita Carter was infact \\"The one with the pipes\\", even to this day many feel myself included that Anita Carter was the best Female Country Singer of the 50's,60's and 70's. If you ever get a chance to see the old film of her singing a duet with Hank Williams doing\\"I can't help it...\\" you will know what I mean. <br />Just listen and you will learn.My wife and I have just about every LP that Johnny ever put out(don't miss out on the two new box sets-Johnny's 4CDset and June's 2CDset, We have both and they are Great).We were both glued to the TV set back in 1969 when the J.C. Show was on TV and we were both smitten when first June then Johnny passed. This movie is so well done that it can take you right back to Arkansas and also in the shadow of Clinch Mountain,VA where it all started for these two. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor wheather you are a Hillbilly or not and see this Great motion picture that will truly become a real part of Genuine Americana, you won't be sorry !<br />                        \\"Enjoy\\"  Joe Kopeck / Parkville,Md
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A good documentary needs more than just a good subject. It needs good narration, good cinematography, good research and a way to keep the viewer interested. And there are extra things as well. <br /> <br />The only narrator in this documentary is Robert Strange McNamara, who talks to an interviewer whom we never see and hardly hear. Sometimes we see McNamara talk, other times we hear his narration over images of all the wars he was somehow involved in: World War II, Cuba and Vietnam. Over all of this of course the Cold War. <br /> <br />Better narration is I think impossible. The way he stresses things, the words that he uses, it's just beautiful. <br /> <br />And what better way to look at Vietnam than with McNamara, there is not a closer source than him. it may be slanted and he may me wrong on some points but it's fascinating. <br /> <br />McNamara is completely open about things. He is passionate about things and even starts to almost cry when he talks about the death and suffering. It makes it very human. <br /> <br />A great extra edition is the music by Philip Glass, setting the scene even more for one of the best documentaries from the last few years.
B000002MFN|5.0|I remember the backlash this album had in 1992, and cannot get over how this still sounds fresh in 2006. The album is great, every song was like a new adventure, different from the one before and the one that follows.  My favorite tracks are \\"Erotica\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Rain\\".  If you didn't buy this album in 1992, grab it now!! You will be pleasantly surprised.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Having missed this at the cinema but read the raving reviews in the english press, I was looking forward to sitting down and finally catching this film on DVD.  It begins very well, almost perfectly, the first scenes featuring snappy direction and camera tricks together with amusing 'we're all zombies now' references ie. everybody in a bus queue lifting their mobile phones up and texting in unison.  The film continues in the same vein, marred only in my opinion by the fact that many of the characters (especially Ed) are just too damned annoying to care about. I almost punched my fist in the air when certain of them got eaten alive. Ok, this is clearly a comedy film parodying the zombie genre, and much of it is indeed very clever and amusing, but some people (I would think especially the american audience) will find the personalities just too irritating to get involved with.  Still, on the whole this parody is affectionate and sophisticated enough to be liked (and even loved) by both fans of zombie movies and of british comedy alike.
0385504209|1.0|Rather than the talent of its author, The DaVinci Code displays the power of what Joni Mitchell calls \\"the star-maker machine.\\"<br /><br />... But the hype doesn't reflect the real quality of the book, which has a stereotyped and threadbare plot. Especially pernicious is the cliched love story between the American intellectual and the sexy French babe (significantly younger than he is). The book is already made for TV.<br /><br />The success of this book rather is the product of the effort that its publisher put into promoting it. Would that such efforts would be expended on truly exciting new authors or even on classic authors who are under-read.<br /><br />In addition, the scholarly underpinnings of this book are ludicrous. Not only -- as other posters have indicated -- is Mary Magdalene demonstrably not a figure in DaVinci's \\"The Last Supper,\\" but the linguistic argument that merges the grail with the blood of Christ (\\"graal\\" with \\"sang graal\\") is also based on an historical error, since the earliest grail text (Chretien de Troyes' Perceval) does not include the phrase \\"sang graal,\\" a literary fact of which Brown (and the sources he shamelessly cribs) seems unaware.<br /><br />Boo -- a bad book.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I found this to be an excellent adaptation of Orwell's classic dystopian novel - mainly due to superb performances from John Hurt as Winston and Richard Burton as O'Brien. The film succeeds in capturing the bleak vision of the novel, a society in which the 20th century developments in technology and mass media lead to the extinction of every value, including love, loyalty and even the very idea of objective truth. A nightmarish world where the will to power triumphs over the human spirit, perfectly played out by a coldly evil Burton (in his last role) and a (literally) tortured John Hurt.
B00000I8NC|3.0|GYBE are an amazing band. \\"Lift your skinny...\\" is a truly amazing work of art. However, with this EP, while the music is exemplory, I have a comment to make regarding the first of the two backing vocal tracks to BBF. One reveiwer describes how this guy goes into court to pay a speeding ticket and outcries about how the US government are cheats, rip-offs, and so forth. The reviewer says \\"and you have to agree with him.\\" I, on the other hand, feel ashamed on behalf of GYBE that they would actually include this track. This guy is angry at the judge while he's paying his speeding ticket for no logical reason. He starts complaining to the judge that he's just there to pay his speeding ticket and he doesn't have to sit there and listen to whatever the judge has to say. I mean, just because he's under the authority of civil law he thinks his rights are being trampled upon. He starts yelling and swearing at the judge like a drunken lunatic, but has no point. What they were thinking putting this track in the midst of their gorgeous music is beyond me. The music is very dramatic and atmospheric, but it becomes way too ironic and even laughable when hapless rhetoric is put in front of it. Are they trying to \\"stir deep thought,\\" or \\"get outside the box?\\" Are they trying to represent the \\"trodden down man\\" or something? Quit trying to be deep and just do what you're good at - making amazing music.
0743454537|4.0|I didn't like this book as much as some of the reviewers -- I didn't dislike it as much as others. I am somewhat bothered by a story being told my several of the characters; in this book, there were 7 people who spoke in first-person - that's 7 times over and over that the flow of the story was broken. I kept having to flip back and see who was \\"talking\\" and if I was in present day or the past. It also was a bit longer than necessary.  <br /> <br />I figured out one of the story's \\"twists\\" early on - that was a given. <br /> <br />The ultimate \\"twist\\" - the end - didn't bother me as much as it did some - it almost had to have a bizarre ending. I kept wondering how Picoult would wrap all this heartbreak and sadness and decision-making into an acceptable ending - the answer was that she couldn't. There was no way this story could have had a happy ending. <br />
0340823364|5.0|The Battle of Corrin is the final installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, trilogy takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the sixth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's young son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually after sixty-five years brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) then Abulurd and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak. In the final story the pieces start to come together that were the basis for Dune some ten thousand years later as the groundwork is laid for the Harkonnen/Atriedes feud as well as the space guild and mentats<br /><br />As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Personally, I cannot understand why so many readers want to burn this series at the stake. I found this book, consisting of 704 pages, to be an riveting read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is ambitious so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.<br /><br />As a reader it seems to be in vogue to criticize this trilogy. As a writer I can tell you that these authors did a wonderful job of juggling this very complex story and telling the story without being confusing and finally closing an open chapter of the Dune Saga. Personally I am in awe of their accomplishment.<br /><br />I suggest that you read this with an open mind and don't pre judge these books. No, it's not as good as Dune but neither were the elder Herbert's following works. The bottom line is this is a good piece of science fiction in this day when Fantasy has taken over the genre.ut they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man. <br /> <br />Conclusion <br /> <br />Personally, I cannot understand why so many readers want to burn this series at the stake.

B0002HDT9A|3.0|Timeline sheds light on a team of archaeologists and marksmen sent back in time to recover the lead professor in a dig taking place in France.  The new setting is now 1357, France, during the Hundred Years War between the French and the English; not the best time to be visiting the Continent...   <br />There are slight hints of Stargate and Timecop so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci-fi type of category. <br />In short, the acting and the dialogues are rather weak, while the plot and the setting, are really very good!  <br />Strangely, one gets the feeling that the film was made for television and not the big screen. <br />In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.   <br />
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I'm not religious at all -- I don't believe in any god and am very skeptical of all organized religions -- but I have to say that this is one amazing piece of music. And like any magnificent work of art, it is universal precisely because it is so intensely personal.  <br /> <br />If you're like me and tend to lean more toward neo-prog (Spock's Beard, Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree) than the oldie-but-moldy Crimson/Yes fare, this album is a must for you. At the same time, be warned that it is not a cosmic blowout or psychedelic trip -- it is a collection of very concrete (and even mundane) stories set to some stunning tunes.  <br /> <br />All of the Neal Morse touches that made Spock's Beard and especially Transatlantic brilliant are available in full force here, but what's really amazing is his virtuoso guitar work. Of particular note is a bluegrass-style solo that I wasn't sure was his until I actually saw him do it on the \\"Tesimony\\" DVD (which is also definitely worth owning).  <br /> <br />I always listening to all two-plus hours of this in one sitting because it really deserves it. Makes me cry everytime...
B00005JOII|3.0|... but Brit accents instead of certain zipcodes of Manhattan do not rescue him. This is the same set of neuroses that Allen's been mining forever, more recently without a sense of humour. Essentially, if you thought the Johansen/Bill Murray Sleepless in Tokyo type of film was profound, you'll love this. I didn't see a return to form only because I can barely tell one film from the next after Zelig.  <br />You'll immediately notice that Martin Balsam, Tony Roberts and whoever is working NY Theatre these days are not in the film, but that's it - the differences are superficial. Wealthy, privileged, over indulged Londoners are subbing for the same mob out of NYC. It's not that there are any Brit versions of Allen in the film, it's just the same story, one more time. Ingmar Bergman manages this better as he seems to find with each film yet another unique reason to despair - he can't help it, he's Swedish. Allen circles the airport on the vagaries of love and betrayal, but it comes across as an incessant whine stretched over 15 years of movies. I can not imagine a WA film festival - it would remind me of a scene from Annie Hall.  <br />In that regard he has turned into a parody of himself. This particular parody is better than any of the last 7 or 8 films, but it's nothing you haven't seen before, just different streets, different accents, same cloying and annoying characters who have no right to complain about anything. I've often looked at the people in Allen's films and found myself recalling Oscar Wilde's quip that money was wasted on the wealthy. <br />
0316096199|5.0|What an awesome book and beautifully written!  I could not put this down until I was finished.(2days!)  What was nice too is that it includes an interview with the author at the end.  I am buying the lovely bones now too!!  Can't wait to get it.  This author is awesome!!
B000BUYP4Q|1.0|Batman Begins is freakin awesome...but there are technical flaws with the two-disc edition.  The second disc has the copyright infringment notice and the WB logo, and nothing else.  There are a few reviews siting this same problem, but I had Amazon to send me another copy only to find the same problem with this one too.  There seems to be a conspiracy afoot!!
B000002HRE|4.0|ReLoad is the follow-up and companion to 1996's Load.  While many people believe that ReLoad was simply all the leftovers from Load, that's not true.  The songs chosen for Load were the songs that were the most developed and farthest along.  After listening to ReLoad, I would agree, seeing as these songs are not much different stylistically from Load.  There are some right turns here though.  Marianne Faithfull's backup vocals on \\"The Memory Remains\\" gives it a creepy and discerting vibe.  The sequel to 1991's \\"The Unforgiven\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\" has a slight country vibe to it, but rocks more than the original.  The strangest (in a good way) song here is \\"Low Man's Lyric\\".  The main instrument here is a hurdy gurdy, which is very similiar to an accordion.  It is very moody and emotionally powerful when you hear James' voice.  Another strange song is \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", co-written by (former) bassist Jason Newsted.  It is very eerie and talks about children giving up too easily when faced with opposition.  Much like Load, the album closes out with a towering, lengthy song.  \\"fiXXXer\\" is even better than Load's \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" and has an evil feeling to it as you come to understand the lyrics, which deals with humans as real-life voodoo dolls.  This is not Master of Puppets by any means.  While there is some filler here (\\"Better Than You\\", \\"Slither\\"), it is a strong album and worthy companion to Load.  The only thing that could have made this even better would have been the inclusion of \\"No Leaf Clover\\", which was written at this time.  Some will say this is the low point in Metallica's career (prior to 2003's St. Anger), and if that is true, then Metallica has truly had a great run.  Standout songs include: \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Devil's Dance\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\", \\"Carpe Diem Baby\\", \\"Low Man's Lyric\\", and \\"fiXXXer\\".    P.S.  To the reviewer who mentioned \\"Bad Seed\\" winning a Grammy, that is incorrect.  \\"Better Than You\\" won a Grammy, not \\"Bad Seed\\".  Also, the person who said that the cover is a mixture of mustard and ketchup is incorrect.  Where Load's cover was blood and semen, ReLoad's cover is blood and urine.  Both covers were done by Andres Serrano.
0679746048|4.0|<br /> This novel, Girl Interrupted, by Susana Kayson, was a lot different than any other book I have read. It was a true story about a young woman living in a mental institute, and those are topics I'm not used to reading or even hearing about. Nonetheless it was a good story. It was a lot more realistic and raw than most stories I'm used to reading. The author, who was actually the young woman this story was all about, was very honest and detailed about her experiences during her stay and about her emotions. She was very open about how she felt about her mental illness, herself, and the other girls she was living with. I would definitely classify this story as a dramatic non-fiction book. It really gave me a clear picture of what it would be like to live in a mental institute, and to me personally, it seemed very scary. Not only scary, but at times lonely. I felt sorry for these girls, but I also couldn't understand all of them. Even though the author detailed everyday life for her and the other girls very well, she could of detailed the illness's they all suffered from a little bit more. Some of the girl's personalities confused me because I didn't understand the state of mind they were in. It was obvious that the author was resentful towards her parents for putting her in the institute, and at times in denial that she even had a problem. Although, it seems a lot of the girls were in denial. Overall, the story was thrilling and informative at the same time. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an intriguing and exhilarating story.  <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|Okay, so the other day I was sitting at my desk, listening to the In An Off White Room EP by The Album Leaf.  I got to the end of the track Off White Room, which is a really ambient track that is 29 minutes long.  About 10 minutes of the song is just city noise.  Anyways, to my point. <br />At 2 minutes left in that song, I heard a part very familiar to me.  So I went an listened to Talk by Coldplay. <br />Guess what? <br />Exact same melody and tempo of part.  exactly.  All Coldplay did was change the sound to guitar instead of synth. <br />So, I'm just wondering if Coldplay stole that part or they paid The Album Leaf off for it.  Either way, this album is not as original as Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head. <br />Still great sing along music though.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I am a Marvel Comics fan. So in some ways I can be too critical of some of their movies but in other ways I think I give them a lot of latitude cause I want to like them. I think Eric Bana is a very good actor and did a good job but I am not sure he was really right for the part of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Conley and Sam Elliot were excellent in their characterizations of Betty and Thunderbolt Ross. Nick Nolte? I didn't like the character of Banners dad, that part of the storyline or Nick Noltes acting in the role.<br /><br />Now to the star of the movie, THE HULK. I thought the CGI was fine. I have heard people say they didn't like it and say The Hulk looked like Shrek. I didn't see it that way. The best part of the movie were the scenes with The Hulk. He was done very well. The scene where he fights the irradiated dogs was both good for action and somewhat funny. I also liked when The Hulk went up against the jets, helicopters and tanks.<br /><br />I also heard people say they thought it took to long to get to The Hulk. I didn't mind cause it built the suspense and told the back story but it was a bit long in getting to the good stuff.
067942850X|3.0|The story was Into The Wild by Jon KraKauer. In this true story it talks about the mysterious life and death of Christopher McCandless, a talented young man from a good family who inexplicably turned his back on everything he seemed to have going for him.  He gave most of his things to charity. He abandoned his past life and personal identity all knew him by to basically disappear from the lives of family and friends. <br />This book is awesome only because of all the adventures he took while hitchhiking across the country.  But the author did a bad job of telling that Chris died at the beginning because it ruined the best of the book. This book explores the themes of adventure, nature, and independence. <br />
6305428522|5.0|This movie is just plain excellent. From top to bottom. The acting, direction, soundtrack, costumes and cinematography are just tops. The story is very interesting and the characters are rich and explored wonderfully. It is well balanced and done so well that I can only say check it out.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album sounds better every time I listen to it.  Courtney Love has an aching and longing in her voice and her lyrics that is extremely powerful and human.  Her lyrics evoke much of the emotional toll that she faced after Kurt Cobain's suicide.   <br /> <br />Every time I see Courtney Love mentioned nowadays, it has something to do with her being somewhat of a train wreck, but this is just one album that proves she is much more than that.  She is a talented musician and she lays her emotions out for all to see with her lyrics and performance.  This is a fantastic album.  If you are a fan of Nirvana or any 90s grunge music, this is near the top of the albums in that genre.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah's second-to-final album for Sony is called \\"Butterfly.\\"  The songs here are about letting go, growing up, and breaking free of the chains that bind you.  This is some serious stuff!  Mariah is so wonderful, no wonder why she's sold so many other records than that smelly cow Alanis.  This album is beautiful.  Buy, please.
0684824906|4.0|The difficulty in writing a book on a subject or person with as much written on him as Lincoln is coming up with a fresh perspective. Last year's Washington's Crossing had this for Washington and the Revolutionary War and Ms Goodwin had the same success in No Ordinary Time. What Ms Goodwin does new in this book is show the personalities of Lincoln's rivals and future cabinet members. She makes each one to be a known commodity.  <br /> <br />I read this book a few months ago and was disappointed that there was so little new about Lincoln. That criticism still rings true (for anyone with more than a passing knowledge of Abe. But, having just enjoyed \\"Manhunt, the Twelve Day Pursuit of Lincoln's Killer\\", I have come to realize just how valuable Ms Goodwin's accounts of Stanton, Seward, Welles, et al were. They made appreciation and understanding of this subsequent book related to Lincoln much deeper. In retrospect, I have upped my appreciation of the book and thus, number of stars.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, two criticisms I have of the book still ring true: It was too long and Lincoln's sainthood was a bit much.  <br /> <br />Ms Goodwin never found fault with anything Lincoln did - if there were a minor point or two, she quickly used it to show how he had improved and used the lesson to be a better person/president/candidate. I doubt there has been such a totally laudatory work on the man since Sandburg's lionization.  <br /> <br />The book is long. Too long. There were quotes, more quotes and then quotes following other quotes. Ms Goodwin got into the routine of starting nearly every paragraph with a declaratory sentence then following it with a supporting quote. I think I may have read some part of every edition of the NY Times from 1859 to 1865!  <br /> <br />Teh best parts were the accounts of the rivals and how Lincoln handled the men. The portraits were excellent: those of Seward (flattering) and Chase (unflatering) and Stanton (somewhere in between) were particularly in depth. Seward's relationship with Lincoln, in particular, was interesting; as was Chase's undying ambition, underhandedness and lack of loyalty. The other Cabinet members were not fleshed out as well.  <br /> <br />The most enjoyable part of the book was the first third when Lincoln and all his rivals for the 1860 Republican nomination were portrayed in an extremely interesting and well-done compare and contrast mode.  <br /> <br />This would have been a darn near perfect book had Ms Goodwin stayed focused on the comparison approach with which she began. The accounts of the workings within the administration dragged on and were where the tedious quoting was the worst.  <br /> <br />In retrospect, although the last third in particular was at times tedious, it was well worth working through.  <br /> <br />
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC's second album was their biggest seller and it was the final album that entirely featured the late Left Eye Lopes.  When she tragically passed away in 2002, her death was rightly mourned by fans all over.  She was a fiesty woman with a tough soul and an independent spirit.  She could teach that arrogant rag Alanis a thing or two!  Anyway, this record is amazing.  Buy now or risk ridicule!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me when somebody can be so good for such a long time! I am an old fan of Depeche Mode. By \\"old\\" I mean that I first became their fan in the mid-eighties. \\"Speak And Spell\\", \\"A Broken Frame\\", \\"Construction Time Again\\" were the first albums I fell in love with. I could listen to \\"Some Great Reward\\" all day long over and over again with my walkman headphones practically glued to my ear canals. When the \\"Violator\\" came out I thought it was an absolute work of art and nothing could compare to it. I shared my love with a number of friends through college and we even followed the style of Dave Gahan in clothing and hair.  <br /> <br />Well, may be the late 90's were not the best time for Depeche Mode. I don't know what the heck they were going through. I would call it the \\"songs of crisis and depression\\" instead of anything else. I thought Depeche Mode exhausted itself and started to loose my hope to hear something good gain. However, \\"Playing the Angel\\" was definitely a real treat. In my opinion this is their second best album after the \\"Violator\\". It's like going back in time. Depeche Mode truly capitalized on what they are good at again. Once more, they showed they had their own unique style that would always remain the style of Depeche Mode.
B000084T18|5.0|In 2003, an unforgettable thing happened in the music industry.  Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent, released his major label debut, which was an immediate success and adored by critics around the world.  His songs are potent expressions of inner city rage, and I am amazed at how brilliantly he articulates himself song after song.  You need to get this album.  Buy it, if you're man enough.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I'm glad to have lived long enough to see a movie of such pure greatness! Mark my words, this film will go down as one of the top films of the 21st century!<br /><br />Imagine! A love story between two men that will probably sweep the Academy Awards in one of the most homophobic countries in the Western World! Gay people have more civil liberties in Greenland than they do in the vast majority of the United States! How ironic!<br /><br />I have had the good fortune to have seen a few extremely wonderful gay themed movies, like Common Ground, starring Ed Asner. But Brokeback Mountain transcends sexual orientation and all other classifications we like to lump people into! It's about ultimate erotic love, mutually shared, between two adults. Something many of us will never truly experience in our entire lives. This brilliant story is a wake-up call to all of us, Gay, Bi-sexual, Straight, or any combination thereof. Life is too short, nothing, absolutely nothing, is more important than experiencing this kind of passionate, loving relationship shown in this mind boggling movie!<br /><br />I thank the author, screenwriters, producer, director and the actors for all sharing their genius, passion and greatness with the rest of us! You have changed my life forever!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This album had some of their best songs, Holy Wars(my favorite song by Megadeth) Hangar 18, and Take No Prisoners. Overall, however, the songs on the album were kinda weird, but they were still pretty good. I was dissapointed with Take No Prisoners because I downloaded the song on limewire and it was amazing but when I heard it on this, well, as I said before it was kinda weird.   <br />Even though this is not my favorite album by Megadeth (Peace Sells is best) this album probably defines megadeths overall career, and in my opininon, it is megadeths last good album (the only good song megadeth after this was syphony of destruction.) You should definetly get this album. If your not a hardcore metal fan you would still like this album.

B000BYRCH4|3.0|This is a decent treasure hunt action movie. I couldn't help considering how much it reminded me of an older classic diving for treasure movie \\"The Deep\\". The cast Nick Nolte, Robert Shaw, Jacqueline Bisset, Louis Gossett Jr., and Eli Wallach were excellent. \\"The Deep\\" story by Peter Benchley was exciting and believable as well. It was about them diving for Spanish treasure and they find morphine on a WWII freighter after a storm. The local drug dealers want it. Hmm sounds similar wouldn't you say? \\"The Deep\\" used some sharks to make it scary, but the Moray Eel was the real scare factor. Perhaps \\"Into the Blue\\" was an attempt at a fresh new version. I am afraid it falls a little flat in a few places, but overall I still don't regret seeing it one bit. It does pretty well considering it doesn't have an all star cast like \\"The Deep\\". There is enough beautiful camera work, decent acting, and reasonable story line to keep your interest.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Before I bought the album, I was really skeptical about it.  I thought this was going to be only one of those album with only 1 hit, the song \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" which is featured on the tv show One Tree Hill introduction.  However, I was pleasently surprised to see it was more than that.  He had other fantastic songs, like \\"Chariot,\\" and \\"Follow through,\\" which captures your heart and has a fantastic beat and you could really relate to the song.  Most of the songs you can bear to listen, unlike most CD's you only like 2 or 3 songs.  Also, I believe Gavin wrote all his own songs, so he just didn't sing words some Recording company gave him.  I really recommend this CD to everyone who loves listening to alternative music.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|The electric side of Bringing it All Back Home rocks.  I guess that's probably oversimplifying it, but it does.  Not only that, but the songs are relaxed, energetic, and more than anything FUN.  This was before Bob got jaded as hell (which is readily evident in Highway 61 Revisited, a classic in its own right).  Songs like \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\", false start and all, are hilarious.  And Bobby even shows his softer, poetic side on \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", which has to rank among his best ballads ever.  And I haven't even touched on the acoustic side, which is great in it's own right.  There is NO other songwriter that approaches Dylan when it comes to lyrics.  Check out \\"Gates of Eden\\" or \\"It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\".  Essential, just like most of Dylan's albums.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a album you must buy and treasure.  It features all the number 1 hits of the Beatles.  These guys basically created a new genre of music by themselves.  They have great songs, like \\"Love Me Do,\\" And \\"Eight Days A Week,\\" songs that every Beatle fan will love.  The best song on the album has to be \\"Yesterday,\\" it's simply the best, with \\"Hey, Judy,\\" coming in a close second.  Every song on the CD is spectacular, and you'll wish that all the Beatles was still alive so you could see them live.  Unfortunately, this CD is the only way to relive the Beatle's best moments, and it's a must to every Beatle collector.  Paul, Ringo, George, and John have created over 20 masterpieces, and it really belongs in your collection.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|What gets me is that people try so hard to categorize this c.d. with others, or their favorite, and what field of the ever growing \\"genre title\\" population this could be on. How about, instead of trying to find a genre, we find a reason to how a beautiful c.d. such as this, ever came to be. This album, is by far THE BEST ALBUM OF 2005. Bar none!<br /> I have been hard pressed to find an album until this one. The other choice was The Russian Futurists. That come in at a close second. Of all the tracks, I would have to say \\"Chicago\\" says it best. Yes, all of the tracks bring a spellbinding, and heart-warming feel to the speakers, and I felt that the album was dynamically above normal, but \\"Chicago\\", was way above that. The seriousness of the song, the choir, the emotions. All of these places that he brings you to on the album, carried an aura around it.<br /> It boasts a phenominal 22 tracks, and no other album in the last decade in my eyes (minus R.F.'s) has come remotely in the same calibur of greatness, that Sufjan does. He is THE best singer/songwriter/co-producer, that I have ever heard. Without a doubt. I could put an entire months salary on it, that he will be the same again for the next decade, and still keep my money. He is the future of all music.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was one of their best albums.  Most of the songs were just sensational.  I really loved \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" and I think it was a hit with everyone else because a lot of people could really relate to the song.  They have other songs which help people relate, such as \\"Extraordinary Girl,\\" and they have songs which talk about American society, like \\"American Idiot.\\"  The album really gets you in your grove and really gets you to dance.  Once you start listening, you can't stop, and you want to listen to the album over and over again.  It's a fantastic album, and everyone should but it.
0812975219|4.0|As self-proclaimed option buyer (vs option seller like Victor Niederhoffer) the book discusses probability issues and their misunderstood likely/unlikely pricing. For example, how do you really know if you've got a good financial advisor? Just because he/she produced 20% annual returns over the last 5 years does not justify that they are a great equity investment manager and not susceptible to a melt-down going forward. They could have just as easily been lucky enough to have caught a good trend (i.e. Banks in the 91-96 timeframe). Even the dart test (randomness) on many occasions has produced just as good of returns. The book at its best points out that most underestimate the randomness in stock market returns and in general, life as a whole (i.e. How did that idiot get promoted - was he/she at the right place right time? or truly the best candidate). The book has some similarities in the discussional text as in \\"Against the Gods\\", but takes a different approach to the \\"revision of the mean\\" than Mr. Bernstein. This book is more of a thesis on pricing the possibility of the 3-sigma event (or the lack of proper recognition of) that happens more often than we give credit to (or price for). Take for example the insurance industry where they were pricing their products with respect to \\"natural\\" phenomena, but now their pricing includes an added \\"man made\\" risk premium or lack of \\"man prevention\\" in the case of New Orleans. (remarks reflect original version)<br /><br />Of note: In the sequel \\"The Black Swan\\", we learn that we should really toss out our concept of 'sigma' as it is Gaussian based and not applicable to power law based systems. Therefore my title should really be revised to something similar to \\"Underpricing of an Exponential Event\\".
B000BMSTMS|1.0|A friend of mine sent me four Korn songs.  Though I have read the lyrics online, and liked some of the lyrics, the production, the band, the singing... they all STINK TO HIGH HEAVEN.  Korn is dreadfully bad.  DREADFULLY BAD.  Don't waste your time with this band...
B000002MY3|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />Unless you lived in a cave somewhere in Madagascar or were part of an indigenous tribe untouched by modern civilization, if you were around in the 1990s, surely you must have been familiar with Alanis Morissette. Even if you didn't own her breakthrough album \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" (1995) you knew the songs, they were everywhere. For a short time in the mid 90s, it was Alanis fever. On modern rock and adult-contemporary stations, on MTV, at the mall, everywhere you went, you heard the singles. Teenage girls (and some boys) everywhere owned her album. Even if you hated her music and would rather die before buying it, you would be able to sing \\"Ironic\\" almost perfectly in your sleep.<br /><br />\\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was not actually Alanis Morissette's debut album. Prior to releasing her breakthrough that thrust her into superstardom, the former Nickelodeon child star already had two albums under her belt; dance-pop fair, comparable to Debbie Gibson. But with the release of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" (1991) which changed the rules and made \\"alternative\\" rock mainstream, Alanis jumped on the bandwagon. With producer Glen Ballard, Morissette made an extremely palatable album that seemingly had \\"alternative\\" rock credentials (such as guest guitarist Dave Navarro) that would appeal to Generation X-ers, teenybopper mall-rats, the Lilth-fair crowd, High School/College kids, and the soft-rock adult-contemporary audience alike. Thus \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was almost custom made for the 1990s.<br /><br />The biggest drawback of the album is there is something disingenuous about it. It feels safe and contrived, as though it was watered-down riot grrrl for mall rats. The album comes across as something very calculated, posturing as something genuine. But while \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is definitely slick and somewhat pretentious, there's no denying it's a solid collection of songs with great hooks and grooves. While Morissette's lyrics are sophomoric and her songs read like a blog from a teenager's myspace profile, her charisma compensates immaturity. The big singles; \\"You Oughta Know,\\" (directed toward Uncle Joey from \\"Full House,\\" gross) \\"Hand in my Pocket,\\" \\"You Learn,\\" \\"Head over Feet\\" and \\"Ironic\\" have all  aged well and stand as some of the most memorable radio staples from the 1990s. The rest of the album is better than average filler, making \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying listen.<br /><br />But alas, for Alanis, the light that shines so brightly burns twice as fast. While her next few follow-up albums debuted at number one on the charts and sold well, they did so only because of the incredible momentum created from \\"Jagged Little Pill.\\" By the mid 00s, a new Alanis album is met with about as much interest as a new Steve Guttenberg movie. Truth be told, Alanis Morissette was like an alternative-rock Cyndi Lauper for the 90s. Her faux feministic anthems and alt. rock posturing took her only so far. Unlike some of her peers, like Tori Amos, she couldn't maintain a loyal following.  Her self-indulgent narcissistic bedroom poetry grew stale and her audience evaporated.<br /><br />While Alanis is more-or-less a one album wonder, it was still a memorable album.

B000286RNY|5.0|I had heard about this movie online years ago and ordered it international from Taiwan because I was excited about it. It is an award-winning film. I was interested in the culture and views of these other people too, this being a top film over there. I am very much interested in other cultures and worldwide films.<br /><br />I was amazed at how awesome this movie was. It is one of my favorite films of all time. Full of timeless themes of heroism, spirituality, and right and wrong -- all woven into a fun and entertaining film. I love the chi-energy-like fire effects when the players get their Shaolin power. Their film-making is poetic and gripping and this makes a great story.<br /><br />This is a must-see film by any standard, great for the whole family (unlike a lot of films these days...).
B000852GIQ|5.0|I can't even describe to you how great this cd is.  It is simply spectacular/amazing.  After hearing the soundtrack to Goodbye Lenin, I was quite disappointed.  I thought that Amelie might have been the peak of Yann's career but I was very wrong.  Les Retrouvailles is 120568x's better than Amelie. I definitely recommend it, especially track three...wonderfully mezzmerizing. It puts you right on the banks of the Siene looking up at the effiel tower. I am so grateful to have found this incredible music.  Thanks again Yann!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao MIYAZAKI's \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is the third anime film I've seen, the second I've liked, and the first that really blew me away.  The grand story, lush visuals, attention to detail, enchanting soundtrack and sophisticated characterizations all combine to make \\"Princess Mononoke\\" a truly captivating film.  Miyazaki's (largely hand-drawn) artwork is famous, and far superior to any other animation I've ever seen.  Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack perfectly complements the epic artwork, pacing and tension of the film.  It is composed largely within the western symphonic tradition; its majestic yet melancholy tone strongly reminds me of the slow theme of Holst's \\"Jupiter\\".  The characters, wonderfully, are all human (even the nonhumans) in the sense that their motivations are rational and logical.  There are no true villains, only characters driven into conflict by their opposing goals, ideals and loyalties.<br /><br />Despite American prejudices about cartoons as kid stuff, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is targeted toward older audiences: it is long, its plot is complex, and there is a good deal of \\"blood and gore and guts\\", though the film does not revel in the violence.  I'm not terribly fond of the English-language dub of the film, but it is decent by the standards of the genre.  Fortunately this DVD includes both language tracks so you can compare them and choose your favorite.<br /><br />\\"Princess Mononoke\\" is set in Japan's medieval period, after the country's feudal system has broken down and the power of the Emperor and the Shogun is all but nonexistent.  The film follows Ashitaka (\\"tomorrow?\\" in Japanese), the last prince of a group of 'barbarians' hidden in northern Japan (a draft title of the film was actually \\"The Tale of Ashitaka\\").  He is cast out by his people after being cursed by a demon, and travels to the demon's home at the other end of the land in search of a way to remove the curse.  There he finds himself in the middle of a war for control of an ancient forest, fought between the people of Iron Town, led by the able, determined, humane and iconoclastic Lady Eboshi, and the gods of the forest (mononoke), in whose ranks fights San, the Princess Mononoke of the title, a human girl raised by the wolf god Moro.  Falling in love with San and learning that it was the hatred of this war that took shape as his curse, Ashitaka desperately but unsuccessfully tries to make peace between the humans and the raging gods, before they destroy each other and him with them.<br /><br />There are two main themes Miyazaki addresses in \\"Princess Mononoke\\". The first has to do with Japanese history.  Miyazaki is an admirer of popular Japanese historian Yosihiko AMINO, and several of Amino's arguments are reflected in \\"Princess Mononoke\\".  For example, Miyazaki attempts to avoid the focus on rice-farming peasants and Samurai warriors typical of Japanese films set in the medieval period (such as Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\").  Instead, he concentrates on manufacturers and traders, hunters, monks and other non-agriculturalists, whom Amino argues are often overlooked in traditional histories of Japan.  In addition, Miyazaki tries to illustrate the chaos, confusion and rapid social and cultural change that Amino sees at the heart of the medieval period, and that Miyazaki views as similar in many ways to the present, with its rapid changes in technologies, cultures and ideas.<br /><br />Second and more visible is the issue of humanity's relationship with nature.  Although many western viewers have been quick to categorize \\"Princess Mononoke\\" as a simple eco-fable or environmentalist screed, it should really go without saying that Miyazaki's environmental message is far more subtle.<br /><br />In a sense, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" can be considered the spiritual sequel to Miyazaki's 1984 film \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\", which also focused heavily (and more ideologically) on ecological issues.  \\"Princess Mononoke\\" was, in fact, the first film Miyazaki made after finishing his nearly 1100 page \\"Nausicaa\\" novel in 1994, after a dozen years of work.

B000B8QEYC|1.0|I have loved some of Enya's records before, as have most people.  That is why this album is so disappointing.  It is a complete rip-off.  There is not an original sound or thought on it! I really wish I could get my money back.  And the company that handles her should be just as ashamed for milking the cow she has apparently become.  Don't waste your money....
0679746048|4.0|The book, Girl Interrupted, by Susan Kaysen is a very well written book. The author, Susan Kaysen, does an amazing job of making it feel like you are right with her the through out her whole experience at the hospital. This non-fiction novel is a book regarding a teenage girl who got checked in to some sort of a mental hospital. It takes you through of all of her different experiences, personal thoughts, and introduces you to people she met along the way. Girl Interrupted gives you a real life experience and makes you feel like you are part of it, too. You learn about the world inside a mental hospital and even shows you all the paper work along the way. It makes you want to keep reading to find out more, and to see if she ever gets out. This book is great if you want to learn more about psychology, and how people act.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|Before you decide that this album is something that you must get, be for warned - it's not for everyone, nor do I consider it the masterpiece that many of the reviews on Amazon have called it. First, let me say that the concept (and titles) are creative, although I would wager that the 50 state album idea does not make it past 5 or 6 states at the most. In any case the main problem I have with Sufjan is in the lite, horrid and extremely fey vocal style he uses. Had this been an instrumental album I would really have thought of this as a much different animal, but as it stands every time I hear that \\"heartfelt\\" quasi folk singer lilt, it makes me ill. Fans of Rufus Wainwright, Belle and Sabastian need apply - this is right up your overly sensitive weeping alleyway. Some blame can be placed on the later work of the Flaming Lips, who found that a lighter vocal style helped to rope in a wider audience of teenage girls and sensitive indi-rock hipsters. Meanwhile, the Lip's harder psych rock was thrown out of the car's windows on the way to greater critical acclaim. As you can guess, I'll take the early psychedelic insanity. So it is with this ambitious album.  You ask, \\"what's wrong with being sensitive?\\" well, nothing, but I prefer the sensitivity of Syd Barrett or Frank Zappa to that of say, Michael Jackson.  I could imagine it in the hands of far greater music makers such as Acid Mothers Temple or perhaps even Tom Waits but this just doesn't get me hooked - regardless of the applause, I can see the Emperor's new clothes, and there's really not much there.  Sorry folks, but gimme danger! gimme something that will make me feel! but please...enough with the namby pamby sounds of lite-rock 101.
0440214041|5.0|I enjoyed reading almost the whole novel. I skipped a few irrelevant dialogues and it didn't affect my understanding. However, the novel does have some obscure parts as some other American reviewers stated. For example, John Grisham interrupts sometimes the readers with his personal commentaries. He must've wanted to express what many readers would be thinking or feeling, however it can be annoying sometimes.     Back to the good points: the characters are very human, one reviewer from TN said he could relate to the novel's characters. John did a superb job in describing the tense working situation that arouse many times between bosses and subordinates (especially between the president and Voyles, the FBI director) and all the political games involved, especially the media and public manipulation. Sometimes it seems that there are only two good guys in the novel: the Washington Post's reported Gary Grantham (and even he himself is a bit tricky) and Darby Shaw (who finds the real bad guy). All other don't care much about justice being done:    -One of the assassinated Supreme Cout memebers, Abraham Rosenberg, was one of those judges who are lenient with criminals. For example, he supported a guy (Nash) who was found to posses an AK-47 assault rifle and he had charges of drug trafficking. It is so wimpy to try to justify AR.    -Voyles negotiates with the president to stop investigating some murder suspects if the president stops blaming the FBI for mistakes in protecting the two Supreme Courts judges assassinated (who didn't want to be protected in first place). The president himself starts the negotiation. The president's top assistant, Coal Fletcher, is merciless with all the employees.    -The heroine's professor, Tom Callahan is only interested in pleasures, especially sex and if it wasn't enough he admires Rosenberg. His friend at the FBi is much like him (otherwise they wouldn't be friends). I never liked that character, Tom, and I actually liked when he's bombed when he was about to drive a Porsche while drunk; thanks for that part John.    -Even the heroine is a hypocrite. On one hand she wants to make a living out of suing chemival companies and on the other hand she invests on those very same companies. This seems to be takes out of the anti-liberal book \\"Do as I say (not as I do) where they say this is what Michael Moore does.    -The bad guys are....bay guys.  Some of them were not clearly identified as other reviewer said, but it's well understood those ones were small fishes. It looks unbelievable that a normal student -Darby- could run away from experienced murders, but you'll find who was helping her almost at the end of the book. This was right what Agatha Christie and many other writers used to do. You can found this action (explanations at the story's end) even in Scooby-Doo cartoons and movies!       Perhaps John strained the readers from knowing who the one behind all the murders was, but that's a standard tool of writers. It wasn't so bad of him, except for the fact that Fletcher Coal becomes the bad guy for most of the book when it was him who advised the president not to interfere with FBI's investigations. Meanwhile, the real murder does whatever he wants...which is what happens in real life all too often. Meanwhile John shows us how authorities behave. This novel was not so much about the typical cat-after-the-mouse chase, but how people behave in their jobs in the government and the media. It was also interesting to read how John described the way Gray, Darby and the Washington Post's staff (all imaginary of course) organized the publication of the final article where they denounced the murderers. Of course all of these descriptions are only clues about how things work in real world.    Yes, give this novel a chance and read it with all your imagination.
B0000009SE|5.0|Waka Jawaka, the tune is Zappa. As Big swifty equally is of course. Take a brief listening to these tunes. You will find that awkward (but extremely beautiful) sense of melody that is completly his own. The very start of these tunes. Those melodies, that unique sense of orchestration.. That is Zappa, at least to me. Zappa of course was a kaleidoscopic, complex and quite unique figure and his musical universe is the perfect representation of his mind and very wide creativity. So saying that he was just \\"this thing\\" (instrumental jazz fusion) would be going far away from the reality. But I mean that these tunes where Zappa fused jazz, with instrumental rock and with his own sense of melody are to me what will remain of his musical legacy. Certainly not his weird sense of grotesque and irony (that is delightful sometimes, awful others), his lyrics which by the way were very often been related to the strictly contemporary issues ... so the present was their time, not the future. Music instead is eternal if it's beautiful! And when Zappa wrote instrumental music he was always right, his music is always beautiful if not sublime! This to say that I really love this album and his perfect companion The Grand Wazoo, probably his overall best works (but I don't own his complete discography). Anyway Zappa was a true musical genius. This almost full instrumental album is extremely lovely, just a little step behind the Wazoo in my polls (and even after the marvellous Hot rats probably). Yes Frank, music is the best! Waka Jawaka is music! WJ is the best!
B000001F5A|5.0|Vangelis' soundtrack to Koreyoshi Kurahara's seldom seen and all but forgotten '84 film 'Antarctica' is one of the true undiscovered classics of the last twenty years. Possibly second only to his highly acclaimed 'Chariots of Fire' masterpiece, 'Antarctica alludes to a less emotional, more remote musical experience.<br /><br />Vangelis' ethereal soundtrack masterfully transports the listener to a barren, yet exquistely beautiful soundscape that superbly captures the sense of isolation and loneliness of this vast, frozen continent. The pieces are haunting, mystical, yet surprisingly peaceful instead of disquieting. Without a doubt this is one of my all-time favorite CD's.
B000002LE6|4.0|After almost sixteen years of having still the original LP and CD as well, this was still an album that should have been not a great album, but a good album considering the success of the previous release Sign of the Times.  Like \\"Around The World In A Day\\" which musically was genius, and went against the grain of the success of Purple Rain, Lovesexy boasted some funky, funky songs.  Eye No, the first track gets you from the start of the CD.  I wasn't overly thrilled with Alphabet St, and figured he released it as a single just for Pop Radio Crossover heads.  However, undoubtedly, the best song on the album and one of the best songs I've heard and seen him perform live is \\"Anna Stesia\\".  Anybody who's heard this played live knows exactly what I mean.  I still don't think Prince still gets his due as one of the meanest guitarists in Rock & Roll or in the music business period.  I always hear about Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, etc when guitarists names are being mentioned but Prince can hold his own with any one of them.  And When 2 R In Love continued Prince's domination on Urban R&B radio with his smooth and sultry ballads.  When buying Prince albums there are two things I have to have, funky tracks, and delicious ballads.  Lovesexy had both.  The only complaint in which I didn't give it 5 stars was the album pieceing together all the songs as one continuous track.  That was and still is irritating.  Glad Anna Stesia was put on a live album some years later cuz I could never get that song by itself.  With technology the way it is you would think by now someone would be selling this particular CD with the tracks separated individually.  Oh Well!  Still great CD
B000000OQF|5.0|This album blew me away when I first heard of it. I was eleven at the time, and I will never forget the day I heard of it. All the songs gave me gooseflesh, Almost made me want to pick up a guitar and learn how to play it.<br /><br />I started fifth grade that year, and I played the tape every chance I had, Of course no walkmans were allowed in school, so I went to class, hummed the songs, went home, and blasted the cassette while I was doing my schoolwork. That year instead of getting a guitar to learn to play music, I got a clarinet. I learned the notes of the songs and played single notes with the album, the guitar riffs, the vocal lines, wishing I knew how to play guitar.<br /><br />Two summers later a friend of my dad's left an acoustic guitar at our house for months. I took it out of its case and started plucking the strings. I played my Appetite tape, and learned to tune the guitar down to match the notes of the songs. My father showed up later, wondering what I was doing with his friends' guitar. I just told him that I wanted to learn how to play guitar, so he showed me the basic chords. Not enough to play Welcome to the Jungle, Nightrain, or even the interesting one, Sweet Child O' Mine (that intro sounded horrible on a clarinet) I did learn the chords to Sweet Child, and I was thrilled that I could finally learn.<br /><br />Now I am 27 years old, a travelling musician, and a renound music lover. I think back on listening to this album and it was a huge thing back in it's day, and still stands the test of time, as far as albums are concerned. It in my opinion ranks up there with Electric Ladyland, Back In Black, and Master of Puppets. It also gave a lot of us music fans something different than looking at MTV every day, looking at Bon Jovi smile every second of the day with his bubble gum rock. A sigh of relief for all of us.<br /><br />I probably didn't write the best of reviews but this album is worth the time and money. It may change your life, if you let it, but most of all, it's more of a wake up call, for people that are too used to the everyday things that happen. I still listen to this album and think that it's changed my life, even if later the band itself plummeted to the ground. Appetite For Destruction is an album that time will (hopefully) never forgetif you let it, but most of all, it's more of a wake up call, for people that are too used to the everyday things that happen. I still listen to this album and think that it's changed my life, even if later the band itself plummeted to the ground. Appetite For Destruction is an album that time will (hopefully) never forget
6304474806|5.0|This video series is a must who prefer enducational videos to pointless miandering tv shows. If these videos were released a few years AFTER the Baby Einstein series became so popular (instead of a few years before) they would be hot!<br /><br />I love these and my 3 year old loves these more. They feature 3 very life like puppets in a \\"natural setting\\" as uncle balzac (a chamelion) teaches 2 young animals who about different animals of the world. With beautiful national geographic footage of animals in nature (no animals in zoo's here) they cover different aspects of animals. With fun sing-alongs, funny puppets, and beautiful animals your child will be learning what a \\"mammal\\" or \\"nocturnal\\" is, which animals can fly, how animals find their food, different habbitats and more. In this particular video the young animals learn about animals that ive in holes-who/what/why/where/how's are all covered. They also dip into fun facts about cats and animals at the watering hole.
B00020HEG6|5.0|Amazing how John Williams comes up with all this new material for old characters . . . one of the best scores ever. Go get it, if you don't have it already! You won't regret it!!! <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I noticed a lot of the composed music was played over and over again on each track. Which annoyed me. But overall, the soundtrack was nice. Some of the vocal songs seemed weird, seeing that \\"it seems so easy\\" doesnt seem to fit in this movie. But the other country-type music seemed to fit well with this movie. I have yet to see this movie, though. Maybe it'll sound better once I see it. ^_^
B000BJS4TO|5.0|. . . and I think one word sums it up pretty well: WOW. This movie is awesome, and that is, in my humble opinion, largely owing to the hauntingly beautiful and elegant score by master composer John Williams (just imagine the movie stripped of its music and all you have left is pretty pictures . . . and yeah, the lead actress Ziyi Zhang IS pretty darn gorgeous). The score TELLS the story, in a way -- and this one really SHINES. I've heard excerpts of it before on the official soundtrack website (I'm ashamed to say I still don't own the album since it hasn't been released in Austria yet, but I've ordered it now) and didn't quite know what to make of it then, but after enjoying the music along with the visuals, I have to say John Williams really outdid himself. I can now understand the enthusiasm he had for the project. I'll even go so far as to say that, in its own way, it rivals Angela's Ashes and Prizoner of Azkaban in its emotional intensity, not to mention Schindler's List.  <br />I won't repeat the story here, since, I think, it is fairly well-known (and if you don't know it, read the Arthur Golden novel or go see the movie), but I WILL say that this is a love story of sorts between Sayuri and the Chairman . . . and consequently the score is built around two leitmotifs, the suites of which are entitled \\"Sayuri's Theme\\" and \\"The Chairman's Waltz.\\" They are heard plenty of times in appropriate moments, but they never become tedious or too much because they evolve throughout the picture in such a graceful fashion (I'm thinking here especially of \\"Confluence,\\" which includes a final emotional statement of Sayuri's theme as played by the whole ensemble). John Williams gives his melodies his usual tweaks and orchestral variations to fit a scene perfectly and I literally got goosebumps every time they started playing. Also, the ethnic instruments that surround these themes and the more playful atmospheric cues (\\"Going to School\\") are well-incorporated to capture the mysteriously exotic ambience of pre-war Japan -- the Shakuhachi and the koto, how does one write for such difficult instruments, anyway? You have to experience it for yourself to fully appreciate it, believe me. <br />Perhaps my passionate enthusiasm can be explained by the fact that I am in part Japanese myself and have an added emotional attachment to the subject matter (and if I sound too gushing, I make no excuses), but I don't think that's all of it . . . and the well-earned Golden Globe proves it. Once I have the album, I know this is music I will treasure for the rest of my life; and for a lifelong John Williams-fan like myself, it's just one more in a huge canon of legendary und unforgettable movie scores.  <br />
B00068CVJ4|3.0|Everyone has labeled this as the absolute best ATDI album and I have to say I couldn't disagree more.  In/Casino/Out and vaya were both much better works in my opinion and represented what ATDI was better than the ROC album.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few good tracks on this album like invalid litter dept., rolodex propaganda, and sleepwalk capsules, but I felt that Ross Robinson made them sound like more of metal band on this record when they were anything but.  Plus by this time Cedric and Omar seemed like they were leaning towards more experimental things and were becoming bored with the music they were creating with ATDI.  There is only so much you can do with post-punk music before it sounds like the same regurgitated crap.  Personally I think that The Mars Volta is much more talented in everyway possible and I am glad that ATDI disbanded.  In my opinion if you want good ATDI look to acrobatic tenement, vaya, and in/casino/out, first.  I think those albums were less commercial and better represented what ATDI was as a band.  I know most will disagree with me, but everyone has there own opinion.   <br /> <br />Also if you are interested in all of the former ATDI members projects after the band broke up check \\"Crime in Choir\\" if you dont already know them.  It is one of the original members of ATDI.
B000BKDOCA|4.0|This is an interesting remix album.  Although I am not certain this is the best remix album on the market, it is a strong compilation of unpredictable Britney songs rolled into one.  The album offers a lot of variance.  The Toxic remix is very uptempo and dancey -but be warned that not all the songs on this album are (so if you are buying it for workout music or dance music you might be disappointed..).  However what you will find is a nice combination of Britney's old and new as well as some interesting use of beats from one of her mentors (see if you can find the sample to Madonna's Vogue hidden away in one of the songs).  This album is very listener friendly- there is none of the spoken word/ rap infused remixes that you find on some other pop songstresses remix work.  In fact, herein Britney's (enhanced) voice get a bit more soulful on some of her tracks. If you are a Britney fan you will love this album .  If you are like me, somebody who is probably years older than the average Britney fan (and perhaps a bit shy  to admit you are one?), you will find yourself grooving along to this fun album. If you are a critic of studio produced modern pop, then this album won't be for you.<br /><br />Regarding the issue of harmful software that automatically launches on your computer, I purchased my album from Amazon, I use a Dell PC, and with Itunes I had no problems with the upload of songs nor conversion to MP3 files.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I bought this CD, and the Live at San Quentin CD, after seeing the movie Walk the Line. I have some other studio Johnny Cash CDS but they pale in comparison to Live at Folsum Prison. This is pure entertainment, raw in some places as the vocals aren't always perfect, but you expect that in a live recording. I flat out love this CD and it hasn't been out of my player since I got it.  <br /> <br />Johnny is edgy here, a man who will do what he pleases to entertain the cons. The background sounds of the prison make it all real...this wasn't some nice arena, this was a prison full of bad guys. Johnny even has to ask several times for  a simple glass of water. How many of today's stars would do something in a place like Folsum Prison. <br /> <br />Luther Perkins guitar sounds incredible, and by not having a large ensemble to play with the guitars really stand out and make the music so much fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Others have commented on Cash's singing \\"Greystone Chapel\\" written by inmate Glen Sherley. This is an amazing song. Only Johnny Cash can cuss and sing prison songs like \\"Cocaine Blues\\" then deliver songs that are like religious-like hymms with a country flavor such as \\"Greystone Chapel\\". <br /> <br />This is the best live album I have ever heard and probably the best country music album too.
0307276902|4.0|I bought the book after hearing about all the lying. I thought, the story line would not have held the publisher's interest had he thought it was a work of fiction. His true story might not have been published but his telling of his story combined with other's he might have heard in rehab is powerful. If I gave this to someone who was an addict they might better identify with the character, someone who comes into the center knowing he won't make it and leaves just 6 weeks later with hope. The fact that the 12 steps for him, the higher power ends up being himself, not God that helps him is something many agnostic or atheist addicts might better identify with. I think the realization that the better clinics in the world have something less than a 20% success rate is horrifying. As a society, we better rid this stuff off the streets sooner than later. I liked the book a lot. I learned a lot. I found the lack of grammar added to the story.
0316168815|3.0|In The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold, Susie Salmon gets raped and brutally murdered. This event starts the book and then it follows Susie as she tells the rest of the story from her view of Earth from heaven. She was a fourteen-year-old girl heading home from school one day when the tragedy occurred. Right away you witness Susie's family fall apart and the mystery of who her killer was get the best of them. The story is in Susie's point of view in heaven and she watches certain people continue on with life without her.<br /><br /> This book was very suspenseful. Having Susie tell the story you, as a reader, know everything about everyone, but she can't change their actions; so you know if someone is doing something they shouldn't but they don't. It is also very original and written unlike many books. But, it can be a little confusing at times and is meant for older teens and adults. This book makes you think a lot about trust and how you always have to follow your instinct.
B00005JOIF|3.0|Spielberg's film \\"Munich\\" is a remake of the 1986 film \\"Sword of Gideon\\" starring Michael York and Rod Steiger.  The true story of the terrorist incident at the 1972 Olympics and the Israeli response.  This film is grittier and more graphic than the original, though many scenes are taken verbatim from it.<br /><br />  One problem I have is the title.  Kind of like \\"JFK\\" which wasn't really about JFK, \\"Munich\\" isn't about Munich.  It does recreate the original incident, but better to see the 1999 documentary \\"One Day in September\\".  The final scene with the World Trade Center photoshopped into the scene was effective, but the point that was to be made was too nebulus.  What is it exactly Spielberg is trying to say there?<br /><br />  Again if you see \\"Sword of Gideon\\" much of \\"Munich\\" is redundant, and in a sense a rip-off, especially as it isn't being marketed as a remake, trying to sweep that under the rug.  The good points are the realism of the camerawork.  I think Spielberg reaches too far by taken incidents and trying to extend them into universal themes.  Schindler's list was not the quintessential Holocaust film as some believe, it was a specific story (War and Remembrance would be the quintessential one).  And likewise this is so far from a quintessential film on terrorism, but it wants to be.

B00005JOIF|3.0|This is an interesting flick about the history of Europe but it is sometimes hard to understand.  You'll have to read the synopsis in order to know what's going on. <br /> <br />Though this is a lot more preferrable than most of the other junk being produced today, it does have its share of objectionable content.  I would not recommend this to young children because the film faithfully depicts the violence and horror of the Palestinian terrorism in Europe.  The explosions rocked me out of my seat, and the unnecessary nude scenes I can do without. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this faithfully tells the horror of the tyranny and at the end it speaks of how the terror group dictator was captured years later.  My best recommendation for the subject would be a documentary on the History Channel. <br /> <br />At least this 'R' rating is a legitimate 'R' rating as most should acquire an NC-17.  I appreciate that.
076780421X|4.0|I am not typically a fan of the romantic comedy, but Fools Rush In is one of the few that keeps my interest. The film focuses the trials and tribulations and cultural clash that follows a one-night stand in Vegas that leaves Isabelle Fuentes pregnant. Salma Hayek plays the fiesty Mexican-American photographer who hooks up with Alex Whitman (played by Matthew Perry), an uptight and nerdy WASP architect from New York City who is on a business trip in Nevada. <br /> <br />Hayek and Perry both deliver outstanding performances, and despite the fact that this movie is a comedy, it also contains a few sentimental moments as well. The film's ending is predictable, but the movie itself does raise some important issues regarding inter-ethnic dating and marriage - such as dealing with parents and in-laws, inevitable culture clash, disputes over the child's religious upbringing, and societal prejudice. <br /> <br />Men and women can equally relate to the events in the storyline. This film will resonate with anyone who has ever faced rejection from someone they were truly in love with; it will likewise resonate with those who have callously brushed aside someone who truly loved them. <br /> <br />In the final analysis, this film works so well because Hayek and Perry are such total opposites. Their diametrically opposed personalities drive home the comedy element in this film and keep the laughs rolling.

B00005ATQF|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is the most realistic and accurate depiction of military life ever released as a major motion picture. Unlike Platoon and Casualties of War (which attempt to capitalize on the viewer's compassion and sentiments), Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece gives us an emotionless, no-holds-barred look at warfare and the toll it takes on the men who carry it out. <br /> <br />Actually, Full Metal Jacket consists of two different movies - the first of which follows a company of new recruits through 12 grueling weeks of the U.S. Marine Corps boot camp in Parris Island, South Carlonia. The outstanding performance of R. Lee Ermey, playing Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, gives insight into the hell young recruits and draftees must go through to graduate boot camp. Young men barely out of high school, and full of youthful humor and ambition, are steadily molded into well-disciplined killing machines and the world's greatest fighters. Meanwhile, one of the recruits - a clumsy, overweight Private Pyle - struggles with the strict regiment and Marine life in general, until his fellow recruits force him back in line. This unleashes the inner beast within Pyle...with tragic consequences. <br /> <br />The second part of the film follows a platoon's experiences in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive of 1968. Here Kubrick focuses on the ugly side of America's experience in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s, through the prism of the young men sent their to fight it. The Marines quickly realize that their government has sent them into a no-win situation, public support for the war has eroded, and even the native Vietnamese see the Americans as more burden than ally. Kubrick captures the essence of the nihilism of war through Private Joker, a reporter for the Marine Corps' Stars and Stripes newsletter. Once a jovial character who made light of the situation he found himself in, Joker is reduced to an emotionless, battle-hardened warrior by the film's conclusion. War is hell. <br /> <br />I havetalked to several friends and colleagues who served in the USMC, and all of them have indicated that Full Metal Jacket is dead-on in its depiction of boot camp. The acting and directing in this film is both high-caliber, and the film leaves you with an empty, sick feeling - but at the same time with the feeling that life must go on. The sheer impact of Full Metal Jacket is gut-wrenching and overwhelming.  <br /> <br />You should definitely check this film out.
0440237688|4.0|Imagine a world of black and white, a world where everyone is equal and no one is capable of doing wrong.  There are no lies, no thieves, no murderers; everything is perfect.  This is the place that Lois Lowry takes us to in her distopian novel, The Giver.  She paints a picture of the perfect life; free from all wrongdoing and judgment.  There is also, however, no feeling.  The community that she artfully depicts fulfills almost any expectation.  This place, though, lacks hate, love, joy, grief, pain, sorrow, and even happiness.  The people of this numb community are always fed, but always hungry, not for food, but they are starving for some kind of Elsewhere, a place that they are totally oblivious to.  The main character in this fictitious read is a young boy named Jonas.  He is given the honor to bear the weight of the Memories of the Community; and often battles himself over this knowledge.  Jonas is constantly conflicted with his yearning to share his ability.  As soon as he received his gifts, he wished the community had abolished them, yet still wanted to protect the citizens from themselves.  Until one day, he discovers a horrible truth, one that drives him to do the unthinkable.  This book is a must-read.  Lois Lowry is has an excellent ability to drive a plot through its end.  The Giver is a powerful example of a distopian society at its worst, yet it still brings out the best in mankind.  This book compared to such books as 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Animal Farm.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Piece Of Mind (1983.), Iron Maiden's fourth studio album<br /><br />Iron Maiden are without doubt one of the main bands which epitomises the heavy metal genre; furthermore, they are definitely one of the most influential. The band were one of the more successful artists of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal Scene (NWOBHM) at the start of the 80's. They proved they were well on top of the NWOBHM scene and the heavy metal genre in general with their 1982 masterpiece, 'Number Of The Beast'. The album was a colossus of timeless and deftly executed songs which have easily stood the test of time. Following this, the band had to start from scratch for their next studio album and trust me, following up 'Number Of The Beast' was no easy task. In early 1983, following the replacement of drummer Clive Burr with the infamous Nicko McBrain, the band jetted off to Compass Point, Nassau in the Bahamas to cut their new album. The album, depicting band mascot Eddie locked in a padded cell was relased in May 1983 and has gone on to become one of Iron Maiden's most revered works. So is 'Piece Of Mind' a revelation?<br /><br />Bad puns aside, this album is another awesome effort from the band and is fully deserving of a 5 star rating. The band definitely matched their legendary 'Number Of The Beast' album with this work. I'm not sure whether I would say it was better - both albums are so good that it's hard to decide but it is easily an album which is up there with the best. Like it's predecessor, the album succeeds more than anything with brilliant song writing. The songs are filled with plenty of fantastic, racing and heavy riffs. At the same time though, plenty of the songs, such as 'Flight Of Icarus' and 'Die With Your Boots On' have plenty of catchy hooks and choruses which make the music all the more fun to listen to. In fact that is one of the qualities I really admire about Iron Maiden's music is their ability to write groundbreaking, complex, heavy tunes whilst at the same time giving their music that great listenability and memorability. The album is also full of classic Iron Maiden themes; sure, some lyrically are a bit cheesy, such as mythical themes in songs like 'Flight Of Icarus' and 'Quest For Fire' but others catch some intersting themes like that of war in 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'The Trooper'. Bruce Dickenson makes all of the lyrics stand out anyway and gives a classic vocal performance throughout the album - he also plays a good hand in the songwriting himself on this album. All in all, 'Piece Of Mind' is another classic installment of the heavy metal juggernaut that is Iron Maiden.<br /><br />Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Flight of Icarus' and 'The Trooper' songs from your PC.<br /><br />Battle commences on the 'Piece Of Mind' album with the opener 'Where Eagles Dare'. This epic starting song, with its WWII Air Combat theme features rallying choruses from Dickenson and plenty of racing, gritty riffs. The instrumental interlude is particularly special, where the sounds of machine guns are incorporated around some great guitar work from Smith and Murray. The slower and more stately 'Revelations', penned by Dickenson himself follows. This 6+ minute song is one of the highlights of the album. The song has plenty of brooding verses contrasted by pounding choruses. Again, the song has another awesome instrumental section; also listen out for some stellar bass work from Steve Harris. Hit single, 'The Flight Of Icarus' is next up. Eventhough I'm not as crazy about this track as a lot of fans are, I still think it's a great song. The chugging guitar riffs from both guitarists really complimenteach other and Dickenson's vocal operatics work really well on this song. The catchy, and for me quite underrated, 'Die With Your Boots On Follows'. The snappy chorus with its emphatic build up really shines through on this great track.<br /><br />Then we come to 'The Trooper'. This is definitely one of Iron Maiden's finest ever songs. From start to finish, all 4+ minutes of this song is full layered guitar onslaught. The racing descending riff is a sound to behold. The song also has a great dramatised verses, where Dickenson's shouts are responded by snapping guitar chords. Oh, and did I forget to say this song is amzingly catchy as well! 'Still Life' follows. Another criminally underrated song. It has a weird, warped voice over opening which runs into an introspective opening verse. The songs stays quiet for a while but you feel the energy building then, you guessed, the song goes into full attack with the 'Nightmares' chorus. An amazing song. Next up is 'Quest For Fire'. A song attacked by some for cheesy lyrics; that aside, it has a great riff to it and a good bass driven chorus. 'Sun And Steel' is similar in that regard. By no means as strong as some of the songs on the album, it is by no means a poor song and is well worth the listen, with it's classic driving riff. Then, we have the epic in 'To Tame A Land' closing the album. This is a great song, with a mysterious opening riff that builds into a downcast but powerful melody. It is epic in the mold of 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' but at the same time, the song shows signs of Iron Maiden's later direction, most notably with the concept album, 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'.<br /><br />'Piece Of Mind' is a powerful work from Iron Maiden. The album has some classic songs and is more importantly, very consistent and no tracks are sub-par or average. For me, this album is every bit the equal to 'Number Of The Beast', it's predecessor. The early-mid 80's saw Iron Maiden rise to become one of the great bands of all time and it's not at all surprising given the classic stuff they did in this period. 'Piece Of Mind' is a must for any Iron Maiden fan and for any heavy metal fan in general.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10ocal operatics work really well on this song. The catchy, and for me quite underrated, 'Die With Your Boots On Follows'. The snappy chorus with its emphatic build up really shines through on this great track.     Then we come to 'The Trooper'.

0316168815|4.0|The book The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold was a great and compelling story that could easy draw a reader, that is mostly, if you are a woman. The book starts when a young woman is raped and stabbed to death by one of her neighbors. She then ascends into heaven and watches over her family and friends also her want-to-be boyfriend. All the way through the book there are many fun and, at come points, hair-pulling moments that make you wonder what is to come. There are a couple main twists to the story (involving some out-of-body experiences) that can draw a reader in but also some graphic sexual tension involving intense situations and themes. Even though, you won't want to set it down. Overall it is creative, imaginative, and a great read for a fiction novel for a girl or woman although, if you are a male, don't stray from this title. It can be very entertaining to any reader with the correct mindset and maturity. If you're not much of a reader or you found the story completely amazing wait for the movie release version that is due in near 2007.
B000669GAI|5.0|Rearviewmirror (2004.), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning from 1991-2003<br /><br />Pearl Jam are one of my all-time favourite bands; full stop. From their immortal debut 'Ten', released in 1991, right up to the present day, the band have produced album after album of great, innovative and sometimes experimental music. The sole surviving grunge band have so far produced seven studio albums and plenty of live releases and not to mention, singles also. Up until 2004 the one thing the band lacked was a 'best of' or 'greatest hits' collection, to help span their career into 2 discs. However, in Novemeber 2004, Epic records (ironically, now and then at the time, Pearl Jam's former label) put out a 2CD greatest hits set called 'Rearviewmirror'. So how does this package shape up to be; is it another dismal 'best of' which doesn't do the band justice, is it one which fails to satisfy fans of the band or is it really a collection that hits the mark?<br /><br />If anyone reading this review has seen any of my other reviews for 'best of' or 'greatest hits' complilations for any bands, you'll see that I never really give any of them 5*s. Most either fall down with a lack of chronology to the tracks or due to a number of inexcusable emissions from the band's catalogue. In the case of 'Rearviewmirror', it's success strength is based around five things. Firstly, both CD's cover songs in chronological order (or just about; the placing of 'Yellow Ledbetter', an early song at the end of disc 2 is the only exception) and secondly, both CD's have the right mix of songs with CD1 dealing with the hard rocking/punkish stuff and CD2 dealing with the slower/more brooding/more ballad styled songs. Thirdly, the 'greatest hits' choice of songs is great for displaying Pearl Jam's catalogue because their singles repetoire is diverse, contains some of their best work and also includes tracks which were 'non album/single only' tracks. Fourthly, the collection is a perfect set of songs to introduce someone to Pearl Jam and get them familiar with their music. Fifth and finally, the collection also appeals to Pearl Jam FANS, even hardcore ones like myself - the collection has remixes of tracks from 'Ten' such as 'Alive' which are refreshing to hear and has the non-album singles such as 'I got ID' which may just help to complete your collection. All in all, it is a conclusive collection whose weaknesses (and these are small ones) are just that there is a slight lack of some later material such as from 'Binaural' and 'Riot Act'. The second minor weakness is, due to the fact it's a greatest hits work, great non single release songs such as 'Grievance' are missed off. That said, let's see a break down of the tracks:<br /><br />Songs from TEN (1991): Once, Alive, Even Flow, Jeremy, Black<br />This album, for me and many others, was Pearl Jam's finest hour. The five tracks on here are great choices and are fantastic tunes. The remixes of 'Once' and 'Alive' are especially interesting to listen to.<br /><br />VS (1993.): Go, Animal, Dissident, Rearviewmirror, Daughter, Elderly Woman...<br />Pearl Jam's second album was a massive commercial success, like it's predecessor and the 6 songs from this album are a great reflection of this and are great choices. The only song I personally miss here is 'Indifference' which is one of my favourite PJ songs...ah, well beggars can't be choosers!<br /><br />VITALOGY (1994.): Spin The Black Circle, Not For You, Corduroy, Immortality, Betterman, Nothingman<br />Vitalogy was another massive success for Pearl Jam; although for me, the records overly difficult and sometimes barmy nature is what makes it the band's weakest album (others may disagree). That aside the 6 song choice cut from the album is a damn fine one. Songs like 'Corduroy' and 'Not For You' are awesome and 'Immortality' is a classic, brooding ballad.<br /><br />NO CODE (1996.): Hail Hail, Who You Are, Off He Goes<br />No Code marked the beginning of the band'smove from the mainstream and into a more underground status. This is reflected by the album only having 3 hits featuring here. That said they're all damn good songs. The punk rocking 'Hail, Hail' cannons out of the speakers and 'Off He Goes' is very heartfelt and powerful. The only fan choice omissions from my perspective would be 'Perfect Tense' and 'LUKIN!!!'<br /><br />YIELD (1998.): Do The Evolution, Given To Fly, Wishlist<br />Pearl Jam's rocking fifth album again did not sell as well as the earlier work but still, dare i say, 'yielded' a fair share of singles. The three listed tracks reflect the album very well.<br /><br />BINAURAL (2000.): Light Years, Nothing As It Seems<br />Pearl Jam hit the millenium and returned with one of their finest efforts. Sadly, though this work is a little under-represented on the complilation. It would be great to have seen 'Grievance' and 'Of The Girl' featured on here but they weren't hits.<br /><br />RIOT ACT (2002.): Save You, I Am Mine<br />Pearl Jam's most recent studio effort is represented by two great hit songs in the punkish 'Save You' and the introspective 'I Am Mine'. 'All Of None' or 'You Are' are my personal choices which would have been nice to be seen.<br /><br />NON ALBUM SONGS: State Of Love And Trust, I Got ID, Breath, Last Kiss, Man Of The Hour, Yellow Ledbetter<br />Here we go!! This were the collection was great for me as I didn't have some of these songs and it helped complete my collection. That said, these songs are great hit singles, especially 'Yellow Ledbetter' and the charity fundraising 'Last Kiss'.<br /><br />Overall, aside from a few very minor niggles, this 'greatest hits' complilation does Pearl Jam real justice. PJ are one of the all time great bands and this compliation covers all angles of their music. This double CD is great for anyone wanting to get into Pearl Jam's music but it is also a useful buy for fans of the band as it has some remixes and non-album tracks. Definitely worth the investment!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10is is reflected by the album only having 3 hits featuring here. That said they're all damn good songs.

0385513755|3.0|This is an \\"okay\\" read. Plot moves along quickly. The writing style and approach to \\"mysteries\\" seemed a little formulaic.  I also didn't like the mixing of fact and fiction. So many false and half-truth statements made by characters who were \\"experts\\" in their fields, but presented as accepted \\"facts\\" annoyed me. Illustrations in this edition were a nice touch---helpful in bringing the book to life. I would not recommend this book to an avid reader. It is too much like so many other mysteries. But it would be a good read for someone new to the genre.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|When Sex & the City first began airing, I wasn't able to watch every single episode, since it was on HBO and played kind of late. Recently, I have been watching the re-runs on the WB and I just got hooked. I received this DVD collection as a gift and I became an S&C junkie! The collection is wonderful with it's beautiful case, bonus dvd's, extras on mostly all discs, commentary, it's great organization strategy, etc. This show may not be a reality show, but there are definitely areas where one can relate. I love how it doesn't focus on negative drama like other shows do. There are no murders to be solved, mysterious neighbors to figure out; it's a light-hearted show that doesn't get you down.  <br />I just can't say enough about this show, except that as I was watching the last couple of episodes, I noticed my eyes were filling with tears. As I wiped my eyes, I knew the end of the series was here. It's a bitter sweet ending... you've followed the lives of these women and know the conclusions of their journey, yet you know there will be no 'seventh season' dvd to begin playing. <br />This show is awesome and you must own your own collection!
B00005A46T|1.0|This band is way too big and way too s**tty.  Fine, we'll forget the masks and janitor suites for a second.  They still suck.  The guys can't even solo and they use typical nu metal downtuned guitars.  BO-RING. <br /> <br />But my biggest gripe comes with Blaspherereion \\"Apocalyptic\\".  He's giving this album 4 stars but gives \\"Master Of Puppets\\" by Metallica 3, citing it as overrated and overhyped and that there are thousands of albums out there that make it look piss-poor?  I don't think so.  He also uses their sell-out state as fuel to make the album look bad.  Everyone knows that any early Metallica album DOMINATES or \\"pwns\\" as the mallcore kids say, any S**tnot album, even the best one.  He also gives Cannibal Corpse more stars.  I'm not gonna argue who is better in this cae, but I think Metallica at least deserves as many stars as Cannibal Corpse.  I mean, at least James could sound emotional and driven without stooping to the level of gutteral roars. <br /> <br />Anyway, the album sucks, Blaspherereion \\"Apocalyptic\\" needs to take his thumb out of his a** because it's affecting his thinking and S**tnot needs to be callen for what they are: mallcore, and as we all know, mallcore does not deserve very much praise at all.
B000001F3C|4.0|Review no. 153. Originally released in early 1983, as 'War' was U2's third album and the one that more or less made them a household name. I remember the day this lp came out and the 'impact' it apparently had on some people. I think I may even still have my cassette copy of this relic. Impressive cuts like the boot-stomping \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", the extremely well-written \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"40\\" deals with Ireland's political issues. The only tune here I never cared for was \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\". Maybe it's just that I've heard one too many cover bands play it. A must-have for any and all true U2 fans and followers alike. Recommended.
B000301YY8|2.0|The production is lush.  Mr. Blunt has that kind of raspy tenor that sounds sincere and inoffensive at the same time.  It's elevator music, the kind of music some people put on to chill.  Kem, Norah Jones and a long list of others make this kind of candy.  It sells because it fills a need.  But is stuff like this memorable or profound?  No.  Look at the lyrics of this CD.  It reads like bad high school poetry.  Are the melodies particularly interesting?  It's the kind of stuff someone with very modest musical talent can thump away on a piano or guitar.<br /><br />Why the hype for this CD?  I have no idea.  It's a pleasant enough listen and is well produced.  It's decent enough music to smooch to.  I can point to tens of CDs made this year that are of this ilk that haven't been selling nearly as well.  Someone has to be anointed by the press, and this is James Blunt's turn.  Lucky guy.  He's won the lottery with rather ordinary music.
B000002UY5|4.0|Review number 80. In my humble opinion, one of the most under rated CD releases of the early '90's. Simply great alternative rock & roll to sit back and fully experience with all the senses intact. Too bad about vocalist Shannon Hoone's passing. I felt that Blind Melon probably would've lasted another two, maybe three albums. Most memorable cuts are \\"Soak The Sun\\", the well written \\"Tone Of Home\\", \\"No Rain\\" (aka The Bumble Bee Song), \\"Sleepyhouse\\" and \\"Seed To A Tree\\". In ways, Blind Melon was mellow but at the SAME time full-throttled power rock. Need more bands like that. Recommended.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Ennio Morricone is a legend.  He's been writing film scores for more than four decades -- he's invented at least a couple genres within the field; he's written several classics; in the past year alone, he's written something like a half-dozen film scores, at least one of which, Fateless, is great, and at least two of the others are very, very good.  He also has more \\"best of\\" and \\"essential\\" collections out than some composers have scores!  And if you'd asked me before I picked up this CD whether we needed yet another one, my answer would have been no, No, Emphatically NO! <br /> <br />Sometimes it's nice to be wrong.  This is a brilliant CD.  Most of the usual suspects are here, but they've been arranged and reorchestrated for the includion of the cello such that they all sound fresh.  The playing is warm and vibrant throughout, and the recording is fine.  The music is dramatic, humorous and exciting by turns, and is arranged into a series of suites such that as a whole it almost plays more like a cello concerto than a film music collection.  I've been known to find some Morricone collections more than a bit tedious; not so this one -- there's not a dull moment here.  Since I bought this CD over a year ago, it has become one of my most frequently played selections -- and it seems to appeal to everyone.  My 14-year-old sister described it as \\"intense\\"; my mother loves it; my dancer friends enjoy moving to it; I have yet to come across a single person who hasn't liked this CD.  For me the highlight of this CD is, of course, \\"Ecstasy of Gold\\" but, as I mentioned, that doesn't necessarily mean much considering how much I love the whole thing. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  Highly recommended for any collection.
0156027321|1.0|As a number of other reviews have stated, I must concur this is one extremely boring and pointless book. If I hadn't been suffering from insomnia, I would never have continued reading it, but it did help me fall quickly asleep. Full of simple declarative sentences which for the most part are devoid of adjectives, adverbs, metaphors, similes.   <br /> <br />This overhyped book lacks merit.
0316172324|2.0|When I first saw this book on the shelf, it caught my attention.  Blink!...  So I check it out, \\"thinking, without thinking.\\"  Making split second decisions with great results, etc...  I look at the back, and I see this guy with a big poofy head of hair and a lame suit, that has wrote a book about making great decisions in a split second.  My first thought, and I should have listened to it was... DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, waste of time.  But, I the thought, ah, what the hek, it can't be that bad, and I may find something useful in it.  Anyway, I'm about half-way through the book and today, as I was exercising on a lifestride and reading through his generalization based theories, without any supporting evidence, I seriously contemplated throwing the book down on the ground and letting my sweat saturate it and let it rot, but, I remembered something, someone told me once, you have to take the good with the bad, and seemings how I'm half way through, I might as well finish, and take it as a learning experience.  One thing I have learned from this is, yes, I was a sucker, yes they are born everyday, and yes, anyone can write a freakin book and people will buy it.  I can't believe this piece of garbage was published.  And by the way...  This is my first on-line review, that I have ever written, about a book, a movie, or anything.  The fact that I am posting here is a testament to how much this book pissed me off with it's ignorance. This may sound somewhat harsh, but it really annoys me when I spend good money on something and it turns out to be trash - as I'm sure most folks feel the same.      I seriously contemplated writing another book, just to contradict his empty theories and make him look like an idiot, but I'm sure after you read this, that will not be necessary for anyone with half a brain cell.  I guess in the end though, he made some bucks off it, so he probably could care less.    GOOD LUCK!    PS.. I just read over more reviews of this book, to see what other folks thought (main reason I came here) and Gil Rosenburg's review was one I wish I read prior to reading this book.  If you want to read a good book, look elsewhere.  I just finished The Rule of Four and it was very good - albeit a different genre.
0451529065|5.0|This book can be a bit dry at times, but the insights Darwin had are absolutely amazing. Overall a good read. I'm confused why amazon paired this work up with the communist manifesto. I understand that Marx and Engels were fans of Darwin's work and inspired by it, but I feel it gives Origin a negative connontation. Maybe they could pair it up with per se, a science book.
B000001ELP|1.0|........ about how mad I was after I first heard this record. That was definately my \\"say it ain't so, Gene!\\" moment. The first Renaissance- (or was it Baroque? ...Middle Ages??) inspired notes are played on a flute! Immediately your jaw drops and you check to see that the label on the CD says the same thing as the CD cover. You check to see that this is a Kiss album and your worst fears are confirmed ......... it IS!!  This is concept rock gone horribly wrong. This is like when an otherwise cool guy asks a girl out on a date to a Bon Jovi concert,  and instead at the last minute diverts the car for a behind-the scenes tour of the local library just out of weird inspiration, and only he knows why. The \\"concept\\" supposedly has something to do with a boy rising to the occasion to go on a King Arthur-like quest to find...... what??  Who knows?? At the end of the CD you still don't know and don't care. There is one really good song on here, actually -- \\"The Oath\\". It makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The rest makes you want to go out and do what Ace Frehely actually did after they recorded it -- find a good solid wall to throw it against and let her fly. If you like Kiss out of their element,  just pretend like you never saw this one and pick up Dynasty instead.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I'll go for a simple and brief review. This is a powerful film that captures the pain in human existence so well. It is about so much more than sexual orientation. Brokeback Mountain is a modern tradgedy that connects with an experience of life of which everyone has gotten a taste. Gay, Straight, Bisexual...all people have known varying degrees of the pain borne by Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. See this movie and allow yourself to experience its pain...you'll feel more alive for it.
B000088E6D|5.0|<br />Wow.  This is the perfect way to resurrect the older standards and mix them with more recent pop hits. Take a young microphone-friendly Canadian crooner that sounds like a jazzy cross between Mel Torme and Harry Connick, Jr., and it's Anka's away!!  Generally, if it's singable, radio-popular material that's got legs, Buble knows how to deliver it. Take \\"Fever\\" for instance --Ms. Lee would no doubt approve of the way Mr. Buble sets up each climactic line for the big-band back- up to spike, a la Harry James. Each song has a personality of its own, and in one case even the personality himself shows up (Barry Gibb rising out of the mist enveloping \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\").  \\"Moondance\\" is another standout and makes you want to pull your tie off and grab that special someone to go out and hit the floor with. \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" picks up the tempo and does not seem the slightest bit out of place thanks to the cohesive arranging. There is just enough spice to balance the sublime, and just enough city slickness to go with the jungle salsa. This one's a great first at-bat for this promising young artist.
B00003CX9E|3.0|I've seen five star reviews and I've seen one star reviews, but I don't think most people are looking at this objectively.  Personally, I appreciated, but didn't really enjoy this film. <br /> <br />FOR TODAYS MOVIEGOERS this is a slow movie, give it a chance.  The only way \\"today's moviegoers\\" will enjoy this movie is if they get into the story of Kane.  It is a good story and an interesting film.  There are even moments of light humor.  However, if you need action and don't care to think much, this isn't your movie. <br /> <br />FOR THE FILM CRITIC this movie is revolutionary.  There are a number of firsts in this movie, and without them, \\"today's moviegoers\\" would be lost.  For example, this movie was one of the first to use deep focus, allowing us to focus on both the foreground and background, adding subtle, yet expertly done images.  This allows the active viewer to foreshadow the events.  The deep focus, in addition to this being one of the first movies to show ceilings, allows Orwell to play with perception, creating scenes that are exciting even today.  Use of shodows and mirrors also adds to the illusions of Orwell.  Overall, this movie changed the course of all that followed, and that's why it is AFI's greatest movie of all time.
B000002KE2|5.0|I think Black Sabbath turned a corner with this one. It's a more confident, experimental product than all that came before. \\"Supernaut\\" is probably their best rocking song ever, has a truly distinctive Iommi riff, and just takes you to the moon.  \\"Laguna Sunrise\\" is a great acoustic guitar- and -strings mini masterpiece.  \\"Changes\\" is the only song I didn't like despite its being a classic and the song that Ozzy later dueted with his daughter on. I think the reason I didn't like it is because it is almost like an adolescent coming of age song -- you half expect Sandra Dee or Annette Funicello to come up behind him and lay a comforting hand on his shoulder,  and then they go off to go surfing or something. \\"FX\\" is probably an intentional joke, just Tony playing at the effects board when no one was looking. All the rest of the CD rocks and one listen will not be enough the first time you play it.
B00005JMXX|5.0|In the day after tommorow global warming causes a new ice age, there's tornadoes in LA and tidal waves on the east coast and the northern hemisphere starts to freeze. Overall the movie sounds and looks....Well... Spectacular.    <br /> <br />The day after tommorow is a great addition to anyone's movie collection.
B00000612P|5.0|Don't be swayed by your preconceived notions of who you think Rod Stewart is. Though Stewart nowadays is primarily known for dating supermodels and recording bland pop albums such as his endless series of American Songbook releases, in 1971 it was a very different story. Rod Stewart was one of the greatest rock and roll singers in the world. After a stint with the Jeff Beck Group in the late '60s, Stewart took over as lead singer of the Small Faces along with his pal Ron Wood on guitar. The group became the Faces, one of the great rock bands of the early '70s. Around the same time, Stewart started recording his own solo albums all of which were quite well received. They all basically follow the same formula. A mix of rockers and ballads based mostly around acoustic guitars with sparse electric guitars. The material being a mix of excellent originals written by Stewart and Wood and well-chosen, well-performed covers. They incorporated soul, rock, folk, blues and country into a truly unique blend that Stewart was completely in command of.     Every Picture Tells A Story was Rod Stewart's third solo release and arguably his best. He truly hit his stride as a singer and songwriter with this album. From the opening track, the title song, the album establishes a standard of quality and doesn't deviate from it throughout all of its eight songs. Everyone knows  the album's biggest hit, the classic Maggie May, but every song here is excellent. The cover of That's All Right (famously performed by Elvis Presley) which evolves into Amazing Grace, Bob Dylan's Tomorrow Is A Long Time, Mandolin Wind, and Tim Hardin's Reason To Believe are all classic.     This is an excellent album that anyone who loves rock and roll should own. Forget about what Rod Stewart is today, in the early '70s Stewart was a unique talent who produced some truly great material, both as a solo artist and with the Faces. Stewart's early solo albums are all worth hearing. The first four - The Rod Stewart Album (1969), Gasoline Alley (1970), Every Picture Tells A Story (1971) and Never A Dull Moment (1972) - being the best. For more great music from this era I would recommend the Faces box set, Five Guys Walk Into A Bar. You will not be disappointed.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is one of those random movies that you heard about from friends and reluctantly decide to give it a try.  The blend of animated effects, music, and fighting is what made the movie so enjoyable.  The music is just amazing with the drums, violins, and classical instruments.  What's hilarious in the movie is how the characters start to dance to a musical piece that is playing in the background.  I will admit the movie is a bit gory for the skittish, but it is mostly cheesy violence.  The movie is a work of Art and describing everything that defines its success is hard so rent it if you're still in doubt!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Kate Beckensale plays Selene here, a vampire Death Dealer with an attitude the size of her body count.  She's a vampire assasin who's waging war with the Lycan (Werewolf) underworld.  Theres one problem.  The Werewolves are searching for a man who may hold the key to both the vampire and Lycan societies...a key that could end their war forever.  So what do the vampires do...they need Selene to KILL him...but she can't, because she loves him.  It's a new  spin on Romeo and Juliet or Westside Story or whatever you want to say but it works no matter how you look at it, it works and you know why?  Because Len Wiseman knows how to make a great movie...the sets the shots the colors are just dark and ominous and A-freaking-mazing!!!  Kate Beckinsale is, I swear, the queen of goth.  Between the Underworld films and Van Helsing she's had her share of monster slaying.  All I have to say is she's great at it, and heck, she looks hit doing it.  Anyways, the film has a great flow, not a total action packed picture but it carries your interest and the whole air of the film is just stunning and dark and worth the time to take the ride so take it...
B00005JOFO|4.0|This movie is haunting and stays with you because of the sheer waste of it all when you follow your head instead of your heart. <br />Ennis is a closed up person Jack is fun and outgoing.They take a job together herding sheep and before the summer is over they fall in love.Jack wants them to have a life together, Ennis doesn't because then he would have to admit that he is head over heels in love with another man and is scare that this relationship will be the death of them if anyone found out.So every year they steal a few days here and there at Brokeback mountain.So Ennis's fears cheats them out of a life together and after 20 years all he has to show for it is a shirt,a postcard, and alot of bittersweet memories of \\"what if\\". This to me is not groundbreaking.If you want to see grounbreaking try the movie MAURICE which was made in 1987 and is set in pre-war world I in England.Maurice is coming to terms with his sexual preference and the feelings he has for his best friend  in a place were if you are caught it was punishable with imprisoment.He then meets Alec Scudder,a servant in his friends household and they start a relationship.They meet one last time because Alec is leaving the country for a better job position.Maurice asks him to stay that finding each other was a one in a thousand shot,that they should go away together.Alec's response was \\"Are you daft,it would never work Maurice,it would be the ruin of both of us.Well guess what, Alec does miss his ship and they meet at the boathouse before they go away together.That to me is groundbreaking!  <br />Yes, the Brokeback mountain is set in cowboy country in 1963. But people ,it is 1963,not the middle ages. There will always be someone who hates you or doesn't want  anything to do with you because of the color of your skin,religion,social status,or sexual preference. If you let your fears stop you from living life in a way that makes you happy you are fool and deserve whatever you get.What irritates me about Ennis was that he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.A \\"straight \\" life with a wife and children and  Jack on the side whenever he could spare the time. He learned too late that !!IT\\"S NOT THE QUANTITY OF TIME BUT THE QUALITY OF TIME THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING!! <br />Don't get me wrong it is a beatiful movie with beatiful scenery and wonderful acting from the entire cast .I did give it 4 out of 5 starts.But to me it would of been groundbraking if Ennis had given their relationship a real chance.The truth of it was Jack was a risktaker and took chances and Ennis never did and never wanted to.To me this wan't about being gay in 1963 but about a person inability to accept himself and go after what he wanted in life because of what other people might say or do.
B00008BRB5|5.0|What was it that movie commercials used to say? If you only buy one Police album, make it Synchronicity. Trite, but it applies. Synchronicity is an impressive final effort from one of the greatest rock bands of all time. It pays homage to Jung's interconnecting theory by incorporating into every song unknown or unspoken forces which affect peoples' lives. The album isn't quite as musically experimental as some of their earlier work, and it is somewhat less exciting for it. However, the brilliance of the writing and instrumentation, not to mention the complex themes explored here, make this the most impressive of all the albums. And if you'll permit me to act the young fogy here, it's nice to consider a time when a band existed that used dense psychology as subject matter instead of a girl usually named Mandy.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, there is a severe first half/second half disparity. The first half is uneven--it starts with the quite impressive Synchronicity I, which introduces the subject matter of the album. While none of the first half is terrible (although Mother is certainly not for everyone), there aren't any songs that truly sparkle. Walking in your Footsteps is a gentle meditation on evolution, O My God is an earnest spiritual inquiry, much like some of Sting's later solo songs. Miss Gradenko examines a totalitarian society and the death it brings, metaphorically, of course.<br /><br />Things change in a big way, though, starting with Synchronicity II. This song admonishes the 9-to-5 workers who go about their lives without thinking about why things are the way they are, and is pursued by the Loch Ness Monster. It might sound silly, but it is very much an ironic song. Every Breath You Take is The Police's biggest song, and if you've listened to a radio in the last 25 years, you've heard it. Some Police fans might chafe at the attention that this song got, compared to other equally worthy songs, but it's not every band that creates music that everyone knows 25 years later. King of Pain is one of my favorites, which has a sort of iceberg-style format where we are supposed to infer what the speaker has suffered to make him the \\"King of Pain\\", in his words. The disconnect between the sorrowful lyrics and upbeat rock musical arrangement are worth noting, but this song has the spark that few songs have, and it must be heard to be believed. When first hearing Wrapped Around Your Finger, you'll notice the carnival-sounding melody. It's no coincidence. The oppressive relationship between the speaker and his controlling girlfriend gets turned around by the end in a song which looks at interpersonal relationships as though they were a game. Tea in the Sahara is the most hauntingly beautiful song of the album, with a very sparse arrangement which creates the impression of a massive, empty desert, and the lyrics talk about disappointment when a prince misses an annual tea appointment in the Sahara. Murder by Numbers, the final track, is a little too didactic in my opinion, but still a good jazz riff with a political conscience.<br /><br />Overall, it's an exceptional album with a few pure gems and is probably their most consistent offering, in spite of a few merely above-average tracks. Highly recommended.c that everyone knows 25 years later.

B000B8QG22|5.0|Good Morning Vietnam is one of Robin Williams' earliest forays into drama. While The World According to Garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama, Good Morning maintains a much better balance. The first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in Saigon.<br /><br />Mitch Markowitz's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other.<br /><br />Director Barry Levinson successfully harnessed the comedian's wild, manic energy in this movie. Of course, the Williams' radio monologues (famously adlibbed by the comedian) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour (\\"What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts? Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.\\"). Williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in. His best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision (Peter Weir, Terry Gilliam and Gus Van Sant) and this one is no different.<br /><br />Even though Good Morning is essentially a vehicle for Williams, Levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors, like Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh.<br /><br />Along with Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth, Good Morning Vietnam gives a human dimension to the Vietnamese people. Unlike many other Vietnam War movies of the `80s, the Vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities.<br /><br />This incarnation is an improvement over the previous DVD. There is a six part \\"Production Diary\\" that runs 34 minutes. This is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed. He sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on (and the film's title). Director Barry Levinson talks about Robin Williams' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script. One part also focuses on the film's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n' roll music and the role it played in the movie. Another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in Thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there. Add to that the extremely hot weather which, incidentally, gave the film a certain amount of authenticity. There are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly, only cast members Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl are back with Williams no where to be found.<br /><br />\\"Raw Monologues\\" features 13 minutes of footage from Williams' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes. There is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form, watching how Williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations.<br /><br />Finally, there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers.st how much of it is based on the real Adrian Cronauer who is interviewed.

0316168815|3.0|Let me just start out by saying that The Lovely Bones is the first book in years that has actually made me cry.  It takes a well-executed book to make me cry, and The Lovely Bones is a well-written, well-executed book.  However, that doesn't mean that the book is perfect.  The first 200 pages of the book are simply amazing.  Some of the most powerful literature I have ever read.  Sebold creates characters that you grow to love so much, that it just kills you inside when bad things happen to them.<br /><br />However, once the book starts to reach its climax, I found it much harder to follow.  It's tough to talk about without giving anything away, so I won't say anything other than the fact that I didn't understand how or why Susie did what she did.  Normally, I don't let a finish that fizzles ruin a book, and I wouldn't say that the ending ruined The Lovely Bones, but it did take a beautiful, powerful, emotional book and turn it into a cliched, unnecessarily happy ending.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Sahara is, in essence, the same movie that we see bearing half a dozen titles every summer. It's not thought provoking, scary, or romantic. But it does have action, and it's mildly funny. Steve Zhan is a hillarious guy, he ought to get bigger parts. But anyway, it's fun to watch, and not boring by any stretch. It reminded me of Indiana Jones without the intrigueing storyline.

B00000I14Z|5.0|i always knew that Mingus was great...but it was not something that i could attest to through personal experience. i had seen the light that was Coltrane, Davis, Sun Ra, Dolphy...but Mingus' masterpieces somehow eluded me. probably due to the fact that i just simply did not take the time to check them out. well, i picked up Mingus Ah Um (finally)...and it all rang true. not only was this man an excellent bass player, but a true genius in composing. his music shines bright with a broad range of feeling and emotion. the righteous anger is present within the notes...anger that boiled hot over the shakey political/cultural climate of the times. but the music's fire  is stoked by coals of passion and sincerity, jazz morphs into the blues and swings into melodies so alive and free that they can't be denied in their originality and greatness. i've been listening to this album only about 10 times and i'm still finding new things revealed to me with each spin. Mingus' vision grows deeper and more profound each time around. and there's so much more to explore and discover.
B00000272N|5.0|As Alice in Chains albums go (not counting Sap because it was just an ep) this is the most straight forward of the four. It opens fast and hard and stays heavy for the majority of the album. For the band this was their comming out album. They stayed pretty true to the rock and grunge style and didn't venture to far away from it with this album. The one problem is there's just not enough to hold attention come the second half. They continue to play the same straight forward rock and it sounds too similar come later. But I'll break the album down to give more insight. <br /> <br />\\"We Die Young\\" begins the album with a heavy rift from Jerry and crunching vocals from Layne. The song, like most of the album, is pretty straight forward. There are no time changes, no speed changes, and no crazy vocal/guitar distortion. The one thing, though, is that the song ends just as fast as it started, and at only 2:32 is the shortest on the album. This is not to say it's a bad song. With good vocals and good instrumentation this songed is one of the better on the album. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Man in the Box\\" is the one song alot of people know. A popular radio tune this is easily one of the best songs on the album. Begginning with Jerry and Mike's solid slow paced thump rift and Layne's moan to accompany it the song is the first to really show the talent this band has. Enter the chorus where you will get some of the best vocals on the album with Jery backing up just enough to cause the effect. Then after another verse and chorus you get to Jerry's solo. Probably my favorite on the album the mid-tempo solo closes and brings back the exceptional vocals of Layne, and with a final \\"Now you've sown them shut!\\" the song reverts back into the moan and ends. As I said easily one of the best on the album. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sea of Sorrow\\" is another good song to keep the album going strong. The song opens calmly enough with the guitar and soon enough gives way to the depressed vocals. The song then switches to a quicker, if just a little bit, tempo. The vocals stay pretty much the same until the pre-chorus in which Layne releases his yell again with Jerry harmonizing. The chorus then follows with the two harmonizing. The lyrics aren't the greatest on the album, and Layne's moan of \\"In a sea of sorrow.......\\" is just a little to cliche for me. The solo is a good one, nothing special, but it gets the job done. Overall this is a good song that keeps the album going and its the also the first to experiment with speed. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Bleed the Freak\\", to me, is this albums masterpiece. The song opens with the haunting guitar Jerry would be known for and has Layne with his moaning \\"My cup runneth over\\" starts what I believe to be the best lyics in the album. The song then picks up with Layne and Jerry harmonizing to \\"Name your god and bleed the freak\\". The first verse opens up to more of Layne's painful-sounding vocals. After another verse and chorus, the song goes into a solo which to me doesn't really fit the song, but it still is good. Then comes the part the bought the song for me. With a sudden \\"Ahhhhhhhh\\" from layne the song opens into Layne background talking where he pleads at the end \\"bleed for me\\". The songs jumps right back into the chorus where the vocals come in stronger than the first time around. This song to me is the most mature sounding song on the album and sounds as if it could be put on \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Tripod\\" instead. My favorite on the album. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Can't Remember\\" is to me where the album starts to slow down. The song does have a nice guitar part to it, but it sounds alot like \\"Man in the Box\\". Layne's vocals also aren't anything special. He moans through the verses up until his prolonged \\"I can't remember\\". The solos in it by Jerry is also nothing special. A slower solo for a slower song it does what it needs to do. The song goes through a little more instrumentation until it ends ubruptly with \\"I'mAlive!\\" It's a song that really won't stick with you for long but nonetheless it's worth a listen.  <br />7/10 <br /> <br />\\"Love, Hate, Love\\" continues where \\"I Can't Remember\\" left off. Another slower song with the Indian-esque guitar grunge had come to know and love. Layne's low pitched vocals open up soon enough for a higher yell and drop off of \\"Innocence creates my hell\\". The second verse is the same as the first and when Layne starts the yell again it sounds the same as before. The one high part that saved the songs was the good instrumental after the second chorus. With a good solo the song climaxes with Layne's signature \\"Yeah\\" and a nice \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" to really push this song to something that you could listen to and not be bored with. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />\\"It Ain't Like That\\" is one of my least favorites on the album. The song just isn't inspired in my opinion and is just to generic sounding for me. The chorus has Layne using his yell for the higher notes, but it doesn't fit the style of the song, and by the time the verse enters again you hear the boring guitar part again. Jerry's solo in here isn't a bad one, but unfortunately it sounds alot like all the others. He does use more of the \\"wah\\" pedal effect in it, but it's just not inspired. It's Alice in Chains, though, and every song is worth at least a few listens. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sunshine\\" picks the album back up again and how apropriate Layne starts with a nice \\"One more time\\". The verse isn't exactly too crazy. It is pretty generic Alice in Chains if you ask me, but where this song really shines is in the chorus. A quick speed change opens to Layne's punishing vocals. The short chorus comes to an end back into the verse. When you the second chorsu ends the song slows abruptly and you are treated to a nice harmonzing part with Jerry backing up Layne ever so slightly, but once again enough to cause effect. After the solo, which is another good one by Jerry, Layne goes into a melodical\\"Memories, set me free\\" and then topping it off with a strong \\"I dont care no more\\" The song reverts back into the old verse and then goes back to Jerry and Layne harmonizing again. The song brings back interest into the album and this is another one of the greats. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Put You Down\\" speeds the album back with a very nice guitar rift by Jerry. The verse starts as a normal AiC verse, but the second half has Layne raising the pitch and leading into the chorus in which Layne nicely sings along with the guitar. After the second chours the song stops except for Mikes bass line and Sean's Ride cymbal. In comes Layne with a nice \\"Put you down, down, down, gon put you down\\". The problem I have with this song is it's ending. It just doesn't feel right. The first time I wasn't sure if it was really over. All and all it's a song that keeps the album from stopping and continues to the rock theme. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Confusion\\" once again slows down the album. The song's main problem is that the verses just seem to drag on. Layne does justice, though, with his prolonging of words into moans. The chorus is average with really nothing sticking out. The solo is also just average. There's really not much else to say about this song. It isn't one of the best, but isn't the worst on the album. Still it's good enough for listens. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Know Somethin (Bout You)\\" at first scared me. I didnt know if my cd was like screwed up or if this was really Alice in Chains. With opening guitar that could be found at a disco, i didn't know what to think. But after a listen the song grew on me. The thumping bass in the beginning really some of Mike's best on the cd. When the vocals enter Layne starts with high vocals usually found in the choruses. It is a welcome change. Layne really uses his abilities to the fullest here. The vocals are only bested by the like of \\"Man in the Box\\". The chrous has nice background vocals by Jerry. The song also lets in somecrazy \\"Dirt\\"-esque guitar effects along with the solo. This song really showed that Alice in Chains could do something different and make it work. Another great on the album. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Real Thing\\" is the closer and it doesn't dissapoint. The guitar's off-beat tempo make it a very good part. Layne's vocals don't hinder this song either. With a fairly mellow verse it opens into the chorus with a strong \\"Don't concern yourselves and just gimme another blast\\". The song reverts back into the verse chorus format untill we reach Layne's chant of \\"Goin' down the steps on a white line\\" which really keeps the songs going without slowing down. The song ends nicely with everything cutting out except for Jerry's guitar and then comes to a complete end with Layne's final line of the album. Overall a very good closer to an very good album. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />Overall this album is a very good one. For new Alice in Chains fans this is the place to start. It doesn't throw too many curve balls at you and stays pretty true to that generation's rock. However this sacrifices all the great AiC effects and changes that came with \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Tripod\\". And often times, the songs will sound too generic causing a skip or two to find something that can hold your attention. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Not their greatest work, but it's most certaintly worth a pick up.
6301174240|5.0|I was brought up on this movie. I'm now in my late 20's and I still enjoy it. My children have watched this movie so much that the vhs is going bad.  I want this movie on DVD. I look online every so often to see if has been put on DVD. It's a must get movie and you must get it on DVD.
B000028U0Y|5.0|You pick up a country album and expect it to rock? First of all, Johnny Cash entertained for the prisoners he was not a prisoner. You heap praise on washed up, has been barely on the radar screen bands like Motley Crue and Warrant but disrespect rock pioneers like the Beatles (yes, I read your other reviews). You definitely have to get out of the house more often, there is more to music than your little world.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As a qualifier, I am an avid musical theatre fan and classically trained singer. Back in the 80s, I couldn't be bothered with seeing Phantom, partly because I was too busy going to show after show of Les Miserables, but mostly because I couldn't picture Michael Crawford as anything other than Cornelius, the wussy shop boy in Hello Dolly.  His voice is nicely trained but his upper register is just simply annoying. I'm sorry to all his fans, but in my musical mind tenor does not equal dark and mysterious and emotionally tortured.   The anger expressed by phans over casting the originals is just silly!  Who wants to watch a 61-year old lusting after an older teenager?  That is not entertainment, that is just gross...anyway, after relentless hounding by my niece, I broke down and took her to NYC to see it.  It was wonderfully entertaining and I was glad to have gone.  <br />     Ranting over, on with the good stuff.  The movie is an absolutely over-the-top, spectacle in everything (AS IT SHOULD BE, FOLKS!) We're dealing with 19th century, gothic romance and a musical score that is closer to opera than not. <br />Honestly, what else could you expect?   <br />     The visual aspects of the movie are rich and sensual and draw the viewer into 19th century Paris.  From the opening crack of the auction gavel to the end scenes of phantom disappearing into the emptiness of his life, I found myself ignoring the actors to \\"let the spectacle astound\\" me. <br />     The performances were very good with moments of brilliance for some.  I'll save the best for last, so... <br />MIRANDA RICHARDSON-MADAME GIRY-wonderfully mysterious, has great empathy for phantom, yet realizes he must be stopped. Any cast is improved by her presence. <br />CIARAN HINDS/SIMON CALLOW-MONSIEURS ANDRE/FIRMIN-light comic relief from two veteran actors with good voices. <br />MINNIE DRIVER-LA CARLOTTA-completely campy and completely hilarious.  Eventhough Driver is a trained singer, her singing parts hadto be dubbed by a true operatic soprano.  The closing credits song is nicely sung by Driver, though.  SIDENOTE: I have read some reviews that criticized the dubbed voice of the soprano as overblown and baudy-umm, hello?  Carlotta is SUPPOSED to be past her prime and painful to hear-enough already! <br /> <br />Now for the big three: <br /> <br />PATRICK WILSON-RAOUL-Let's face it, the part itself is not exactly meaty but rather insipid.  Wilson handles it competently and even ups the hero factor.  An accomplished Broadway actor, he has a wonderful lyrical tenor voice, but it does get drowned out at times by the dynamic swells in the orchestrations, a mixing problem, not his.  That hair was awful, though! <br /> <br />EMMY ROSSUM-CHRISTINE-In a word, angelic.  Again, the critics drive me insane with reviews stating her young voice was not polished enough.  DUH!!!  She was 17.  The storyline clearly implies that Christine is very good, but to excel she needs to return to her teacher.  Rossum's upper register did sound a bit pinched in a couple of spots, but the quality in general was pure and open especially during the boat ride to phantom's lair as she is essentially vocalizing on an open \\"ah\\" that ends on E above High C-yikes!   <br />    Her acting performance was average-it would have been better to see a little more confliction/emotional stress in her facial expressions.  The graveyard number was beautiful and poignant-lovely.  However, the instant costume change from white dressing gown to black irked me. <br />      <br />GERARD BUTLER-PHANTOM-In a word, sublime!  As the critics have said-he's no Michael Crawford-THANK THE GOOD LORD!!!  This talented Scot absolutely commands the eye to watch every move he makes.  His phantom is emotionally wrecked, sexy, dark, edgy, tragic, soulful and ultimately heartbreaking.  As others scoff at the frilly costumes and assume the bared chest shots are purely for female viewers, I feel his vulnerability is made even more apparent by those ruffled shirts which seem to lay wide open his aching heart that waits for someone to take care of it. <br />     Butler's singing performance is quite good for someone with so little training.  Yes, a couple upper notes seem shouted and/or strained, but I do not think it detracts from the performance, but rather adds a sense of desperation that he no longer has control over Christine and his efforts to do so are futile.  Butler's performance highlight is, without a doubt, Point of No Return; it is simply mesmerizing. <br />     Butler's phantom is raw sensuality and emotion.  He could not possibly be more in love with Christine and it is heartbreaking to watch him be denied and ultimately defeated.  If you can watch the last 30 minutes without crying, you have a cold, dead heart!  Butler is so captivating and convincing that it is inconceivable to me how Christine chooses Raoul over phantom. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, get a bottle of good Italian wine, settle in for a couple of hours of shameless romance and let your fantasies unwind through Gerard Butler's phantom.
0060751967|1.0|I wanted to like this book: I love paranormal romance and have read almost everything else.  I was excited about a new author with fresh ideas.  Unfortunately, the ideas aren't fresh, the heroine is whiny and immature and the book ends without resolving two very major issues.  <br /> First, roman IS a vampire, yet Shanna refuses to entertain the idea of being bitten.  Yes, he has another food source but is love not about accepting and sharing the most important aspects of your partner?  We're not talking about liking sports or sharing tastes in music here.   <br /> Second, her father clearly intends to kill Roman and all other vampires. Shanna's response is a flippant joke.  This seems to underscore the whole problem with the book.  Shanna is extremely self-oriented and responds to almost every situation childishly.  How are we to believe a 545 year old man, who was once a monk, would be attracted to such a woman?
B0001LYH98|5.0|Hours is the exact opposite of the previous album, Earthling, because it isn't heavy, loud, and upbeat. \\"The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell,\\" is the only song that sounds like it could have been off of Earthling. It's still a really good CD though, just in a completley different way. I love both of them, but some fans seem to like just one or the other. I can see why because of the really big change in music. Even the lyrics are a good bit different. A lot of the songs Bowie sings on Hours deals with sadness and regret. <br /> <br />I'm pretty sure there were two hits off of Hours, and they were \\"Thursday's Child,\\" and \\"Survive.\\" I know for sure they  were both made into music videos. It seems like a lot of people like \\"Thursday's Child\\" way better than \\"Survive,\\" but I absolutley love that song. It's my favorite one off the album. Why don't more people like it?! Other great songs on here are \\"Something In The Air,\\" \\"Seven,\\" \\"The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell,\\" \\"New Angels Of Promise,\\" and \\"The Dreamers.\\" If you like Bowie's music in the mid-late 90's and 00's, you'll probably like this one too. It's been selling for pretty cheap, so you should buy it and give it a chance! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|The departure of Fish and the arrival of Hogarth was the best thing to ever happen to this band!!   This album proves it. <br />Awesome from beginning to end...Mark kelly is consistently flawless on keyboards...Steve Hogarth sings with emotion...great guitar and bass work....... <br /> <br />THIS is how marillion is supposed to sound. It's incredible!
B0002OERI0|5.0|1st of all, I'm a huge fan of Green  Day, have been listening to them for 5 years. But I would like to say something to the reviewer who senslessly saying in his/her review,\\" If you listen to Green Day you are one f*cked up person!\\" I would just like to say to this reviewer that I am offended at the way you sterotypically insult Green Day and their fans. Jeez, just accept the fact that not everyone is going to like the same music you do! And I don't know who you think you are insulting us like that but just know that we can do the same to you you little queer. Now look, I got nothing against Megadeth or Slayer, but c'mon, Mudvayne? When you're going to list other bands as alternatives don't use a piece of crap band like Mudvayne.<br /><br />Ok, so onto the actual review...<br /><br />American Idiot is a social commentary on what's happening in the world. We see it all around us. With Bush in charge of America, it was up to Green Dayu to make this concept album, about a boy, named Jesus of Suburbia, who has to experience all of the harsh aspects of America and the rest of the world. The riffs may not stray away from the standard GD formula, but would we want it differently? This is by far Billie's best vocal performance ever, and Mike's bass sounds amazing, as well as Tre's drums. There are additional instruments like the paino, the saxophone, and the trumpet incorporated into the album, like on JOS, BOBD, GMN, Extraordinary Girl, WMUWSE, and Homecoming. Let's just hope the movie version of the album doesn't get delayed for too long.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend getting this album if you're a TRUE GD fan, not some poser trapped in the '90s who can't accept anything new from the band.

B000C65Z1G|2.0|I was really looking forward to this film.  The buzz from critics was largely positive, I liked the actors, the director's previous effort left me hopeful, and, though not LeCarre's best novel, certainly provocative and topical enough to make a terrific film (with the book's weaknesses filtered out).  Wrong.  The \\"Constant Gardener\\" is yet another example of read the book (if you must).  Basically, the book is about how Evil Pharmaceutical companies (with Political help) are using Africans as guinea pigs as they pursue the next big money making drug.  Ever since the Soviet Union fell LeCarre has been left to find another bookend to match his corrupt West.  By now he's quit looking, so he vents his spleen (not undeservedly) on the West.  The problem is he can't seem to learn that less is more.  The lessons from, for example, Greene's \\"Quiet American,\\" with all its use of nuance but at the same time clear condemnation of American policies in Vietnam would, you would think, be obvious to a seasoned writer such as LeCarre.  Well, no.  LeCarre's confusing of  shrill lecturing as substance shows him, sadly, the lesser writer.   I'm not saying that \\"Constant Gardener\\" is a bad book, it is interesting, and the didactic weaknesses are at least spread out over a long novel.        The movie is another matter.  It magnifies the very weaknesses that you would like to see muted.  Early on crusading \\"activist\\" Tessa (soon to be Quayle) (Rachel Weisz) gives an passionate denunciation of Iraqi policy while attending a press forum hosted by her husband to be Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes).  It's an embarrassing moment (for the viewer as well) that turns into \\"Love.\\"  Maybe.  Problem is that Tessa is very manipulative - so much so that it's difficult to be sympathetic, despite all her trumpeted high ideals.  Justin is your classic LeCarre sympathetic lover - who must step beyond the gray bureaucracy of his life to prove (to himself?) he indeed cares about Love (see Winston Smith in Orwell's \\"1984\\").  Tessa becomes his Beatrice as he crisscrosses Africa and Europe in search of the Truth behind his wife's tragic fate, while sinister forces follow closely behind.  This all sounds fine, but as film it's very confusing.  Having read the book I knew what was going on, but I wonder how it plays for someone who has not.  One major problem is the cinema photography of director Fernando Meirelles (\\"City of God\\").  Meirelles employs a lot of flashbacks (seemingly of the handheld camera kind) in \\"Constant Gardener,\\" so much so that the characters rarely get any traction as people.  The intent is to convey urgency and \\"realism.\\"  Instead it results in a collage of cryptic images that never give you enough meat as to just what the story is about and who the characters are as people.  Characters, some important, some not, just pop up, say something that seems important, and then disappear again. And near the end, there is another embarrassing moment, another embarrassing speech, that tries to lead the viewer by the hand by wagging a finger.  If you want political drama of a coherent and literary kind, check out \\"The Quiet American\\" (movie and book).
B00005JOII|4.0|Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former tennis pro, takes a job at an exclusive club in London, teaching the well-to-do. There, he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the son of a rich businessman and they strike up a friendship. Tom learns of Chris' love for opera and offers him an extra ticket for the next show allowing Chris to meet the entire Hewett family; sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer, \\"Dear Frankie\\"), \\"Poppa\\" Alec (Brian Cox) and mother (Penelope Wilton, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Chloe and Chris plan a date and soon become inseparable leading her to ask Poppa to find a position for Chris in one of his companies. Alec wholeheartedly agrees and Chris is soon the head of a division, spending weekends at the Hewett country estate and shagging Chloe on his sleeper sofa. Then, Chris meets Nola (Scarlet Johannson), Tom's American fianc&eacute;e. They flirt and begin an affair. Chris and Chloe are soon married and move into a fantastic loft on the South Bank. But as Chris becomes more and more comfortable in his life with Chloe, and her father's money, his relationship with Nola spins out of control, threatening his newfound security.<br /><br />This is just a small portion of the plot for the new film \\"Match Point\\". I remember clearly the first time I saw the trailer and the reaction when it was revealed as a Woody Allen film. There were a couple of audible \\"whoa\\"s in the audience. Everything in the trailer was different from anything we had ever seen in an Allen film before; hints of a torrid love affair, the predominantly British cast and setting, the dramatic overtones with little evidence of comedy, hints at possible violence. In short, it surprised everyone. It surprised me. After almost a decade of slogging through mediocre films like \\"Small Time Crooks\\" and truly bad, bad films like \\"Curse of the Jade Scorpion\\", \\"Melinda and Melinda\\" (shudder!), and \\"Anything Else\\" (double shudder!!), my patience as a die hard Woody Allen fan was sorely tested. The trailer peaked my curiosity. Is it possible? Could he have made another great film? Something so different from his previous works to respark his career?<br /><br />\\"Match Point\\" is a very good film, easily Allen's best in a decade. But it falls short of his classics, films like \\"Annie Hall\\", \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\" and \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" for a few reasons.<br /><br />One of the biggest surprises is that Allen would set a film anywhere other than his beloved New York. But the London setting works well for Allen's writing and directing style. His writing is a little unnatural at times; a large majority of the characters in his films speak as though they all attended an Ivy League college and consistently stand around talking about philosophy, opera and `making love'. I'm not saying this doesn't happen, but in his less successful films, it rings false. In his last great films, this worked because the people who spoke these lines were wealthy, educated and it was believable. He also balanced these storylines with the comedic antics of his character.<br /><br />Another positive change Allen has begun to make is that he is casting other actors as leads in his films. Will Farrell, Kenneth Branagh, John Cusack and others have essentially played the \\"Woody Allen\\" role in some of his recent offerings. This is a step in the right direction, but in most of these cases, these younger actors are still speaking Allen's dialogue and it just doesn't work. Strangely, in \\"Point\\", there is no \\"Woody Allen\\" character, adding another level of surprise to the film. He has created something almost entirely new, challenging his skills and abilities.<br /><br />The predominantly British cast and locations add a level of authenticity to his writing, helping it seem more natural. We fully believe that a bunch of upper crust Brits would act and speak like this. At one point, late in the film, a character quickly talks about neuroses, reminding us that this is in fact a Woody Allen film. But before and after this point, the thought never occurred to me. You might almost forget.<br /><br />The biggest and best change in the new film is that Allen doesn't subject us to another interpretation of his character running around with an actress (or two) twenty to thirty years his junior. We are spared endless scenes of these actresses claiming what a great lover Allen's character is. Thank GOD! Allen is a funny guy, but to watch Elizabeth Berkeley, Helen Hunt and others fight over Allen, and his \\"ability to make love\\", is just painful.<br /><br />In \\"Point\\", Allen casts Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlet Johannson as the ill-fated lovers. Emily Mortimer completes the trio as Chris' supportive, yet eager to be pregnant wife. As the film begins, we realize we are in the hands of an accomplished filmmaker. Through a series of short scenes, Chris' life is quickly established and Rhys Meyers hints that his character may be a gold-digger, placing himself in situations in which he is more likely to meet the well-to-do. Then again, he could just be trying to make his life better; he is constantly trying to learn and seems to work hard. But Chris remains enough of an enigma to keep us guessing. As his life begins to get better, it also starts to unravel. He quickly becomes comfortable in his new lifestyle and sees it slipping out of his hands if Nola gets her way.<br /><br />Emily Mortimer brings a quiet vulnerability to the role of Chloe. She adds just the right level of love and support to spoiled rich girl, making her character interesting and believable. Just as things begin to get complicated, she begins nagging Chris about having a baby. This causes her husband to vacillate back and forth. Should he stay with Chloe or leave her for a more passionate, but less comfortable existence with Nola?<br /><br />The biggest problem in the film is Scarlet Johannson. She is good, but Allen's dialogue does not blend well with her age, lack of experience and accent. In her mouth, his dialogue sounds stiff and forced. The contrast between Johannson and the British actors is really quite noticeable. She is much better in her scenes with Tom, as his fianc&eacute;e, sharing alcohol and food, flirting a bit, putting on an act. When she becomes the center of Chris' attention, she does and says things which seem unnatural becoming a fairly stereotypical \\"jilted lover\\". How exactly does a young American woman come up with the resources to move from England to the States and then back to London again? How does she survive in London on a shop girl's salary?<br /><br />Also, there is a point during the resolution when characters, specifically two British detectives, talk about things we haven't seen. Their descriptions are amusing, but it is a sloppy method of storytelling.<br /><br />These two points aside, \\"Match Point\\" represents a return to form for a master filmmaker. As the story unfolds, and we realize the events will be told in a series of tableaus, leaving out the unnecessary bits, we realize we are in the hands of a master. Sit back, enjoy and let Allen tell his story.before and after this point, the thought never occurred to me.

0307276902|4.0|In spite of recent controversy, this book is worth taking the time to read.  Unless one is naive, it is apparent the author has taken some license and exaggerated events, however, the author takes you though what I believe is a realisitic experience of coming off drugs and alcohol.   <br /> <br />I found it hard to put the book down.  It was well written in that it kept you involved and curious to see what the next page would bring.
B00028HBKC|3.0|A great movie describing the last 12 hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life.<br /><br />Jesus is arrested after being betrayed by Judas Iscariot and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy.<br /><br />If I look at the movie from its educational and Historical perspective, its high quality filming, acting and gread sound and music effects, (I am talking about the DVD here) this movie will surely rate not 5 but 6 Stars;<br /><br />However, Although I am a person who likes historical and action movies with strong graphics, the Passion of the Christ was way too strong for me and I almost gave up on watching the movie to the end. Horrifying graphic detail with all kinds of whipping techniques, kicking, puncturing and  Hammering nails in the flesh on the cross with extreme blood, making these details extremely disturbing.<br /><br />1 or 5 stars? your decision.<br /><br />History? yes. Acting? great. filming? perfect. however.........<br /><br />Before watching this (good or bad) movie, be prepared for all what I described above.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is a simple movie that packs a pleasant punch. A man and a woman reunite after a brief interlude 10 years previously. They speak of past times, about themselves, and of each other. More importantly, they are in that blissful groove of speaking tenderly towards each other. This movie captures love growing and gaining momentum. There appears to be some debate over what happens in the end...Not for me! I feel certain about what happens in the end. Watch it and I'm sure you'll agree with me.
0316172324|3.0|I blinked and did not see any empirical evidence that Gladwell's assertions hold ground. I was somewhat confused by the various ambiguities and the author's \\"thin slicing\\" theory and his leap of faith conclusions. In all fairness, this book is entertaining and is filled with fascinating anecdotes.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one great debut album and so is \\"Nevermind\\" but you can't compare the two.  They are both good but for too many reasons to mention here, \\"Nevermind\\" is destined to be remembered more fondly and ranked higher in any best of albums compilation than this one.  I have to admit that this album had to grow on me as I didn't think it was that great to begin with.  I thought the sound quality wasn't that good and in fact I still do but eventually, the brilliance of this debut album shone through.  \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Even Flow\\" and my favourite, \\"Alive\\" (even though Stone Gossard completely rips off Ace Frehley's (from Kiss' \\"Alive\\" album - brilliant tongue in cheek tribute to obviously one of his fav bands/albums and guitar idols -  guitar solo note-for-note for the beginning of his solo) are all great tracks while the \\"fillers\\" are pretty decent and don't take too much away from the overall quality of the album.  I even got to see them live shortly after they'd released \\"Vs\\" when they toured Singapore and I got the ticket free too!  They are excellent live and I recall even the quality of the sound at the indoor stadium was a lot better than what's on the cd.  I'd like to see Sony repackage this as an mlps replica and digitally remaster this soon.  Great debut but I prefer \\"Vs\\" for some reason.  Recommended.
B000BNI90O|4.0|It's not hard to see with the string of positive reviews that this set containing (finally!) the complete soundtrack score of the Fellowship is a 'must have' item for any fan. I don't need to tell anyone reading this review how wonderful the score itself is. Nor do I need to go on about the technical rating of the disks themselves as several others have done a wonderful job with that here already. The collection of the music is very well worth five stars but here is why it gets 4 out of five stars from me: <br /> <br />I agree with most here that this set is simply overpriced and the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. For such a high price tag, the pagacking is cheap and poorly produced. The entire set is flimsy and care will be needed to make it last over time and frequent use. The DVD disk is attached to the inside cover via a glued on rubber knob that barely fits the center opening of the disk. Anyone who owns any high end music boxed sets will instantly know this set's production was a complete miss. One has to wonder what kind of design and producing amateurs were behind the approval of the final product. We can only hope word gets back to the studio and the next two sets are produced with the care the subject matter so deserves.  <br /> <br />Also, when it comes to the high price, I can do without the DVD disk here. While it's nice to see this option, if I had my way, I'd rather not pay the extra to own it. Like most here, what I was really looking for was to upload the whole soundtrack onto my Ipod (which I did with ease). Ideally, we should have been offered a three disk set by itself for, say, around $29.99 retail (tops!) and the DVD disk sold seperately for those who so desired.  <br /> <br />In the end I'm very happy to own the complete recordings of this film and look forward to owning the next two. But we were definitely gouged for the privlage.  <br /> <br />
B00000J5Z6|5.0|Monty and his crew take Bob's music to a different level and yet he ads a dimension that even Bob would be proud of. He combines both the jazz and reggae and interweaves both so perfectly as one and yet still remaining true to Bob's music in Monty's own personal interpretation of Bob's music. Monty and his musicians honors both the jazz and Reggae and yet this cd remains a reggae disc with touches of Jazz flavored throughout. Splendid job by Monty and his pals.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|Carla Bruni's voice is so soothing and sweet.  The tracks mesh together to make a wonderful compilation of Ms. Bruni's spectacular talent.  Beautiful - perfect for a sunny summer drive.
B000BRBA8S|1.0|My boyfriend and I saw this movie while it was out in theatres. It just went on and on and on, and it made me wish I could just leave the theatre and go bang my head against the wall for 2 hours rather than have to sit there and watch it.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|After seeing this movie for the first time I was blown away, and the more i watch it the more I get out of it.  Eternal Sunshine can be confusing if you are not ready to think.  The acting is wonderful and the order that the movie is shot is great.  This is Jim Carrey's most serious role and I would have to say his best, you are able to feel his emotions while watching the movie and you can't help but be totally absorbed into it.  I have recommended this movie to everyone i know, but just remember that this is not going to be like \\"The Mask.\\"
B000AP04OM|2.0|My parents dragged me to this musical when I was 8.  Hated it.  I saw the movie in first release, got bored and left an hour into it. <br /> <br />With age one begins to appreciate the sweeter things about life, things that are decent and show people at their best and after watching bits and pieces of the movie on tv over the years and having always loved Julie Andrews, I decided during a real bad funk a few weeks ago, to buy the 40th Anniversary Edition.  It was really like discovering it for the first time.  Actually it turned into the first time I watched the film in its entirety.  I love Rodgers & Hammerstein's musicals (all of them really pathed the way for the \\"serious\\" American musical) and this one is really far more endearing in retrospect than I had remembered.  For one thing the story, which really has little to do with the real story of the Von Trapp Singers, is very moving, uplifting and even spiritual.  It really is a story about personal triumph, the importance of honor and brotherhood and courage and there's certainly nothing wrong with the beautiful music. <br /> <br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC has very little nostalgic ties for me so the Sing Along documentary was a hoot for me.  I loved the reunion of the kids, most of them are my age today, and just adored Miss Andrews's introductions.  Can't believe she's around 70.
B000AY74OG|5.0|This is the funniest kids movie I have ever seen. Every character is so funny and lovable you can't help but want to watch it over and over. This is one movie I definitely bought for my children because they loved it too.............
B00005JGAF|5.0|At first I thought that their first album was the best one for years. But when I caught wind of this album, I relized that this one kicks much more ass. \\"Rockaway Beach\\" and \\"Cretin Hop\\" show it's hardcore punk power while \\"Here Today, Gone Tomarrow\\" and \\"Locket Love\\" show it's soft side. With Joey's cockeny british accent and Johnny's ripping guitar chords, this is a must have for all fans of the band, punk, rock, or just flat out music.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|After their more radio friendly album Discovery this album is going to come as a shock to most people.<br /><br />It's back to the basic loops, repeatative over-long tracks, and minimalist dirty synths. If you liked their album Homework then you'll probably like this.<br /><br />However it certainy doesn't have the fun and variety that album did, and it is mostly without a highlight. The single, Robot Rock, is catchy but overlong, the title track Human After All is bouncy, but without energy.<br /><br />Hardcore fans will love this, people who have just heard Discovery will probably dislike it, and people who were kind of sitting on the fence will be left rather flat.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag, but its intended audience is probably the club dance floor anyway - and it will most likely be played there - so is it a success? As a CD, I'd say not, but as a slice of Daft Punk doing what they are famous for... sure.<br /><br />Overall? Their worst album, but not a complete loss.
B000002PCS|4.0|THough I have not yet seen this film, the music is classic and very soothing. Pieces such as \\"Somewhere in Time:Main THeme\\" Are very memorable, while some of the other are more backround music than anything else. However this is perfect for putting on while you're working on projects and the like. <br />   Very soothing and refreashing, Somewhere in time is a classic worth listening to!
B000023VR6|5.0|At a time when the west coast was dropping hit album after hit album, Dr. Dre hits us with his second solo LP The Chronic 2001. Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from '99 out of the water. 2001 has some of the best west coast production you will be able to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, he really serves up a high quality album.<br /><br />Of course Dre didn't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da 5'9\\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes here. On \\"The Watcher\\" (think Jay-Z's \\"The Takeover\\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easilly bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \\"F You\\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanitory. \\"Still D.R.E.\\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomonal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \\"Big Ego's\\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \\"Xxplosive\\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \\"B\\" and \\"H\\" at least twice in every line. Believe it or not, that is my favorite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \\"What's The Difference\\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in his earlier days and what he is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \\"Light Speed\\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \\"Forgot About Dre\\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \\"The Next Episode\\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's preceeding song. \\"Lets Get H***\\" is a party/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \\"B**** A** N*****\\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \\"Murder Ink\\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \\"Ed-Ucation\\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \\"Some L.A. ******\\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \\"Housewife\\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt's [[ASIN:B000028TWH Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha]], which was ironically released the same day as this album. \\"Ackrite\\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \\"Bang Bang\\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \\"The Message\\" a deep touching track dedicated to his deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell.<br /><br />To me 2001 is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but he can thank other albums like [[ASIN:B00000IMGM No Limit Top Dogg]], [[ASIN:B00000AFAC Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes l & ll]], [[ASIN:B00001T3H6 I Want It All]], [[ASIN:B00001IVOY 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz]] for the help as well as others, because he didn't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is. I picked up this album when was 14, and must have spun it over 100 times between 1999 and 2000, at the same time fearing that my Dad would walk in on me while I was playing this album, and confiscate it (theres enough profanity on here to offend Richard Pryor). Anyway, 2001 is an album I highly recommend to any rap fan. Peace.<br /><br />Lyrics: A<br />Production: A+<br />Guest Appearances: A<br />Musical Vibes: A+<br /><br />Top 5 Tracks:<br />1.

0446677450|3.0|I bought and read this book in a rather short time, but I feel that there could've been more of a 'cut to the chase' style of writing. There's some good advice, but it seems drawn out and repeats often at times. It seemed a little stuck on the childhood stories for too long in the start of the book.  <br /> <br />   It seems at times that the author doesn't really want to tell you how to do something directly or specifically, almost as if he's holding back information, but rather mentions things that you probably should investigate on your own with additional reading. I don't have a problem with doing additional reading, but it seemed like I was playing 'peek-a-boo'with a teacher.  <br /> <br />   The overall message and philosophy is -making 'money making' assets work for you, not working jobs for money, so it seems more of a motivational book to me. This book definitely needs to be followed up with other books (probably his other books, which is probably the idea), but the drawn out style of writing will prevent me from getting any of his other books for my own collection.  <br /> <br />   My fiance' loves this book so far, because it's motivating her to look beyond her day job.  <br /> <br />
B000002IST|3.0|As Genesis moved on through the years, the sound from the debut album in 1971's \\"Trespass\\" to 1992's \\"We Can't Dance\\" is like night and day. Of course, most bands that have been around as long as Genesis had, aren't going to be writing the same material as they did 20 or 30 years ago, yet..this Genesis album was a little bit of a disappointment. I realize that Phil Collins has devoted his solo act to creating Soft-Rock radio Love songs these days, and if that what he wants to do, so be it. But this was released in 1992, and it was a long time coming for a new Genesis album. (last studio effort in 1986) Even though this has some really good tunes on it, it is a bit mellow, and has way to many ballads..the only song that really isnt downbeat is \\"We cant dance and Jesus he knows me which I think are  rather cheesy. The songs that really stand out here are No son of Mine, Drving the Last Spike, Never a time, holld on my heart, since I lost you and Fading Lights. The reason that I give this effort only 3 stars, is because I believe it is the worst genesis album with Phil, and Songs like I cant Dance, Dreaming while you sleep, living Forever, way of the world, and since i lost you, are way way to corney and sound like they belong playing in an elevator (yes hold on my heart and Never a time are mellow, but they are really emotinal ballads, not some whining and sad junk like the others I metioned) anyway, this is the one Genesis album that isn't the best effort, yet I still say add it to your Genesis Collection..ENJOY
B000068FY0|5.0|\\"Crime of the Century\\" is the name of the album , but in hindsight \\" Surprise Of The Century \\" would of been a more apt title . Supertramp were formed in 1969 around Richard Davies , with the financial backing of Stanley August Miesegaes<br /><br />(Known to his friends as Sam) .In the first auditions Richard met Roger Hodgson , who were to become the nucleus of the band we now know from legend as Supertramp. After various name changes the band decided to be called Supertramp after Sam suggested it from the W. H. Davies book published in 1910, 'History of a Supertramp.'<br /><br />The first self titled Supertramp album is released in 1970 , to no public or critical acclaim , the rest of the band are either fired , have a nervous breakdown ,or jump ship. A second album is recorded 'Indelibly Stamped' ( 1971) which if anything fared even worse than it's predecessor. ( Both of these albums feature rather aimless songs featuring meandering solo's and indifferent lyrics instantly forgettable .) after the tour to promote, Indelibly Stamped, the three new recruits to the band are all fired leaving just the duo of Davies and Hodgson again, at this point Sam separates from the band paying off the 60,000 pound debts already incurred , wishing them all the best for the future , but severing any further ties .<br /><br /> Davies and Hodgson bravely keep going recruiting new musicians in the shape of magical saxophonist John Anthony Helliwell ( Ex 'Alan Bown Sound' )The rock solid jazzy drumming of Bob.C. Benberg ( Ex 'Bees Make Honey ', and 'Ilford Subway' with American Scott Gorman before he became famous with 'Thin Lizzy'.)Perhaps most importantly of all Dougie Thomson came in on Bass guitar and also took over the business management of the band .At this point the band are gigging day to day to survive whilst writing new material for the proposed new album . But A&M Records had no future plans for the band, in fact they thought Supertramp had imploded . Roger Hodgson, Richard Davies under the watchful eye of new partner Dougie Thomson went back to A&M Records to plead their case for another bite at the cherry. For once somebody at the record company got it right .<br /><br /> In November 1973 the band are moved lock stock and if you want smokin' barrel to a farm in Somerset ,England to work on the new material for the next album , from there in February 1974 they are moved onto Trident Recording Studio's in London with the excellent Ken Scott holding down production duties , in June the band finish off recordings in the famous Ramport Studio's .The third album under the Supertramp banner is released in September 1973, and with the full weight of the A&M publicity machine behind them, coupled with some ground breaking and prestigious live concerts, the band become overnight sensations . The first single off the album \\" Dreamer\\" ( Which was to be the template for the Supertramp sound from here on,hammering piano, searing guitar licks , beautifully contrasting harmonised vocals, with catchy amusing lyrics , combustible saxophone and clarinets ,with a jazz influenced rhythm section.) was to peak at Number 13 in the British charts followed by the album itself which was in the Top Five by Christmas of that year .<br /><br />All the songs on the album have a conceptual theme to them in this case insanity . All sorts of insanity whether it be brought on by ,Education( School), Dreaming( The first single), Love (Rudy),Shyness ( Hide In Your Shell) or  authority ( The title track).  Every track is instantly recognisable as Supertramp , and the album as a whole runs together perfectly , starting with the haunting harmonica opening of School to the final rousing crescendo of the title track . In-between there are some splendid melodies ranging from many of the bands influences ,Folk, Progressive/Rock, Pop, Jazz and the Classics ,combining the vocal talents of both Hodgson and Davies in there contrasting manner, giving Supertramp that essential variety,which is used in quite devastating effect on the albums centrepiece song Asylum ,where they both sound as if they are completely going off the planet ,  quite a blend you may think , but it all gels to stirring effect .<br /><br />Supertramp were to go on to conquer the Adult oriented world of Rock music ,even the advent of Punk Rock did not dent their mercurial rise to Stardom . Three more smash hit albums were to follow, \\" Crisis What Crisis?\\" (1975) , \\" Even In The Quietest Moments\\" ( 1977) and culminating in the Worldwide  Number One album \\"Breakfast in America\\"( 1979)  which was to spawn four Hit singles on it's own ( In those days Hit singles used to mean something .)  The band toured Internationally on the strength of these records and would fill Stadiums where ever they went .<br /><br />As in many marriages ,something that started out as blissfully perfect ruptured into bitterness and in family fighting, after one more not so successful album and world tour ,Roger Hodgson left the family taking with him John Anthony Helliwell, leaving Richard Davies to carry on with the name Supertramp . Of course by this time none of them needed to work for the money , and really did not care, nor to be quite honest did the public, enough was enough . Both carried on their careers in a very lack lustre manner , but were never to find that original spark again . All good things must come to an end.The Tramp was super for a long time and made enough to retire to it's mansion , I do like a story with a happy( If not perfect) ending .I wonder if Stanley August Miesegaes \\" Sam\\" ever got repaid for his original funding of the dream?<br /><br />Mott The Dog.ite devastating effect on the albums centrepiece song Asylum ,where they both sound as if they are completely going off the planet ,  quite a blend you may think , but it all gels to stirring effect . <br />Supertramp were to go on to conquer the Adult oriented world of Rock music ,even the advent of Punk Rock did not dent their mercurial rise to Stardom .

B000001ESF|5.0|Anyone who thinks Rush's \\"2112\\" is below a five star rating is insane! Even if you aren't a fan this album is a must for anyone who loves and appricates music. Consider its release in 1976, it was way ahead of its time, and even more amazing it the diversity of instruments played on this album by just three band members. I beg anyone who has never heard this to really purchase this and you will be blown away by the 20+minute title track, and actually the other songs on this album are amazing also...This is one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever...ENJOY
0811828697|5.0|I went to a bookstore looking for some other Star Wars books and happened upon this by chance.  It is a truly lovely work of art, and should appeal to: <br />*artists, who will be impressed by its vision as well as its craft <br />*children, whose imaginations will be fired <br />*naturalists, who will have a lark finding similarities between these made-up species and real-life species <br />*Star Wars fans who love the archaeological depth of the fantasy <br />I'm just not entirely sure that it will appeal to the average Star Wars fan.  The majority of people who love Star Wars seem to love it for fight scenes and techno-gadgetry.  This book is a long way from that.
B000002J2D|5.0|And then there were three continues to be my favorite Genesis album without Peter Gaberial. This is really were the band started to take off, and even though it contains the popular Follow You, Follow me, that might be the worst track on here. The rest of the album hits a nerve as it is very emotional. This is a slow album and lack a lot of the acid type rock found on the earlier Genesis albums, yet there is something about it, even if it a little slow, that just Rocks..Even if you arent a Genesis fan, you should have this in you collection just because it is a great effort..ENJOY
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein's MUTTER continued the trend they had already begun with the stomp of HERZELEID. While incorporating more melody into their music, they still rocked with a fierce devotion to keep the guitars very metal and the rhythm section very rigid and compelling. REISE, REISE (\\"ARISE, ARISE\\") is a solid collection of their hard-hitting and symphonic German brand of metal. You will not find one bad song amongst this cohesive bunch, which like their previous albums, holds up very well upon repeated listens. The guitars from Paul and Richard remain crisp and menacing; Till's vocals remain enchanting and threatening at the same time; drummer Christoph and bassist Oliver keep the grind of the rhythm section in full force; and keyboardist Doktor Lorenz keeps the samples and effects interesting all throughout. <br /> <br />The title track kicks the album off on a blustery note, with sweeping strings, metal madness, and a rather odd but interesting accordion to conclude the song. All of this is blown to bits by the monstrous metal of \\"Mein Teil\\" (\\"My Parts\\"), with shards of crunchy guitar and hard-hitting rhythms backing a rather dark and morbid tale of cannibalism (go check out the English translation and you'll know what I mean). The song concludes with a sinister-sounding choir of voices, which gives the song such a chilling edge. Without a doubt, \\"Amerika\\" (\\"America\\", but I'm sure you knew that) is another clear anthem, complete with an English-sung chorus and big, full guitars, and you can't get the words out of your head once you hear them (especially the memorable chorus). \\"Los\\" (\\"Less\\") has a very cool acoustic-bluesy guitar intro to integrate into it's very catchy beat, while Lindemann sings in a hushed breath. \\"Moskau\\" (\\"Moscow\\") is another dance-y type track with atmospheric beats and air-y but metallic guitars, and even female voices! \\"Morgenstern\\" (\\"Morningstar\\") harkens somewhat back to the days of HERZELEID with its verses, but the chorus definitely feels SEHNSUCHT-ish. The beautiful and enchanting \\"Ohne Dich\\" (\\"Without You\\") is by far the best love song Rammstein have made, with Till really singing his heart into this one and it's one of REISE, REISE's more melodic moments. Closer \\"Amour\\" (\\"Love\\") is a rather moody closer for an album that does include its harder moments, but it nonetheless closes the album on a strong note, making further proof that Rammstein don't always have to crank the volume to ten to make a great song (it still contains a crunchy ending). <br /> <br />So while REISE, REISE is full of great metal moments, it also continues to expose some of the more softer moments of Rammstein. If you're looking for a complete repeat of HERZELEID, you're not going to find it here, but what you will find should be a very enjoyable experience. From front to back, REISE, REISE is another clear winner from the finest German metal band to emerge from Europe and into \\"Amerika\\".
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's sound changes on every album. The band is constantly changing. If you listened to the band's debut, Pablo Honey, and then Hail To The Thief, you would know what I mean. Thom Yorke's voice has changed dramatically, from decipherable to his new mumbling singing-style (listen to Myxomatosis). In this album, Radiohead combine their original \\"rock\\" style with their later electronica to make a masterpiece of an album. For example, 2+2=5, an amazing opening track, starts off with the sound of a guitar being plugged in (wonderful sound). Then you hear a mechanical beat, followed by a guitar playing arpeggios. The song uses a mixture of rock and electronica, to form one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />As always, Thom Yorke's lyrics are superb. Metaphoric and meaningful, every song gives a different mood. Yorke has continued to keep up his standard of lyrics.  <br /> <br />Hail to the Thief. One of the best Radiohead albums, along with OK Computer and The Bends. Everyone will find something they like here. Highlights include: 2+2=5, Backdrifts, Go To Sleep, Where I End And You Begin, There There, Myxomatosis and A Wolf At The Door. This album easily blows anything Coldplay has ever done out of the water.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein have, over many years of relentless touring and stellar album after stellar album, proven themselves a gigantic force in the metal music scene. The big success of their breakthrough album SEHNSUCHT proved to many that they were not going anywhere anytime soon (last year's ROSENROT certainly continued to prove the importance of their existence), and it was time for Rammstein to make their third collection of catchy and monstrous metal operas. Indeed, MUTTER's first track, \\"Mein Herz Brent\\" (\\"My Heart Burns\\") is like a gigantic opera: full-throttle thick metal guitars, a grand backing of strings, Till Lindemann's theatric vocal grandeur, and the hard-hitting rhythm section of drummer Christoph Schneider and bassist Oliver Riedel. Guitarists Paul Landers and Richard Kruspe continue to remain two of metal's best axemen, and Lindemann has already proven to be a secret weapon of Rammstein with his vocal theatrics. Everything comes together to make MUTTER (\\"MOTHER\\") another grand album from Germany's finest. <br /> <br />\\"Links 234\\" (\\"Left 234\\") is another catchy slice of German metal that cuts through even the thickest layers, further enhancing this collection. The marching feet and stomp of the drums give it a militaristic beat. \\"Sonne\\" (\\"Sun\\") blends melody and grace with thundering guitars and beats. The gentle and almost ballad-esque metal of the title track breaks briefly into more of the soft side that Rammstein can break out without incident. Even the closing track, \\"Nebel\\" (\\"Mist\\"), incorporates piano into its volatile mixture, complete with Bobo's enchanting background vocals (she was brilliant on the well-crafted hit \\"Engel\\"). But Rammstein get down to harder dynamics on the crunchy stomp of \\"Adios\\" (\\"Goodbye\\") and the wild \\"Freuer Frei!\\" (\\"Fire at will!\\"). They even add a child's voice to the enchanting metal of \\"Spieluhr\\" (\\"Music Box\\"). Rammstein have really continued to craft excellent albums, and MUTTER proves to be no disappointment. <br /> <br />Rammstein have longevity in their bright future thanks to solid efforts like MUTTER and SEHNSUCHT, and REISE, REISE and ROSENROT proved to be stellar collections. MUTTER is only further proof that while not from the U.S. metal scene, Rammstein continues to remain an important piece of the metal music puzzle. Ich will more Rammstein!!
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I picked this CD up in spite of all the complaints over the digipak packaging and you know what - the album is still great!  The sound is vastly improved - most noticably on the 'Overload', which on the original issue sounded more bass drone than what you get with this superior issue. Of the bonus tracks, Fela's Riff and Right Start sound most compatible with the original.  I don't have 5.1 capability - so I don't know whether the DVD side is any better, but the CD side sounds excellent and is worth the buy, regardless of the packaging.
B000089RV6|5.0|First of all, I listen to the post-BIB AC/DC.  With that said, this album is the perfect comeback.  After the tragic death of the original lead singer, people have either made or broken their love for AC/DC.  I personally love Brian Johnson.  He is the perfect lead singer for this unbelievable band.  I only own Fly on the Wall while this review is being written, but I guarentee that I will eventually own Back in Black, along with Highway to Hell.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br /><br />Hells Bells<br /><br />You Shook Me All Night Long<br /><br />Back in Black<br /><br />Shake a Leg<br /><br />AC/DC is one of the most legendary bands ever formed, no matter what people may say.  So in the end, this album is the perfect way to say welcome back, AC/DC.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a beautiful love story for our time.  It is superbly scripted, sensitively directed, beautifully filmed, with inspired acting and a message that all Americans need to hear.
0307276902|1.0|True or not true......I just did not like this book.  This is the first book that I've put down and didn't finish.  Even bad books I'll read until the end because I don't like to leave things unfinished.  This one just wasn't worth it.  The language the writing got on my last nerve and it truthfully (no pun intended) made me feel dirty. <br />I don't recommend reading this.  The comments on this site are much more entertaining.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Definitely, they have done better stuff. 10,000Hz legend was much better as a whole, but this album has some of my favorite songs. <br />\\"Venus\\" is a great opening track. Very subtle, perhaps a little monotonous, but I like the piano's chord progression. <br />\\"Cherry Blossom girl\\" acoustic guitar and electric drums, mixed with heliumized vocals.  <br />\\"Run\\" my favorite track. Toy piano sounds in the beginning; a rather dark track. <br /> <br />The songs kind of level off there. Like I said, they've done better, but this is listenable.
0307276902|1.0|DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!  IT IS A WASTE OF TIME SINCE IT IS ALL FAKE!!!!  What a jerk to right a book that would give false hopes to any recovering addicts.  JAMES FREY IS WORTHLESS!!!!!
B000059XUO|5.0|this movie is the perfect movie to bring your spirits up, have a good time with, draw various inspiration from it...etc. etc. <br />hell, a wcw wrestler named \\"sting\\" even dressed up as eric draven for his gimmick in the ring. whether your a fan of action, drama, romance, gothic, or just a plain movie with funny and deep quotes, then this is your movie. also, if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend break up with you or move away or someone dies or whatever, this movie is definately recommended to you. the movie is a revenge/love story...the dark atmosphere make it even more breath-taking. not to mention the soundtrack just kicks rump. this is the best comic/superhero movie i have seen. <br /> <br />can't rain all the time.
B00005JOII|5.0|... MATCH POINT illustrates the biological truth that a male is likely to be ruled by his gonads rather than good sense. That's why men are pigs.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris Walton, a tennis pro in early retirement who lands a gig teaching the game to society's upper crust at a poncy London club. There he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who invites him to his parents' elegant country estate. There, Chris meets Tom's sweet, beautiful sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and Tom's seductively gorgeous fianc&eacute;e Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a struggling actress from Colorado now trying break into London's acting scene. To make short the extended set-up to the plot's punchline, Chris and Chloe fall into a comfortable love relationship and wed, and the former is handed a cushy executive position in the company run by his father-in-law Alec (Brian Cox). This doesn't prevent Chris from having a tempestuous one-off roll in the hay (literally) with Nola in a sodden field on Alec's estate during a downpour. (It seemed to me disagreeably drippy, cold, and muddy work, but, hey, were talkin' Scarlett Johansson in a wet, clingy top here.) Tom and Nola subsequently break up and the former marries someone else, much to the relief of his mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), who never approved of Nola anyway. She's American, after all, and totally unsuitable. Anyway, Chris is now hormonally driven to begin a long-term affair with Nola, ultimately getting her preggers, while remaining in an increasingly frustrating marriage with sweet Chloe, who remains barren despite the couple's best efforts to conceive. Meanwhile, Nola refuses to have an abortion and stridently demands that Chris reveal the fact of their affair and her pregnancy to the loyal and loving Chloe, end his marriage, and come live with her. Effectively, this course of action would also put Chris out onto the street without a job. What's a poor fellow to do?<br /><br />I've revealed perhaps the first two-thirds of the plot but not really given anything away because, for heaven's sake, how often has this between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place situation been the subject of films and books?  So, at this point, I was willing to award MATCH POINT only three stars, despite the excellent acting performances all round and my willing admission that I too would have ruined my life and those of my loved ones to possess the luscious Nola. But, wait.<br /><br />The first scene sequence of the film has a tennis ball sailing back and forth over a net to the voiceover of the Walton character reminding the audience that Luck is the unacknowledged arbiter of our lives. The ball hits the top of the net, rebounds up several inches, and then falls. The scene fades to black before we see to which side of the net the ball descends and determine the good or bad fortune of the players.<br /><br />As we left the theater, my wife remarked that this is perhaps Woody Allen's best film. I agree for at least no other reason that Allen doesn't star in it. That petty jab aside, it's a brilliant and unsparing portrayal of the meltdown suffered by a man as a result of his own libidinous foolhardiness. In some sense, the film's conclusion may seem unsatisfactory in that justice and fairness aren't served, but that's due again to Luck, portrayed in a clever scene reminiscent of the first. In retrospect, Chris will be punished by his own mental demons. If I was the unsuspecting Chloe, I would have every reason to be afraid of their relationship's future.<br /><br />MATCH POINT is a first rate film, perhaps one of the year's ten best, much like 2004's CLOSER.plot but not really given anything away because, for heaven's sake, how often has this between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place situation been the subject of films and books?

0143034901|5.0|I dont often read fiction, but I picked this up on a recommendation from a family member, and I am glad that I did.  Hints of Umberto Eco jumped out at me as I read through the twists and turns that continued to surprise me throughout the book.  The character development was also quite interesting.  Fermin and his mannerisms; Daniel's adventures with girls and his association with Carax; all made for the best read I have had in quite some time.<br /><br />Booklovers will also enjoy the central role of the \\"book\\", which the entire plot revolves around.<br /><br />5 stars, and I look forward to reading more from Zafon.

0307276902|5.0|I have just finished reading this book by James Frey not knowing there was any contoversy.  <br />It is not the type of book I would normally read but after just a few lines I was hooked ( bad wording ) <br />This is the story of James Frey, the drug addict,the alcoholic and the criminal. This is a story all adults, all parents SHOULD read.. <br />James Frey comes around on a plane, covered in blood, and vomit with a hole in his face and missing 4 front teeth and has no idea how he arrived there... he walks out of a fancy rehab centre some time later a recovering drug addict and alcoholic and criminal.  <br />Along the way he meets fellow addicts who become his friends. Leonard, Lilly, Miles and all the other charactors appear genuine. James Frey has a manner and language that causes the reader to be in the same room. <br />Whether this is total fact or some fiction, James Frey has touched me.. <br />I thank him for that and wish him the best <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and was slightly disappointed when I learned of the discrepencies in this memoir.  However, after hearing all sides of the story, I believe the changes that Frey made were minute and insignificant.  The story is still real, believable, and it sells.
0553801503|5.0|I, like many of the other reviewers of this book, was put off buying it because of many of the negative reviews comparing it to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  Now that I have read AFFC, I have to laugh at the reviewers who have made this comparison. <br /> <br />First, Martin hasn't fallen into the trap of repeating paragraphs of story again and again as Jordan has.  Second, even when the story is not as fast paced (as was the case with some of the Brienne chapters) the story continued forward sufficiently that even in the Brienne chapters she actually made it somewhere and did something (which can't be said for Jordan).  Third, Martin has a way of getting to the psychology of the characters he writes about making them real; making them human.   <br /> <br />I have read many reviews that have complained about the fact that GRRM keeps getting us to like characters (namely the Starks) and then goes and kills them off.   <br /> <br />WAKE UP FOLKS!  IT'S REAL LIFE!  Frankly, that point alone was one of the reasons I loved \\"A Game of Thrones\\" as much as I did and have continued to read the series.  There was none of this, \\"The hero has to survive\\" nonsense that is found in so many high fantasy books nowadays (like the \\"Wheel of Time\\").  I've read the ones where the main character always survives and frankly I'm tired of the same old script.  The hero always just manages to get away, or someone just happens to be in the area to save the hero from the bad guys.   <br /> <br />This series has been refreshing and AFFC, though not perfect, is a lot better than most of the fantasy getting published these days.  If you don't like the main characters dying off, go read Paolini's \\"Eragon.\\"  You wont have to think at all as Paolini just leads you by the nose through the whole story and you wont have to use your mind any. <br />
B0001I55NS|4.0|I thought this movie was very engaging.  The acting by Paul Walker and the gal who played Kate, was highly marginal, but I could get past that.  Butler was fantastic, as usual.  There wasn't a dull moment, a little bit of everything, action, romance, history, sci-fi.  We gave it an 8 on a scale from 1 to 10.  I read the book afterward and thought it was awful, perhaps if I read the book first I would have thought the MOVIE was awful like many others, oh well. I highly recommend Timeline, the movie.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This was a great movie. Better tham the matrix? Im not going to make that call, thier both really good. But if you have seen the matrix ( and liked it ) this is just as good. I thoght Chritian bale was great. ( i saw this after i saw \\"batman Begins\\" and thought he was good in that too ) great movie, and great buy.
0440241588|2.0|\\"Read\\" this as an audiobook on the daily commute to work.  Kudos to the reader who renders each character in a distinct and engaging voice.  Shame on the author for this half-spun effort.  Delighted to learn (epilogue) he had such a wonderful time in Bologna.  Not at all delighted with his Frommer's-guide like narration -- and the endless beginner Italian lesson -- he incorporates throughout.  80% of this book was pure filler.  The remaining 20% did have the makings of a decent thriller.  Indeed, the story begins on a very intriguing note, and continues at an exciting pace.  The moment we land in Italy, though...Page after page of basic language discussion and tourist details.  Give me a break.  All this I could forgive had the book's ending remotely fulfilled the promise of its opening.  What began pretty intriguingly in the first chapter, completely petered out in the final chapter.  An utterly utterly lame ending.   <br /> <br />1 star to Grisham.  A second star to the audiobook reader (who, in fact, deserves more).  Glad I got this at the library.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Boycott Smallville purchases <br /> <br />The series may have started off nice and worthy of the legacy but the way that TPTB are headed with their vision of this Clark Kent and Lois Lane many of us diehard fans will be left dissapointed. Lets let the almighty dollar do it's work and lets vote with it by avoiding the purchase of Smallville products like the DVD's and other related items. <br /> <br />If at all possible try to return the sets you already have even if they are open. Make sure the retailer knows the reason is because you are becoming disenchanted by where the story is going and you wish to voice your opinion retroactively by withdrawing your financial support of the show. (You can always buy them again later when they get their act together, just as long as the point that you are trying to voice your opinion is heard) <br /> <br />Now you may think that as a comic fan or chlois fan you are only a small portion of the ratings pool that actually gives a damn if Clark is portrayed properly or Chlois happens but think about this: We may be a small segment of the ratings pool but we are the bulk of the fandom that buys the DVD's, the comics, the companion book tie-ins, go to the ComicCons/conventions, and will buy the future action figures/video games/and other ties in that are yet to come.  <br /> <br />In the end they will have to take a look and decide which would they rather make happy? The bulk of the ratings fans who tune in and sit and watch the series at home and view a few comercials, or the smaller fandom part that will spend the money long after the series is forgotten.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|almost all the ingredients to ensure a movie to be good are all included in this movie. i totally enjoyed this viewing experience. like spiderman series, giving these comics' characters with realistic emotions, love...that's why these movies were so good. the special effect, the graphics....wow!
6302787564|5.0|Joel Schumacher's 1992 movie \\"Falling Down\\" is a chillingly powerful film that seems to get often misinterpreted.  Don't get the wrong idea, there definitely IS substance to this movie--it's not just some kind of freak show.    Michael Douglas, in a spellbinding performance, plays William Foster, a man who totally collapses emotionally while stuck in traffic one morning.  He ditches his car, leaving it right in the middle of the roadway, and begins an on-foot trek 'home' through the streets of Los Angeles.  What follows is a day of extremely tempermental and violent behavior from Foster, lashing out against a Korean shop owner who 'won't make change', Latino gang members who accuse him of invading their territory, a fast food restaurant that's 'stopped serving breakfast', and a neo-Nazi gun shop owner who already has some frightening issues of his own.    With its story of a white man 'fighting back' against urban decay, \\"Falling Down\\" is similar to the 1970 film \\"Joe\\" (starring Peter Boyle).  A deeper peek though reveals \\"Falling Down\\" to be kind of a cross between \\"Five Easy Pieces\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\", both masterpieces in their own right--William Foster's wildly erratic and tempermental behavior strongly brings to mind the former's Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), while the good-guy-turned-violent reactionary element of Foster isn't too far off from the latter's Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro).    Michael Douglas is clearly the perfect actor for the role of William Foster.  Douglas' terrific knacks for subtlety and dry humor are key ingredients to making his character, despite all of his fits of violence, frighteningly sympathetic.  It never appears that Foster derives any amount of pleasure or satisfaction from his violent reactions--it's as if he thinks he is merely 'bringing justice' to the inadequacies of everyday life.    We learn that Foster's ultimate destination is to return to his ex-wife's home for his daughter's birthday.  We learn from the ex-wife (playedby Barbara Hershey) that she has a court order against him from seeing her or the daughter.  She admits that he never actually resorted to violence against her on the daughter, but that she \\"thinks he could\\".    Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, an about-to-retire cop.  Despite the fact that it's originally intended to be Prendergast's last day on the job, he becomes immersed in the trail being left by Foster.  The two finally encounter each other in the movie's powerful 'big climax'--by this time, Foster has definitely reached the point of insanity, or as he says in his own words a bit earlier on in the film, \\"past the point of no return\\".    Michael Douglas makes it seems as though this kind of devastating emotional collapse could easily happen to just about any 'average Joe', and that's where a great deal of the film's power lies.  \\"Falling Down\\" is a thought-provoking movie that really stays with you.
B00003CXBK|5.0|First off this movie is one of the best i have seen ( anime or not ) and its really not that violent. i really did'nt think the dubbed version was so bad. great animation and exilent story-line. if you liked \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or any other action adventer then most likly you like this too.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Super dumb and poorly shot, Constantine fails on so many levels. For one Keanu Reeves is miscast and his performance is rather dull. Keanu's delivery of his lines are so bad in certain points of the film that you are actually grinning your teeth at him for most of the film. Second the script is horribly written and the direction is so clunky that you are actually are staring at walls for certain scenes other than seeing the actor in front of you act.  The only thing in the film that is note worthy is Rachel Weisz `s performance and that's because she at least tries to bring a real sense of strong will and bravado to her role but outside of her game and too good to be in this film performance, the rest of the film is literally a disaster.   <br /> <br />Worth a look to see Rachel Weisz give another great performance but I suggest you rent a better film with her in it other than to waste your time with a movie that is really not as good as her performance. <br /> <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles have been and still are THE best live band, to prove that, sit back, relaxe for 3 1/2 hours of what is truely a treasure. Joe Walsh sober and on the mark of his life.

B000BNX3B4|1.0|what a shame! don't know how this lousy screenplay could be approved by the production, don't know how could this(these) screenplay writer(s) could find jobs in the movie industries. one of the worst movies viewed so far in 2006. it's shame that this wonderful actor, diane lane, always ended up in lousy movies, wasted her beauty and talents again and again, and now, so pitifully becomes older and older. it's just like steven seagal, i have to watch her every movie once released, even i'm so sure that almost all of their movies suck big time. what a horrible movie this must love dogs! terrible dialogues, plot, scenario, acting, directing, editing.....you name it, nothing is right. what a shame.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Nope, it ain't the blistering spy thriller of a Jason Bourne or James Bond and, well, it ain't all that thrilling, but there are layers and depth in this movie that hold it high above the tripe shown in the last couple of years.<br /><br />For a start, it's about something real. Le Carre confirm in a DVD extra interview, that he planned to make the central conflict something else but a friend convinced him to go for the pharmaceutical companies.<br /><br />Second, the book boggled Hollywood - Le Carre says in the same interview that the big studios turned it down because \\"African movies weren't in.\\" So the book went to a small producer who got a small director and it became a labor or love and it shows.<br /><br />Third, the depth of characters is great. Ralph Fienne's character hears his wife whisper about it being a \\"marriage of convenience\\", assumes their marriage is falling apart and when he investigates her death, hears her report where she talks about the pharmaceutical companies and government being in a marriage of convenience. He had mis-heard his wife, mis-judged their marriage. In an amazing scene, his wife wants to stop to help a woman who is walking with her child. Ralph Fiennes launches into a big speech about how they can't help them all. His wife claims \\"we can help this one person\\", but Ralph Fienne remains steadfast. Later, when his character has gone through a personal change, he tries to save a young girl by taking her on a plane. The pilot gives Ralph Fienne's character the same argument Ralph Fiennes had given his wife.<br /><br />This movie is about growth, awareness. It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, with great dialogue and pitch-perfect, thundering pacing. People who find it dull might head to other movies like Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo.
B00026L7O0|1.0|and i saw ishtar.  cinematography and music are excellent. acting and writing are awful, julianne moore achieving a new low. <br />However the graphic depiction of the macabre subject matter and the extraordinarily graphic murders are positively sickening.  One really should avoid this movie at all costs.  Those persons who are finding psychological insights or other redeeming social value in this movie should really take a long look in the mirror and/or schedule some much needed therapy.  It is without a doubt the most perverted and sickening movie I have ever seen.  The key word here is \\"sickening.\\"
B0009S4IHY|4.0|KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well-produced comedies to come around for a long time.  It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain.  But as in all good comedy there is also a message.<br /><br />Talented director/writer (with Tsang Kan Cheong)/star Stephen Chow has the whole concept of Kung Fu as entertainment down pat.  With the brilliant choreography of Yuen Wo Ping as partner, Chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals (Chow himself and his obese sidekick Chi Chung Lam) who will stop at nothing to become members of the Canton mafia Axe Gang. They blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife  to find someone to kill, as that is the only way they can join the Axe Gang. But this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs, why? - because they happen to be the home of some expert Kung Fu practitioners.  After some absurd events the Axe Gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprises.<br /><br />The choreography and setting parodies everything in the Hollywood repertoire: the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, High Noon antics, Busby Berkeley type staging, Keystone Cops zany shenanigans, Marital Arts films - name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original!  The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!) is a little masterwork of ancient Chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds, and the actors, when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences, just seem to be having the best time being silly.  For pure diversion and giggling entertainment, spend an evening in the  company of Stephen Chow and crew.  Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados!  Grady Harp, January 06
B0007TKNCY|5.0|This movie is definitely one of my favorites.  Cary Grant, as the straight man, and Katharine Hepburn, as the scatterbrained heiress, are absolutely hilarious in this film.  And they make it look so easy.  This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  I have to say though, that it's not for everyone.  Some people cannot stand this movie because they (especially Katharine Hepburn) talk so fast and he says it hurts his head to listen.  I think Hepburn has that effect on a lot of people, but I think she's great.  It's a shame that this movie was not more appreciated in its own time.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|_Amarantine_ is vintage Enya, crafted in the formula that first made her famous.  From the opening chords of \\"Less than a pearl,\\" this album held me captive the way nothing has since _Shepherd Moons_.    As a long-time Enya fan who would rather forget most of _A Day Without Rain_, I could not be more thrilled with _Amarantine_.  This CD does not have the same widespread commercial appeal, nor does it have a stealth pop hit waiting to break into the top 40, but it is a magical treat for those who fell in love with Enya's _Watermark_ or _Shepherd Moons_.    For this Enya fan, it has been a \\"long, long journey\\" from _Shepherd Moons_ to _Amarantine_, a journey where I occasionally wondered whether Enya had lost her way (_The Memory of Trees_) or worse (_A Day Without Rain_). With _Amarantine_, my heart is home, surrounded by Enya's heavenly voice and magical rhythms.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|This movie was so good you have to rent it for yourself. The story is great. Matt and Heath were great and funny. I think that all the little things about the fairy tales were perfect. All you out there who hate this movie it was great so there. Don't listen to them if you havent seen this movie yet. It's good. And it is very entertaining. I loved it when I saw it at the theatre. There may be some things that arent exactly perfect but who cares.I still love it. SO screw you guys I'm going home!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I bought the extended version of \\"Gladiator\\" on DVD, although I already have the widescreen signature edition and I never regretted it. Many of the deleted scenes those which I already knew from the signature edition and some additional ones were added. This additional footage is an absolute gain for the overall brilliant story line. There is also new bonus material on the second and third disc. All the documentaries provide an interesting insight into the making of the film.  <br />\\"Gladiator\\" is on second position among my all time favorite movies. The cast is outstanding. Russell Crowe's performance is absolutely brilliant. Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix are also perfectly chosen for their roles and too give a great performance, just to name a few. I have watched \\"Gladiator\\" countless times. After each viewing I could just watch it all over again. It's a masterpiece of its genre with the most magnificent and brilliant special effects I have ever seen. There are so many scenes which are pure joy to watch. The dialog and the score are pure \\"ear-candy\\". I am not a fan of Roman or Greek empire movies, but \\"Gladiator\\" is different from all the other old and new films about this period. There is something special in \\"Gladiator\\", something I have never seen before. Just as Maximus (Russell Crowe) says in the movie: \\"I'll give them something they have never seen before\\". <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've been a Madonna fan for 25 years, and this is my favorite CD of hers yet. I'm a hot glass artist and I've played it nonstop in my studio since I got it for Christmas. Her voice has never sounded better, the songs are both edgy and retro, and if it weren't dangerous around all that glass I'd be dancing my butt off to it every minute.

B000AP04FG|1.0|We waited to watch this movie on DVD, was excited to finally get to see it after all the publicity.  What a total disappointment! The only good thing about this movie was some of the action sequences.  The actors seemed like they just weren't into their roles...sort of like they were just putting in the time to get their paychecks.  The whole movie just seemed FLAT and cardboard.  Pitt seemed to just be walking through the part...Jolie was stiff and not believable.  We wanted to love this movie, but, sadly, it was just a waste of our time and money.  This one will be in the discount bins very soon...so if you must spend your money on it...be patient for it will be in the 2 for $10 soon!!!
B000C3H4M2|2.0|Wow, this disc is full of extras, particularly the DVD side.  Too bad the DVD side completely locks up my DVD player.  To the point that the buttons on the front don't even work, from trying to open the unit to pushing the button to turn it off.  Same thing with the Talking Heads 77 DVD.  I'm hearing the same from others who bought it, so you might want to wait until they're offering a better batch.
0446577383|1.0|I have never read a Baldacci book before but this was the selection chosen by the Book Club that I am a member of.  It became quickly obvious what Baldacci thought of this country and our war in Iraq. If you hold to the notion that this country is evil and that the terrorists are just poor misguided souls that have been pushed to the extreme by this country, then you might enjoy reading this book. I, personally, found it distasteful and offensive. I do not appreciate a writer who foists his political viewpoints off on a purchasing public in the guise of fiction.
6304383827|5.0|I rate \\"Emma\\" 5-stars. Gwyneth Paltrow plays an upper=class member from the Gentry (as opposed to the nobility), who plays matchmaker to another young lady, who is considered to be socially inferior to her, but overlooks this because she's not a snob, so she tries to help this young woman find a suitable suitor from the Gentry. Eventually, \\"Emma\\" ends up getting closer to one of her male friends and realizes that she has feelings for him and follows her heart.<br /><br />It's a good movie for anyone, who is interested by the British class system and loves a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Buy it or rent it--you'll be glad you did!
B00004W199|5.0|\\"I don't belong in the world....something separates me from other people\\" says Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) in perhaps the most lyrical horror film ever made. It is the unlikely 1962 masterpiece \\"Carnival of Souls\\" which philosophically fleshes out the premise of \\"Twilight Zone's\\" \\"The Hitch Hiker\\" episode (January 1960). The one where Inger Stevens (as Nan Adams) plays a young woman driving cross country who keeps passing the \\"same\\" man standing by the side of the road. Its masterpiece quality was unlikely because it was the low budget first feature film of Herk Harvey (a director of educational short films), using actors with little acting for the camera experience, and with a story structure adapted to fit sets and locations to which Harvey had free access.<br /><br />One of these locations was an organ factory. This not only dictated the film's unique and beautiful score but it suggested a profession for the main character (Mary Henry), a church organist. With this they really got lucky because it brings in many disturbing religious images and undertones. A church organist seemingly possessed by her instrument, as her playing alternates between the spiritual and the profane, deeply disturbs her wrapped-too-tight\\" minister who would have benefited from Pollyanna's advice about the \\"rejoicing texts\\". The organ factory also serves nicely for a Carol Reed-type angular crane shot with the huge organ pipes in the foreground and the diminutive figure of Hilligoss far below. This early shot sets the existential tone for what will follow. Finally, there is the moment when she is alone on the highway and her radio will only pick up organ music.<br /><br />The other location is the abandoned Saltair Pavilion outside Salt Lake City. Much of the story takes place here as Mary Henry is mysteriously drawn to the place. Watch for this shot of her in front of a promotional poster for the Pavilion, on the poster is a look-alike blonde with the same hairstyle. Since the late 19th century, Saltair had been a family swimming/recreational facility built out into the Great Salt Lake. The huge pavilion looks like a strange cross between an Eastern Orthodox church and an Arabian Nights palace. The falling lake level doomed the swimming feature but the place operated as an amusement park until abandoned five years before the filming of \\"Carnival of Souls\\". At the time of filming the actual pealing paint, broken glass, collapsed staircases, and general disorder made for a better location than even the best production designer could have constructed. It also works well from a \\"language of film\\" symbolic perspective as Mary is shown walking through an unnatural circular passage, which reinforces other subtles off-kilter elements that occur throughout the film.<br /><br />While much of the film's texture was the happy result of the low budget necessity of using these available locations, the casting of Hilligoss worked out even better. Probably cast because she was the most beautiful actress available for the price, Harvey hit a home run because she brings exactly the right sterile and distanced qualities that the film needs in its main character. Hilligoss might have been an acting-for-the-camera novice but she had extensive stage experience. Harvey was able to get an extraordinary nonverbal performance from her, unexpectedly taking the film deep into the concept of human alienation. Much like \\"The Incredible Shinking Man\\", with its existential theme of separation from society, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" also transcends its genre and explores the isolation of someone who feels they no longer belong. And like \\"TISM\\", the resolution is the realization that loss of identity is freedom, that the infinite and the infinitesimal are the same, that you are not alone because you are a part of something bigger.<br /><br />The two occasions where Mary Henry suddenly becomes invisible to everyone are much more vivid because Hilligoss is so beautiful. Unlike a person of average appearance, an especially beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone. For such a person the phenomenon of sudden invisibility would be far more jarring than for those who are used to not being noticed in the passing crowd.<br /><br />For budget reasons, egg white was used on the faces of the \\"dead\\" cast members, including Harvey himself who plays Mary's recurring apparition. This has an especially eerie effect with black and white film and would be adopted a few years later by George Romero for \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".<br /><br />Educational film veteran Frances Feist plays Mary's cherubic landlady and John Linden plays her slimy (on the make) neighbor. Both are excellent, and the disjointed and stilted acting style of their scenes with Hilligoss will remind many viewers of David Lynch's \\"Eraserhead\\".<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.lly beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone.

0740748475|3.0|I love this strip and I was very excited to see it collected completely in a lovely boxed set. I have only one fault with the item but it is a big one. For a set of this nature and for this price, you would think the publishers could have spent a few extra bucks and given the thing a proper binding! I've read through the collection only twice and the spine is already cracked on volume one and a page has actually come out! How much could a real stitched binding have added to the price? I plan to send my books off to Southern Binding and have them sewn. It will cost me about $30 but I believe it will be well worth it in the long run. Still, I'd rather have paid a few more buck up front.

6302517028|5.0|Okay, \\"who you gonna call?\\" --\\"ghostbusters!\\" This is a fun film for children and adults alike. It's about these ghostbusters, who go around the streets of NY hunting and keeping ghosts in a box.<br /><br />The movie is funny; especially, if you are interested in sci-fi and mythological ghosts.<br /><br />The end is a riot with a huge \\"stay puft\\" marshmallow man, who walks the streets of NY, no doubt, they got the idea to have him walking down the streets of NY from \\"Godzilla,\\" but in lieu of a dinosaur, he's a gigantic marshmallow.<br /><br />*(Suitable for children ages 10-adult).*
B00008WT5M|4.0|This is the first AC/DC album I've ever owned,  and while it may be the only one I own,  I may have to add more of their catalogue to my collection. <br /> <br />Razor's Edge was released in 1990,  and went platinum thereafter.  Two hits were produced by this record,  \\"Money Talks\\" and \\"Thunderstuck\\".  Both really strong rock songs.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect with AC/DC,  seeing as how prior to this purchase,  I had only heard two or three of their hits.  In short,  I am very impressed with The Razor's Edge.  It combines that signature squeal of Brian Johnson,  with the classic stop-beat sound that the band is known for.  It's straightforward,  but it's high quality rock music,  by some of the best in rock n' roll.   <br /> <br />The Razor's Edge starts off strong with the best song on the album,  \\"Thunderstruck\\", which,  as noted before,  was one of the album's two hits.  The album exhibits Johnson's awesomely distinct \\"Uncle Scrooge\\" singing style,  which is actually disliked by some,  but more times than not,  the rock fans I know agree that AC/DC has done a lot for music,  and Brian's voice is really what makes them most unique.   <br /> <br />There are twelve tracks on the album,  and throughout,  it doesn't dip in quality at any point.  Yes,  some songs are better than others,  but they all sort of revolve around a central norm.  And surprisingly,  unlike other artists,  this doesn't work to AC/DC's detriment.  The Razor's Edge doesn't pull any tricks to surprise the listener,  it just does it's job and creates a very enjoyable rock experience.   <br /> <br />The two songs I most recommend are \\"Money Talks\\",  and especially \\"Thunderstruck\\".  In short,  catchy stuff,  very catchy stuff.  And I'm definitely impressed.  I wouldn't call myself a full fledged AC/DC fan,  rather,  I'm more of a casual towards these guys.  They don't really blow me away,  but they didn't need to.   <br /> <br />If you like rock music,  pick up The Razor's Edge,  you shouldn't be dissapointed.
0312330537|3.0|When I started to read Shantaram, I absolutely hated it. I cursed my two friends who were reading the book at the same time who were all praises for the novel. For me, it was an exceptionally slow read, too many descriptions and what I thought to be too cliche a look at the world.. about the poorest slum dwellers being the happiest yada yada yada. Yet, there was something about the story that made me stick with it and continue reading it. Finally the pace picked up and a funny thing happened... I looked forward to finding out what happened next, in Lin's weird and twisted existance.  <br />Whether you hate the book, like I did at the start, or love it, you have to admire Lin for the life that he has led and somehow still managed to maintain his sanity. He is a man who has lived with slum dwellers, villagers, murderers and mafioso, and still has managed to see beauty and love in everyone he met. Moreover, he was a great friend to all and treated each person with respect and dignity. If that isn't poetry, I don't know what is.  <br />I gave the book three stars because of its slow begining and mind-numbing descriptions. For all his conviction, i still think the author went into way too much detail into his own thoughts and philosophies on life. Yet, if you like me don't like the start too much, I would suggest you persevere on because the book will provide you with enough twists and turns at the end to transform it into a real page turner.  <br />Would I buy the sequel? Most definitely!
B00005JOFO|5.0|I think reviews have been summed up nicely, so I will add some observations. <br />Let me first state that I live in the bible belt, Oklahoma.  Imagine my surprise when I viewed this film with my partner on a Monday afternoon in a fairly full house.  One look around and I discovered that we were not amongst a crowd of gay males as I had expected to be, but a very diverse audience.  This included 2 very straight looking cowboy types with a woman. <br />I point out all of this, because it appears as though people have now started to come to their senses and give movies a chance to move them reguardless of their content. <br />Now for my impression of the film itself.   <br />I could not wait to see it from the moment I found out about it. <br />A special about it on the LOGO network made me want to see it even more. I almost made a trip to Dallas because I didn't want to wait for wide release. <br />Well, it finally came here, I saw it and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. <br />I have rarely been moved by a story, either in film or in print, as much as I was moved by this movie.  I left the theater on the edge of tears which came later on my trip home, and it was all I could think about for days. <br />Now, today, reading these reviews, some of those tears are back. I am amazed at the number of men who have written glowing reviews and I suspect many of them are straight. <br />Please tell all of your friends to open their minds and hearts and see this film, I think many of them will be surprised. <br />And one final observation:  As I was leaving the theater, a rather long line had formed, and talking later to a friend of mine, I discovered that was the case when he saw it on a Sunday. <br />This renewed my faith in people to give movies a chance reguardless of the possible controversial content. Perhaps this will usher in a new era of thought provoking movies.  Don't get me wrong, I love movies that don't take much thought but are alot of fun, but lets have more movies like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. <br />It will be sad if the Academy fails to give it it's due.
6300184269|5.0|This film is hilarious!<br /><br />It's about two guys, who create a woman from their computer and everything goes awry!<br /><br />She's like a 20th century genie, who grants these two high school kids' wishes, but the wishes make them realize that materials and being popular aren't always what it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those older than 13.
B00005J6T1|5.0|\\"Madonna \\"is one of those albums that you'll probably get made fun of for liking if you're a man, but if you're a mature person then this won't matter. \\"Madonna\\" is just an incredibly creative and fun album as every song here is fantastic. Madonna may just be a good singer and not actually a musician, but her voice is amazing and very appealing - only those who are prejudiced against pop music won't like it. The lyrics here are very well-written and fun to pay attention to, although they can be simple at times (see the hit \\"Lucky Star\\"). I'm not even sure how to describe what it sounds like - it's definitely 80's with a little fantasy feel to it, but other than that it doesn't sound like anything else I've ever heard. It's all very original, creative and fun to listen to. It was all very new and cutting edge at the time, and after listening to \\"Madonna\\" one can certainly see why she would become the world's biggest female star (as well as one of the most influential). The two grievances one could possibly have about Madonna is her lack of real musical talent as well as her guilty pleasure nature, but those with an open mind won't care about either of those. Pop music fans will definitely LOVE this album! Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Lucky Star\\"  \\"Borderline\\"  \\"Physical Attraction\\"  the rest is great, too!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I was thrilled to pick up the newest Priest record, and it delivered just what I thought it would- a cross between their older songs mixed with the rage of 'Painkiller'. What I like most about this band is the variety they show over their whole catalog, and even individual releases. This is one of their most eclectic yet. My favorite is 'Deal With the Devil'. Great groove, good chorus, and a long, shredding lead break by both K.K. and Glenn. 'Worth Fighting For' also stood out for me, being a bit understated, with inspired vocals. I was pleased to see it on their recent 'Rising in the East' DVD. There are some slower numbers that pad the length a little bit but are still strong. 'Revolution' is sing-songy and just not up to Priest standards.    One misstep, and everyone seems to agree, is 'Loch Ness'. This clocks in as the longest Priest track ever, I believe, and it has their trademark sound. But can anyone take it seriously? Doesn't most of the world regard the Loch Ness monster as a hoax-slash-tourist trap by some otherwise sleepy Scottish burg? How come no one has a definitive picture of it? How does it sustain life and procreate? These questions haunt me, readers, and sadly go unanswered in the song.     This DVD edition is worth picking up because of the interviews and newer live performance, and because the price difference should be negligible. The packaging is cool, although not of terribly high quality. The pages and spine of the book started pulling away from each other very quickly.     Overall, this is a memorable release from one of our favorite bands, and I hope they keep filling us full of metal for years to come.
0800187881|5.0|I give this movie 5-stars because it's heart-felt, amusing, delightful and has some poignant scenes.<br /><br />The movie is about a middle-aged woman played by Barbra Streisand, an excellent actress & singer, who has difficulty attracting a suitor because she's considered an ugly duckling as opposed to her sister played by the the talented actress, in her own right, Mimi Rogers and their mother, played by the talented actress, Lauren Bacall.<br /><br />Barbra Streisand's character is a successful professor at the Ivy-league university, Columbia, who decides to go on a blind date because her sister is afraid that she will end up a miserable spinster.<br /><br />Barbra Streisand ends up meeting another professor played by Jeff Bridges, also a good actor, who teaches calculus at Columbia like Barbra's character--they just teach different subjects.<br /><br />Anyhow, they both end up hitting it off and decide to get married because they think they can remain platonic yet married friends and realize that you can't have a successful marriage without romantic love involved.<br /><br />The main reason that it's sad is because poor Barbra's character is viewed as an ugly duckling, who can't get a date and lives in the shadow of her beautiful mother and sister. Of course she gets a date with a man, but he's not physically attracted to her and he has this theory that good friends can make a marriage work without the physical attraction being involved.<br /><br />It's a really poignant film, which makes you realize--man or woman that not only is beauty only skin deep, but just being attractive isn't enough to make you happy, that is, if you're not happy being yourself.<br /><br />Barbra's character realizes that she has more to offer even if her character is deemed the ugly duckling. Something that her sister and mother never really seem to fully realize.<br /><br />They're all a great cast, but it's a sad movie with a happy ending where...<br /><br />Well, I will just let you see the film for yourself!<br /><br />*(Due to mature adult themes, I would only recommend this to viewers 18 and older.)*I will just let you see the film for yourself! <br /> <br />*(Due to mature adult themes, I would only recommend this to viewers 18 and older.)* <br /> <br /> <br />

630018403X|5.0|This movie is about a jock,a rich popular kid, a loner/rebel, a girl whose ignored by everyone, and a geek.<br /><br />The rick kid is played by Molly Ringwald, whose parents are always away on some exotic vacation, whose mother is alcoholic and goes completely ignored.<br /><br />The jock is played by Emilio Estevez, who is popular, but can never please his dad no matter how hard he tries at being the best athlete.<br /><br />There's the lonely, \\"crazy\\" girl played by Ally Sheedy, who goes ignored by everyone and her parents, too.<br /><br />There's the so-called geek, who makes straight-A's, and is always under constant pressure like the jock to be perfect.<br /><br />Finally, there's the loner/rebel, who is physically and verbally abused by his dad played by Judd Nelson.<br /><br />All of these kids from diverse backgrounds have Saturday detention from the morning until the afternoon and learn from each other, while sitting in the library all day how much they really have in common; despite, their diverse social backgrounds.<br /><br />They all realize that they're ignored or mistreated to some extent by their parents and always being expected to be the best with the exception of Ally Sheedy's character, who is only in detention because \\"I didn't have anything better to do.\\"<br /><br />I am sure that any American student, who's either currently in high school, or has already graduated from high school can definintely relate to these stereotypical characters.<br /><br />The movie is excellent and while it seems that the plot is not deep because it's not that thought-provoking, the music is great and the film is awesome!<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone, at least, 14 and above because unless you're in high school, or have already graduated from high school, then you're not going to be able to appreciate the problems these teens must face at the hands of their peer groups and parents, alike.

B000BYA5GO|4.0|\\"Lord of War\\" begins by following a bullet from the moment it is manufactured to the point at which it is fired and kills somebody on the other side of the globe.  I think it is obvious that is what is going to be the payoff to the opening sequence, but I also think that you know the victim is going to be instantly recognizable as an innocent, because clearly selling arms is a bad thing.  But the point of this 2005 movie from writer-director Andrew Niccol is that selling arms is also big business.  How big he saves for the final punch line of the film, which makes sure nobody finishes watching \\"Lord of War\\" without getting the point.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant who discovers that his gift in this world is selling arms (a.k.a. \\"gun running\\").  He teams up with his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), until they are paid off one time with cocaine and a kilo is appropriated for personal use.  Pursuing Yuri is Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an American agent working with INTERPOL, whose Achilles heel is that he will not break the law, although you have to admire his interpretation of holding a suspect in custody for 24 hours before charging them.  Yuri always knows exactly where he stand vis-a-vis the law, but I must saw that he is perfectly polite when yanking Valentine's chain.  Yuri's own Achilles heel would be his wife, the former Ava Fontaine (Bridget Monyahan), a super model that he is able to wine and dine into becoming his wife.  She remains oblivious to what he does, but if Yuri has to choose between his wife and his work, you are inclined to think he would go with the latter.  After all, the fall of the Soviet Union and the arms bonanza that creates in the former republics is a lot more important to Yuri than the fact his son has started walking.<br /><br />However, there are two people who seem to pose a bigger threat to Yuri.  One is Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), the king of the arms dealers, who sells not for the money but to dictate the balance of power in the world by picking sides.  Yuri refuses to pick sides.  Yuri maintains he is oblivious to what the guns, grenades, tanks and other military hardware are ultimately used for by the people who buy them (the same cannot be said for Vitaly).  Weisz wants to squash Yuri, but whether it is for economic or ideological reasons is not clear.  The other threat is one of Yuri's biggest customers, Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker), the dictator of Liberia, who is crazy enough that he might blow Yuri away on a whim with a gun that has not been sold yet (or by sending him a couple of local women from a country that has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world).  Since the film focuses so much on Yuri's ride, you know that there is going to have to be a fall.  The question is, how far and how hard?<br /><br />Niccol wrote and directed \\"S1mOne\\" and \\"Gattaca,\\" and also wrote \\"The Terminal\\" and \\"The Truman Show,\\" so clearly there is always some important point to be made in his films. \\"Lord of War\\" is one that defines a problem without attempting to offer a solution.  Indeed, the punch line at the end of this one, which is reinforced by the facts related before the end titles, makes it clear no solution is possible.  Yuri's final words put a spin on what has transpired, but you have to think people in the audience are just focusing on the horror and the madness of it all.  Then again, Cage's performance makes you root for Yuri despite the fact that what he is doing is bad, which makes him a bad person.<br /><br />The evil of being a \\"Lord of War\\" is the overriding point of the film and that judgment is supposed to overcome some of the problems with the narrative.  Yuri does a lot of the work in the field by himself, which seems a tad dangerous to me, but I guess part of the attraction here is that he is glib enough to survive living on the razor's edge.  But I really do not understand why he wants his brother with him ever again once he clearly becomes a liability.  Again, it is Cage's performance that forgives a lot of these concerns and Niccol does have a payoff for the big set up.  The results are not great, but certainly well worth watching.becomes a liability.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|Well, I've been waiting awhile for an extended release of this film, ever since seeing the \\"longer\\" version on TV.  The Universal Home Video site says that both the theatrical version, and a version running 40 minutes longer will be included.  Both versions are listed as coming in full 5.1 Dolby Digital, as well as both versions coming in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  I didn't find anything telling whether or not Virgina Madsen's narration would be replaced with the male from the TV versions, or what specific scenes would be reintroduced.
B00005JOII|5.0|MATCH POINT is considered by some to be a departure for Woody Allen, due largely to its setting and its few oddities that can sometimes be an annoying Allen trademark. Yet it is also a well acted and well developed film that would be reminiscent for some of films such as ANNIE HALL. In order to know for sure, a person has to see it to decide and it's certainly worth seeing.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Chris Wilton, and Irish born tennis player who realizes there's only so far his game will take him, so he takes a job as a tennis pro hoping to make a connection with London's upper class. His charm and ability ensure this will happen. He meets a client Tom Hewett, the son of a powerful business leader. Wilton marries Tom's sister, endears himself to his in-laws, and has a passionate affair with Nola, Tom's fianc&eacute; then later ex-girlfriend. Much of the film focuses on the ways in which Wilton goes to great lengths to cover up his affair.<br /><br />The actors fit their roles well. Chris Wilton is played masterfully by Irish born Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Rhys Meyers has the look of someone who would fit into British upper class circles, and he comes across less as an imposter and more as a climber. Rhys Meyers, who is familiar to many who saw the film BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, again an Irish lad trying to make it in England, albeit in very different circles, demonstrates he's a believable and versatile actor. Scarlet Johansson plays the American actress Nola, likewise gives a phenomenal performance. The Hewett Family: Brian Cox as father Alec, Penelope Wilton as mother Eleanor, Mathew Goode as Tom and Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife Chloe seem like British aristocrats, oblivious to all that is happening round them, yet believable too. Perhaps one of the films strengths is the fact that the Hewetts are oblivious to Chris' scheming and climbing, and that Chris is not a character whose controlled by ambition as much as his desire not to loose the good life he's created for himself.<br /><br />My guess is that since MATCH POINT was nominated for several Golden Globe Awards and will likely be nominated for Academy Awards too, people will take notice of this film. One of our local newspapers praised MATCH POINT because it was a Woody Allen film that was not typical Allen fare. Another paper praised it because it is so Woody Allen, but set in London rather than New York. The long and the short of it is, chances are you'll enjoy this film whether you like Woody Allen or not.d for himself. <br /> <br />My guess is that since MATCH POINT was nominated for several Golden Globe Awards and will likely be nominated for Academy Awards too, people will take notice of this film.

B00005JOFO|5.0|The cast and crew of Brokeback Mountain produced a magnificent film about \\"real\\" life and love in all of its diversity.  If I have one criticism, it would be its lack of background in terms of providing insight into Jack Twist's life prior to his meeting Ennis Del Mar.  It also did not fully define why Ennis' wife did not confront him with her knowledge of his secret prior to their getting divorced, and also did not fully explore Jack's strange and distant relationship with his wife either.  However, already being two and one-half hours long, perhaps it just was not possible to fill in those holes and still retain a coherent film in the process.  Yes, Heath Ledger's Ennis was deep and believable, but Jake Gyllenhal was magnificent as Jack Twist who was brave enough to want to follow his heart and say hell and be damned to the whole world.  It wrenched my heart to know that after 20 years, it was only death that allowed Jack Twist to \\"...find a way to quit...\\" Ennis Del Mar.
B0007OCG56|2.0|Spanglish really disappointed me. The acting was fantastic all the way through.  And the plot could have been as great as the acting was if only Brooks hadn't written it with such a raging hard on and a guilty concience.  The real focus of the plot is that of a white married man's crush on the Mexican, family maid. Touchy subject, but that's why it could have been rife with realism and tension. C'mon, it is not difficult to understand why a beautiful, exotic woman thrown into the home of an unhappy marriage might cause the man to feel divided and excited. What is difficult to understand, however, is how a married relationship can overcome this event. <br />     Unfortunately, one half of the plot is spent trying to convince us that Mr. Clascy is a good guy and the other half drooling, ad nauseum , over what a virtuous madonna, Flor, the maid is. (kinda racist, no?) The plucky bit with the daughter writing about her mom sticks out as a red herring. Don't be fooled: This is not a family film! It is a complete downer dedicated to masterbating over the unattainable. <br />       Which is why it's unbeleivable that Flor should be attracted to Mr. Clascy. Not that Adam Sandler isn't charming, it's just that it comes as a shock to see a character who has only been depicted as a saint suddenly acting like a human during a greuling, almost love scene. <br />      The greatest failure of Spanglish is that the wife is oh so conveniently demonized right when she should be redeemed. Mrs. Clascy's neurosis, caused by white American life, is an interesting contrast to the merits of Flor. But since her much needed character developement is all but forfeited in favor of bolstering more excuse for Mr. Clascy's emotional affair the plot becomes too imbalanced to acheive poignance. The sensitivity found in Sideways, American Beauty, and the Icicle Storm is not present in Spanglish. What the audience needed was to understand the flaws of each character enough to have sympathy for them. No sympathy for Mrs. Clascy means we feel no concern for the marriage. So, what is binding Mr. Clascy to the marriage? Brooks point is that there is only duty. What a downer!  <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|Id like 2 write pages and pages about this album, telling ya exactly how good it is...but, i think the reviews b4 this 1 pretty much cover it. This vibe created by this album is unique, RZA's beats are so far ahead of their time is unreal, the way that the Clan come togeather on this album is pure magic!!! Some people dont quite get their style... i didnt realise exactly how good this album was until my friend gave it 2 me on a tape which i put in my car. i had heard the album played before this and although i liked it, it took almost a month of playing the tape nonstop until it hit me... any other tape playing non-stop for 4 weeks would have driven me insane!! NOT this one though, iv probably listeden to the album right through over 100 times!!!!!IT STAYS FRESH!! If u have read all the other reviews on this album and u havent been convinced to buy it i hope this changes ur mind. With Hip-Hop being in the pathetic state that its in these days and new origonal artists being few and far between it is albums like this that remind you what rap is really about. If you consider yourself a real hip-hop fan, without this album you are faker than 50!!!!

In heaven Susie is able to see everything and she learns things about her family members that she never knew while she was on earth. She also watches the guy that killed her. This book is full of humor, hope, and suspense.
0385335482|5.0|this is my favorite book, without a doubt. i read all 4 shopaholic books and if there was a 5th one I'd read that too. Becky Bloomwood is the most lovable, adorable, hysterical character from any chick-lit book out there. if you haven't read this book yet, stop wasting time and read it because you're missing out. and if you happen to have a shopping habit that has gone a teeny bit out of control, well you'll appreciate this book even more.
0679746048|5.0|Susanna Kaysen wrote this book about her life while she checked herself into a mental hospital for a couple of years. This book is very interesting. Giving full detail of the other girls committed to the hospital, nurses, and other workers that helped out at the hospital. This book gives you a feel of what life would be like inside a mental hospital and how the other women and nurses interact with each other. <br />The theme of this book is about finding ones self. Do not be discouraged by the title of this book. Guys can read this and end up liking the book. This book may help someone recovering from depression and insanity. Susanna is very courageous for committing herself, she realized that she needed help, and this book delivers her journey along the way. Through the good times, like getting ice cream, and the hard times, such as death. <br />
0553584537|2.0|I'm a huge Lisa Gardner fan, but I thought that this was by far her worst book.<br /><br />Bobby was an idiot that I couldn't care less about. He did stupid things and thought with his other head. Catherine was just creepy, as were the rest of her family. The bad guy was nothing but a caricature. I can honestly say that by the time I got to the end, the only thing I cared about was the puppy surviving and finding a home.<br /><br />I hope her next book is better.
0596007124|5.0|I am reviewing books as texts for continuing education text book.  I found it to be both effective and enjoyable to read.  Topics were presented in fun but most importantly accessible way, which invited the reader to go deeper into the topic.  Design Patterns can be a very challenging to discuss and an academic approach is as much a barrier as most programmers short attention span.  This book can serve as a gateway to the subject for both the casual reader as well as an excellent text for an introductory course on Design Patterns.  I have and continue to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an introduction to Design Patterns.
0393035158|5.0|Publisher's Weekly must be intimidated by pressure groups or someone to make such a dumb statement. I saw Sam Harris on C-Span and he was articulate and intellectually impressive. Neither he nor his book are \\"simplistic.\\" Irrational thinkers may believe he is misguided. Publisher's Weekly should be more sophisticated. Bravo to Harris for this well-reasoned, courageous book.
B0000019PA|5.0|I am not kidding.  If you don't own this album, but you are reading this, you should get it.  Because it means you have an interest in music out of the mainstream, and Neutral Milk Hotel is possibly the best indy band ever. <br /> <br />Sadly, Jeff Mangum only made two albums under this name with these musicians (you can also get some great live CD's that I also recommend).  And this album will blow you away, it's like a cacophonous, operatic symphony of eclectic delights.  The group employs a huge variety of instruments, from zithers to horns to god-knows-what, but it all works, nearly every song a flowing, soaring masterpiece. <br /> <br />I've only worn out a couple of CD's in my life (I didn't know it was possible).  This is one of them.  And it is the CD I would take to a desert island if I only could take one.
B00005JLSE|5.0|If you're not really into musicals, you should still give \\"Chicago\\" a chance.  I love this movie!  Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fantastic.  The dancing is incredible, especially the Cell Block Tango.  Queen Latifah, Taye Diggs and Richard Gere round out an awesome cast.  It's dazzling and should keep you hooked.  I saw the stage version years ago and the movie compares wonderfully (although the movie eliminated one song...but I can overlook that).  Thoroughly enjoyable and I highly recommend it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Some of you may be skeptical about this DVD.  The cover art is, frankly, rather unwelcoming, and it has no big stars to reassure you that there will be *something* that you'll certainly enjoy.   <br /> <br />But here's plain speaking.  This is amazing just on a dramatic level.  It made me claw myself in anticipation in places (I'm occasionally high-strung.  Shut up.).  The acting is powerful, and it has layer upon layer of meaning and emotion as one rewatches.  The relationships even in the short span of this film are all fluid, mutable, and it draws you in as you try to understand how there's any possible way for this to end well, or even not-too-horribly.  The arc of Malcolm Reynold's character is a beautiful one, from anti-hero to hero, unwillingly, brought by belief and faith in the people he flies with.  This is a movie about trust, love and loyalty, a movie whose depth of emotion takes your breath away. <br /> <br />Buy it.  Now.
B0002STNQ2|5.0|\\"Prey\\" by Michael Crichton. Prey is a fictional book like most of the books Crichton has written. One of his best sellers is \\"The Lost World\\" <br /> In the beginning of the story Jack, a caring father who ha been fired from his job, has to take care of his family while his wife Julia works 24/7. As the times passes Jack finds his wife acting very strange she refuses to tell him what is going on at work and she would argue with him all the time.  Strange things start to happen around Jack first his baby is taken to the emergency room for unknown reasons. Later on the story Jack get a job offer by his best friend who happens to work where Julia works. Once he gets there he discovers what hides behind the curtain of lies.  <br />  <br /> \\"Prey\\" may pick up a slow paste but once you get passed the first few pages you cant stop reading, it will keep you intense with suspense to the end. <br />
B00005OWEG|5.0|I started to write a review of the entire thing, but realized that the main issue here is the new material that has been added, so I will concentrate on that. Let me just say that I was blown away when I first saw this movie many years ago from the opening montage of Martin Sheen's character suffering a breakdown to \\"The End\\" by the Doors, punctuated by muted blasts of helicopter rotor blades. The only disapointment in the rest of the film for me was that I could predict which characters would die and which wouldn't; the black guys would die first and Willard and the surfer dude would survive because they were the hero and the harmless insane guy, respectively. As soon as Chef said 'I don't care where I die, as long as it ain't here\\", well, you knew he was toast.     Most of the new scenes aren't really necessary and the first time you see them they do seem excessively over the top. But after a while it starts to blend in and flow. Kind of like adding a couple new movements to a familiar symphony. I believe that Coppola was trying to show war as being absurd to the point of parody...and beyond. A bad acid trip. A nightmare. And even nightmares have oddly funny moments. Part of the disconnect from reality that is the (cliche alert) insanity of war. Like the scene with the priest giving communion wearing a flak vest and Coppola's cameo appearance as a war documentary director, yelling \\"Don't look at the camera!\\". Perfect.    The plantation scene was nice because it explained where Clean's body went, along with giving the historical context of the colonialist line of march in SE Asia. It didn't have to run so long though, and the scene where Willard gets some from the French MILF wasn't really needed. But its dreamlike quality blended in with the growing nightmare to come. This was the last pleasant interlude of the dream. The Bunny scene and the surfboard-stealing were comic relief, and both scenes were pretty much expendable.    By far the best addition was Brando'sdeadpan-sounding reading of some CIA propaganda outta Newsweek magazine and the New York Times. Some things never change! While the little kids posing and taunting the emaciated Willard added a perfectly macabre touch. This is an important scene, one of the most important in the entire film and I don't know why it got cut from the original. This is the ultimate indictment from Kurtz of his accusers, and it is so subtly delievered that it doesn't fully hit you until much later. Of course, there are many scenes that stay with you long after you see them here and that is the mark of a classic. But this scene will haunt you not only because of what it means in the context of the storyline, but in the relevance that it still has now.    All in all, this is a true masterpiece and a landmark achievement. Any other war movie comes in a distant second. And this just may be the final, if not best-loved, version of it.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Ok, so as you can see this movie has Christian Bale in it. Everyone now knows him as Batman. But take Batman and make him more... extreme and you got John Preston. This movie is completely 1984 mixed with Farenheit 451 and Matrix. The extreme poltical messages are mixed in with what we are losing in society today, and the incredible fight scenes. Yes, they do dodge bullets... but through a realistic martial arts form... not the bending of reality. Between amazing fight scenes, and deep rooted messages, this is a highly enjoyable humanistic look at what society can become and how change can be good.
B0000VD04M|5.0|If you've ever watched a really, totally awful film, and asked yourself WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE COULD POSSIBLY THINK THIS GARBAGE IS A GOOD IDEA? -- Well, THIS film ... this totally, wonderfully, brilliant film ... will explain it all to you!<br /><br />Johnny Depp is great as Ed Wood, but Martin Landau steals every scene he is in as Bela Lugosi. Don't miss it!
0596007124|5.0|I heard a lot about this book and finally decided to buy & see whats so good about this one. I am very much impressed with this one! <br /> <br />I purchased many books on the same subject but most of them are complicated & some are over-complicated!! (Of course, the subject is not an easy one). But these authors have really done a remarkable job in bringing the gist of design patterns in a very simplified & interesting manner!! <br /> <br />If \\"reaching to audience\\" is a true measure for an author's capabilities - these folks get more than 100%!! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to everyone starting to learn about this subject!!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|The first time I saw The Money Pit, I was in the middle of a construction fiasco. I laughed through every minute of this Tom Hanks movie. Be advised -- if you are a veteran of any HOME IMPROVEMENT -- this will be like laughing after a good scare in a horror film.(What a great release of those tensions!)
0810945797|5.0|My favorite movie of all time is \\"The Dark Crystal\\", and I just had to get the book to complete the collection. This book goes in depth of the world of the dark crystal. Even though the artwork is beautiful, the story behind it is just as unique. This book talks about the pod people, the gelfling, and most of all the uru and the skesis. Everything from languages to physics to cultures are discussed in this book. Even though there aren't alot of pictures of the gelfling, to me they're the most beautiful pictures in the entire book. It's somewhat sad that brian froud's artwork is somewhat underrated. If you definatley love the movie like I do, this is a must have for you!
6305041156|5.0|Akira Kurosawa was the greatest Japanese director ever.  Many of his films went on to be corner stones of modern film making.  One of his films, The Hidden Fortress, was remade into a small film called Star Wars. <br /> <br />Kurosawa adapted two Shakespeare plays to Samurai films.  The first was Throne of Blood which is based on Macbeth and this one is his adaptation of King Lear.  King Lear is a tragedy.  Lear had no sons but three daughters.  Rather than waiting for his death to give his kingdom to an heir, he decides to split his kingdom in three and give one to each of his daughters.  Regan and Goneril both greedily accept his offer but Cordelia doesn't want to disrespect the natural order.  Lear cannot understand this and casts Cordelia out.  The two other daughters conspire against their father and his power.  This creates civil war and with every Shakespearean tragedy all involved must die. <br /> <br />Kurosawa kept with the storyline except there was no way that Lord Hidetora could give the land to daughters so he created sons.  But the sons were dominated by their wives. <br /> <br />The war scenes are some of the greatest ever filmed.  They are poetry in motion.  When I first saw the film I was amazed by these scenes.  I told everyone just watch the film, you don't need to read the subtitles to understand it.  The beauty of the film is breathtaking. <br /> <br />Every so often there is a Director's film.  That is a film that the visuals are more important than the dialogue.  This is definitely one of these films.  Of course, at Oscar time these films should win the Director award but never do.  (I do want to say that the dialogue and acting is great especially Meiko Harada as the evil daughter in law). <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br /> <br />THIS IS FOR THE STANDARD EDITION NOT THE CRITERION OR MASTERWORKS EDITIONS.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I just heard Human Touch for 30 seconds and man, THE BOSS just rocks your ass. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN JUST ROCKS SO HARD. Glory Days and Born in the USA are great too. So as the Rising. LISTEN TO THIS. DEFINATELY 5 STARS.
B00004RF9B|5.0|In the fifties the public had an insatiable appetite for space movies and monsters. Most features produced were low-budget 'B'-movies and producers were using the genre simply as a cash-cow. Every now and again came the exception to the rule... Forbidden Planet is one of these... a stellar cast, high productions values, a fabulous script, a large budget, filmed in color, and cutting edge graphics for the day! 'Robbie' the robot was so well done, that for many years, most people actually thought it was mechanical rather than an actor in a suit.    Anne Francis and Walter Pidgeon were the headliners but the supporting cast members would soon become household names themselves. The story in a nutshell... A space ship arrives at planet Altair 4 to find out what happened to colonists sent there twenty years before. Morbius (Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Francis) are the only survivors and Morbius tries to warn the ship away. The ship lands and is met by Robbie and taken to Morbius' house. The ship is delayed from taking off and during the night some valuable equipment is destroyed. The captain (Leslie Neilsen), his exec officer (Jack Kelly) and the doc (Warren Stevens) pay Morbius another visit, thinking he may know more than he's telling. Morbius winds up giving the trio a tour of a vast underground complex he has found left by the Krell, who occupied the planet 250,000 years before. Morbius is confused that on the eve of the Krell's greatest discovery, the mental creation and transport of matter to any point on the planet, the whole population seems to have been destroyed in a single night! These sets are very impressive even by todays standards. Morbius shows the trio a machine that he hooked himself up to that permanently doubled his already genius IQ but nearly killed him. A crewmember is torn apart inside the ship and the captain and doc return to the house to demand answers. While the captain persues his love interest, Altaira, doc takes the brainboost and before he dies tells the captain about monsters from the 'id' (the subconscious). Its is only after more mayhem that the captain finally puts together that Morbius is sending out monsters from his id and once again confronts Morbius, who eventually confronts his own deamons and lies dying in the lab. He has the captain throw a switch that sets an irreversable chain reaction off in the planet's core. The ship takes off and the planet is destroyed.    This movie is a must-have for your 'vintage' collection.
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier is a great book. It has a lot of detail and makes the reader really feel the vibe of the characters. The theme to this book is not to judge a book by the cover. There is more to someone than just what people say they are. Chevalier makes the book easy to follow. Greit, the main character and a mid-teen, has to help out her families' money issues and has to work as a maid for a wealthy family. She is to work for a prosperous painter's family across town. At first the family is suspicious of her, because maid were known to steal and to be sneaky. They pay her weekly and let her visit her family on Sundays. After months of working, and barely ever seeing the master, Johannes, of the house, she starts to see him more and more.  She will do small jobs for him such as getting colors from a store so he can mix his paints. She is sent to his studio to clean the dust and to keep things fresh. She gets to see what he is working on and she even moves around the set up for a painting he was working on. He doesn't punish her or fire her, but ask why, and likes her answer. He then has her help with the paints and sometimes even asks for her advice. Johannes sees she is more than just a sneaky maid. A rich man offers Johannes money for a painting. Johannes and Greit keep this secret until it slips out. Griet then loses her job. When she is grown up and has a family of her own, she is called back to the hosue, which she worked at, so long ago. Finally some unfinished business is taken care of.  <br />There is a movie made after this book with the same title. The movie does not follow the book completely but points from the book are made. Important parts in the book were not mentioned in the movie.  <br />
B000BKDOB6|5.0|I bought this set because Horses needed to be in my 'Living in the Past' collection, but the live recording on CD2 blew me away. Patti Smith just sounds fantastic 30 years after; just as out there, angry, and insightful (\\"Our Generation\\" gave us George Bush!).<br /><br />Just plain friggin' fantastic!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I cannot really say much more than what others have already said about this soundtrack, except that it is absolutely amazing. Every single track brings you back to the movie. After I saw Brokeback Mountain, I seriously could not stop thinking about it for days, and then when I bought the soundtrack, it made me fall in love with the movie even more (if that is even possible.) I even cried when I listened to some of the tracks, like Riding Horses and The Wings, because the tragedy of the story just comes rushing back into your mind the minute you play the cd. I am not even a country fan, and it is probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I highly recommend this soundtrack for both non-country lovers and country listeners alike.
068987474X|5.0|Highly recommended. If you want to understand your man better, or are wondering if he is in to you, read this book. It is an easy read. One of my friends (who is dating the cad anyway) says the book is quite blunt. Perhaps, especially if you are trying to be in a relationship with someone who isn't in to you.  <br />This book just might help you get the backbone you need to end a bad or going nowhere relationship
B000BEZQ18|5.0|What I like most about this CD is that, although it certainly conjures up images of the movie when I listen to it, the music on the whole is abstract enough that I can enjoy many listens without feeling like I am following the movie each time. The tunes and singing are quite beautiful and the CD has a powerful emotional feel throughout it.<br /><br />What is also interesting is that, if you listen to the words, put them in the context of the movie, and then go see the movie, especially for a second time, there are a lot of interesting symbols to connect together. I wouldn't say that this is a fun CD as such. It's more like a nice little transfiguration. :-)
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I was sitting at home one night watching one of the various music video channels, and something beautiful happened. A song i'd never heard in my life came on, from a group i've never heard of, it was \\"Hoppipolla\\". At First I was drawn in by the music, and sitting there frozen staring at the screen was a video clip unlike anything i'd ever seen. The combination of the two was enough to almost envoke tears. Amazing. Now that I have the album when I listen to it, especially through headphones at night before going to sleep, I just float off to another world. If I was dying, i'd like to listen to this music while I was so that I would be rid of any fear, and be resting in complete and utter peace.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|once again imdb.com has removed the usa and europe release dates... apparently it isn't coming to us after all...
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Really solid effort. Great bargain for the price (2 full discs, not one and a bonus dvd no one uses). <br />For those bitching about not being able to burn this - who cares. Enough. I hate the ipod crew of kids.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is, overall, one of my favorite opera recordings, and one of my favorite operas too. All of the principals are in top form - Caball ravishing as the slave Li, Pavarotti the best Calaf I've ever heard (just listen to his famous third act aria and you'll know what I mean), and Sutherland a most surprising Turandot -, and the rest of the parts are well covered too. Mehta does an amazing job conducting the LPO, bringing out all the details of the lush and exuberant orchestration Puccini made for his last operatic work. Powerful and sublime at the same time. Highly recommended.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Well, many people would say that Enigma is backround music or novelty music or whatever but I have to disagree. Many of the songs on here are too powerful and surley have too much emotion to be simply called backround music. With that said this cd has 3 of my favorite Enigma songs which include: \\"Push the Limits\\", \\"Gravity of Love\\", and Traces(Light and Weight). The rest of the album is very good also these are just the songs that really stick out to me. All in all I would be very quick to recommend this cd to those with open minds and fans of real music.
B00005JOQ9|3.0|Wearing the chevron of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth has created one of the first gore-filled horror films to hit mainstream theatres in recent memory. HOSTEL, the latest film from the writer/director of CABIN FEVER (2002), has an advertising campaign that makes it come across as a filmed abattoir on steroids. <br /> <br />For those who have asked, I've summarized HOSTEL as follows: <br /> <br />1) Take the most gore-filled, pain-filled, dismemberment-filled scene you can remember that makes you flinch just by thinking about it. (I, for instance, use that 5 minute scene from the end of the disappointing AUDITION (1995).) Now, repeat that for about 40 minutes. <br /> <br />2) Now take an hour of AMERICAN PIE (1999) and drop it in the front. In hindsight, I probably should have told everyone to take EUROTRIP (2004) instead. <br /> <br />HOSTEL was an intensely gory film, which was poorly written, very very poorly acted, and ultimately only moderately executed. <br /> <br />In fairness, the premise was actually superb. I don't want to give too much away, but the premise was reasonably believable, and while not an entirely novel concept, it was given a fresh spin. <br /> <br />However, the story was structured in the worst possible way. The first hour was nothing more than pointless nudity (and I don't even mean entertaining, I just mean utterly boring) and cheap humor. Sitting through the first half was tedious and had us wondering, \\"are we in the right film? THIS is the great horror film that's been hyped?\\" <br /> <br />The film then takes a drastic right turn and delves headfirst into gore. Explicit gore. And lots of it. For about 40 minutes. <br /> <br />I can only assume that when writing the film, Roth tried to go for maximum contrast: really funny and lighthearted, and then, WHAM, what the Hell is happening?! <br /> <br />The failure lies in both the pacing of the first half (insufferably long, light on suspense, total lack of atmostphere), and the horribly writtencharacters. In many horror films, the \\"protagonists\\" are annoying, and you're just waiting for the Big Bad to kill them. Here, they're so annoying, that you just get bored waiting for it to happen. <br /> <br />The gore, however, is delightfully extreme, if you're into that sort of thing. Lots of puncturing, slicing, laceration, dismemberment. Good times, for those who enjoy. But that make it a good horror film? No. No, it doesn't. <br /> <br />A good gore scene will make the average person wince. 20 gore scenes in succession just kind of dulls the senses. If not used tastefully (see SAW 2 (2005)), gore for gore's sake just becomes another load of special effects. <br /> <br />On the bright side, the gore miraculously managed to escape an NC-17 for reasons that I'll never understand. With the more liberal R rating, and a limited release, HOSTEL will likely be considered a commercial success. This is good, for two reasons: <br /> <br />1) Maybe HOSTEL 2 will be to HOSTEL what SAW 2 was to SAW: a dramatic improvement in writing and ambience that greatly enhances the rewatching of the original. <br /> <br />2) A commercial success for HOSTEL could conceivably drive the industry away from these atrocious PG-13 teeny slasher flicks, and back towards some more serious, disturbing, dark material. Look: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and quite frankly I likely never will. <br /> <br />Do I recommend HOSTEL? Not really. If gore really does it for you, have at it. Otherwise, just watch AMERICAN PIE and the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br />
B0000508U6|1.0|That's it. Coldplay sucks, end of story. Maybe it's me but I just can't stand this. Coldplay is probably the dullest band I've ever heard. I mean it makes 50 Cent's 'The Massacre' sound like Public Enemy's 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back' for godsake!!! Why the hell people think this lame excuse of making intelligent and honest music is good? Chris Martin is a godawful vocalist. The musicianship is lame. The lyrics are senseless. This it sounds more \\"innocent\\" than all the other mainstream shi t doesn't make it any better. I'd rather listen to myself throwing up instead of this pile of dogs hit. Plus they completely ripped off Radiohead (which I'm not a big fan of either, but I have respect for them). How can you call this original? Have you never heard about Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Meshuggah or Opeth? I honestly can't say anything good about this waste of plastic.    Do yourself a favor and buy some Opeth (start with Damnation if you are not yet into metal), Iron Maiden, Public Enemy, Dream Theater (Images and Words is the best option), Snoop Doggy Dogg (not Snoop Dogg), Led Zeppelin, Ice Cube, Deep Purple, Depeche Mode etc for GOOD music.    BURN IN HELL, CHRIS MARTIN >:)
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Supposedly, this was delayed from last year because David Lynch decided that he wanted to  participate in this version.  Lynch's participation will mean that this is not one of the 'Universal' versions from the past, but a version that Lynch himself has overseen.   <br /> <br />Let us hope so.  A more satisfying version has been posited from before the release of the original theatrical film.  Alot of the early promotional material showed much material from the book that never made the original edit.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|This remix CD is awesome.  It brings new life to songs that were just \\"eh\\" (especially Touch of My Hand, Early Mornin') and rejuvenates the best.  Here's a track-by-track breakdown: <br /> <br />1. Toxic (Reconstruction Mix) 6/5: This is the best remix of Toxic I've ever heard.  A pounding bass line and great synth match up to Britney's vocals and make one of her best songs even better.  You won't find another one like this. <br /> <br />2. Me Against the Music 5/5: This remix gives the song a rock edge that wasn't found on the original.  It pounds its way through and everything seems to come together a bit more than the original version.  Madonna's vocals aren't as pronounced, which is a great thing as well. <br /> <br />3. Touch of My Hand (Hamel Remix) 6/5: One of In the Zone's weakest songs, Touch of My Hand strived to be something bigger than it was.  But it just wasn't catchy.  This remix speeds things up and changes the song completely.  Using many of the original elements, it sounds like it belongs on the original album.  The vocals are mixed up a bit as well.  An excellent mix. <br /> <br />4. Breathe on Me 4/5: This remix isn't anything too spectacular.  The other remix by the same guy was featured on the GH bonus disc, which was really LOOOOOOONG and boring.  This one's a bit faster, but isn't much different from the original version.  A good mix, but could have been much better. <br /> <br />5. I'm a Slave 4 U (Slavedriver Mix) 6/5: One of the other best remixes.  It's a total reworking of Slave, with a pounding bassline, great new instrumentals and slightly faster vocals.  A truly great mix.  At just 5 minutes, you'll wish it was longer.   <br /> <br />6. And Then We Kiss (Junkie XL Mix) 5/5: While the only version of the song heard, this song is actually really good.  A much better one than Someday, this song plays out really well.  What the original sounded like is anyone's guess, but this one is definitely a good start. <br /> <br />7. Everytime (Valentin Mix) 4/5: Not one of my favorite Everytime mixes (see the better Hi-Bias mix) it just sounds harsh and it doesn't match up to the vocals like it should.  The instruments are a bit too loud and drown out her voice a bit.   <br /> <br />8. Someday (Remix) 3/5: I've never cared for this song much, and the remix isn't much better.  While I believe it sounds better than the original, the faster beat just isn't enough to make it awesome. <br /> <br />9. Early Mornin' 6/5: This mix has totally changed the song.  What was once annoying and always skipped has become a must-hear.  The funky guitar always playing in the background really drives the song forward, making it catchy and something you can actually listen to. <br /> <br />10. Baby One More Time (Ospina Mix) 3/5: I've never found a good remix of this song, and this definitely isn't one.  It's quite disappointing actually.  I have gotten used to it but I wish that it wasn't trying to be so funky.  Just a straight remix would be better. <br /> <br />11. Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know 6/5: This remix gave this song new life.  While I found the original version slightly annoying and forced, this made it fun and enjoyable.  It's an 8-minute song but doesn't feel like it.  One of my favorites. <br /> <br />The album is great, but could have been better with the inclusion of some more remixes, such as Stronger, Oops!, Do Somethin', Sometimes, etc.  Overall it's a great CD and you won't be disappointed.  Get it!!! <br />

Well the spare parts kid turns 13 and decides to sue her parents for medical independency, so that SHE can decide whether or not she wants to give her sister her own kidney. <br /> <br />its a really difficult topic. it also includes a love story between the lawyers which is hot. i really HATED the mother though. <br /> <br />but, and i won't give it away. but the \\"ENDING\\" was an escape. she couldn't SOLVE the problem or show which horrible solution would happen. she jumped ship!!! this conclusion doesn't answer the problem it runs from it. shame, shame on you!!! what a coward!!! you should have chosen a side instead of flaking out!!!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I stumbled onto Sufjan Stevens after downloading an MP3 of Casimir Pulaski Day, and I haven't been disappointed yet. The evocative melodies, the folksy rhythms, and playful lyrics all come together in a highly impressionistic portrait that extends far beyond the bounds of Illinois.  It is a pleasure to hear a literate musician evoke such memories as well as inspire new ones.
0671688782|5.0|This book was quite amazing, my son recovered from autism (which was induced by a vacuum extracted birth and broken skull)...once he started feeling better, he would go back into autistic episodes which we later found out through holding time and orgonomy treatment, that he was angry at me the mother.  Within the course of six months he went through feelings of rage and resentment regarding his birth, circumcision and the way I mothered him during his early childhood (I was a christian at the time and the church gave me all these James Dobson books and schedule books about withholding food and cuddling from your child.  Many christians advocated \\"spanking\\" and rejection as the means to control \\"my strong willed child\\" (we did not know he was autistic).  I know that my rejection of him caused him to go further into whatever problems he had from birth.  Holding time and orgonomy saved our entire family (I had a baby that was born at home but still suffered from inadequate bonding with me-this was made evident by his only wanting Daddy and always pushing me away).  I do believe that the holding that Dr. Welch recommends is inadequate without orgonomy.  The child must be able to scream and physically get the trauma out of the body by kicking and hitting a pillow or bed.  If anything Holding opens the door to truth and contact between parent and child...and yes, if the parent is angry or hostile toward the child...or even feels those emotions, the holding will back fire.  So, what worked for me is me the Mother, hitting and kicking my anger out before I held my child.  Many time this allowed me to really contact my child in his eyes and even cry.  My children all appreciated this sense of realness and we are experiencing the most wonderful relationship now...Children really want to forgive, they are always there waiting for us-to meet them-honestly.  This is what I wrote my own book on....I hope soon it will be available with this one.  Good luck on re-bonding-it is wellworth it. <br />Aurore <br />
074325144X|5.0|...just the first 4 chapters, where the author outlines the physiological and psychological differences between his Eastern-philosophy-based \\"chi running\\" versus the conventional Western \\"power running\\" model is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Long before I read this book, I had already been leaning in the same direction as I continue my Zen meditation practice (going on 6 years now) and having recently gotten back into running several months ago.  I was already striving to focus on mental as well as physical relaxation as my main objective in running, trying to keep my shoulders/traps down, head properly aligned, relaxed hands, running from my hara (\\"dan tien\\" in Chinese, = the chakra about 2 inches below the belly button), minimizing unnecessary strain/effort, and really FEELING the ground beneath my feet.  With this sort if improvised \\"Zen\\" approach I already noticed the lack of shin splints and general sense of excruciating exertion that I used to experience while running in high school and college...running became relaxing rather than stressful and tedious!<br /><br />This book connects a lot of those dots, reinforcing but also expanding on many of those technique points, and mercifully does so with a relative economy of self-help psychobabble though there are the inevitable anecdotal testimonials here and there.  I was just happy that this was not yet another corny motivational pep talk (\\"you can do it, just believe in yourself and train train train, rah rah rah!\\") type of book. There are plentiful photos which are mostly useful, and the format of the book is fairly easy to navigate through.<br /><br />I have not had a chance to actually try many of the body-awareness drills and exercises (am hoping to take one of his workshops to have them demonstrated to me in person) but still found most of the book very helpful and insightful.  Might just get the DVD instead...<br /><br />*** FOR ALL NEW RUNNERS: along with this book I'd recommend going to a dedicated running shop (and I don't mean \\"Foot Locker\\" mall chains) to get your feet looked at and buy a really good pair of running shoes, which should go for 80-100 bucks.  Later on you can order replacement shoes online and save a little money but the expertise of such a shop in choosing the right type and size of shoes is priceless.  Also a pair of specialized running socks (8-15 bucks, Thorlo for example) is an excellent investment.  I ran with the wrong type and size of shoes for years, and when I finally took a friend's advice to go to a running shop it really made a huge difference.  (BTW, the running shop is also where I first saw this book!)

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|The new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" just seems to go from strength to strength; it has garnered both critical success and high ratings, and it's music is of no less quality than its storytelling and its visual effects.  To begin with, the music is memorable.  Some of the music, such as \\"A Good Lighter\\", and \\"Wander My Friends\\", is hauntingly beautiful, and you will find yourself humming it over and over again.  It sticks in your head.  Some of it, such as \\"Passacaglia\\" and \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\" is sublime.  This is music of great quality by ANY standard, and it is incredibly good for a television series.<br /><br />The second thing about this music is that it comes as such as a refreshing change after a long, dry spell of lifeless, bland TV sci fi music, to which we have been treated since \\"Star Trek: the Next Generation\\".  A few years after ST:TNG debuted, I realized one day how colorless the music was.  The original \\"Star Trek\\" had a memorable score.  There was music perfectly tailored to every mood: serious, lighthearted, humorous, suspenseful, bold, etc.  Anyone familiar with the original series of \\"Star Trek\\" will recognize the music from it almost instantly.  This is because the music was catchy, and it perfectly suited the mood of each episode and scene in which it was used.  But try to remember a single piece of music from \\"The Next Generation\\" (apart from the opening title, which was, after all, just the recycled main title theme from \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\") and you may find yourself hard pressed to do so.  I myself cannot.  TNG ran for seven years, and yet I cannot remember a single piece of music from its entire run.  I learned many years later that it had been made a deliberate policy NOT to use music that was in any way striking.  Apparently, this was thought to be a distraction from the story and dialogue.  What followed was years of bland, dull \\"aural wallpaper\\", as one critic put it (another term used was \\"mumble music\\").  Other shows, such as \\"Babylon 5\\" and \\"Farscape\\" may not have made it a deliberate policy to make the score as lifeless as possible, but they also somehow failed to achieve much, musically speaking, whatever their other qualities.<br /><br />With the \\"Battlestar Galactica: Season One\\" soundtrack, viewers are FINALLY treated to music of real quality.  It truly surpasses anything in scif fi television, or indeed ANY television that has come before.  It is, just as the original series \\"Star Trek\\" music was, dramatic and memorable, and perfectly tailored to each scene; but it is far more grand, and far more eclectic in its style.  This it what happens when you get a really talented composer, and give him broad leeway to exploit his talent.<br /><br />The \\"Battlestar Galactica: Season One\\" soundtrack is simply superb.  I cannot remember any other series with music this good.  Other series may have had catchy, memorable theme songs, some more so than this show.  But no other show has ever featured such a high quality score for the scenes which play after the opening credits have finished rolling.  this is GREAT stuff!  My hat is off to Bear McCreary.abylon 5\\" and \\"Farscape\\" may not have made it a deliberate policy to make the score as lifeless as possible, but they also somehow failed to achieve much, musically speaking, whatever their other qualities.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|I will not understand the glowing reviews of this album!  Am I the only one here who thinks this thing is a piece of mindless crap (even for a dance record!)  I've heard all of these beats and melodies before, in the early 90's.  There is nothing merely original or real here.  It's dance pappy-crap and it's a sad excuse for a Madonna record.  Monotonous, boring, and extremely shallow lyrics.  Does anyone agree with me?
B000C65Z1G|4.0|The first thing I'd like to stress is this movie is not for everyone.  It is very slow-paced.  But this is not a negative. There is a story to tell.  The movie starts with Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes, meeting his wife-to-be Tessa, excellently played by Rachel Weisz, while giving a speech at a conference.  Tessa is frustrated by the whole speech issue and she makes her objections so loudly that the rest of the journalists and reporters leave the room.  This leaves Tessa and Justin all alone.  After introducing themselves to each other and Tessa apologizing for being rude, it is predictable that they fall for each other.   <br /> <br />The mood shifts when things start to go awry.  Tessa becomes involved in some political issues that she keeps well-hidden from Justin.  As the movie goes along, you kind of get the impression that Tessa is having an affair.  You'll have to watch for yourself to see if this is the case.   <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, this movie moves along at a slow pace. But the acting is very good and the plot is very good.
B000AIZ8WM|4.0|from start to finish this album delivers one thing and one thing only: Atreyu with some testicular fortitude. <br /> <br />this album is pretty cliche with its screamo/metal riffs, but delivers what most bands in the scene cant, determination. <br /> <br />this band has talent and is determined, and you can tell on the album. check it out.
B000E8N690|5.0|This movie is definitely the best movie. You can't go wrong with this dvd. The story of John and June is phenominal. With Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's chemistry being electrified on screen, you get a sense of real love by their characters.
0307276902|1.0|The further I got into this book the more uncomfortable I became with its non-fiction status.  I was annoyed by the lack of punctuation and the author's tendency to repeat a line or word over and over again like an eighth grade student trying to fill up space on a 1,000 word essay.  I believe the author thinks it is poetic.  I find it annoying, annoying, annoying... As I soldiered on through this \\"memoir\\", more and more of the details seemed unrealistic.  I won't give away any plot points but, some of his claims are more worthy of a superhero than a wasted junky on the verge of death. My personal opinion is that the book doesn't ring true because it is not true. Shortly after I finished it, the story broke.  The website \\"Smoking Gun\\" claim to have conclusive evidence proving this book to be, at the most, a complete fabrication and, at the least, a fictionalized and heavily embellished memoir. I vote for the former and would like to add that, as a piece of fiction, it is not worth the paper it's written on. The thing that disturbs me most is that people who might otherwise stand a chance of being saved from drug abuse might believe this is a legitimate way to handle their addiction.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest post-modern books of all time.  The book is halarious, and makes fun of all sorts of politics and religion.  But in the end, \\"Snowdens seceret\\" reveals great spiritual truth.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Rob Halford returns to the band and Judas Priest is back with a classic!! Judas Priest returns to the formula that made Painkiller a classic.  Judas Rising gets the album off to a fast start and this album is great from beginning to end and this is a classic and showcases that heavy metal is making a come back and this has to be the comeback record of 2005.  Now all we need is Guns N' Roses to be the comeback record of 2006 when Chinese Democracy gets released in March.  Heavy metal is back and better than ever.  Check out this record- Angel of Retribution is a masterpiece and one of the best metal albums since Metallica's Black Album. <br />
B00008PW2D|1.0|The show's worst season, and the same high price as the previous ones, but for only EIGHT episodes! And notice how the posted product info claims it is \\"540 minutes\\"? That's either a convenient misprint or an outright lie; it should read 240 minutes (8 x 30 min., which it does on the box). Then, for the final Season 6, the corporate money-grubbers split it up into two overpriced \\"parts,\\" probably because they realized that that particular cash-cow was now coming to an end and they'd best milk it for all it's worth. HBO=AOL/Time-Warner, of course. Nice way to treat your fans, very nice.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's Ten is a classic album and one of the best albums to tbe released in the 90s- but is not the best metal album in the last twenty years. That is open for debate.  There's Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction, Skid Row's Slave To the Grind, Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power, Pantera's Far Beyond Driven, Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood, Guns N' Roses- Use Your Illusion I & II and Metallica's the Black Album.  Pearl Jam's Ten was a #1 album and sold millions of records and produced #1 rock tracks in Jeremy, Even Flow, Black and Alive.  Pearl Jam's ten is a classic album and one of the best albums of the 90s. Let's not forget Anthrax- Sound of white noise. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's Ten is an essential album- but there are better albums. Metallica's Black Album gets my vote for the ultimate album from the 90s. <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The implications of chaos theory (the theory that individual events can have countless unpredictable consequences)are intelligently explored in this highly watchable but ultimately depressing sci-fi movie.<br /><br />In recent years hollywood has spent huge amounts of blockbuster dollars examining the potential horrors of genetic predestination, this movie warns that the opposite view - the fantasy that individuals are made through their interactions with others in society, could be just as nightmarish for our notions of self-identity. There is also a rather iffy pro-abortion message that can be read into the plot - the happiness of the community and in particular the central character's mother can only be obtained by that character never having been born - he was after all 'never meant to be'. Nethertheless, a well made film that is sure to get any intelligent film buff thinking.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's Nevermind is revolutionary and started the grunge metal scene.  Nirvana's Nevermind was not their first album. Nirvana had a college following with their Bleach album in 1989 and it was not until late 1991 that Nirvana found success with the #1 single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on the Hot 100 singles. I was shocked when \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit topped the Hot 100 singles chart.  \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" even found a place on pop radio.  It is not, however, the most important metal albums of the 90s.  I would give that honor to Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction, Skid Row's Slave To the Grind, Metallica's Black Album and Guns N' Roses epic- Use Your Illusion I & II. <br /> <br />Nirvana is a one-hit wonder with \\"Smells LIke Teen Spirit\\", but their album \\"Nevermind\\" sold millions of records. <br /> <br />Nirvana could be considered over-rated- but the band started grunge metal. <br /> <br />Nevermind is an important album- but not the best metal album of all-time.   <br /> <br />Metallica's Black Album is the ultimate album from the 90s. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|and reading Michael Acuna's fine review of it, I'm convinced there is little more that I could say.  Sad and lovely, poignant and bold, the film shows the unique crafting that Ang Lee provokes from the cinematographers, actors and musicians he works with.  There are very few directors today that can make a moment on film as thought and emotion provoking as the scene of Ennis' and Jack's reunion....or the moment when Jack's mom finally meets the love she knew he had....or the moment when Ennis decides to stop hiding from life in his work, and agrees to attend his daughter's wedding.  Simply beautiful.<br /><br />5 stars, more if it were possible.
B000002JR8|5.0|Far Beyond Driven is perhaps one of the heaviest metal albums released in the 90s and it's aggressive and loud. Pantera created a masterpiece here with Far Beyond Driven and is one of the best albums released in the 90s. In 1994, this album debuted at #1 on Billboard's 200 Albums and sold millions of records.  It is one of Pantera's most successful albums.  It is one of the best metal albums ever recorded and a must-have for every Pantera fan. <br />

It seems that just about every time one turns on the radio its one whining, nasally tone deaf \\"singer\\" after another. Not here, though-- We actually have some fun, get up and go music that doesn't make you feel like you should be braiding your underarm hair and swaying to \\"Kumbaya\\" in your head! Nothing too serious, but also alot of fun. \\"Basket Case\\" is very catchy and you can't help but turn up the volume when it comes on. <br />Way to go, Green Day--Keep it up!
B000002IQW|5.0|In 1991, Skid Row landed #1 on the Billboard 200 albums with Slave to the Grind and this album is one of the hardest metal albums of all-time.  Second only to Metallica's Black Album and Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction.  Nirvana found success with Nevermind, a multi-million selling album and yet Nirvana was a one hit wonder.  Nirvana created grunge metal and they were the pioneers for bands like Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots. Skid Row's \\"Monkey Business\\" was a #1 video on Muchmusic and Slave to the Grind was a darker heavier single. Even the ballads were more bleaker with \\"Wasted Time\\" about the evils of drug addiction. \\"In a darkened room\\" is a great song and \\"Quicksand Jesus\\" is another classic ballad from Skid Row. <br /> <br />Poison, Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Warrant and Skid are the best bands from the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br />Nirvana was revolutionary but their success was short-lived and #1 single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a classic but Nirvana is a one-hit wonder. <br /> <br />Skid Row's Slave To The Grind ranks as one of the best metal albums of all-time. <br /> <br />However, Metallica's Black Album is the landmark metal album and still influences artists today in 2006. <br />

Well some of my friends are always giving me recommendations for new musik, and one day this silly looking guy with long greasy hair and a beer gut said I should look into this Pantera album if i wanted good guitar musik with a hard edge!!  Even though I never saw them on MTV, TRL or herd their musik on the radio I still gave them a chance!!  Wow, talk about noisy filth with no substance, this Pantera band is Panterrible, LOL!!!  Haha!!  The guitar player just strums fast without playing any memorbale hooks and I hope that wammy-bar wankery isn't passing for solo's, cuz its annoying to listen to!!  The vocalist just growls on about how much he hates everything and how their band is gonna take over the world...yeah right buddy, no one will take you guys serious!!  The bassist and drumber can't stay in time with each other for anything, they need to practice.  Hopefully the guitar player practices some too, maybe he can get better and play good memorable guitar musik!!  If you want to hear bands with GREAT guitar players, buy any album from KoRn, Hawthorne Heights, Good Charlotte, Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Green Day, Papa Roach, Atreyu, Death Cab For Cutie, Reliant K, All American Rejects and the hip-hop medal god, KIDD ROCK!!!  forget Pantera, their nothing compared to these awesome bands!!  Go Bengals!!  Who-Dey!!!
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row had a winning formula with this album and showcases Sebastian Bach's vocals at its best and this group found success in the late 80s- but not the same level as Poison, Motley Crue and Guns N' Roses.  Skid Row's Slave To The Grind was the first metal album to ever top the chart.  Motley Crue topped the album chart with Dr. Feelgood and Guns N' Roses topped the chart with Appetite for Destruction- perhaps one of the greatest metal albums of all-time.  Skid Row found mainstram success with the #1 single, 18 & Life and #2 \\"I Remember You\\".  Youth Gone Wild and Piece of Me are two the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />Skid Row delivers this album. <br /> <br />As for the new album, Thickskin, avoid!! <br /> <br />There is no Skid Row without Sebastian Bach. <br /> <br />Sebastian Bach was Skid Row and the new Skid Row won't have the same success. <br /> <br />Skid Row's debut is a classic. <br />

Metallica did it with the Black Album, Megadeth did it with Countdown to Extinction and Skid Row's Slave to the Grind was the first metal album to debut #1 on the chart.  Guns N' Roses debuted at #1 with Use Your Illusion II. Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power is hard-hitting and aggressive. The guitar riffs are in your face from beginning to end and this is one of the heaviest albums to ever debut at #1 on Billboard's 200 singles.  This metal at its best!! <br /> <br />Pantera is perhaps one of the best metal bands of all-time. <br /> <br />My top ten metal albums: <br /> <br />1. Metallica- The Black Album <br />2.

When u expect to read a book like harry potter and get let down, u let down yourself because every author is different. Diana is not like a certain JK Rowling and hopefully will never be the EXACT same thing.  <br /> <br />What is most delightful about her books u will never know what happens next. <br /> <br />I have read the Dalemark Quartet, and it is excellent, it kepps u guessing although u know the ultimate goal of the books. Which i am sure is demenstrated in most of Diana's books, so if this one does not get your fancy try out with one of her other books u may be surprised about how much u like it.
B00005JOII|5.0|After several decades of shooting intriguing comedies, dramas, and mutations of the two, Woody Allen has eventually reached the point where he again reinvents himself.  His newest film, Match Point, might be one of his very best, as it definitely is his best within the last decade.  Despite its similar application of interpersonal tension as his Interiors (1978) and September (1987), the film provides a distinctly different atmosphere compared to his other films.  Allen allows the audience to venture into the psyche of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) in a beguiling cerebral drama that dissects the philosophical importance of mere luck.<br /><br />By appearance, it is rather obvious that Woody Allen never had a chance to reach stardom in athletics with the exception of being a jockey.  Nonetheless, he has repeatedly displayed his intellect in regards to athletics and sports in a thoughtfully intelligent manner.  Sure, on occasion, he has even made fun of the sports, but it has never been tactless.  In Annie Hall (1977), his character Alvy Singer told Annie (Diane Keaton) in the theater line that those who cannot become teachers with the exception of physical education teachers.  Almost two decades later Allen returns to point out the importance of athletics in the Western society, as the former tennis pro Wilton attempts to seek his fortune among the London aristocrats by using his skills in tennis and quaint discourse.<br /><br />Match Point begins by planting a seed in the audience's mind by letting a tennis ball strike the top of the net and then freeze in mid air while Rhys-Meyers' voice points out the importance of luck needed for a ball to continue over the net.  It is an intriguing notion that luck often has decisive power of a situation such as it can determine the outcome of a tennis game.  However, Allen takes the notion even a step further by applying it to the path of people's lives.  The existential determination based on luck is rather obvious in the beginning of the film when Wilton finds employment, as a tennis coach in an extraordinarily exclusive tennis club.  Wilton, once born into Irish poverty, has now been fortunate to make ends meet through tennis while many of the people in his working environment have the privilege to enjoy the birthright of wealth and social status.<br /><br />The initial illustration of luck determined through birth eventually diffuses, as Wilton's actions bring him in a desired direction.  He befriends the rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) by becoming his coaching tennis partner, and eventually Wilton finds himself invited to an opera.  Wilton nurtures the friendship by never taking advantage of the situation, or his new friend by insisting on paying for himself despite his meager salary.  Through Wilton's new friendship, he also encounters Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who he begins to court, after she shows interest in him.  Even the parents of Hewett family performed by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton take liking to him.  It is evident that luck alone does not make things happen, however, luck still is the decisive factor of new encounters.<br /><br />As the film unfolds, Allen also allows luck to collide from two different directions - wealth and love.  It all begins when Wilton meets Nola (Scarlett Johansson) who is Tom's fianc&eacute;.  Nola is much like Wilton, who is raised in poverty who tries to find her way out of her misfortunate situation, and Tom has fortunately crossed her path like a knight in shining armor with his deep bank account.  Through Wilton, the audience realizes that he cannot acquire both, as he either must remain true to Chloe to secure his future, or pursue Nola for love.  It leaves him with a deep personal predicament, as he must confront his own greed and lust, which he begins to rationalize in his own favor.<br /><br />It is in the conflict between love and wealth that the story's treasure rests, as Allen rises several existential questions suchas is it wrong to wish oneself riches and can love provide everything necessary in life?  To increase the complexity within the story Allen pushes boundaries beyond what he has ever done previously in a ghastly manner.  The film also has a slight tone of Robert Bresson with its unique minimalist approach, which augments the minute actions and incidents within the story.  Allen never says what is right or wrong through the film, he simply lets the camera capture the truth.  It is both refreshing and horrid, as the minimalism enhances the offensive nature of the story and compels the audience to ponder the morality of Wilton's situation.<br /><br />The convergence between the notions of fortunate happenstance and morality ushers the audience into a thoughtful mode while following the intriguing rationalization of Wilton and his actions.  The film also provides an interesting perspective of how luck ambiguously affects people's lives, as Allen exhaustively presents an emotional drama that intentionally keeps its distance to the audience in order for the viewer to dwell on the concepts presented.  However, it leaves the audience disturbed on a very intellectual level, as it purposely stirs the very foundation of moral development.  The film does not allow the audience to feel neutral to the topic, as it presents a very dark tale, which can be summed up by Wilton's statement, \\"I'd rather be lucky than good.\\"uch as is it wrong to wish oneself riches and can love provide everything necessary in life?

0062515675|5.0|The wisdom contained in this book is not anything new or different to that already contained in the wealth of self-improvement literature. It's essentially eastern philosophy simplified and presented in the context of a nice story. Unlike other reviewers, I don't think that this fact makes it any less worthy.  <br /> <br />\\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" contains many concepts and practices which can potentially transform, uplift and enrich your life. Additionally, through the use of a delightful fable, it provides the reader with memory pegs which causes him/her to inevitably remember the concepts- truly an invaluable gift to the reader. If you're looking to improve the quality of your life and health, it's a great read...I would recommend it to anyone, even teenagers.
0440241588|3.0|\\"The Broker\\" tells the story of Joel Backman, an imprisoned former stock broker, who receives a suspicious last-minute pardon from an outgoing President. The idea behind the pardon, as the book's backcover will divulge, is that Joel has secrets the CIA hasn't completely figured, and they're interested in who will take the first shot at Joel now that he is a free man.    The books strengths, as with any Grisham novel, are the gripping introduction and fast-paced, tight prose. The strongest moments in the story, however, I thought were the ones spent in Italy when Joel was trying to learn the Italian language, even though the pace was slower. A lot is revealed about his character during these scenes.    On the other side, the story suffers from a lot of the same pitfalls as many of his recent works. The ending felt anticlimactic and was devoid of the subtle commentary on how things work (commonly the main character gave up practicing law after the ordeal) that was commonplace in his earlier works. Grisham also wades in well over his head in the technical aspect of the story. He gives a disclaimer at the end that he's no technical wizard, but it's really unnecessary - it's thoroughly obvious from the way the plot unfolds. I can't even begin to imagine how he supposes three Pakistani students would be the only people in the world who could find and hijack (hack) a rogue spy satellite. And don't get me started about the overuse of the word \\"hack\\". Note to Grisham: Giving your user name and password for your email account does not qualify as \\"hacking\\".    But I digress. A worthwhile read for those devoted to reading everything Grisham publishes (like me) but, for new Grisham readers, pick up \\"The Rainmaker\\", \\"The Firm\\" or \\"A Painted House\\" before this one.

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom was a very memorable book.  This nonfiction book explores the struggles and emotions of death.  Morrie is a professor that has spent his career trying to get his students to think about life; not just take it at face value.  Morrie only has a little longer to live, and he knows it.  Within his last few months of life one of his students comes to visit him every Tuesday.  \\"We're Tuesday people,\\" they say.  This is when Morrie holds his final class with his beloved student Mitch.  On these days they discuss life and the meaning of all that is in it.  All of the notes that were taken, during these final sessions with his professor, Mitch Albom compiled and turned them into this wonderfully insightful book.  The reader gets a sense that the last moments of a person's life, if not spent in self-pity, can be the most productive.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This movie wasn't BAD so to say, just some parts kinda pinched my nervs here and there, like how they made the werewolves look, they acted kinda stiff and un real, and the whole thing of making the vampires ''Hiss''..yea...that was gay. Thats all the vampires praticly do lol.   I also thought the ending creature of the half vampire and half werewolf was kinda lame looking, they could of been more creative then THAT.  <br /> <br />over all the plot was good, the creatures, so-so.
0679746048|5.0|Susanna Kaysen's memoir, Girl, Interrupted, was very insightful and taught a lot about mental illnesses and their affect on other teenagers my age. It talked, in detail, on how the different illnesses change everyday life and the process to fight off certain mental or even physical disorders. Especially readers who take a special interest or who might be interested in mental disorders and/or psychology would appreciate and enjoy the story. The book paints a clear picture of what the author went through because there is no censoring and she isn't afraid to say what all happened to her. It's such an honest story and it's hard to put the book down once you start. <br /> It all starts when Susanna, the author, is sent away for a couple months to a mental facility after being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder but actually ends up staying much longer. The most interesting part of the book is that a lot of her case study reports from psychiatrists are included and are very neat to read. The theme was clearly presented through the struggles of a young girl eager to \\"find herself.\\" Despite the depressing mood of the book, it was an amazing story of real life situations that almost anyone can relate to in some way. Also, the book was made into a movie that was really enjoyable, whether you read the book or not. <br />
B0000399WI|5.0|The first of the umpty-billion times I've enjoyed this movie, I wasn't surprised by the outcome, because I'd read the book. I was, however, simply amazed at how phenomenal the onscreen version was...better than ANY book I've read. It is the only movie I've faithfully watched at least three times a year. <br /> <br />If you're usually a renter and can only own one movie, make this the one. It's that good, yet each time I watch it I find some new detail I'd missed previously. I gain new insight each time; I feel that I will continue to come away more enlightened on each viewing. You will never grow bored of this movie, and you will never forget it.  <br /> <br />I think, this week, my favorite line takes place when Andy Dufresne's cell is \\"tossed\\" and the warden nearly forgets to return Andy's Bible. SALVATION LIES WITHIN. Indeed it does. <br /> <br />An aside...I had the privilege to tour the defunct Ohio prison where the movie was made. It's so HAUNTED by real souls who resided there, and seeing it just gave me the shivers. I could easily pick out where certain scenes had taken place and almost HEARD the warden's footfalls in the corridors. It's hard to explain better than that...just an amazing experience.  <br /> <br />Run, do NOT walk to the Buy It Now icon!
6305897786|4.0|The film drags a little towards the end, that is the reason for which i don't give 5 stars, but in the overall picture, frankly, this is an excellent movie, well done, with both a good plot and a good suspense, all the actors are excellent, and there is an atmosphere that grabs you until the end ; i'm not an absolute fanatic of all the Polanski's films, but this director is sometimes unfairly underestimated, that is the case for the 'Ninth Gate'.
0765301598|3.0|Finally this series is over and I can breathe a deep sigh of relief.  This book, like the others was an absolute chore to read.  I've said it before, and unfortunately I have to say it again:  TOO MUCH REPETITION. <br /> <br />In every single chapter, you're absolutely bombarded with repetition, and I'm not sure why.  I specifically remember that about half way through the book, the authors go to great lengths to say 19 years had passed, on three seperate occasions.  This happened in two consecutive chapters.  I may not have the best memory, but that's just insulting. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what happened with the character development in this book.  Everyone just kind of seems to be in limbo.  I felt like so much attention was being given to the \\"Universe Changing Events\\" that the authors lose focus on their initial characters, who had great potential.  The characters were what drew me into the story to begin with. <br /> <br />I was very excited to finally learn why the Harkonnens had been labeled traitors, and why they hated the Atreides so much.  Unfortunately, I feel like more questions were rasied than answers.  As someone else said, you end up feeling bad for the Harkonnens, which is unfortunate, especially since it seemed like  Abulurd Harkonnen was trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br />I'm so torn about this novel.  I liked the ideas, and the concepts, and I'm always a fan of origin stories.  I guess my issue was more with the way it was written than the topic.
0380789019|5.0|It's difficult to sum up Neverwhere in just one review of a few paragraphs, unless I choose to rewrite his book right here, and I don't have the time--and somehow, I doubt they allow me the space, either. <br /> <br />It's like tasting a really good food for the first time, reading this book, because you've never really read anything like it before. Gaiman is always unrelenting with his characters. At times, he shows no mercy when he shouldn't, and he imbues Richard Mayhew (his character of flawed, but pure, humanity) with a degree of morality that stable people can relate to. <br /> <br />It's a misconception what good writing entails. A lot believe good writing means that the author has to craft a complex plot, or a syntax worthy of analysis by Shakespearian scholars. But Gaiman embraces his characters, which astounds me more than anything. He uses his surroundings to greater effect. We don't understand our character until he undergoes a change of environment, and Gaiman uses this to intelligent effect--after all, everybody can relate to that. We don't see Richard Mayhew as a person until he matures and metamoprhoses into a brilliant culmination of moral human compassion. <br /> <br />This review, of course, is not meant to pinpoint one character and to analyze him until our ears bleed. But Gaiman clearly meant Richard Mayhew to be an indicator of the themes of love and loss, of good and evil, of dark and light and of pure, simple survival. <br /> <br />
0062502182|5.0|Truths and omens come and go like grains of sand and desert winds in this Celestine Prophecy-like tale of our alchemical kinship with one another in mind and spirit. It teaches us about our inherited strengths, which many of us sadly fail to realize as we go through life.<br /><br />A deep read in a small book. Highly entertaining, but even more so, deeply interesting, and inspiring.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As I glance through other reviews of this film, I see several people mention that they had not seen the television series prior to watching this film.  While most still loved what Whedon had to offer in this big screen adaptation, I must warn everyone that you MUST watch the television series first.  There are character connections and emotional moments that you may not develop an understanding about without watching the series first.  Serenity is a conclusionary film in the sense that its purpose is to finally answer those questions that were left on the table at the end of the television series.  With that said, Serenity is the BEST conclusionary film ever!  The true conclusion to Whedon's science fiction epic is finally told with the budget it deserved.  While I do believe that Whedon could have successfully done this perhaps seven seasons later, due to the final termination of the first season, he did the best that he could.  Actually, who am I kidding, he did magnificently.<br /><br />I am an enormous, yet new, fan of this series.  For those that have not experienced the television show Firefly, you are missing out on possibly the best that television had to offer.  This film is just a brief snippet of what was offered in the television series.  So much of this film is left up to the idea that the viewer has seen the television series, no matter what others may say.  You need to watch the television series first.  Whedon has amazingly transformed the bond between these characters, the tension, the excitement, the passion, and given them their feature debut.  Everyone, from the small background characters to the head-honchos of this crew, give more than 100% in their efforts for Whedon's dream.  It is obvious as you watch this conclusion that those involved with this series were extremely passionate about what Whedon was creating.  The actors were completely immersed in their roles, giving us the same spunk, pizzazz, and charm from the original series.  Watching Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau reprise their characters was like revisiting your favorite book on a beautiful spring day at the beach.  Nothing could have been more enjoyable or relaxing.<br /><br />One of the aspects that I love about this film is that Whedon honestly does answer all of those burning questions that are in the back of your mind.  Fans of the show will know what I am talking about.  Those watching the series and wondering about River, Reavers, the Alliance, and a bit about Book will know more coming out of this film.  Whedon does not disappoint his fans.  He does this by keeping so many of the same elements in the film that we grew to love in the television series.  The very technological CGI, the western atmosphere (though this film does feel a bit more sci-fi than the television series), and the bond between the crew (a element that you do not see in most television film adaptations) are all points that made the series great.  Whedon has taken these and crafted one of the best films this year.  Even three years after the final episode, Whedon remembers what brought his fans to this series.  He remembers the humanity of the characters, the humbleness of Mal, and the fire that is in each of their eyes.  It is about having faith (but not always about God), it is about honesty, and it is about courage and dedication.  After watching this film you cannot help but feeling motivated to get up and fight for what you believe in.  Mal and his crew ignite that passion within you!<br /><br />If I had to have two gripes about this film, they would be very small, yet still dwelling within my mind.  Where were the men in the blue gloves?  Remember, River always chanted, \\"two by two\\"?  There was even an episode called \\"Ariel\\" nearly dedicated to them.  I wish Whedon had expanded with them instead of focusing so contently on this Operative.  While I think the Operative was amazing,I just kept thinking about them throughout the film.  The second remaining question that I had was this, \\"Who was Shepard Book\\"?  I thought out of all of the characters, even River, he was the most complex.  While he is hardly in this film, he continues to force us to ponder on what is truly in his past.  What makes him different, yet special at the same time?  Just two simple questions that I did not feel validated by the end of the film.  Small gripes, nothing huge to talk about.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was fantastic.  It carries everything a sci-fi, western, action genre person would want.  Whedon proves that he has the power to control his characters and develop honest stories that keep simple themes and devoted morals.  Serenity was nothing short, to use words from my Firefly review, of perfection on a stick.  Never have I finished a series, coupled with a film, only to want to start from the beginning again to see my old \\"friends\\" in action.  I actually felt very emotional when this film was over because I really didn't want to have a final closing to this series.  I wanted to know that my friends would still be out there waiting to make me laugh, enjoy an adventure, and grow challenging secrets.  It is what I loved about the TV series, and it is what completed this film for me.<br /><br />Whedon, from Firefly to Serenity, I applaud you!!<br /><br />BRAVO JOSS, BRAVO!!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****mazing, I just kept thinking about them throughout the film.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|If you're still vainly awaiting the release of \\"Chinese Democracy\\", this album may help ease the pain. Avenged Sevenfold borrows from a number of great bands--Metallica, Iron Maiden, Faith No More, and System of a Down come to mind--but the dominant sound is that of \\"Use Your Illusion\\"-era Guns 'n' Roses. Great melodies, inventive lyrics, and absolutely fantastic guitar work -- instrumentally Avenged Sevenfold is one of the best bands I've ever heard. The only weakness is the vocals; the group sounds SO G'n'R that I found myself mentally rerecording the songs with Axl's inimitable yowl drowning out the comparatively lackluster M. Shadows. (Shadows really grew on me after a while though--he's not at all bad; he's just not Axl.) <br /> <br />Every track on this album is excellent, but of particular interest to Guns n Roses fans are \\"Trashed and Scattered\\", \\"Sidewinder\\", \\"Strength of the World\\", \\"Betrayed\\" and of course \\"Bat Country.\\" Avenged Sevenfold have a lot of attitude -- they're a real metal band, no whiny over-enunciating Linkin Park bullcrap.  <br /> <br />G'n'R lovers, do yourselves a favor and buy this CD now. When just a little patience and a big bland Velvet Revolver don't cut it, \\"City of Evil\\" will rescue you from the wait. \\"Sweet child, we miss you,\\" Shadows sings at one point in a lyric perhaps inadvertantly expressing the dejection of legions of fans. Miss him we may, but finally there's an imitator worth listening to. Avenged Sevenfold isn't Guns 'n' Roses, but they do a damn good job of coming close. Plus, I need something to listen to until I get Axl's new album for my 90th birthday.
1592400876|5.0|I've always been a stickler for grammar -- it runs in my family -- but while I take enormous pleasure from editing essays, critiquing people's speech, and finding grammar and spelling mistakes in subway ads, I never thought it would be fun to listen to someone else going on and on about the whole business.<br /><br />Okay, well, forget that. I was wrong. \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is a stickler's paradise from start to finish. You have to *really* be a stickler, though. A sort of everyday appreciation of grammar and punctuation may not be enough to get you through this book. If, however, you are a grammar Nazi, this book is a must-read. Do you commit awful grammar mistakes to memory so you can regale your friends with them later? Is there no acceptable excuse (Hell? High water? Terminal illness? Death?) for a person mixing up \\"they're\\", \\"there\\" and \\"their\\"? Do commas in inappropriate places make you itch? Well, then. Stop reading this review and skip off to read the book instead.<br /><br />Lynne Truss isn't a perfect grammarian by any means, but she's wry and funny and clever. She can go off on tangents, but I feel like that's kind of the point. If you want an exacting English Workshop type of book, get a textbook. \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is for those special people who know what all the rules of the language are, but are willing to laugh about them. Truss acknowledges the flexibility of The Rules, and also that it can be okay to break them... as long as you know what you're doing.<br /><br />\\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is the book I read when I'm sick or in a horrible mood, because it's guaranteed to cheer me up. The world can't be such a terrible place when you remember that there are people in it who can get excited about the inventor of the italic typeface.<br /><br />Trust me. You'll get it when you read it.

0743526937|4.0|Listening to this audio book I really learned a lot about how to view the whole concept of negotiation. I have been using this approach and it makes things much more efficient and keeps me in an excelent mood since I know that my main objective is to get to a WISE AGREEMENT and not just to win or avoid been controlled or turned down.It frees me from a lot of stress and keeps me going where I really want and think I should go. It works! The more people use this ideology in negotiations, the more good agreements will be made and the more productive life the world will have. I fully recommend this audiobook
B00005JLTN|5.0|\\"There is no spoon.\\"  There.  That settles it.  The Matrix trilogy is the best out there.  Spoons are cool! <br /> <br />But seriously, I could sit here and type up all the reasons that this movie is so great, but you've probably seen it on TNT 6 times.  Listen.  It doesn't matter if special effects ever surpass the ones in this film because no movie will ever couple it with such a deep story line.  And visa versa. <br /> <br />One thread that runs through each Matrix flick is the love between Neo and Trinity.  They sold me on their affection for one another through all they'd been through when each time they were going to supposedly die, they were there for one another, even when Trinity did actually die in front of Neo.  THAT SUCKED!  But that was the third movie anyway. <br /> <br />What really enhanced this movie was how confident Neo had become with his skills and not get arrogant.  How un-American of him!  But this is a good thing.  When's the last time you had a hero that wasn't a pothead with his buds or a drunk or a thug with no morals?  Neo is a guy all people can relate to, not just certain stereotypes. <br /> <br />After I saw this on opening day at the movies, I started clapping loudly and impulsively.  I thought I was the only one who clapped at movies anymore, and that I'd be alone in doing so.  Wrong.  Everone seemed to be going nuts and my little noise was engulfed in the din around me.  Get this DVD, it'll blow your mind.  Also get the other 2 and the Animatrix for extra storyline stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Cookies need love too.\\"

I must say, honestly, that I enjoyed Angels and Demons (the prequel to Da Vinci Code) more than I did this one, but I still liked it nonetheless. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louve Museum, where the body of a man is discovered with certain symbology around him. Langdon eventually traces down the source of the man's symbols (with help from his grand-daughter Sophia, a cryptologist in the French Police) and soon learns that the clues to the man's death point to an ancient society that has protected the Holy Grail for centuries. It contains a secret that most people would love to get their hands on and Langdon must not only find the grail, but keep it safe from those that would see it destroyed. The adventure is fun and daring, and the bad guy is not exactly who you think he is. I found the ending good, but it didn't have all the action of Angels and Demons.  Still a great read though.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I have not stopped thinking about the film since I saw it a few weeks ago, actually have not stopped crying.  My favorite is Rufus Wainwright singing 'The Maker Makes'.  He sings is with a faraway, longing quality that completely captures that empty feeling....
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey is now better than ever.  After her previous CD, I thought her career was heading downword, but after this album, she has straighten herself and then some.  This CD is just magniciant.  You can just tell when she is singing.  Her vocals on this album are just incredible and out of this world.  It's unfair to the music industry that she such incredibly talented.  I have to say every song in this album was just great.  No song was created just to fill in the CD.  I mean, just listen to the song \\"We Belong Together.\\"  That alone is worth the CD.  I highly recommend this album to every music lover out there.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|First of all, this movie is a classic hands down (bar none). However, they should've left it the way it was that's why it didn't get a 5 star rating from me. I think they should've left the comic book theatrics out of it. Let's just pretend you hadn't seen it in the 27 years it's been released. If that was the case, then you got cheated with this version because Walter Hill took a serious movie about gang wars, courage and survival, and dumbed it down with comic book theatrics (as if there aren't enough comic book movies). Call me a sucker, but I just didn't want them to change a thing. I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it 25 years later to this day. This movie is about \\"The Warriors\\" (a street gang) trying all night to survive making it from the Bronx to Coney Island after they are wrongly accused of gunning down the president of \\"The Gramacy Riffs\\"... Cyrus. On a good note, Micheal Beck (Swan) and James Remar (Ajax) still deliver powerhouse performances. Come on, we all know that Ajax (the 2nd best character of the movie) was robbed! In fact, Ajax and Swan were my 2 favorite characters in the whole entire movie, and halfway through it, Ajax gets arrested, and you don't see him anymore from that point on. If Walter Hill wanted to add something, he should've added a prison break. Just kidding! I really did miss my Ajax, and I would've loved to see him still standing tall at the end next to Swan. At any rate, I don't think that Deborah Van Valkenburgh was right for the part of Mercy, but that's just an opinion. David Patrick Kelly also didn't disappoint as the leader of \\"The Rogues\\" the real person who pulled the trigger killing Cyrus. At any rate, this movie was so ahead of it's time. I do recommend that you see it's original version though to get the full effect.
B00007AJF9|2.0|This film only merits two stars to give credit to the costume and set designers.  The rest is pure trash.  The script sounds like it was written by a bad romance novelist and the historical inaccuracies are amazing.  The characters are pure stereotype.  If you are intersted in a dramatization of Elizabeth's life you would be better off going to the old \\"Elizabeth\\" series with Glenda Jackson.  Even the 70's movie \\"Mary, Queen of Scots\\" does a better job with the same material.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|First of all, from reading most of the online reviews, I can tell that most of the viewers missed the point of the entire movie. This movie is not a horror story at all. In fact, it's more of a courtroom drama if you will. The film is centered around a catholic priest named Father Moore played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson. Father Moore is being prosecuted and standing trial because the exorcism he performed on teenage Emily Rose resulted in her death. This is where medicine versus spirituality begins. This movie was done brilliantly because it's not told from a biased prospective. It doesn't try to persuade you to see it from one prospective or the other because both sides are equally expressed. This movie wanted to be politically correct, and it didn't wanna ruffle any feathers from either side. Meanwhile, showing the viewers both sides of the story from two different points of view. By the end of this movie we still can't be sure what actually happened to Emily Rose. Was it demonic possession? or Was it pychosis? However, I will say this, even the non-believers must admit that some of the prosecutions arguements were too far-fetched. Then again, there's always gonna be the so-called \\"realists\\" who think that there's a scientific explanation for everything, and then there are \\"spiritualist\\" who think that there's a higher power that goes beyond medicine. I am on that side because what I saw was clearly demonic possession, but that's just an opinion, and we all know what they're like. I thought the ending was most impressive because I sat in the theatre waiting for a more in depth explanation as to why the demons attacked her in particular, and in the end that question was answered. Father Moore took the stand and read Emily's final letter that she wrote just before she died. I thought it was so interesting that after a failed attempt to drive the demons out. After Emily's body had been starved, beaten, worn, and attacked by a legion of demons she actually got to see the \\"Virgin Mary\\" Of course, she wants to know why she's suffering this way, and of couse it's because she's a \\"saint\\" or meant to do God's work. At this time she's given a choice to die and be delivered from all her suffering, or she could stay and be a martyr thus continuing to suffer even more, but the demons still weren't gonna leave her body. At this point, Emily chose to stay, and at that time I thought it was very foolish. However, in hindsight I see it was a very courageous thing to endure. Emily chose to suffer so that her story could be told to the world. So that everyone would know that demons do exist. That was Father Moore's sole purpose to make sure Emily's message got delivered. On the other hand, you have the prosecuters expecting us to believe that Emily's behavior is another form of psychosis or epilepsy treatable by proper medication. They're trying their best to get us to believe that the rest were just muscle constrictions and elevated voices. They want us to believe there was nothing \\"spiritual\\" about this whole ordeal. Emily was not possessed, and she didn't suffer the stigmata because she was a person ordained by God, but she wondered outside in a daze and grabbed some barbed wire thus getting the wounds on both her hands. They want us to believe that she stopped taking her medicine that the doctor prescribed, and that's why she is indeed going crazy. In my opinion, that's ridiculous! They didn't wanna entertain the possibility of demonic possession, but they could entertain the thought of that other crap.
0385507755|1.0|Frey's affected post stream-of-conscience narration style survives only because the story being told is supposed to be real.  Now that we know that almost all of the claims in the book are false, Frey's whole absurd, macho fantasy comes crashing down into a million silly pieces.
B000001G5A|5.0|Karl Bohm, like the fellow Deustche Grammophon conductors Karajan and Bernstein, specializes in works by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, but his reputation may be easily shadowed by the latter two. Being wrought with slow tempo and apparent lack of individual touch may be the reason, but don't give up too easily on him. Maestro Bohm is an absolute winner on Mozart's \\"Requiem Mass\\", and his performance really live up to the standards of, even outshines, those of Karajan and Bernstein. Although the tempo is relatively slower, neither the orchestra nor the singers show signs of apathy and bluntness in the music at all. As a benefit, the slow tempo give more time for the musicians to evoke pathos and power inexpressible if too rushed, and the audience to recive them. The speed is JUST RIGHT in louder segments including \\"Dies Irae\\", \\"Rex\\" and \\"Confutatis\\"... and PERFECT in the grim \\"Lacrymosa\\", without any fear of rush. Just serene and powerful. This gotta be the Mozart \\"Requiem\\" to own!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Some people say this is actually their \\"Best Of\\"-album. I can understand their point of view. This album has a bit of every other of their albums. The playfulness of 'Pablo Honey' (\\"Punchup At A Wedding\\"), the skill of 'The Bends' (\\"Go To Sleep\\"), the complexity of 'OK Computer' (\\"Where I End And You Begin\\"), the fascinating beauty of 'Kid A' (\\"Backdrifts\\") and the pleasant weirdness of 'Amnesiac' (\\"The Gloaming\\", \\"We Suck Young Blood\\"). But this hasn't got any real hits, excluding \\"2+2=5\\" maybe. But this album is so much more than only a Best Of, it doesn't need hits to be strongh.    First of all, Radiohead are more subtle than they ever were. Around every corner there's an effect you didn't hear or didn't notice before, and those effects are used as optimal as possible. Take for example the scratching samples underneath Thom's voice in the chorus of 'Backdrifts'. At first I simply didn't hear them, I first heard them when I was listening to the album with headphones on. I just watched the movie 'Ju-On' and those scratching effects scared me, it reminded me of the movie.     Another effect that is used to the fullest, is recurrence. More than in other albums, Thom repeats his lyrics very often in some tracks, not because of a lack of inspiration, but for the great effect, and often emphasises the message of the song (for example, the lyric \\"The rain drops\\" is repeated frequently in 'Sit Down Stand Up'). The lyrics themselves are often politically charged, but are at the same time very cryptical, like usual.     Because the album is so subtle, it was for me very inaccesible. Unlike most of their albums, I didn't really understand it for a long time. If you would have asked me to give a score when I listened to the album for the first few times, nearly two years ago now, I would have given it 2 stars I think. It has been my least favourite by them for a very long time (not considering Pablo Honey). It slowly has grown on me, the more effects and layers I discovered,and only since last month I saw the shining brilliance of this album, in all its diversity. For a long time, my mayor complaint was that the album was too long and too inconsistent, but I cut back on that.     Key tracks for me include:  \\"Where I End And You Begin\\" (I often consider this my favourite Radiohead-song, and for great reasons), \\"Backdrifts\\", \\"A Punchup At A Wedding\\", \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\".    This is an excellent album, it only needs (alot of) time. So, if you are willing to spent time and effort in listening to it, I recommend buying it. The only Radiohead-album I rate higher than this one are 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac'.     And always remember, like Thom said, if you don't like this album: \\"I will eat you alive\\"    Just kidding...  Right, Thom?
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I've been a fan of A7X since day one. Every album they got is different from one another. I just gotta say that the newest album is amazing and probably the best one. Sure it's not as heavy as the previous ones but it's all about progression. Metal-core is soon gonna be dead and A7X is already headed towards the right direction. At first I was kinda pissed about them going mainstream, but that's only normal when a band is that good.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This movie is really great. Every kong fan,Kaiju fan,lord of the rings fan, science fiction fan should see. PJ's truly shows his passion with this movie.The only minor grips in this movie are jimmy with the thompson gun being accrute and not many guys getting killed in the stampade. But everything else is GRAND! For those who complain on how they carred kong back to NYC, WATCH THE FIRST KING KONG MOVIE!!!!!! And whats with the hate for using cgi? It can look fake, BUT SO CAN EVERY OTHER WAYS OF  SX!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If I could give Firefly more than 5 stars I would.<br /><br />I had never heard of Firefly until we saw Serenity in the theater. We loved the movie, bought it as soon as it came out on DVD and have watched it several times. When I realized it was a show, I immediately bought the DVD set and we're still watching it. We're so upset that we only have 1 DVD left before we're done! After every single episode we watch, I feel the need to reiterate, \\"I can't believe they took this show off the air!!!\\" We'll be watching it over and over for years to come, I'm sure. I love everything about the show - the characters, the relationships, the intensity and the light-hearted moments. It's just so much better than anything else out there right now. I really hope that DVD sales of both the show and the movie prove to the networks that this show deserves to be resurrected \\"Family-Guy\\" style. I can't say enough. Watch it and fall in love.
0307276902|3.0|This was an interesting look into a life I might otherwise not be privi to.  There were similarities to the various obsessive thoughts I might indulge from time to time...but this wasn't quite the page turner, it was claimed to be!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to rent these DVDs right after the set was released (at the time or the original airing I did not have HBO or cable TV for that matter). I was COMPLETELY blown away. I hadn't heard much about them and didn't know what to expect. It is definately one of my most prized DVD sets. The acting is top notch, and the commentary and stories from the actual members of Easy Co. before/after each episode I thought brought a unique addition to the series as a whole. This is the kind of cinematic work that will preserve an important piece of history for a long time. Kudos to all who contributed to this series!

1401207928|5.0|All I want to add to the torrent of reviews already out on this--and well before the movie comes out--is that, if like me you're a fan of Orwellian dystopia, thoughtful considerations of personal responsibility within the context of a police state and those who allow such a situation to control them, and a challenging plotline, this is superb edification as well as cracking good entertainment. Moore & Lloyd stretch again the ability of their genre to deliver multiple storylines, overlapping or simultaneous (or as close you can get to this in print) voices, narrative, and/or soundtracks, and quickly edited scenes makes this a satisfying visual and auditory experience. Characterizations are also fleshed out well; as the afterword's notes comment, even the baddies gain recognizable features that we share with them, and nobody's a caricature, although many people's poses are satirized deftly. My favorite section, the set-piece of Valerie that centers the whole triptych, was astonishingly intricate.<br /><br />This work takes considerable mental concentration; the hours flew by as I read, and I found myself engrossed, by the combination of visuals and print, in a way that combined the best of film and literature. I commend Moore and Lloyd for their diligence, intelligence, and craft. Macbeth, the Stones, Blake, Crowley, Martha & the Vandellas: all this and more pack the intertextual references with even more layers of sophistication. A fine work indeed, and one also that can be valuable for teenagers as well as those of us who read \\"1984\\" in our formative years. My son borrowed this from his classmate and urged me to read it. I'm glad I did. And, for the present generation, this take on Orwell's vision of \\"a boot crushing a face, forever\\" is considerably faster-paced and bolder in its near-familiarity.
B0009IW88A|5.0|First, let me say I enjoyed the film Batman Begins immensely.  I thought it was the most \\"true-to-life\\" representation of the Batman story ever done and I was pleased with the stylistic choices made in the film. <br /> <br />That said, I found the Hans Zimmer/James Newton Howard collaborative soundtrack to be perfectly suited to the film and I was quite surprised to find that it also stood as quite a good listen on its own.  I believe my surprise stems from the fact that when I first saw the film, I didn't hear the soundtrack, I FELT it.  While this may strike some as an indication that the composer failed in his duty, it is in fact the highest aim of the film composer.  So perfectly interwoven into the film was the score that my consciousness barely noted it (though if you asked me after I saw the film if I liked the music, I certainly would have said yes). <br /> <br />As many reviewers have already stated, the score evokes deep senses of darkness, foreboding, and despair, as well as tenderness, courage, and honor.  The score, like the film, is a roller-coaster affair that may leave one breathless. <br /> <br />A few reviewers have stated that they were bothered by how Zimmer and Howard \\"ignored\\" or \\"trampled on\\" or \\"disrespected\\" Elfman's score for Tim Burton's Batman, released in 1989.  This is absurd.  For one, while many composers choose to include homages or references to previous scores if they're doing another version of the same (or in this case, similar) film (and yes, there are a few I could pick out in Begins), they \\"owe\\" those previous composers nothing at all.  They are hired to produce a score which matches with the movie on screen.  I absolutely love Danny Elfman's score for Batman, I have listened to it regularly for over a decade.  But I firmly believe that Elfman's work would have been completely wrong for Batman Begins.  Elfman's score screams brass and bravado, elements that would have grated against the grim, bleak Gotham City of Batman Begins. <br /> <br />For those who know their works, it is pretty obvious when Howard is doing the talking and when Zimmer takes over.  Zimmer, in particular, has produced what I believe to be his best work to date.  One reviewer decried his use of synths and went so far as to claim he had no musical talent at all.  If synths are a problem with you, then yes, you may have issues with Batman Begins.  But if you think Hans Zimmer is a no-talent hack, I would recommend you listen to the score to \\"As Good As It Gets,\\" an amazingly uncharacteristic Hans Zimmer work.  If you can listen to that and still come away thinking Zimmer has no talent and doesn't work with live performers, then I will have lost hope for you. <br /> <br />James Newton Howard also contributes some beautiful themes, most notably in my mind being the \\"Bruce remembers his parents\\" theme, though it isn't known as such.  It pops up throughout the score and really gives perspective to the fact that in the end, Bruce Wayne is still a young man who misses his parents.  It is reminiscent of Malcolm's theme in \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" another powerhouse Howard score. <br /> <br />Overall, though, what struck me most about this soundtrack was how closely it is related to Don Davis' work for the original Matrix film.  Structurally, the two are very similar: they eschew the use of dramatic musical motifs in favor of creating an entire sonic world in which the films can exist.  Both scores sprinkle themes audiences come to know and recognize in the film (the aforementioned \\"Bruce/Parents\\" theme, the Neo/Trinity love theme, for examples), but those are not the focus of the music.  And, just as people in 1999 condemned the Matrix score as being \\"soullessly atonal\\" and lacking any major themes, few people in America today would not be able to identify the echoing, brassy fanfare that heralded the start of one of the Matrix films.   <br /> <br />I feel that the same thing will happen with Batman Begins.  There may be an initialnegative reaction to the \\"decentralized\\" nature of the score, but I am confidant that when all is said and done, it will be recognized for the truly great work of music that it is.  Films like The Matrix and Batman Begins are, in my opinion, the future of things to come in the film score world.  I expect to see many more well-made soundtracks in the style they are helping to establish.
B000BTJCRM|4.0|What more can I say??? <br />The World needs more bands and  <br />music like this. <br />Best fresh Rock'N'Roll since Lenny Kravitz. <br />Bloody Brilliant!! <br />
B00082IJ08|4.0|Wouldn't it be weird if the Gorillaz were real? I don't listen to stuff like this. I listen to artists like Green Day and Eminem,but this is way different. I don't understand how you could give this 5 stars either. Most songs aren't even 3 minutes long. Don't get me wrong. I do give it 4 stars. Why would I get an album I wouldn't listen to? When I see an album like this I expect a lot of strange lyrics. \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is just a sample of weird styles you can expect. Here are a few dos and don'ts on this album: <br />Don't: expect much of any verses in most songs. <br />Do: Enjoy the variety of the Gorillaz including stuff like rap and rock. <br />Don't listen to this album in the dark. <br />Do: read this breakdown of each song. <br />1. Intro 3/5 Some possesed dude talking. Good starter. <br />2. Last Living Souls 3/5 Good starter track. Simple beat and okay lyrics. <br />3. Kids with Guns 4/5 One of the more edgy songs. Has a distracting title. Makes you really listen. <br />4. O Green World 4.5/5 Love the beat. This is where the techno comes in. Singings not that bad. <br />5.Dirty Harry 0.5/5 Messed up. <br />6. Feel Good Inc. 5/5 Single. De La Soul was pretty good. Best singing done by the Gorillaz. Actual verses. <br />7. El Manana 4.5/5 I like this song a lot. I like when the violin or whatever comes in. Slow. Kind of sad. <br />8. Every Planet we Reach is Dead 3/5 Didn't care much for this one. Slow beat until the end. NOT ENOUGH SINGING. <br />9. November has Come 5/5 Where has this Roots guy been. He can rap rhyme after rhyme after rhyme. His deep voice fits in so well with the Gorillaz style. Great hook too. My favorite song. <br />10. All Alone 4/5 Overrated. Though very good. Great rap verse. Two word hook isn't so bad either. Martina Topley Bird is an undiscovered talent from her short verse. <br />11.White Light 3/5 Freaks the freakin' freak out of me. <br />12. Dare 4/5 Great dance beat. Ryder was great. Pretty catchy too. Didn't need much singingto get 4/5. <br />13. Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head 3.5/5 I still don't get it. Strange,but cool. Mainly payed attention to the hook. <br />14. Don't Get Lost in Heaven 0.5/5 I did. <br />15. Demon Days 2.5/5 The title track is a disgrace. Plain and simple.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars - The Complete First Season is incredibly entertaining.  Although I'd seen most of the first season's episodes on UPN, I rewatched the entire season within two days of getting this DVD set.  It was well worth the money.  The acting is refreshing and the plot will leave you guessing.  I could not recommend this DVD set more highly. <br />
B0002OERI0|2.0|remind anybody of anything, particularly Bryan Adams Summer of '69.  Can you say musical rip off in the vein of Vanilla Ice.  Listen and you can hear the similarities.  The first time I heard it I couldn't help but singing...\\"Standing on your mother's porch/you told me you'd wait forever....or whatever the rest of Summer of 69's mindless lyrics are.  Kind of thought it was funny.  As for the rest of the album not too inspiring. In light of the recent political administration and its agenda it isn't hard to come up with material or pot shots.  Kind of like Clinton without sexual imagry. I just felt that a work hailed and hyped as much as this didn't live up or measure up to expectations.  Bearable if on the radio, (though I usually change the station) but not worth purchasing.  There are better artists and bands out there that relay the same message in a manner that is more inspiring and eloquent.  If rock mucis isn't going to be intelligent, then why not just call it pop music and call it a day.
B000002B2T|5.0|this band was a side project for layne staley (lead singer of alice in chains) and is the bands only album. it also has pearl jams guitarist mike mcready. it pretty much sounds like 50% pearl jam and 50% alice in chains. the album is pretty soft but great. but it walso has some songs that are more... alice in chains style. its a great listen.
B00025ETIW|4.0|When I first reviewed this album, I reviewed it as 'atrocious'. I was wrong. My Chemical Romance is awesome. When I heard the Cradle of Filth, I knew what 'atrocious' really meant. Favourite tracks: <br />. Helena <br />. The ghost of you <br />. I'm not okay (I promise) <br />. Give em hell kid. <br /> <br />This band is punk metal. Pop? You must be tuned to another station if you think they're pop, man. Pop is light and good to dance to. This is neither. But I am a massive fan of rock music, so when I heard this properly I LOVED it. And the lyrics are wonderful and very well-written. <br /> <br />So, if I love it so much, why am I only giving it four stars? Well, Gerard's voice could be a little better, but that's not really the reason. It's just, my favourite band is Green Day, not My Chemical Romance. And if you give both five stars, then you'd be giving two bands of different quality the same rating. So, I only give this band four stars. <br /> <br />And, no matter how much I love this band, they will never, ever, EVER be as good as Green Day.  <br /> <br />And if you still think My Chemical Romance is bad, do yourself a favour and check out the Cradle of Filth's album Nymphetamine, then tell me which band REALLY sucks. <br /> <br />Right, now that we've got that straight...  <br /> <br />
B000669GAI|4.0|Now, being the avid Pearl Jam fan that I am, I was kind of disappointed to hear that they were coming out with a 'Greatest Hits'. I had always considered PJ 'my' band, since no other kids my age listen to them. I was afraid that the publicity would spark more teenage listeners, and that PJ would become a fad- 12 year old little girls wearing pink 'babydoll' versions of their T-shirts, concerts on MTV, things of the sort. Now, after the album came out I was pleased to hear that there wasn't as much hype as I'd expected, but I was still weary of purchasing the album. I did, and I'm really very happy with it. Including classic hits like 'Jeremy', 'Even Flow', 'Given to Fly' etc., there are some lesserknown songs such as 'I Got Id' and 'State of Love and Trust'. While I wish some of their more experimental songs would have been included, I still think that it was a great compilation and I don't regret buying it in the least.
B00079FUI6|5.0|These women are so desperate that they are funny.  Makes me wonder what was really going on in the quiet middle class suburbia I grew up in where most of the women were housewives and my brother bought his first car from his earnings from mowing many a lawn.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This was my favorite movie of 2005. I'm a Batman fan and really lost interest in the movie franchise after the first two Tim Burton movies. The others were okay but things were just getting too over the top. This movie brought the series back to earth a little. Aside from being a great comic book movie, it's just a great movie. What I liked was how the movie avoided clich&eacute;s through out. The damsel in distress isn't. Katie Holmes character is in peril but she isn't a screaming victim. It's also nice that the relationship between the two is downplayed. There isn't a forced romance just because movie history requires one. There is still something between them but it is a more realistic complex connection. The don't ask, don't tell nature of Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox's relationship is refreshing in a genre of movies that usually rquire the hero's identity remain a secret from everyone around him. It's a more realistc approach. I like fact that we are shown the origin of Batman's gear also. It's interesting to see where the Batmobile comes from rather than it is just there.<br /><br />The best trick Chris Nolan pulled off was keeping it interesting even when Batman wasn't on screen. A problem with a lot of the older superhero movies was you waited for ever for the hero to get into costume and then there was a two minute appearance than it was back to the alter-ego. I thought the balance was well done and the story was about Bruce Wayne as well as Batman. Part of the credit goes to the actors. I wasn't familiar with Christian Bale but thought he was good in this part. And Michael Caine as Alfred is a fresh take on the thin old bald butler of the past.<br /><br />Everything about Batman Begins was fresh and original to this type of movie. It was closer to the comics. The people that make the movies have a tendency to take use the character but then re-write everything like any other movie. Like The X-Men and Spiderman this movie really gets into the heros legend and makes good use of the history to tell an interesting story. I think it's the best comic book movie to date.makes good use of the history to tell an interesting story. I think it's the best comic book movie to date.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The Original Sound of Music was the very first movie I ever saw in a theater, so getting the 40th Anniversary Edition was a no brainer.  At the time, it seemed to me a movie of such innocence, and revisiting it as an adult I can appreciate and enjoy it also for the raciness for the times.  The Captain is engaged, Maria is nearly a nun, and Liesl is obsessed with sneaking off to meet her bo.  Watching the movie again in great and the special features are well done, especially the \\"Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reminiscence\\" and \\"From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion\\"
B000BVEKO0|3.0|If you are reading this review and you say to yourself \\"Hey! Korn is supposed to evolve so they do not get caught up in the stream of nu-metal that they helped invent,\\" thank-you for stating the obvious. I am not going to make any gripes about how this album does not sound like their old albums because, well, it does not sound like their older material. Everyone knows that, so stop writing reviews about how they do not sound like they used too or stop saying how they need to evolve. If you are a hater or lover, just judge the album by how it sounds and do not give a history of the damn band. <br /> <br />With that said, this album is quite the interesting album. I have been a Korn fan for quite a while but I had apathetic anticipation for this album, not knowing what to expect. When I was listening to it the level of content on the disc it underwhelmed me. I was amazed at the transitions that they make from song to song, with distorted bagpipes coming in and out before a new song starts. It seemed to break the boundaries of what they used to be. The transitions almost had a Mars Volta like quality, but in the style of Korn. The unfortunate thing is that about half of the songs are annoying. They do not seem like they have much thought put into them and are just annoying anthems for anguished 14-year old teenagers. I am happy that Jonathan branches out and speaks of more then just his anguished feelings, but in some of the songs the way the lyrics flow makes them unappealing. It almost seems like they are just compounded without much consideration as to the flow. The message seemed to come first before the lyrics, and it did not work in half of the songs. The weight of being a band for ten years should not be an excuse to pass some of these songs off on an album. <br /> <br />I do not know why they did not put the three songs off of the bonus disc onto the main album. The bonus album just seems like a cheap gimmick in order to get more money. If they had put the three songs onto the album (as well as the videos) and gotten rid of the mind-numbing remixes and some songs from the main album, everyone could have enjoyed the album without having to decide if they should buy one or the other. <br /> <br />While I have many problems with this album I also think that when Korn hits it good on this album, they hit it very well. \\"Open Up\\", \\"Tearjerker\\", \\"It's Me Again\\", and \\"Throw Me Away\\" are excellent songs and, to me, catalogue an extraordinary evolution in the history of Korn. Unfortunately, I feel that one half of the album does not meet the standards of the other half. With these conflicting sides battling each other in order to make the album \\"See You On The Other Side\\" I would have to split the 5 rating into a 2.5 but will round to 3 because, hell, it's Korn and most of these songs, while not sounding that great on an album, would probably take on a better quality when performed live. <br /> <br />Just because some people are new to Korn does not necessarily mean they would like this album more. It is just that old-school fan's heads still might be stuck in the past and unwilling to listen to what they have become. I can respect that, because my interest in Korn has wavered ever since the release of Untouchables (with the exception of \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\").
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Christian Bale is gorgeous! Batman Begins the best pre-quel and Batman movie I have ever seen including Burton's original. Bale is the perfect Batman, dark and mysterious Michael Caine the perfect butler humorous in his care taking.  Other roles well cast as well, Katie Holmes is convincing and sexy and did I say, Christian Bale is gorgeous!
B0007P3582|1.0|This album was straight garbage. He has nothing to talk about except for getting shot. That is so 2003. And \\"Piggybank\\" sucked. If u make a song dissing other MC's, don't make it the worse song on the album. All 50 cent has is nice beats. He has no lyrical ability. Ja Rule is way better. At least he rap about different things. Not the same s**t over and over again. G-G-G-G-G-G UNOT!!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|A refreshing break from the stage version of a helpless young girl who needs rescuing from her monstrous dictator. This is the best Phantom I have ever seen and Emmy Rossum was the right choice for the role of Christine. Her talent, beauty and palpable devotion to her teacher tells the real story in just one look and gesture of her hand. Watch the scene just once and you'll never doubt why he loved her enough to let her go. The music, sets and cinematography are incredible and last but not least,  Minnie Driver was an excellent in the role of Charolotta, successful in her role to steal the show, and actually stealing the show.
B000BP86OG|1.0|This album is doesn't even come close to 'Permission to Land'...  It's not that I'm expecting it to be the same as that one, just to have the same magic that I found there.   And sadly, I'm not hearing it with this one. Not at all.    While it still sounds like them, It's as if they've been replaced by some Darkness cover band.   [who ain't got the chops to produce music on par with the truly great music on Permission]     I am very disappointed by this album.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Great action flick and incredible acting considering how bored these two were with each other on the screen while a sizzling romance was happening behind scenes.  There is just enough flicker of the flame revealed to provide a satisfying amount of sexiness. Amongst all the guns, bombs and life threatening devices is the cleaver bickering that makes all the violence worth while.
B00005UEAR|4.0|This album is a double album. Listeners know too well how those end up being. It always seems like if it was shortened to one album, it would be a lot better. Too much filler, it seems with a lot of double albums. Not this one. Because while one is 5 7-15 minute tracks that have lyrically nothing to do with each other, the other CD is a grand 42 minute piece of music. Both have their merits. On the first CD, there is The Glass Prison, the heaviest song Dream Theater have ever written. It is absolutely punishing. No doubt the best part of the saga Portnoy wrote about Alcolohism. After that, there are 3 great tracks. I don't enjoy Disappear much, because it seems it's just Space Dye Vest part II. <br /> <br />Then, there's the big epic. A 42 minute masterwork, 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence is divided into 8 parts. Overture, About to Crash, War Inside my Head, the Test that Stumped them All, Goodnight Kiss, Solitary Shell, About to Crash Reprise, and the Finale. Every song is great, especially Goodnight Kiss, as it turns extremely badass towards the ending. The only song that you should probably skip is The Test that Stumped Them All, as it is a sh*tty song that seems forced.  <br /> <br />I strongly recommend you buy this.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|If you like sexy and intrigue, The Constant Gardener delivers magnificently on both. Believable is the chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz, as are the issues addressed in the world today, making this movie feel very real. Many times you want Fiennes to simply put his head back in the sand, you also want him to forge a head as the grizzly truths are as compelling as repulsive.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I've never seen the stage production but I think that the movie was incredible. The music is phenomenal and the story line is full of fun and emotion. This is the only movie that has ever made me cry.
B000683VI4|5.0|Incredible love story set in time, but such a true work of art makes The Notebook timeless.  The dedication and adoration displayed by the main characters as a young couple yearning for one another and then later on even as their lives seem to be narrowing to the end is an inspiration for any couple.  The slow understanding of who the man is who is reading the notebook and who he is reading it too settles in like a warm light bulb slowly coming to life, adding a sweetness to the story that could be overwhelming, but simply makes you like it even more.  Gratifying memories and feelings linger pleasantly in your consciousness for days afterwards.
B000A5TJA2|1.0|Don't know what the previous reviewer got but I, too, received a lousy imitation.
B000066NW0|3.0|Sometimes, I look at the RIAA stats and feel repulsed by the number of crap artists selling millions of records. <br /> <br />I don't consider Lavigne to be one of my Top 20 Artists of all-time...but this album leads me to believe it just might happen someday. And I certainly don't feel repulsed knowing how successful she is in music today. Avril Lavigne is talented, no doubt. I rarely listen to this album in its entirety. \\"Losing Grip, Complicated, I'm With You, Mobile, Unwanted, My World, Nobody's Fool, Too Much to Ask\\" That's 8/13 songs and in the times we live in, its called \\"Worth Your Money\\". It's hard not to find SOMETHING to like in this album (unless you get off to death metal or gothic rock)...but then, you wouldn't even bother with this. It's really a matter of how open you are to listening to various genres of music. Most people who would stay away from this record are Rock Fans, wondering if she is really punk, whether the guitar riffs disguise pop-fare as hard-rock and so on....It really depends. Its like-it-or-dislike-it. You won't instantly love it...and won't hate it either. It's good overall though. <br /> <br />P.S. The only thing Avril shares with Alanis are their Canadian roots and that their names start with A. Maybe Losing Grip reminds people of You Oughta Know? If it does, its just the whole Canadian thing. I don't think we will be hearing Avril singing anything like \\"And do you think about me when you **** her\\" anytime soon. And we certainly won't be hearing her write songs like \\"No Pressure Over Capuccino\\", \\"Hand in My Pocket\\", \\"Unsent\\" or \\"That I Would Be Good\\". She is closer to Michelle Branch in that perspective. But we shall have some good, easy-listening pop/rock...and that is never a bad thing.
B000002ACR|5.0|There are few bands that could put together an album as tuneful and diverse as 'Younger Than Yesterday', but other bands aren't what The Byrds should be measured up against.  The Byrds must be compared to themselves, and 'YTY' stands as the one of the twin peaks of the bands first incarnation, along with their previous disc, 'Fifth Dimension'.  While comparisons are often made between those two releases, I find the distinctions represent a splitting of hairs.  Both discs are revolutionary in their own right, and both possess a wealth of quality composing and musicianship.  Both also possess tracks that are obviously of lesser quality than those they are surrounded by. <br /> <br />Probably the biggest distinction between 'Fifth Dimension' and 'YTY' would involve the people penning the tracks chosen for inclusion.  David Crosby, who began his ascent within the band on 'Fifth Dimension', comes out in full force on his last dedicated recording with The Byrds, penning seven of the seventeen tracks on this edition of the album.  A much bigger surprise was the unpredictable emergence of Chris Hillman as a composer, contributing to seven of the seventeen.  Since Crosby and Hillman generally take the lead vocals on these tracks as well, and two of the tracks are versions of Bob Dylan's 'My Back Pages', there wasn't much room for Roger McGuinn to place his stamp on this, The Byrds fourth full-length release.  So the album has a different texture to it than all previous Byrd excursions. <br /> <br />'YTY' presents several stunning compositions and performances which must be seated at the top of any Byrd's compendium.  Start off with the lead track, 'So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star', a rock classic featuring a wicked Hugh Masekela contribution on trumpet.  Two of the songs, Hillman's 'Have You Seen Her Face' and 'Thoughts and Words', possess an uncanny resemblance to John-Lennnon and Paul McCartney compositions (when the two were actually composing together), creating sheer delight with their mix of distinct yet complementary melodies and choruses.  Crosby's 'Renaissance Fair' and his co-write with McGuinn, 'Why' (featuring a guitar doing a fine impression of a sitar on the bridge) are stand-out numbers as well.  Add to this the two versions of Bob Dylan's 'My Back Pages', the alternate version worthy due to its use of organ rather than McGuinn's twelve-string to provide the basic melody, and it's apparent that the disc possesses an array of elite tunes. <br /> <br />Most of the remaining tracks possess worthwhile attributes as well.  The 'Mr. Spaceman' redeux, 'C.T.A.-102' features a jaunty rhythm and comical sound FX, especially McGuinn's imitation of an alien over the fade-out.  Hillman's 'Time Between' (perhaps the first country-rock outing) features gorgeous melodies, Crosby's 'Everybody's Been Burned' possesses a haunting, melodramatic melody and incisive lyrics, 'Lady Friend' has a great chorus line, and 'The Girl With No Name' and 'It Happens Each Day' are both worthy ballads.  The use of guitar recordings played backwards on 'Thoughts and Words' and 'Mind Gardens' adds a revolutionary note to the disc.  Unfortunately, 'Mind Gardens' is way over-the-top in it's psychedelic, atonal underpinnings (although the alternate version is done in acoustic-folk mode, making it much more paletable), 'Don't Make Waves' is a fairly undistinguished pop offering, as is 'Old John Robertson', despite a unique sounding bridge, an undistinguished folk ballad.  There is also a hidden instrumental track that follows 'Old John...', an unexpected but also undistinguished entry. <br /> <br />As with all The Byrds remastered products, this disc comes complete with a collection of band photo's and displays of rare memorabilia, as well as detailed liner notes from David Fricke.  Details on each track are also offered.  The only extra a dedicated fan might find missing would be a lyrics sheet, commonly and regretably omitted from most CD's.  All in all, 'YTY' would have to be regarded as a milestone in rock history, and a must-listen for anyone interested in enjoying the best in 1960's rock, psychedelia, and popular music.
B000003TA4|5.0|\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" - THE Rock Anthem. Now, perhaps the most overplayed song in Rock Bars along with \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\". <br />\\"In Bloom\\" - Funny lyrics, great chorus which takes a dig at people who love catchy choruses & riffs, but don't bother to understand the lyrics. Ironically, this particular song is ANYTHING but deep, meaningful or thought-provoking! <br />\\"Come As You Are\\" - Great Song, Very Well-Written, Memorable Bass-Line which everyone and their mother recognises in less than second. <br />\\"Breed\\" - Gives your subwoofer a great work-out. If Cobain is most well-known for his lyrics, this song isn't the one to showcase that. <br />\\"Lithium\\" - They say Nirvana invented Quiet-Verse-Loud-Chorus. If true, then this song takes dubious honors for what's become of Modern Rock/Nu-Metal. And this song, is catchy as hell. <br />\\"Polly\\" - GREAT GREAT Song. Any kid learning to play bass/acoustic would do well to start here. Also a great track to play acoustic while trying to impress your friends. <br />\\"Territorial Pissings\\" - A lot of noise and furious drumming. <br />\\"Drain You\\" \\"Lounge Act\\" - I don't find them special. <br />\\"Stay Away\\" - A lot of screaming, furious drumming. Quiet Verse-Loud Chorus. Very average except for Dave Grohl. <br />\\"On a Plain\\" - WOW! Now THIS, is a song that deserves to be honored and mounted on a pedestal, if possible. Very intelligent lyrics, great tune... <br />\\"Something in the Way\\" - Melancholy with a beautiful Cello. <br /> <br />It's hard to understand why this is called THE de-facto legendary album. I fell in love with Nirvana for their Unplugged performance and \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\". I wasn't around in 1991 (well, I was 6)....but i can think of a lot of great albums that came around that time (Metallica's Black Album, Ten)...Sure Nirvana must've had a unique sound back then and successfully transitioned from Alternative to the Mainstream. And this might even be 5-Star material considering its pretty good at what it does: flat-out power rockers with distorted guitars and the uber manifestation of teenage-angst [although the lyrics rarely ever talk about teenage-angst in particular]. Nirvana's Nevermind was a sonic experience that shook the paintings of the walls with its brash arrogance. But no, it is not the greatest record of all time. It doesn't reveal Kurt Cobain to be a great singer [for that, you have Unplugged in New York]. It isn't Kurt Cobain's best songwriting [For that, you have In Utero]. It definitely might be Dave Grohl's & Novoselic's best. <br /> <br />Personally, if I was a 20-year-old back in 1991, I would be driving around in my car listening to \\"Estranged\\" by GnR, \\"Jeremy\\" by Pearl Jam, \\"Sad But True\\" by Metallica & \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana. In that order. But I guess I will contradict my own point when I say - \\"Not the Greatest Songs ever made...but definitely some of the best to come together on one record\\". <br /> <br />Great but not the Greatest like people make it out to be. By now, I feel as confused as ever. I want to state that this is a tad over-rated, but I seem to have a hard time convincing myself 100%. Oh well, whatever..Nevermind.
B000BKDOCA|2.0|I must admit I've taken a turn or two round the dancefloor to some of Britney Spear's many hits. \\"Toxic\\" in particular is quite thrilling. But the bottom line here is that while these tracks might pass while twirling around the disco in a drunken haze, with the mighty thump thump thump of a mega watt soundsystem in your ear, they certainly don't retain their energy or charm anywhere else. I honestly don't know who this collection might be geared to - club DJs will already have these mixes and casual fans obviously prefer the original single versions. This sort of disposable pop music is often by definition vapid and weightless (although for a time all the rage) and it seems Ms Spear's inexplicably extended fifteen minutes are just about up.
B0000027RL|5.0|I've never bothered lookin' up trivia that may reveal to me why this album is called Ten. It has 11 songs and nothing else that seems to relate to the number 10. My guess is the band listened to the record after it was mastered, realized that they had a Triple-A, 10/10, Perfect, Flawless, Ingenious, Masterful & History-Making Album which is why they called it Ten. If that is the story, then they definitely got it right! <br /> <br />Pearl Jam doesn't sound like Creed (except the voice). It doesn't sound like Alice in Chains or Soundgarden and is as closely similar to Nirvana as Britney Spears is to Bruce Springsteen. Or Barbara Streisand & Eminem. What it does sound like is magic. There isn't a weak link in this band. And although Mr. Vedder does deserve special mention for the contribution he makes to the band, the other members are not just a back-up band. Mike McCready may not be as cool-looking as Slash or Joe Perry but he & Stone Gossard bombard the listeners with some crunching and slick guitar-work that is NOTHING like what you heard on Nevermind. Now I love Nirvana as much as the next guy...but what Pearl Jam achieved with Ten is nothing short of miraculous. Yes, this is the album that made me want to say, \\"I'm a Rock Music Fan & I'm proud of it!\\" like I had never said it before. This is the album that had me air guitar to \\"Alive\\" atleast 600 times (and counting). This is the album that had me attempting to match Mr. Vedder's growls at the end of \\"Jeremy\\" every time I heard it. This is the album that had me trying to match Vedder's ability to hit the high notes on \\"Release\\", while trying to drop low to the opening lines of \\"Black\\". Of course, it also made me realize how lousy a singer I am ;) <br /> <br />All in all, this was the greatest record to come out in the 90's beyond doubt. I'd like to believe the whole of last century but then, I don't know much about music before that (except Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd & some Who and a few others). Its without a doubt that this band, Pearl Jam, shocked the world with their dream debut...and haven't let down their fans ever since. Pearl Jam & Oasis, I thank you for being there while I was growing up in the 90's!
B000002PCS|5.0|'Somewhere In Time' is the ultimate tragedy/romance film. Made in '80, it has been one of my favorite films and musical scores for the last 25 years. John Barry's soundtrack is elegant, intensely romantic and will bring the listener to tears whether they have seen the movie or not. To me that is definitely the final and most important test of the value of the music.<br /><br />Definitely for the thoughtful, romantic and emotional personality. Turn out the lights, put the CD on and find a comfortable spot. The music will ellicite feelings and emotions that you never knew you had.
B000002MY3|5.0|I must have been buried under a rock back in 1995 because I didn't have a clue about Alanis Morissette until I happened to catch her on MTV Unplugged in 1999. Wow! That was an amazing performance! I looked her up and found that she had also sold 16 million copies of this album! Double Wow! So I headed down to the music store and bought this album, as well as unplugged. <br /> <br />The first time I heard her voice come on in \\"All I Really Want\\", I actually grinned. \\"She's a best-selling artist with this voice?\\" After the song got over, I hit the back button and listened to it again. I listened to it 4 times before I went on to Track 2. In that one song, her voice had planted its prints somewhere inside my brain which seemed to say, \\"From this point onwards, you are NEVER going to forget this voice, the riffs...and the urgency in Alanis' voice.\\" I move on to \\"You Oughta Know\\" and the whole process repeats itself. So there are a lot of albums that open great (Once/Even Flow/Alive from Ten come to mind) but can how long before the filler kicks in? I waited for that on Ten...and I waited for that on this record but it didn't happen. Nope, I was left scratching my head. Was it alternative, alternative hard rock, adult/alternative, adult/contemporary, pop....it was hard to tell. \\"Perfect\\" might have been a song one could expect to see on her Third record...but no, it immediately followed \\"All I Really Want\\" & \\"You Oughta Know\\", two tracks that are as energy packed and heavy-riff driven as you can imagine. The first two songs displayed great production & songwriting with some \\"good-but-not-great vocals\\". Perfect changes all of that. Then I listened to \\"Hand in My Pocket\\" and asked myself how lyrics that simple managed to establish her as THE songwriter of the decade (tied in with Vedder). Ed Vedder's lyrics aren't simple, but reveal great emotion. Alanis Morissette's lyrics are extremely simple on \\"Hand in My Pocket\\", but reveal as much sensitivity and craft. I can go on and on about the rest of the tracks, but I wonder if I can do a job as well as the other hundreds of reviewers.  <br /> <br />I'm here to remind you that this should've been the album that should've ended Jacko's Thriller as the Best-Selling Album Ever. Yup, today, I think Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" was the greatest record of the Last Century. But I feel this is a record that almost ANYONE could listen to and love like it were their child. I don't listen to it much these days, considering the hundreds (maybe thousands of spins) it's had...but on this record, (and a lot of people might hate me for this) this young woman from Canada captured the rebellious spirit of the 90's generation better than Nirvana's Nevermind did. I say that because even though she was a rebellious, angry soul...she still had hope...
B00003CWPL|3.0|A wonderful film.  One of the most important movies of its time.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />The best way to attend a showing of Eraserhead is to take your own chair and place it near the front of the auditorium facing the crowd.  Observing the audience reactions to this \\"interesting\\" film is a much more enjoyable and enlightening way to spend 90 minutes than watching what is on the screen.<br /><br />Bizarre stuff -- kind of intriguing in spots.  May turn you off chicken for a while.  Definitely not a film to see if maintaining a positive outlook on life is not one of your strong points.  It may just push you over the edge.<br /><br />Otherwise, a good Friday Night film.  You'll forget whatever has been eating at you during the week.  The boss driving you nuts?  About ready to kill your coworkers?  The spouse plucking at your last nerve?  Watch Eraserhead.  You'll forget all about it.<br /><br />Sorry I can't be anymore descriptive than this; I don't have any kind of reference point to attach it to.  Nobody does.  This is one STRANGE movie.<br /><br />I actually have a friend who likes this film.  He appears to be a sane, intelligent human being other than that.<br /><br />The best thing about it is that there is very little likelihood of anyone generating an insipid remake, or any remake for that matter.  It's one of a kind.  And for that, we can be thankful.

B000060OFT|1.0|this movie simply does no justice to shakespeare.  for those who have spent time studing him they know that his words are ULTRA important.  in this movie they yell constantly.  never between the feuding families do they speak to one another without yelling.  it is possible to act angry and not yell.  this movie was a great dissapointment to me.  they skipped over all the little witty lines that make the play wonderful and just took out the guns to shoot people. skip it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is the greatest gay movie that has ever been made in my opinion. It is heartwarming, romantic, and sad towards the end when Jack got killed by those awful straight dudes he got messed up with. I was really hoping that Ennis and Jack would have been with each other for the reast of their lives because I could tell they really loved each other in spite of their rocky start. <br />
0783116934|5.0|Ably directed by Chris Gerolmo and filmed entirely in Budapest, Hungary, CITIZEN X is the true story of the excruciating bureaucratic problems faced by a young forensic pathologist (Lt. Viktor Burakov, played to the hilt by Stephen Rea ) assigned as an investigator to the Soviet Union's worst serial murder. During Burakov's first night on the job as a crime pathologist, a young girl is brought in -- and immediately he notices that the detective was wrong saying she had been killed in a field. \\"Go back and look for evidence in a nearby wood,\\" he orders the tired and bored policemen. \\"Now?!\\" they ask increduluosly. Burakov insists, now. Grudgingly they go back -- only to return with half a dozen decomposed bodies of youngsters from the nearby forest. <br /> <br />Thus begins CITIZEN X. When the next day an exhausted Burakov makes a report to a police committee on the grisly serial murder of children, his superior Col. Mikhail Fetisov (wonderfully well played by the irrascible Donald Sutherland) quietly winces. The Communist Party Secretary who wields the power in the room Comrade Bondarchuk (similarly well played, Russian accent and all, by British actor Joss Ackland) contemptously rejects Burakov's theory because, \\"serial murders are impossible in the USSR! Those only exist in the degenerate capitalist countries.\\" Burakov is speechless. <br /> <br />Recognizing Bukarov's single minded dedication to solve the murders, Col. Fetisov assigns the bewildered pathologist to lead the investigation. The rest of the film takes us through the torturous experiences of Bukarov trying to track down the real murderer as fresh childen's bodies keep piling up. And as he gets closer to solving the crimes, the competing villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system that is drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. Valuable time is being wasted as Comrade Bondarchuk becomes all the more menacing because Bukarov is not subordinating himself to this bureaucrat's wrong crime theories. <br /> <br />All of the supporting actors (Bukarov's angelic wife and his children) are as good in their roles as are those playing the main characters. But there is a continuity problem here.  <br /> <br />Twelve years were to have passed between the beginning of the film and the end, yet Lt. Burakov's children do not age in those twelve years.  <br /> <br />Later in the film, Max von Sidow's convincingly plays a clinical psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky who reluctantly agrees to try profiling the murderer (not really what he had been trained to do). Somewhere in the middle of all this, the Soviet Union undergoes a complete collapse. Yet Bukarov keeps investigating as though his life depended on it.  <br /> <br />The film's climax is spellbinding.
B00007BH5C|5.0|In his review of the original publication of \\"The Two Towers\\", the great C.S. Lewis wrote: \\"Here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron; here is a book that will break your heart.\\" <br /> <br />Now Tolkien was a friend of his - so Lewis's objectivity is open to question. [And truth be told: for me, the books have never fully lived up to their reputation. Which meant that part of what made living through the release of the films so exciting was seeing how spectacularly this Tolkien geek (fat and bearded - like a good Tolkien geek should be) had managed to articulate the nobility and the beauty that the other Tolkien geeks had always seen in the books.] But to whatever extent those words are true of the novel, they are the best possible description of the music that Howard Shore wrote for its film adaptation. <br /> <br />In fact, I will claim that the scores are the single most important factor in the films being as great as they are. Consider the shot that introduces Shadowfax - a minor event in the narrative. [If you saw the movie, I am certain you have not forgotten it.] On paper, it would have verged on cheesy. <br /> <br />117. EXT - DAY   <br /> <br />A majestic white horse gallops up to Gandalf. <br /> <br />           LEGOLAS <br /> <br />That is one of the Mearas. Unless my <br />eyes are cheated by some spell. <br /> <br />As filmed by Jackson, with a subtle use of slow motion and an anamorphic lens, it is a striking visual - conveying more artfully than the expository dialogue that this is no run-of-the-mill inn pony. Still, if you view the shot without sound, it is not much more than picturesque. It is left to Shore to do the impossible - to create a sound as epic yet exquisite as Tolkien's description of this legendary animal: \\"And there was one among them that may have been foaled in the morning of the world.\\" <br /> <br />And this is just the horse, folks. Can you imagine having to create sounds worthy of evoking such immortal events as the fall of Gandalf from the Bridge of Barad'dur? The lonely sadness of the Shieldmaiden of Rohan? The hopeless stand of Theodin King at Helm's Deep? Not merely to find emotions that great within yourself, mind you - but to articulate them in practice through the workday medium of 100 union musicians and a 48-track recording studio? And to *actually accomplish it*? <br /> <br />If I ever meet Mr. Shore, I will be hard pressed not to fall to my knees and chant \\"We're not worthy!\\" This seems to me the surest proof that one has achieved the summit of one's art - to elicit not mere enjoyment, but gratitude.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Some reviewers have said this is an \\"anti-war\\" movie. That may be optimistic. Maybe it is a movie about the misery of being a submariner on a suicide mission near the end of a war they know has been lost. But I think director Wolfgang Petersen tried and succeeded in presenting an honest portrayal of the once proud German \\"wolf pack\\" U-boat hunters of the sea who would sink anything afloat for the Fatherland. <br /> <br />Exhausted and demoralized men, the film opens with their drunken cabaret party in occupied France just before they ship out on yet another mission. The tough, thoughtful captain played by Jrgen Prochnow is becoming contemplative. He loves his men, and he seems certain each mission will be their last. Yet he is the strictly by the book warrior who will follow his orders to the end. <br /> <br />What carries the film is the conflict between military commeraderie and purpose, combined with certain failure and danger, and imminent death under the sea. Yes there is an undercurrent throughout DAS BOOT of repressed contempt by the U-boat captain for the Nazis, their discredited ideology and even Hitler and his henchmen. But one cannot help wondering whether this is part of loyalty to the truth of the actual U-boat officers' attutudes to the politicians in Berlin in 1945 ... or a contemporary impulse to be politically correct in Germany of the late 20th Century. <br /> <br />The combination of superb acting and unbelievably skillful camera work aboard an actual submarine made this among the 20th Century's most outstanding war films from any country. Also it froze in time a group of mostly young and bewildered submariners who had to function highly efficiently while at the same time, nearly constantly paralyzed by fear. <br /> <br />There is some glory and very much sadness and tragedy in DAS BOOT. Mainly, the film exhibits the terrifying absurdity of life on a German U-boat at the end of the Third Reich, lived by gallant but doomed young men ... and that of their leaders who while not much older than their subordinates have been made ancient by their ordeals in warfare. This film is intense and continually absorbing. No one can be indifferent while viewing DAS BOOT. A real spellbinder.
0679441018|1.0|I had the Misfortune to read this piece of Literary garbage when I was about 16. You would think that a teenager back then would be more easily captivated by this book, but wrong!  This novel is utterly proposterous! Even a kid can't stop from feeling the need to throw this book away!  After getting a new vampire buddy (David,thanks to some body switching fiasco in the previous book) Lestat meets a new character : Satan himself! yeah that is right, the Biblical character that represents all Evil on earth. Anyways, in the meantime, he falls in love with a nun named DORA (Don't laugh yet). this Dora person is the daughter of a New Orleans mafia guy...Being unable to suck her blood due to \\"moral issues\\" Lestat proceeds to feed from Dora's menstrual cycle...I guess this is what Anne Rice considers romantic. As if that wasn't bad enough, Memnoch takes Lestat for a tour... where? TO THE LIFE OF JESUS HIMSELF! that's right! Lestat gets to meet jesus, and he meets GOD as well...  That book was supposedly written when Rice got really sick and she became a newborn Christian, which is totally valid but mixing vampires with the Bible is going way too far.  I only recommend this book to die hard Rice fans who will read and love any junk she is willing to publish...   I wonder if I can get a refund if i send this book back to her address as well...
0765348780|4.0|I received the first three books in the series as a gift from a friend who thought that I would enjoy them. I did enjoy this first book, but not without reservations.<br /><br />The Malazan Book of the Fallen introduces a very complex fantasy world with nation politics, a multi-tiered magic/religion system, multiple races, and a whole lot of fighting. Often when a writer is going to introduce the reader to this kind of fantasy world, they do it through the eyes of a child coming of age. Both the main character and the reader get introduced at the same moment to the key concepts when you begin with this kind of trope. Erikson provides no such easy way out for the reader. You are flung from the beginning into a swiftly moving situation, and left on your own to figure out what everything means. Although this does eventually work, it takes quite a while to get into the book as a result. Many readers may give up before getting to the point where they understand what is going on in Gardens of the Moon.<br /><br />Ultimately, I was intrigued by the world of the novel. It is very heavy on the battle detail, which may turn off some more magic-and-intrigue-oriented fantasy fans. I found the characters to be the strongest point (something that I would not have predicted during the first few chapters). The personalities feel quite real. Sometimes the very reality is distracting, as Erikson layers out even the most minor of characters with an attendant set of quirks and personality traits.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is a very long book. Furthermore, it is a very dense long book. The amount of material that he crams into the 657 pages is huge and quite probably too much. Still, he nearly gets away with it-- and given how complex the project is, that achievement is enough to keep me reading into the next in the series.<br /><br />If you are a reader who likes George R.R. Martin and feel like you can tolerate even more complexity, then this might be a book for you. If your fantasy tastes run more to Lynn Flewelling and Mercedes Lackey, then I suggest you take a miss on The Malazan Book of the Fallen.f your fantasy tastes run more to Lynn Flewelling and Mercedes Lackey, then I suggest you take a miss on The Malazan Book of the Fallen.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I plan on purchasing this the day it comes out.  I saw it opening day, and having seen it on stage twice, I really think the movie version is amazing. <br /> <br />Many of the songs were cut out for the film version, but considering the musical is almost four hours, I think it was perfectly understandable for them to cut out the songs that they did.  I found the most appealling aspect of the transformation to be the sets.  I knew that, with this being a film version, they would have the ability to move from scene to scene.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that the musical takes place on stage with few set changes.  But being able to see different rooms in different buildings and various areas of the city really made the movie enjoyable.  Also, having all but two of the original cast memebers made the film that much more impressive.  Some of the lyrics were changed, but not to a degree that made the music any less enjoyable.  It was also impressive to see some of the lyrics transformed into dialogue for this version. <br /> <br />I think whether you've seen the musical on stage or not, this is still a film worth seeing.  The music is incredible, the acting is awesome, and the cinematography itself is phenomenal.  Definitely check it out.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson's lard-a**ed, amped-up, super-spectacular \\"King Kong\\" goes the distance in answering the age-old question: Where does a 25 foot, 5-ton Gorilla sit?<br /><br />Answer: anywhere he damn well pleases.<br /><br />Even if that means getting his hairy a** shot off the top of the Empire State Building by a squadron of Army Air Corps biplanes, all amped up on pure aerial fury and a boatload of Giant Monkey-hatred. Yaaaar! You thump dat chest, big fella, we got gatling guns!<br /><br />There's really nothing that's gonna tax your brain in Peter Jackson's Minimum Opus, and it's all pretty much by the book: Girl gets tired of eating in soup kitchen, Girl goes to Skull Island, Ape meets Girl, Ape falls for Girl, Girl flees to New York, Ape takes an even bigger fall. Lucky for New Yorkers Kong didn't have a high fiber diet.<br /><br />In the end it's an oddly muted, curiously intimate Spectacle Movie: all the juicy moments are in the long slow-burn shots, where Kong (the inimitable Andy Serkis all spruced up via CGI into yowling, scowling, frowning, brooding uber-Simian) and ingenue Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts, whose lips launched a thousand ships) share some girl-on-ape quality time atop the high places of the two most fearsome islands on Earth, Skull & Manhattan.<br /><br />For all the sound and fury, \\"Kong\\" isn't as spectacular as it wants to be: when it stumbles, it's because Peter Jackson is trying too hard. Take the dinosaur tumble sequence---what the H*ll was that all about?<br /><br />It's just freakish, astoundingly goofy, totally out of place and tone: not for a single second did the sequence suspend my disbelief---wait a sec, you got a bunch of fat Manhattanites doing the 15-minute-mile beneath the thousand-ton feet of a herd of hopped-up dinos, and you're telling the whole bunch of 'em ain't gonna get squished?<br /><br />Whatever. \\"Kong\\" is intermittently fun, occasionally astounding, and often spectacular, provided you check your cynicism at the door. WETA-New Zealand's giant monkey is an astonishing master-work, a coup of theatrical art for the ages: he has a helluva lot more charisma, pathos, and screen presence than rival Jack Driscoll (the ugly Adrien Brody, playing the world's most godawful playwright). If you're not jumping up and down in your seat and rooting for Kong to knock those pesky, b*tch-a** bi-planes outta the sky, you're not breathing.<br /><br />And let's cut to the guts of the deal: the duel at the top of the World took my breath away, and, frankly, there's nothing as delicious, and ghoulish (though Jackson could have added a little more splatter!), than the nasty spider-pit sequence, which underscored this point: there are far nastier things on Skull Island than King Kong.<br /><br />And the acting? It works just fine: Naomi Watts (Darrow) could just purse her lips all days and it would be alright by me. Jack Black (Denham) smacks of the theater and a little brimstone: he gets the balance between the sulphur of unfettered greed and the wide-eyed wonder of a spoiled child. Brody is, well, Brody: ugly, gawky, and puzzling.<br /><br />In all of his incarnations---particularly in the unloved 1976 version, which is superior in dignity and terror to this outing---Kong has always struck me as a fascinating figure: a loner, a kind of outcast. Perhaps he is King of Terrors to the cowering natives---who in Jackson's opus are more horrific than Kong---but he's more of a sad, brooding, wandering nobleman, cursed by fate, the last of his kind, apparently---more at war than at home with his fellow weird, hungry denizens of Skull Island.<br /><br />In the end, Jackson succeeds because he gets his arms around the central truth of the Kong legend: the King of Skull Island is lonely, just like the rest of us.<br /><br />Flawed, goofy, encumbered by its CGI: it doesn't matter, there is something so masterfully soulful about King Kong himself that the movie scores one for the ages, if only in the fact that it makesme care about a creature who truly, madly, deeply---isn't there.<br /><br />If that isn't magic, what is? Wonder of the World?<br /><br />Indeed.<br /><br />JSGif only in the fact that it makes me care about a creature who truly, madly, deeply---isn't there.  <br /> <br />If that isn't magic, what is?

B00005JOFO|5.0|By telling the story of two cowboys in love, this movie was sure to explode into the public concious, and the only question on my lips was whether the film would justify its popularity or was merely going to gain acclaim for its controversial subject matter. <br /> <br />The movie follows the lives of two cowboys, Ennis and Jack.  Originally working together in isolation as sheep herders on \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", Ennis (Heath Ledger) is charged with staying at camp, cooking and cleaning, while Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) stays in the field with the sheep, protecting them from coyotes, only to return to camp for meals - already a domestic divide is introduced and the idea of them depending upon each other is formed. <br /> <br />In the solitude of the mountains a sexual relationship beings  between the two men.  However, their employment is terminated prematurely and the two men say goodbye to each other to live their seperate lives; get married, have children.  One day Ennis receives a postcard from Jack suggesting they meet up, and from that point an on-and-off affair takes place between the two lovers over the next twenty years, with the pair meeting every few months to stay at Brokeback Mountain, the only place the two men can find refuge to love each another.  The mountain becomes an oasis where they can truly be themselves, however it is created at the expensive of their other relationships. <br /> <br />Superb acting between the two front men enguages the audience in to the story, however, it is the acting of the supporting cast, especially Ennis' wife (Michelle Williams), that really ground the project into reality and the audiences emotional centre - Williams would even ask her co-actors Ledger and Gyllenhaal to passionately kiss offscreen to help fuel her emotional performance; a task showing all threes commitment to the script. <br /> <br />This is a chaotic story of two men that are not comfortable in finding comfort with each other, cannot possibly find comfort in a society that doesn't accept them (as pointed out by Ennis' tale of the two men that lived together only for one to be publicly lynched) and don't find comfort in their hetrosexual relationships.  It is so deep in messages that trying to pinpoint them all would be to insult Ang Lee's vision; watch the film, at worst, it's a little drawn-out and slow, at best, it's life-changing.
B00007G207|5.0|An interesting and well-crafted homage to the role of movies in a small Italian town, circa 1944-54. But it's a lot more than that, too. A young boy befriends the local movie projectionist (played by Phillippe Noiret), who takes him under his wing and teaches him (while reminding us, in case we've forgotten) about the emotional power the movies can have on the populace. The boy becomes a young man, falls in love with a girl whom he loses, and on the urging of Noiret leaves the small town and goes to Rome to pursue his star (he becomes a famous movie maker, of course). The movie is warm with the nostalgia of a bygone era, though it comes dangerously close to being a sentimental weeper at the end. The acting is excellent. The shorter version is definitely the better of the two.
B000001FG5|3.0|This CD is good. But, it will never equal \\"Main Course\\" or 2 of their non hit producing CD's (Mr. Natural & Life In A Tin Can). More than likely the reason this one was so popular was...The year it was released some rock & roll stations was referring themselves as The Album Rock Station as one of Indy's local station's did. So \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" album had every song played. The tunes are good. But, just like another reviewer quoted basically, \\"Why does Barry have to scream\\"? Who knows? So if your into a lot of screaming and whining in your music. Then this albums for you!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|In Britain this was voted the best film of 2005 by BBC Film 2005 viewers, this film beat off competition from many so called blockbusters like :- Batman begins, Star Wars & Sin City. It's a Science fiction film where plot and characterisation have not been submerged by pointless CGI and the need to merchandise a myriad nasty plastic toys. Devoid of bug eyed monsters and pseudo mystic waffle, this is a story about believable people in a futuristic setting, even non Sci Fi buffs can enjoy it. The TV & paper reviewers knew it was good, but that wasn't adequately reflected in the cinema attendance figures, which is a pity as it simply is a superior movie. A lot of people went for marketing hype rather than quality and watched the wrong film. I just hope that the DVD sales of the movie and TV series are sufficient to keep things flying true and get the next film into production. <br />Buy it, then buy a copy for each of your friends.
0307276902|5.0|It's interesting that it seems the thing to do is jump on the bandwagon and cut James Frey down for the innacuracies and impossibilities in the book. Embellishment or not, only James Frey will know how much of his story is actually true.  <br /> <br />This book is not about facts and figures. James Frey himself said in an interview, \\"Who wants to read a book about smoking cigarettes in rehab?\\"  These stories, whether fact or fiction, make the pages turn faster, but don't contribute to what the story is really about, which is one person's self discovery.  Anyone who's been through something tramatic can relate to the emotions expressed in the book. Throughout the book I found myself thinking over and over again \\"wow, I've experienced many of these same feelings of fear, intense anger, and hopelessness.\\"  I'm not going to go out on a limb and say that somehow James Frey \\"saved\\" me, but I am inspired by his raw emotion. I am appreciative of his bravery in baring his soul to the world.  I don't know how anyone could fabricate such raw emotions.  <br /> <br />To know if you'll like the book, it really depends on what you are looking for.  If you can't get beyond his dialog that sits sporadic on the pages, or if you are looking for a story that is made up entirely of straight up facts, I suggest you keep looking.  However, if you are looking to be inspired by a book that tugs at the heart strings, and exposes all kinds of emotions and may cause you to look deeper into yourself, then this is truly an excellent read.

0767805712|1.0|Some information in the \\"Product Details\\" section for the non-Superbit DVD release of \\"Gattaca\\" may cause confusion as to whether this issue includes a widescreen (2.35:1) presentation.  The \\"Format\\" section lists the available presentation as \\"Full Screen\\" (i.e. \\"Pan & Scan\\" for any widescreen theatrical movie), while the \\"Aspect Ratio\\" section lists a 2.35:1 (widescreen) aspect ratio.  To clear things up, the theatrical presentation is widescreen (2.35:1), but the DVD presentation is pan & scan (1.33:1), not widescreen.  It says so on the back of the DVD case cover insert.  The Superbit DVD release of \\"Gattaca\\" includes a widescreen presentation at a heftier price.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|I was really anticipating this release.  When I first heard of the reunion, I almost tried to attend the london show.  Cream was one of the 1st bands to catch my ear that made me want to play guitar.  2 rants: 1. The cream guitar tone and energy was what made cream the legend it was.  Well, on this reunion, clapton plays a strat - which always has had thin sounding single pickups compared to humbuckers in a gibson.  There is no getting around it.  A strat is a strat.  You can pay $250 for a cheapo, or $1900 for an artist signature strat - but the sound of a strat single pickup is thin and always will be.  I do not care if clapton is using his lifeless sounding lace sensors that he played along with his phil collins produced pop stuff, or the noiseless fenders(and powerless) pickups in his new signature strat.  Now, a strat has its advantages for sure.  A great clean sounding guitar that a bluesman or country picker will cherish.  You want a dire straits sound- get a strat.  BUT if you want the classic CREAM sound - use a gibson.  Yes, clapton's strat does sound ok, but it does not sound like a gibson.  Just because he is endorced by fender....  oh well... off my soapbox. <br />2.  The energy is not there.  These guys are playing like 3 old guys!  When ginger sings his song, it is nastalgic yes, but it makes me a little nervous- waiting for him to fall off his drum kit!  These guys seem to be falling asleep during some of these songs.  Jack Bruce sounds pretty good on vocals.  Do not get me wrong.  I love Cream.  I still to this day usually have one of their cd's in my 12 disc changer.  But when I got the dvd, I could not even watch it all the way thru.  I have had it since its first days release, and still have not watched all of it.  The strongest songs are the blues.  Stormy monday is good.  Rollin' and Tumlin' is good.  Also, Sunshine of your love is great.  But NO wah-wah in white room- and the slow pace???  That was my fav cream song of all time!!!  Crossroads-they may just have well played it sitting down with acoustics.  It is cool to see them play stuff they never had a chance to play live before breaking up.  But it would have been really cool to see them play a few more songs that surprised the audience.   There is virtually no banter between the 3 legends.  And not much talk to the audience.  You would think there would be more interaction.  Yes, this can be seen as a plus - just let the music do the talking. That is what cream was always about - a true jam band. BUT if only the music was doing that...  I still give this 4 of 5 stars for the legendary reunion that was to never be.  And compared to all the junk released these days called music, this is 10 stars!!!  But could these guys maybe have kicked it up a notch???  Give eric a Les Paul standing in front of a marshall stack, a wah-wah, and a shot of expresso next time they play live!!!
B0007TKNII|5.0|Joel Schumacher has given our world the most visually and acoustically stunning musical theater performance ever achieved on film.  It is a precious gift for the ages.    PS:  The saddest thing in all the world is when Christine finds it within herself to kiss the Phantom, twice; and when he then tells her he loves her and, in agony, accepts back the ring she returns.    PPS:  Great voice or no, Gerard Butler's abilities for pulling us into the depths of his despair over nonacceptance and unrequited love are masterful........we cry along with him.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I think it's ridiculous the amount of bullsh*t that Slipknot get, yes they are nu-metal, but there on of the best nu-metal acts out there, no matter how hard they worked on this album they still get a load of bull from \\"real metal\\" fans, seriously quit being so close minded<br /><br />This is a good album, and by far Slipknot's most mature to date, don't get me wrong, I love old slipknot, but this is great<br /><br />1. Prelude 3.0- A pretty good opener, didn't like it at first, but it grew on me 4/5<br /><br />2. The Blister Exists- Jesus christ! This is my favourite song off the whole album! After hearing Corey scream \\"123!!\\" you know it's gonna be an awesome song 9/5<br /><br />3. Three Nil- Not as great as I used to think, but still REALLY good, \\"Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction, maybe I'm looking for any direction\\" good line 5/5<br /><br />4. Duality- Good choice for a single, awesome chorus 7/5<br /><br />5. Opium Of The People- It's ok, just not really standout 3.5/5<br /><br />6. Circle- For a slow song, it's great! About reincarnation (I think) 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Welcome- Good song, just nothing special 3.5/5<br /><br />8. Vermilion- Beutifal (sp??) song here, and the solo is great! 5/5<br /><br />9. Pulse Of The Maggots- For the slipknot fans, another solo, but it's not really that good, the rest is great though 4.5/5<br /><br />10. Before I Forget- One of my favourites, about evolution 7/5<br /><br />11. Vermilion Pt. 2- I'm digging it, I used to despise it though 4.5/5<br /><br />12. The Nameless- Nice song here, about wifebeating 6/5<br /><br />13. The Virus Of Life- Strange song here, the strangest on the whole album, it's good though, and I think we know what it's about 5/5<br /><br />14. Danger - Keep Away- A good ending to an awesome album 4/5<br /><br />Overall this is awesome, there is alot more difference from their past albums, there's not more angst or out of control foul language, their most mature album, I'm not ashamed to say that Ilike slipknot, But it's pretty annoying to see most of their fans bashing on this album, even though IOWA's my favourite, recommended: Yes
0307276902|1.0|Had I not found out that this book was based on complete fabrication, I would have left an entirely different review.  But the singular reason I enjoyed the book so much was that I thought it was real -a series of uncanny conincidences and extraordinary evidents with a bittersweet ending. <br /> <br />It took me a while to get into reading it, not because of the graphic details of going through detox (the puking, the blood), but James Frey paints himself as super-human.  The infamous going through a root canal without sedatives, pulling out his stiches prematurely, breezing through the weeks of rehab by playing poker and making jokes, ditching the blue book and all rules of recovery by sticking to his own principles, playing a keen Sherlock Holmes when his love interest leavees the clinic and ends up in a crackhouse, etc.  I never got the sense or truly bought that he truly understood what it was to be an addict. A decade of abusing alohcol, sniffing glue, and smoking crack daily  while vomiting blood and not being able to keep down food, also on a daily, leave you as a resemblance of something that may have once been human.  Anyone having gone through it personally or knowing anyone who had gone through it, would know that.  This is very different from this mug shots which show a healhty, fresh faced boy in a crisp button down shirt.  (How does he keep his clothes so clean after passing out in alleys and crack houses?) <br /> <br />There are so many elemenets that seemed fake.  Had I picked up this book with the understanding that it was fiction, in all honesty, I would never have made it past the 2nd chapter.  James Frey, in interview after interview, credits himself for his writing style and his stregth.  I'm sure he was nothing more than a party animal who was admitted to Hazelden after his parents thought he was an alcoholic and treatened to cut off his inheritance if he didn't recover. <br /> <br />Shame on Oprah for her unrelenting seal of approval.  Of course, she will do nothing short of praise him since she inducted his book into her book club with a shower of tears on her show.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book.  If James Frey had paid attention during the recovery process he would have learned that one of the most important steps towards betterment is honesty.  This book is nothing short of some garbage supermarket novel.
B00005T30L|3.0|I loved the original Daniel Clowes graphic novel. I found the story engaging and the characters really interesting. I had read this after the movie came out, so I waited until it came out on TV.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not exactly a 'purist' in that every detail needs to be exactly copiied from the book. As long it more or less stays faithful to the general plot and characters I'm satisfied.<br /><br />Ghost World takes a completely different take than the book. Whereas the book focused on Enid and Rebecca's relationship, the film more or less spends more time with a character exclusive to the film named Seymour, a nerdy records collector.<br /><br />After a while it seems like Steven Buscemi's character becomes the protagonist of the film. He came across as more pathetic than sympathetic. There were times when I cringed for him, but overall I found the scenes with him to be boring. The fact that he soon becomes smitten with a girl who just graduated high school just seems downright creepy. (Although Enid becomes attracted to him as well for some reason) At times it feels somewhat like 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. Chief Bromden may narrate the book, but the story centers around McMurphy more than anyone else.<br /><br />There are still some elements from the book, but they are more or less there just to be there. Enid's 'friend' who's interested in serial killers and the occult pops in for one or two scenes and is forgotten. His only reason for being there is well...because he was in the book. The love triangle subplot, one of the bigger parts about the book, is completely ommitted as well. Rather, these are shelfed in order to make room for Buscemi's plots.<br /><br />Rebecca's role is severely shortened and thus we never really get to see who she is. At times she seems cold and downright cruel. Scarlet Johannson does a decent job with what she's given, but although she's very attractive, she doesn't really fit in her character.<br /><br />Thora Birch does a good job as Enid. The scenes with her just being herself and not revolving around Seymour are the best. Her sarcastic behavior at a garage sale and at a movie theater are hillarious.<br /><br />The film also drags and seems boring at times, even depressing. Granted, the graphic novel isn't exactly cheerful but it was still somewhat enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, it was  a decent film but could have been a lot better.Birch does a good job as Enid.

0385338686|4.0|Because you would end up giving bad review of this book which it doesn't deserve. ..<br />I gave this book 4 stars only because I have read 'can you keep a secret?' before this and found it much funnier , kind of felt let down after reading that book. But this is still a good book about a high power lawyer working at great firm on the verge of fulfilling her lifelong dream when everything crashes down. And she thinks her life is over since her dream is over but then she realized when she started living an absolutely different life that life is not all about having a successful career, but also doing something that fulfills you more than any career can ever do. About having love of the people around you.<br />Now everyone is entitled to their opinions, and I know many women would find this book antifeminist and say that this book is disgrace for all the women. But I am not one of them. I am a housewife. I do housework, take care of my kids and husband and in my free time I read romance novels. All these things I find quiet fulfilling and I am happy with my life. I have got no career to speak of, I am not proud of the fact but I am also not ashamed. It's just the way I am. I am not a very ambitious person so this kind of life works well for me. It might not work for all women. So its all about individual choice.<br />In this book Samantha Sweeting the lawyer never knew there could be different stress free life for her , so she thought she was happy with her life but when she got the taste of a better , stress free, relaxed and a life filled with love she opted out of her former life. She was just not the kind of person to be happy just being a lawyer, it is as simple as that. For her mother who made her believe that the only way to a good life is successful career that might have been true for her but for Samantha it was not true, as it is not true for me.<br />I was quiet pleased with the ending.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|Ever since the Glitter debacle in 2001, and the aborted comeback of \\"Charmbracelet\\", I have eagerly awaited Mariah's   return to form. I, along with Mariah's legion of fans received our wish this year when \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" hit the   ground running. The first single, \\"It's Like That\\" was a club song, but gave little hint of the album's offerings.  The second single became ubiquitous.  \\"We Belong Together\\" became what most artists can only hope for:  a multi-format smash.  The song's success in the pop and R&B arenas was expected, but the song quickly spread to the adult formats.  This song   was simultaneously in the top 20 of multiple charts, while breaking airplay records.  At first I didn't find the song that   spectacular. It took repeated airplay to get it in my head.  Even months after its success I found myself singing it.  The re  -release includes the remix as well. I'm usually luckwarm to these guest rapper/new lyric things, but this one works,   especially the verse from \\"Two Occasions\\".  Even with all of the success, it's a simple song at heart.  Mariah messed up a   relationship, and now wants it back.  The song also displays something many fans feared gone-Mariah's voice.  The   album as a whole displays her voice, though she is more subtle in her delivery than the \\"Fantasy\\" days of a decade ago.   While \\"We Belong Together\\" restablished Mariah at radio, \\"Shake It Off\\" continued the trend.  SIO was another smash for   Mariah, becoming inescapable as WBT slowly started to wane.  For the fourth single a new song appeared.  \\"Don't   Forget About Us\\"  could be considered a sequel to WBT.  This one grabbed me immediately, and I awaited eagerly for   the re-release.  It may seem silly to some to have two copies of the same album, one with a few extra tracks (Of course,   I have two versions of Music Box, because I found one from Europe with a bonus track. I'm a completist).  The re-  release, including three new songs (and the aforementioned WBT remix), does not detract from the original album, which   successfully combines ballads with hip-hop inspired dance numbers. The opening three tracks, all singles, give way to   \\"Mine Again\\", another classic Mariah ballad that puts her voice on display. The next track is a scorcher:  \\"Say Somethin'\\"   is a dance track featuring Snoop Dogg, with whom Mariah had previously shown musical chemistry.  He postures, she squeals,   and we are the lucky recipients of their revelry.  It may not be a single, but it's definitely one of the album's most   memorable tracks.  \\"Stay the Night\\" is a self-explanatory torch song.  The following track, \\"Get Your Number\\" is a silly   song, but it's all in good fun.  This one includes Jermaine, too, and is his most prominent role on any of the original album tracks. \\"One and Only\\" is a duet with Twista, which is surprisingly not cringeworthy. It's almost as if Mariah made all of the rappers check their egos at the door and say something (no pun intended) relevant in their rhymes.  The next three songs act as a kind of suite.  \\"Circles\\", \\"Your Girl\\", and \\"I Wish You Knew\\" all relate to Mariah's feelings over (what else?) a prospective lover.  Great tracks, all.  The next track, \\"To The Floor\\" is another Neptunes number, recorded with   Nelly. The Neptunes seem to have gotten lost over the past year or so, but Mariah has resurrected them here. Next up is   \\"Joy Ride\\", not the greatest track but better than most of the junk found on albums in 2005.  The final track on the   original release, \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is an insprirational pop-gospel number like only Mariah can do.  Simply amazing.   As for the new tracks, they include Mariah's 17th Number One hit, \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"So Lonely (One and Only   Part II)\\" with Twista, and \\"Makin It Last All Night (What it Do)\\", featuring JD again.  One thing I can say about Jermaine   Dupri on this album is that he kept it to a minimum.  On \\"Charmbracelet\\" he couldn't keep his mouth shut, but here he just pops up every so often, utters a verse, then lets Mariah take center stage.  The final track is the remix of WBT featuring Jadakiss and Styles, which I think is one of the better remixes she's done.  This version of the album includes a DVD with four videos. ILT, WBT, and SIO are included along with the video for \\"Get Your Number\\", which thankfully was a   European-only single from the album.  It includes a link to watch the DFAU video, but you have to install additional software to view it.  18 songs and 4 videos really sweeten the pot.  If you don't feel like buying the re-release, download the new tracks from the Internet. For all of people's complaining about the album's re-release, it has continued to sell. This album is on track to become one of Mariah's top selling albums, and is well enough made to be favorite for years to come.   An essential purchase for Mariah fans and an important piece of mainstream music in 2005. Sorry for such a long review, but I've obviously had a lot of time to think about this album since it was first released.
B000002B2T|5.0|Mike McCready, blues-influenced guitarist of Peal Jam, friend Barrett Martin, drummer of the Screming Trees, and John Baker Saunders, a bassist friend of Mike's, got together in early 1994 to set up some informal jam sessions. The band sat down and instantly wrote the music to 'Wake Up' and 'River of Deceit.' The band new they had sparked something and it was only a little while until Mike got on the phone with Alice in Chains vocalist Layne Staley. Staley joined, with guitar in hand and a head-full of lyric ideas, and the new band's musical mix got even hotter. A Year later the band released their album, one which was completely unique from all of their other bands, and one that wouldn't be duplicated.  <br /> <br />The first thing noticable after a listen through of \\"Above\\" is that it was different. Alice in Chains this is not. Although Layne's vocals do sound like they're from a AiC album, and although they do stop this from sounding like Pearl Jam, that is not to say this sounds like Alice in Chains. Mike's guitar playing is strictly his own, most of which sounds as though it could come out of Pearl Jam. From the Vitalogy-sounding guitar of 'River of Deceit' to the screeching of 'I Don't Know Anything', Mike uses all of his talent to create a sound he hadn't done in Pearl Jam yet. The bass of Baker is exceptional. Having played with blues artists such as Little Pat Rushing, Hubert Sumlin, Sammy Fender, and the Lamont Cranston Band, he and Mike both had an idea to the stylings of music and they incorporated as much as possible into the album. The blues influence really shines, though, in the jazzy 'Artificial Red'. A song that is one of the best on the album. The percussion is also very nicely done. With not only drums, but bongos, congas, and marimbas, Martin does a very nice job setting an atmosphere along with a beat. He also contributes a bit of the Cello to some of the songs. <br /> <br />The vocals of the album are confident and Staley uses his range beautifully in songs like 'Im Above' and 'Wake Up'. Also contributing vocals is Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan on songs 'Long Gone Day' and 'I'm Above'. With these years being arguably Staley's best he shines bright on all 10 tracks. Still the genious in the album comes straight from the instruments and it is proven in the 7 minute instrumental 'November Hotel'. The song shows the best of all 4's musical talent. With the crazy effects of Mike, the furious beat of Barrett's toms, the constant moving bass line of Baker, and Staley's constant riffs, this song is really the icing on the cake of the album. It shows the talent this band had. It showed what each individual member could accomplish and proved that this side project wasn't a side project, it was a superband. <br /> <br />Sadly Mad Season's first album would be it's last. With all four members heading back to their roots and their old bands, time would be slim for a new album to be made and sadly, Staleys death would stop it entirely. Fortunately we have this album, which shows of different sides of all four artists. Maybe having only one album is better. If there were two would we really recognize the genious in this? I don't know, but this album's style, originality, and uniqueness makes it well deserving of 5 stars.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|So many good reviews here as well as pointed, though somewhat relatively valid criticism. <br />I do feel that the goal of awakenig people to third world plight was reached back then and now with this beautifully rendered DVD package. <br />The restoration of audio and video can only be compared,in my opinion,to the milestone Led Zeppelin DVD boxset in capturing the rawness of a live performance and using multichannel ambience production to highlight the music without overprocessing. <br /> <br />Here is a reminder of the 60's spirit in it's dying bloom embodied by these great musicians who, through their own experiences,had learned that life was not only songandance or peaceandlove and planted the seeds of humanitarian concert events through sheer care and generosity.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|When I first walked into the movie theartre this movie blew me away. Its mix or rock, ballads and over all fun make this a must for a fan of the play or of musicals. This, however, is where people get the wrong idea. Fans of the play have said that it just dosen't live up. I find that, while this is true, the movies good. + most orginal actors who don't suck. Get it, Love it. I bilieve that this should come with a warning though. This movie touches isues about Homosexualness, drugs, and poverty. It just isn't for everyone. LA VIE BOHEME
B00004YX39|5.0|\\"...and why is he standing in your spangled leather poncho and your elevator shoes?\\"    The absurdity of the lyrics--their audacious swagger--married to such righteous music can only be the work of one great band.  Steely Dan doesn't rock.  They don't necessarily do jazz.  Their music is so unique it can only be described as \\"Steely Dan\\" music-- a trademark of quality since 1972.      While Aja is generally hailed as their triumph, I'm personally partial to this one.  In fact I would rank it as one of the great albums of all time.  It was also their most complex.  This is amazing in light of the turmoil the Dan were undergoing during this time.  Much of the work on Gaucho fell on Donald Fagen's shoulders since Walter Becker was dealing with drug problems.  During the mixing sessions, Becker was largely absent after severely mangling his leg in a taxi mishap.      Gaucho is filled with songs surrounding the seamy underside of society's high rollers.  It reveals a world seen through the haze of drugs and despair.  It's a cathartic aural experience.  If you haven't heard this album, you haven't experienced the full potential of music and the human imagination.      The title track, depicting a gay love triangle, is exquisite beyond description with its precise construction, stately  horns, and a tricky melodic vocal line that tests Fagen. But what the heck is a \\"Custerdome?\\"  Fagen visualized it as a fictional skyscraper with a revolving restaurant at the top.  \\"Third World Man,\\" an off-the-wall sketch of a child as terrorist in his sandbox bunker, features a sneering vocal and Larry Carlton's acidic guitar solo.  The song began as \\"Were You Blind That Day?\\" which they left of the Aja album.      \\"Babylon Sisters\\" is hipper than hip with its funky keyboard run-up, slick horns, and girl singers biting off quick syllables.  This is followed by the equally jivey \\"Hey Nineteen\\" in which the singer gushes over \\"The Cuervo Gold\\" and \\"the fine Columbian.\\"  It's a real hoot, as the singer, an older dude, tries to enlighten his teenage companion about Sixties soul music.      \\"Glamour Profession\\" concerns the activities of a coke sniffing basketball player named Hoops McCann.  It burbles with synths and sleazy saxes.  It's luxuriant tone is intoxicating.  The bridge is co-opted from Kurt Weill's \\"Speak Low,\\" with a dash of disco added.    This would prove to be the last great Steely Dan album.  More trouble followed it's release.  Keith Jarrett successfully sued the band for plagiarizing his \\"Long As You Know You're Living Yours\\" on the title track.  Shortly after the album was issued, Fagen applied for a spot in Dylan's touring band.  He never heard back from Zimmy.  One can only imagine what that collaboration would have wrought!      Unable to top this masterpiece, it would be 20 years before Steely Dan put out another album of new material.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'll try to rate this album, but it changes all the time. First (before I listened to it so much) I liked it sooo much, I'd give it 9.5/10. I'll also comment: <br /> <br />1. \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" [8/10] - Lyrics: Ok. Song & beat: Deadly! <br />2. \\"Overprotected\\" [9/10] - Lyrics: GOOD! Song & beat: GOOD! <br />3. \\"Lonely\\" [9.5/10] - It's just good! <br />4. \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" [9.5/10] - Deep & Beautiful, my #2 Britneyballad. <br />5. \\"Boys\\" [6/10] - Ok, but the co-ed remix is so much better!! <br />6. \\"Anticipating\\" [8/10] - It's just happy-ish. When you're in a good mood: nice to listen to. When you're not: dont listen to this, could get annoying. <br />7. \\"I Love Rock & Roll [8.5/10] - Good covered! Nice video ;). <br />8. \\"Cinderella\\" [10/10] - The first time I heard this song, i immediately fell in love with it! Listened it over and over again. My favourite song from this album! I actually wished Britney had chosen this song to be her last single of this album in stead of 'Boys [the Co-ed Remix]'. She could've made a video with Justin, I think I would've been a bigger hit than Boys, and that people'd like her better too. <br />9. \\"Let Me Be\\" [9.5/10] - Like it a lot! <br />10. \\"Bombastic Love\\" [8.5/10] - Like this one too, though I like the verses & beat of the song more than the chorus. <br />11. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" [7.5/10] - It's just so sweet :D. <br />12. \\"What It's Like to Be Me\\" [8/10] - Like it. <br /> <br />Conclusion: Av'rage: [8.5/10]. My #2 Britney-album...
B00007LTIG|4.0|Thanks to Rhino's excellent Birth Of The Dead 2CD this is no longer the earliest studio evidence of the Grateful Dead's work, but it is still their eponymous debut album, recorded (apart from one track) over four days in January 1967 in Hollywood at RCA's studios. Jerry Garcia had worked there the previous year, helping out on Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow album, with engineer Dave Hassinger, of Rolling Stones fame, who was now producing The Grateful Dead.<br /><br />Having first joined the Dead's golden road of musical experience around 1969 and not hearing their first album, I had been expecting it to have relatively unformed ideas and only the beginnings of their distinctive character. The first listen was enough to prove me quite wrong, with their ten minute tour de force of Viola Lee Blues in particular instantly dazzling, and each subsequent play has only re-enforced the confidence and subtlety of the playing and the depth to their original pieces. Band compositions mingle with blues, jug band standards and Bonnie Dobson's apocalyptic Morning Dew, all performed much as they would have sounded live in the San Francisco dance halls or at the Golden Gate Park Human Be-In they had played the week before recording the album.<br /><br />The album produced one single, The Golden Road/Cream Puff War. Early fades necessitated by length restrictions on vinyl album sides have been replaced with the original full-length masters, though most of these also fade, with Schoolgirl gaining almost a minute.<br /><br />To the original album has been added over 40 minutes of bonus material. Four of these tracks were recorded at RCA as try-outs after the album had been completed, and the final two tracks are versions of Viola Lee Blues. One is a three-minute edit, suggesting it may have been considered as a follow-up single at one time, and the other is an (incomplete) 23 minute live version from Rio Nido Dance Hall in September 1967, quite different to the studio performance but just as magnificent.as magnificent.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|My opinion: <br />I think the \\"Toxic\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\", \\"Breathe on Me\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" remixes are the only real remixed songs. All the others are kinda the same (vocally). I do like the other songs, but Toxic is just my favorite. <br /> <br />Rate the Album: <br />01. Toxic [Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix]  - [10/10] <br />02. Me Against the Music [Justice Remix] - [8.5/10] <br />03. Touch of My Hand [Bill Hamel Remix] - [9.0/10] <br />04. Breathe on Me [Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke] - [8.5/10] <br />05. I'm a Slave 4 U [Dave Aud Slave Driver Mix] - [8.5/10] <br />06. And Then We Kiss [Junkie Xl Remix] - [8.5/10] <br />07. Everytime [Valentin Remix] - [8.0/10] <br />08. Early Mornin' [Jason Nevins Remix] - [7.5/10] <br />09. Someday (I Will Understand) [Hi-Bias Signature Radio Remix] - [8.0/10] <br />10. ...Baby One More Time [Davidson Ospina 2005 Remix] - [6.5/10]  <br />11. Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know [Hex Hector Club] - [7.5/10] <br /> <br />I like all the songs a lot, except for the remix of \\"...Baby One More Time\\". The beginning sucks, but I like the rest of the song better (when she starts to sing). Toxic is my favorite up-beat song by Britney, and the remix is wonderful too. It's just the best! This is (currently) my top 5 songs of the album, but it changes all the time, except for my #1 & #2: <br /> <br />01. Toxic [Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix] <br />02. Touch of My Hand [Bill Hamel Remix]  <br />03. I'm a Slave 4 U [Dave Aud Slave Driver Mix]  <br />04. And Then We Kiss [Junkie Xl Remix] <br />05. Me Against the Music [Justice Remix] <br /> <br />My album average is 8.2/10, very good for just a remix album! So it's surely worth buying! I have it myself too and i listen to it all the time
B00000JMG7|5.0|Why did they wait so long to put this out?  Great find and well worth the price.  In fact, it's a steal.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Chicken little was one of the best disney movies made.Its has some of the best effects next to pokemon heroes.The movie was funny.My favorite scenes were the base ball park and chicken little kissing the ugly duckling which was nasty.

0743454537|5.0|I was strongly moved by this book.  Thinking the premise was interesting and even thought-provoking, I picked up the book.  I cannot begin to describe the power of this author.  She takes a headline topic and turns it into memorable characters with a multitude of viewpoints on one central theme.  The pages breath life into the reader with Picoult's subtle maneuverings throughout the novel.  With a subject that could easily move the author to a \\"preachy\\" sort of platform, the reader is blessedly given an understanding of the complexity of the situations and the fundamental understanding that there is \\"no definitive way\\" for every person.<br /><br />I understood each of the characters and even though there were times when I might have momentarily disliked a character, it was strictly momentary.  Picoult has an amazing ability to engage the reader to recognize the motivations of her characters despite the supposed \\"wrongness\\" of their actions.  It was a book without judgment and left me as a reader with a keen understanding that choices are often situationally driven and the will of family or even parents, although compelling, cannot subvert the will of the individual or child.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good about this author.  As a result of this book, I have picked up several other of her books.  It is smooth reading, not easy reading, because there is just too darned much to think about!  Picoult manages to avoid any sort of didactic prose while simultaneously giving a respect to the intelligence of her readers.  I think this would be and is a difficult balance when tackling such life challenging subjects.<br /><br />What resonates most for me is that I remember reading headlines about children who were born to save their elder sibling from a life threatening illness.  I also remember thinking when reading that story that it was a glorious miracle, a beautiful choice to save a life, but Picoult manages to strip away the fairy tale ending we all assume occurs in such a story and delves deep into the ramifications of family dynamics, self identity, self purpose, defying the perceived \\"good\\" of the majority and tackling the perceived \\"good\\" of the individual.  I am still not sure how she manages it because again, her characters aren't self pitying wallowers or self-centered individuals.  It's just an amazing book for me that brought a fabulous author to my attention.occurs in such a story and delves deep into the ramifications of family dynamics, self identity, self purpose, defying the perceived \\"good\\" of the majority and tackling the perceived \\"good\\" of the individual.

0679422714|5.0|Leftists sing the praises of Mao. Nicholas D. Kristof in his New York Times review writes \\"Mao's ruthlessness was a catastrophe at the time . . . and yet there's more to the story: Mao also helped lay the groundwork for the rebirth and rise of China after five centuries of slumber.\\" Kristof admires a man, a dictator, a tyrant who caused the deaths of an estimated 70 million people, reduced more than a billion people to impoverished slavery and proudly proclaimed to his inner circle \\"[w]e need the policy of 'keep the people stupid.'\\" Mao seems to have succeeded beyond his hopes with the left-wing intelligentsia: they still wear their Mao pins and consider him some kind of hero.<br /><br />  Rational people reading \\"Mao: The Unknown Story\\" will find it difficult, if not impossible, to fight off depression and sadness as they read page after page of cruelty beyond imagination. From a time in his 20s, Mao discovered a liking for inflicting pain. He became a skilled politician, besting his rivals, making them to subservient to him, at least those he did not have killed or imprisoned.<br /><br />  How sad for the Chinese people that the main adversary to the Soviet supported Chinese Communist Party was the inept and corrupt government of Chaing Kai-shek.<br /><br />  Mao was no hero. The champion of guerilla warfare was a coward and an inept military leader. He was no economist: a huge portion of China's budget was devoted to arms industries developed with the proceeds of exporting farm crops while the peasants starved by their millions.<br /><br />  Chang and Halliday provide a well supported portrait of Mao, a megalomaniac who cared nothing about the Chinese people, and his cronies who cared only about themselves.<br /><br />  This is an enormously sad story, overflowing with pain, suffering and needless death. It is a portrait of a monster, whom left-wingers in America bizarrely revere. Sad. So very sad.<br /><br />Jerry
0156027321|5.0|I was curious about this book ever since I read it had won the Booker Award but did not actually read it until my book club assigned it.  It was great.  A very quick read with a unique premise.  It was also very spiritual and philosophical without being preachy.  Some parts were just out and out gross. These parts only emphasized the struggle for survival and that all of our humanity even the most base tendencies must be realized.  Those moments of horror were balanced with humor.  The whole book was a testament to the indomitable human spirit.  I thought about this book for days and still remember little phrases from it that I liked. I highly recommend it as it has been adopted as one of my favorites.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I used these on my iPod.  I also used these for running.  the sound is ok. Very little bass and kind trebly. They lasted about 6 months then stopped working all the while they kept deteriorating. The cord is very thin and very weak.  I stepped on it twice and the wiring became exposed.  The cord ultimately looked like an electrical taped mess.  The left channel stopped working after 6 months. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who is going to use these for working out in any way.  I suppose they are fine for commuting or general use.
B000005JA8|5.0|I checked Trout Mask Replica out of my school's library after being told it was one of the weirdest and greatest albums ever made. Yes to both of those.<br /><br />Captain Beefheart, along with The Velvet Underground and Jimi Hendrix, led the massive evolution that rock music underwent in the late 60's: rules went out the window, experimentation was ramapant...as long as you avoided the hippie love-fest, it was all good.<br /><br />Some music sounds like it was made using LSD. Trout Mask Replica sounds like the music itself is on LSD. It's unbelievable, and largely undescribable. Sometimes it sounds like the music exists in multiple dimensions (4D? 5D? 6D?) at once. You can hear traces of garage rock, avant-garde and blues, but there's still nothing that sounds anything like it. The best descripton I can give is to imagine a standard rock song as a jigsaw puzzle. Now imagine that the pieces have been taken apart and re-assembled in a completely different way, yet somehow (don't ask how), it still makes sense, and sounds good.<br /><br />The drums stutter and roll like a drunken sailor, the guitars are an \\"unimaginable landscape, splintering and spronging and slanging and even actually swinging in every direction, as far as the mind could see\\" (to quote Lester Bangs), and the Captain's gravely cartoon character vocals brings this insane universe to life. Even though most of the songs rely on astonishing rhythms and weirdness, there is some excellent melody in some places, such as \\"My Human Gets Me Blues\\" and \\"Dali's Car\\".<br /><br />And then there's the Dadaist, random lyrics that rule more than you can imagine. When the Captain announces \\"no more bridge from Tuesday to Friday\\", it's safe to assume he's not talking about the card game. Sometimes hilarious (Pena) sometimes heartfelt (Veteran's Day Poppy), sometimes image-heavy (The Dust Blows Forward), kickass one liners (\\"It's a bush recording.\\")...always interesting. Van Vliet is now one of my favorite lyricists, alongside Isaac Brock and Roger Waters.<br /><br />Not an easy listen. The album sounds like some sort of sick joke on the first listen, but look past the ugly exterior and let it bend your mind.<br /><br />Reccomended: Frownland, Pachuco Cadaver, Hair Pie: Bake 1 and Bake 2, Pena, Well, Wild Life, Hobo Chang Baters.

B000AMJDHY|3.0|it's actually not a bad record, but boy does this band sound like they want to be fall out boy.  it's so blatantly obvious that it's impossible to overlook.  this record is very well-written and catchy, and it sounds good.  however if you don't like fall out boy i can't even begin to understand how you could like this record.  it really goes both ways.  however, lots of bands totally rip-off lots of bands to don't judge this record based totally on that.  if you're into today's pop-punk there's probably a few songs that you'd find enjoyable.  if you don't like fall out boy, however, i'd say don't even bother. <br /> <br />another thing, how exactly are these guys a \\"dance\\" band in any sense?

My interpol friend and myself tried to solve cold cases for 2 years. I was warm on one case in minnesota where I have never been. First LJB had me remote view the burlington skyway playing innocent over the bridge, then she had me remote view the lake superior coastline sure I know Tie mex its got hands and a face. Then she had me remote view a kamachatka naval base Petropavlovsk and in my mind I could see the derrick cranes and the Admiral Carrier 2 under construction not shown on Google earth. Very Clever of my Russian relatives Stalin was Maos Dad, to use an existing and proven aircraft carrier design, good aircraft carriers come in threes. Due to my Clone Grandfather being Stalin and my Clone Dad being Mao, I said that studying petropavlosk would benefit America little. You cant learn that much from overhead satellite. The remote viewing was conducted for the good of all mankind, I was not trying to freak the fbi out with info from their remote viewing manual that has been around for years. I genuinely like helping Laurie J B with cold cases and consider her to be my C K friend. L J B if you could help me get my C K Jacket back that would be really cool. So after Petropavlosk is the really outlandish tycho crater plaque live long and procreate laboratory. Elizabeth is a wonderful movie and Churchill is the alluded to Major Metcalfe Walsingham to mi5.

I was psyched (yes, child of the 80's). <br /> <br />I got these as a gift, so I'm quite greatful, but so far (Season 1), the quality of the DVD is HORRIBLE. <br /> <br />I don't much care for the extra frills (behind the scenes, actor bios, etc.), but Paramound didn't even bother to fix any damage to the master film/tape that they were using.  I agree with user D. Mok's review, they did a horrible and lazy job of putting this beloved series to DVD.  Makes me think that at times I'm watching a film in class on the vintage high-school reel-to-reel projectors. <br /> <br />I bet if I go out and get the original 1979 Battlestar Galactica on DVD it won't be anywhere near this bad in quality. <br /> <br />For now, save yourself the money, buy a DVD recorder and record it on SpikeTV... it's probably better quality.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Your review was terribly biased.  You not only gave a negative response about this album but you attacked the character of Mr. Cash.  I'm not a country music fan by any means, which is why the music of Mr. Cash appeals to me.  He did not just appeal to country folk or sing only country hick songs.  His melodies had a message about the good and the bad that lies in every man and he sang about their addictions not just to substances but to behaviors.  To set you straight, he never was in prison, although he spent short times in jail cells for unruly behavior.  He only visited prison to perform on a concert level for the prisoners to give them hope, compassion, understanding and to uplift them from their oppression whether they deserved it or not. He arose from poverty and mingled with some of the greats - Elvis, Jerry Lee, Bob Dylan, and so many more - all of whom contributed to music in an eclectic collection of material. <br />Not only were his lyrics revolutionary, but his music was tuneful and melodic - certainly more fit to bear the title of 'music' than the likes of many of todays screaming, shrieking noisemakers that want to be known as artists and musicians.

Now, if you don't get it I will get the monkeys of my town to sail there boats over to your land of misery and force it upon you while you are bug eyed at that fact of what all is happening and that what I said came true. Now although this may seems cool because you wouldn't have to buy the album it wouldn't be because the monkeys would also tie you up with elephant hide and sing Britney Spears to you cause they are freaks like that and want to torture innocenct minds with filth. But all in all 5 stars and get it or beware. I hope this has convinced you.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|THIS FILM IS GREAT BECAUSE IT ERASES THAT LAST INSTALLMENT WITH GEORGE CLOONEY AS THE BATMAN WITH ALL THE BICARIOUS WEAKEN-WATERED DOWN VERISON OF THE HERO WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE. I LOVE TO BE ENTERTAINED BUT WHEN YOUR INTERPETING SOMETHING TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE AND NOT LIBRITIZE THE FIGURE OR THING YOU INTERPETATION. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK NOLAN & GOYER DID SUCH AS GREAT JOB AS KEEPING IT SIMPLE AND TRUE TO WHAT BATMAN IS, WAS AND EVER WILL BE A MAN AND MAY HAVE SOME HELP ELSE WHERE DOWN THE LINE BUT DON'T TRY N PLAY THE UP. CUZ TRUE FANS KNOW WHOM BAT'S IS MAN. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT BECAUSE IT TAKES BATMAN TO A MORE HUMAN LEVEL THAN BURTON/SHUMAKER'S VERISON EVER DID. SO I THINK ALSO WITH OTHER INFLUENCES FROM THE COMICS WIT ADDED A LANDSCAPE OF FOUNDATION TO CREATE A CONCRETE FIGURE CLOSER TO ICON WE KNOW AND LOVE. SO I GIVE THEM 5 STARS ON THIS FILM
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember seeing ads for Firefly and not being that interested in the concept, even though I am a fan of Buffy and love sci fi. I recently purchased this DVD set out of curiousity. It is a terrific series that was canceled too soon.  <br /> <br />It is at least as good as Lost(I discovered Lost after buying the season 1 DVD too). What makes both Lost and Firefly great is the attention to character development. Great pains are taken to make the characters as real as possible. I really cannot understand why Fox didn't give it a chance. It has much broader appeal than Buffy. It could have had huge ratings if Fox had given it more attention.
0553062182|5.0|Psychologist Elaine Aron, Ph.D., who first identified the trait of high sensitivity, notes that people who are highly sensitive are sometimes mislabeled as shy, introverted, inhibited, or fearful. In a culture that seems to value toughness, it's no surprise that high sensitivity is misunderstood, underappreciated, and even negated. But it's also a shame, because many Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs) are highly creative, intuitive, and empathetic. These are wonderful gifts and this book shines the light on this truth.<br /><br />I am a HSP and also a professional coach. I have given this book to many clients. There is such a sense of relief when we come to understand why we are the way we are and then get to look at how we can create a life that supports us and allows the gifts of this trait to shine forth. The Highly Sensitive Person is a manual for doing exactly this.<br /><br />I simply can't recommend this book enough. Oprah, are you listening???
B000002O5L|4.0|This is a great album from Tom Petty and although the arrangements are simple, the overall package is brilliant showing that even the simple tunes can sound good.  The only problem with this album is that the sound quality isn't that great and it needs some remastering done which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Everyone's heard of \\"Free Fallin'\\" but \\" I Won't Back Down\\" and \\"Running Down a Dream\\" are also great tracks.  If you are a guitarist, this is also a great album to play along with as the chords are simple and fun to strum along and the solos are not too complicated.  Tom Petty is a great songwriter as well which he shows on the later excellent \\"Wallflowers\\" album too.  Recommended but you may want to wait for a remastered version to come out first.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a story of real people, in a real place, and at a real time. Having grown up in the rural west, and having a father who was a real cowboy, this movie took me back in time.  I thought the movie acturately portrayed life in the rural west among poor folks--something I grew up knowing about.  <br /> <br />The acting is outstanding, especially the portrayal of Ennis by Heath Ledger.  His character was so authentic it was uncanny.   Heath Ledger reminded me so much of the men that I grew up around.  He was taciturn, but at the same time, communicated a lot of information with a few words. He also mastered a form of speech that I remember.  He spoke without moving his lips. That was so characteristic of the cowboys in the rural west at that time, and probably still is.  His emotion was so real when he learned of Jack's death.  One could see all of the frustration of hiding his love and affection for all of those years.  Ledger conveyed that pain in a spectacular way with just an expression.  <br /> <br />This is a story of hundreds of men who grew up in that time and that place and in the same situation of Ennis and Jack.  I have met and talked to many of those men.  I think the strength of this movie is in the universal human emotions that are so brilliantly captured.
0307276902|5.0|This is a brilliantly written piece about the despair of a world that goes undocumented and misunderstood.  Frey's memoir is searing and profound, let the story tell itself, and get the pundits and the muckrakers out of the way.  The spirit of this book floats above and beyond its details. <br />
B000BWI9U0|3.0|About the album: not what I have expected. Previous ones (both) are just perfect. This one is average. <br /> <br />About the \\"Special edition\\": even worst.

B00005JOFO|5.0|There are many definitions of love. Love is terrifying and exciting and unexpected and heartbreaking and tender and so hard, all at once.  It's surprising and lawless and forbidden and passionate and so wrong, but so right.  And with the release of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, director Ang Lee brings to the screen a film that, at its core, is about this kind of love--the kind that won't take no for an answer, the kind you can't help but fall into, and the kind you can't quit even if you want to.   <br /> <br />Heath Ledger's Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist are young when they meet in a dusty parking lot in a small town deep in the heart of Wyoming. They're both down on their luck, looking for work, and tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain seems like the perfect way to make a buck. Ennis is quiet, resilient, a man of few words; Jack is a self-proclaimed \\"crazy rodeo cowboy\\" who loves to break the rules.  Neither of them expects to fall in love in the wilderness, but up on Brokeback Mountain, they're drawn to each other; their souls connect, and they are both struck by the powerful spark that is ignited within them. Their love affair spans twenty years, through marriages and divorces and children.  Three or four times a year, they meet on Brokeback Mountain...and for the week or so they are away from the rest of the world, it's like they never left.  They talk of buying a ranch, settling down somewhere together and living the quiet life of lovers. <br /> <br />Sadly, though, Brokeback Mountain is the only place their love can live.  In the West of 1963, homosexuality made you a target--and the stakes were high.  As a young boy, Ennis himself witnessed the brutal results of a hate crime committed on a farmer who lived quietly for many years with his partner.  It's understandable, then, why Ennis is frightened by the depth of his feelings for Jack, while Jack keeps naively hoping for more than Ennis can give.  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is their love story, the tale of a love doomed to fail--but a love so beautiful and powerful it makes all the heartbreak worth it. <br /> <br />Heath Ledger is brilliant as the reserved, stoic Ennis Del Mar.  His performance is sensual and emotional and passionate; his character is deftly layered and breathtakingly acted.  Jake Gyllenhaal is also phenomenal as innocent, eager Jack Twist.  He plays a man seemingly untouched by the baggage of the world; Ennis renews him, and he also breaks his heart.  Both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway give commendable performances as the wives of the two men.  The movie is brilliantly acted. <br /> <br />But if it's brilliantly acted, it's even more brilliantly directed.  Director Ang Lee's film is atmospheric and poignant.  Ang Lee acknowledges that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was preceded by a controversial reputation; and he uses that reputation to his advantage, creating simple scenes that are, somehow, rife with sensuality.  The film builds up to one explosive moment, the crescendo of rapture, and then slowly changes into something even more incredible as love replaces the initial release of passion.  Many scenes are lump-in-your-throat emotional:  Ennis's breakdown in a roadside culvert, the passionate reunion after four years apart, the moment Ennis finds a shirt he thought he'd lost years ago.  And one of the nicest things about the film?  It's not political.  It could have been, but Ang Lee maneuvers his controversial topic in a much better direction.  It's a love story, plain and simple.  It's not a love story about two men...it's just about love.  And that's freakin' awesome. <br /> <br />BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a film you experience, not just watch once while chowing down on popcorn and Junior Mints.  The scenery is noble and gritty and breathtaking; the performances are heartwrenching; the score is perfect; the love story is transcendental and timeless.  BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a cinematic masterpiece, a love story that will singlehandedly redefine its genre, andwill change how films are made forever after.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I went to see the movie in response to the reviews and accolades it was getting, but I had never read Annie Proulx's story. Consequently, I didn't know many of the details before I went.    As the movie began, it seemed obvious that the circumstances could readily develop into a long relationship between the two young men. That it would become sexual I knew from the reviews.     But I seldom felt much of anything lovable in either one. True, they both worked hard and helped each other. What many reviewers described as Jack's furtive glances at Ennis didn't look at all libidinous to me. I thought he often looked sullen and morose. I did not see tenderness or fondness, and to this minute I don't understand what those reviewers saw that I didn't.    (Perhaps I project my own prejudices into the story. My experience is, that love builds slowly, by baby steps. A pleasing attitude, a caring demeanor, perhaps a small act of compassion observed discretely from afar - these sort of things can trigger an interest. Then comes getting to know each other. At some point, as time together increases, shared experiences unaccountably become moments to be remembered. You get the idea; back to the story.)    Weeks of  virtual isolation may indeed make any man horny, and if either one or both of the protagonists is homosexual, the result seems predictable. But their first sexual encounter simply looked to me like opportunistic sex, not love. A few reviewers have commented similarly, but went on to say that \\"it grew into love.\\" I only saw two short scenes that I interpreted as love growing.     Distressingly, the first was seen through the binoculars of their boss, Joe Aguirre, as the young men cavorted on the bare slope of the mountain, in a rough and tumble game of love tag,  hugging and kissing, unmistakably enthralled with each other. The other occurred many years later, during one of their \\"fishing trips,\\" when they jumped, naked and exhilarated, from a high bluff into the lake. Ifelt their joy in both scenes.     Trouble was, their love had been fully formed years before the swim scene, so it doesn't count as a stepping stone to love. That leaves the first scene as the only early scene that suggested growing love. But in fact, even it occurred after the tent scene.    The entire story rests on their love. If their attraction was only sexual, I don't think it could account for the ultimate, overwhelming tragedy. The author, Annie Proulx, and the screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, postulate that the young men are in love, profoundly, unfathomably  and unspeakably in love. By the end of the movie, I agree it was so. But somehow, I didn't see love start; I didn't see love grow where I thought it should have.    Still, many of the reviewers said it was there. What I didn't know  (and wanted to know) was, did these reviewers sense it from watching the movie, or simply accept it as a given? It seemed to me that there was only one way to find out, so I bought the book and read it.    Well, the missing love development is in the book, plenty enough to satisfy me. So what was wrong? I went and saw the movie a second time.    I was wrong, thankfully wrong. Virtually everything in the book is in there, and I must admit, done to perfection. I simply hadn't understood much of what was said in the first viewing, particularly in the early scenes where Ennis and Jack get to know each other on the mountain. And of course I hadn't read the book at that point. Reading the book made all the difference in the world.    In the book, after Ennis and Jack have swapped duties as herder and camp tender, Ennis comes into camp one night for what Annie Proulx calls \\"a high-time supper.\\"  A big meal, followed by smokes and whiskey, and then talk. Annie, whose prose is amazingly lean, ticks off  a whole page of things they talk about. They must have talked for many hours (far too long for the movie). Annie says, \\"They were respectful of each other's opinions,each glad to have a companion where none had been expected.\\"  Finally, it's time for Ennis to return to the flock:    \\"Ennis, riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous, drunken light, thought he'd never had such a good time, felt he could paw the white out of the moon.\\"     That was the line, just a single line, that opened the door enough to let me glimpse Ennis's heart.  After an impoverished, loveless life, someone had opened up to him, made him know his feelings were important to them. I don't know how it could have been displayed on the screen (it was not). It was, after all, just his feeling, riding alone in the moonlight. To me it was the touchstone, the first baby step to love.     I found many other small steps after that, benefiting greatly from having read the book. When the tent scene happened, it fit the story, at least in my mind.    I was surprised by my own reaction in the second viewing. Jack came through much more powerfully and sympathetically. I actually didn't like him much the first time.     And the anguish that first overwhelmed me seemed not quite so intense. Someone, in one of these posts, makes reference to \\"..the moment when Ennis decides to stop hiding from life in his work, and agrees to attend his daughter's wedding.\\" I wish. That was a bone tossed by the screenwriters to the movie audience. Annie Proulx never wrote it. What she wrote was, \\"That was about the time Jack began to appear in his dreams. Jack as he had first seen him, curly-headed and smiling...\\" Make no mistake, Annie's Ennis is sentenced to haunted dreams and regrets for the rest of his life.    The movie surely stands on its own, and that tiny ray of hope that Larry and Diana sent us doesn't seem to be a match for the enormity of the tragedy. I said it was not so intense the second time, but just writing about it brings it flooding back to me. No, I'm not over it yet.    By the way, if I forgot to mention it, this is the finest movie I've ever seen.Bob Arr
0553584537|2.0|Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge has put in a 15-hour shift the night the call comes in.  A man is holding his wife and child hostage in his home in an elite Boston neighborhood, and there are reports of shots being fired.  Bobby is a member of STOP, the team of law enforcement officers who deals with dangerous police situations, so he is called to the scene.  The man, it turns out, is Jimmy Gagnon, son of prominent Boston judge James Gagnon.  His wife is Catherine, a tortured and beautiful woman still trying to cope with an event that took place long ago in her past.  Their son is Nathan, a five-year-old with a mysterious illness.  From the apartment across from the Gagnon residence, Bobby watches the events unfold through the scope of his sniper rifle.  He watches Jimmy's finger tighten on the trigger and makes a decision that will change the course of his life forever:  He fires his weapon and takes the life of the husband and father in his line of sight.  Catherine Gagnon looks at Bobby with gratitude, and mouths, \\"Thank you.\\" <br /> <br />So was Bobby justified in taking Jimmy's life?  Judge Gagnon doesn't think so; in fact, he thinks Catherine plotted the whole thing.  He also thinks Catherine is deliberately making her son sick, and he is determined to gain custody of Nathan.  Bobby is caught in the middle, and he doesn't know where he belongs: not with his girlfriend, who he dumps because he thinks she deserves better; not with the police, who aren't sure if Bobby's actions were justified and are investigating his every move; not with Catherine, who has carved a position for herself in his life; not with his father, from whom he's distanced himself; and not with Catherine's powerful father-in-law, who is determined to bring Bobby down if he doesn't admit to Catherine's part in his son's killing.  To top it all off, people Catherine is close to are starting to die...and all signs point to Bobby as the prime suspect.  He truly is, as the novel's title suggests, ALONE. <br /> <br />This is the first Lisa Gardner novel I've read...and to be honest, I really wasn't all that impressed.  The plot of the novel dragged in places, and some parts were really boring.  This book took me forever to read, because I like to read before I go to bed and this one just wasn't stimulating enough to keep me awake.  I wasn't wild about either one of the main protagonists.  Bobby is the stereotypical tortured cop with a difficult past; Catherine is the stereotypical beautiful heroine with a difficult past.  I couldn't warm up to or sympathize with either of them, or their hopeless situation, when all they do throughout the whole novel is whine and brood over things.  The so-called \\"sexual tension\\" between the two is poorly-established and not genuine at all.  At some point in the novel, I just stopped caring what happened to them and just plodded through to get the book over with.  And the \\"bad guy\\" is simply gratuitous, nothing more...although he does break up the monotony of all the brooding and whining a little bit. <br /> <br />Although the ending contains some interesting medical information and a twist I really wasn't expecting, it just isn't enough to make reading this novel worth it.  The chase scene at the end is muddled and amateurish, and the resolution happens too quickly for a novel that is so slow everywhere else.  But nevertheless, ALONE is good bedside reading--if, that is, you tend to have trouble falling asleep.

6305949980|5.0|I've watched this movie every year on Halloween and I've never gotten bored of it. I went through 100 reviews and only 4 or 5 people disliked the movie, so that should be a testiment to its quality. Granted, some people may think it too morbid for young children, but I have a 6 year-old brother who has wathed it with us for several years and he's never been frightened. Also, the myth about this being a \\"goth\\" movie it not quite true. I'm not goth, and I have a friend who is as far from goth as one can be and she LOVES this movie. The basic point of The Nightmare Before Christmas is the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington who is a skeleton (duh) grows bored of is job as boss of Halloween and accidentily finds Christmas Town. When he returns from his adventure he tries to explain this holiday to the citizens of Halloween who don't really get it. Jack decides to take over Christmas and disasterous results follow. This is a musical so there is obviously music and singing (which is exceptoinal). There is a little bit of romance, and a little bit of comedy, something about this that makes it a classic in my opinion. I reccomend it for anyone or Tim Burton fans especially.
B00005JOFO|5.0|As I type these words, Brokeback Mountain just won four Golden Globe awards including Best Drama. It's no surprise to a lot of people, even though the film itself was every bit a surprise. <br /> <br />Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), both 19 years old, are two poor ranch hands from Riverton, Wyoming. They meet one summer while seeking jobs, and Joe Aguirre (Quaid) hires them to herd sheep up in Brokeback Mountain. <br /> <br />Ennis is a taciturn, reserved and shy man. Jack is a charmer, a dreamer, a risk-taker. Their difficult childhoods and shared interests quickly secure a bond between them. Then one cold night, their budding friendship turns into something else: a drunken, violent sexual encounter. The next day, neither of them speaks of the incident, until Ennis tells Jack, \\"What happened was a one shot deal. I ain't queer.\\" Jack replies, \\"Me neither.\\" <br /> <br />When the summer is over, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways. Ennis marries his sweetheart Elma (Williams) and they raise two daughters. Jack marries wealthy girl Lureen (Hathaway) and has a son. Everything is normal until, after four long years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. Something deep inside stirs up a hornet's nest. Their reunion becomes the beginning of a 20-year secret affair. Brokeback Mountain becomes their refuge from the world to which they don't belong. <br /> <br />Ledger (Casanova) is extraordinary with his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, a man who has few words in his vocabulary, a man so repressed that he doesn't know how to express himself or go for what he wants. Ledger reveals so much about his characters, often without saying a word. His mannerism and facial expression speak volume. He's transformed himself realistically into a man that is so unlike the actor himself, who has mostly been known for his fluffy, light performances in the past. In contrast, Gyllenhaal (Proof) has the more lively role. His Jack Twist is the opposite of Ennis in almost every way. Jack's longing for the man he loves is evident in Gyllenhaal's stellar performance. The men also share immense chemistry together. You believe they're real. You believe their feelings for each other are real. <br /> <br />While one can argue that it's a character study of two men and their relationship, the women in the story add an immense appeal to the film. Williams (The Station Agent) is amazing with her heartbreaking performance as Ennis's long-suffering wife Alma. When she witnesses something about her husband that she doesn't fully understand, her reaction is incredibly real and painful to watch. Hathaway (Havoc) has a relatively minor role as Jack's indifferent wife Lureen. But her final scene is mesmerizing - Hathaway has matured into a fine actress. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain unfolds slowly and, under the direction of Lee (Hulk), the pacing is deliberate and leisurely. At more than two hours, the film feels slow sometimes, but it is far from being boring. While the plot is simplistic, the acting is exceptional and there is so much going on at the thematic and emotional levels that one can't help but feel spellbound by the story. <br /> <br />The script by awarding-winning writers McMurtry (Terms of Endearment) and Ossana (Dead Man's Walk) expands Proulx's short story into a languid character study that holds on to your heart and doesn't let go. The dialogue is real and to the point - nothing too poetic or out of character. Mostly episodic, there are many fine moments in the film that are emotionally raw and powerful. The ending will haunt you. <br /> <br />Lee's direction is masterful, and it clearly demonstrates his versatility as a director. It's even more impressive when you consider Lee's heritage as a Chinese immigrant, and how he so deftly captures Americana in Brokeback Mountains. The cinematography by Rodgrigo Prieto (21 Grams) is breathtaking. The editing is crisp. Gustavo Santaolalla's (Motorcycle Diaries) score is subdue but poignant. <br /> <br />Some say this is a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie. I say this is a story about love and betrayal and life. Homosexuality is only part of it - the heterosexual aspects of the story are just as strong. If you have ever loved and lost before, you will feel the impact of this story. The film is like fine wine - it delicately lingers on your palate and seeps into your vein. Brokeback Mountain is destined to become an American classic.

0525244581|4.0|Benjamin Hoff's job comparing the lovable characters of the One Hundred Acre Woods to Taoism may be a stretch to some, but I found it delightful and very helpful.  First of all, I taught Ancient History including the great world religions to sixth graders (roughly 11-12 year olds).  I took some examples from the book and its theme and integrated them into my teaching on China and Taoism.  The concepts in many of the great eastern religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, etc. can be hard for many in the West to grasp, not to mention adolescents just being introduced to them.  The comparisons in this book really allowed my students to absorb the overall theme of Taoism.      The two comparisons I love that Hoff gives:    1) How the Taoist tastes vinegar and unlike the rest, enjoys it because he realizes that everything in life is not sweet (Balance).   2) I also taught a character education class and this theme was particularly helpful: you should seek to live everyday of your life like you are about to open a present.  That anticipation and excitement should be driving forces in your life.  No matter how bad your day/ week/ month is there should always be a \\"present\\" to look forward to on your calendar.   And when that event is over, there should be something else to keep in your mind; a new, exciting anticipation.  It is a never ending cycle.    You don't have to be a Taoist to appreciate this book.
B000B6CODO|4.0|I often seem to wonder why movies out there can be just outrageous at times. Nevertheless, I also know that there just aren't that many good movies out there right now which is shallow. That also goes with the same for great actors like Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, and the legendary Robin Williams. In the 1990's he was just everywhere as one of the funniest performers in comedy, and a fantastic actor to the bone. He was just great in films like Mrs. Doubtfire, The Birdcage, and arguably one of the most outrageous and the most exciting films of the time, Jumanji.<br /><br />Jumanji with Robin Williams, is about a young boy who feels his life is full of doubts and heartbreak finds a outrageous game, which turns fully interactive. When he comes back in the future, he has no idea of what life leads from the death of his parents, to finding a childhood friend, Sara Wittle played by Helen Hunt. Then, they have to finish the game they started in the years earlier. The movie is absolutely amazing with beautiful graphics from the wicked floods, to the calming lion sleeping in the bed of the house, and even the shocking thrill of the hunt as a British hunter also comes into play with the dice. The effects in the movie are absolutely unique and amazing from each details of the rhinos stampedeing, to the unique mutation of young Peter. The film also remains very unique and fun for all ages.<br /><br />All in all with the recently released film Zathura in theaters, many may want to still consider that film. However, you may still want to see its competition, Jumanji first. I really loved this film the first time I saw it in the theaters about a decade ago, and if you've enjoyed it you know you have too. If you haven't seen Jumanji yet, you don't know what you're missing with the roll of the dice.<br /><br />Mastering: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Story: A-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyemnt: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I had never seen RENT on stage before I went to see the movie. Yet, I fell in love with the story, and went back to the movie theater over and over again. All of the characters are amazing. Although I didn't see Daphne Vega on the original play, I believe Rosario Dawson was born to play as Mimi. And although critics say the rest of the cast was too old for their roles, I think they were perfect. I am so tired of seeing sixteen year olds every time I turn on the TV or go to the movies.  <br /> <br />RENT is not only a play or a movie. RENT is an amazing experience. It makes me so greatful for life, health, and friends. It makes me not want to complain about anything, 'cause I'm not hungry or frozen; and I certainly don't have the kind of baggage these characters had. It makes me want to definitely measure my life in love.  <br /> <br />RENT is truly a work of art. I can't get enough of it. Thank you, Jonathan Larson! And thank you, Chris Columbus, for making this movie into a film. I am definitely getting the DVD the very first day it comes out; and I'm definitely flying to New York to see the play on Broadway this year.
0224076051|5.0|Looking at the various popular science books published on the topic of fundamental physics in recent years, one might be forgiven for getting confused between what is scientific fact and what is science fiction. We have grown used to seeing top theoretical physicists enthusing about Superstrings, extra dimensions, wormholes and time travel, all of which - on the basis of current evidence - belong in the latter category, but rarely do we get an assessment of the state of this particular art that concentrates on what is known rather than what the speaker/writer would like to believe.    Dr. Woit takes the view, as do I, that if we want Science Fiction, then we can watch Star Trek or read Isaac Asimov - these people, after all, are the professionals, and do a better job at this than Harvard Professors.    What I would like to concentrate on therefore is not, \\"Where can I let my imagination take me?\\" but the ultimately far more interesting - to a scientist at least - \\"What is Mother Nature trying to tell us?\\"    To do this requires a certain humility, a certain coolness, and above all the ability to exercise judgement. It is easy to be critical of other people's ideas, but to be critical of one's own without causing the creative flow to dry up altogether, is the real challenge.    The title of the book derives from a comment made by Wolfgang Pauli - one of the founders of quantum mechanics, and arguably someone who took the criticality too far - who, upon hearing a half-baked idea from a student, remarked, \\"Your theory is not correct. In fact, your theory is not even wrong. Your theory makes no predictions at all.\\"    Unfortunately, though, however much the enormous efforts expended on Superstring theory in the last twenty years may have pushed back the boundaries of mathematics, \\"not even wrong\\" is a fair and accurate assessment of its worth as a physical theory.    If theoretical particle physics is to dig itself out of the rut, it must start with an honest assessmentof its achievements to date. This is the main thing that Woit provides in this book. The first part is spent describing the so-called \\"standard model\\" of particle physics. Most of this material one may find elsewhere - most entertainingly in Crease and Mann's excellent, \\"The Second Creation\\" - but it is when the book gets to the chapter entitled, \\"Beyond the Standard Model\\" that it really starts to get going. Woit is not just about saying what these attempts were, but also why they were tried, and where they led. Although Superstring theory is the main focus of this analysis, it is by no means the only one: also explored are such topics as Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), Technicolor, Lattice Gauge Theories and many others, and all with an honesty that the advocates would admit only if wired up to a Polygraph.    This book is not the end of the story. It is, on the contrary, a beginning. It forms a basis from which the younger generation of scientists can decide what is and is not worth examining. The point is just that if you are going to heal yourself, the first thing you have to do is to acknowledge that you are ill in the first place. To have an account of the state of the art free of hype and unwarranted self-promotion is a major contribution.    I should also add that, like \\"The Second Creation\\", \\"Not Even Wrong\\" generally avoids mathematical equations and can be read by anyone.    It should be required reading for every researcher coming into the field of particle physics.

B00097A5I6|4.0|After \\"What's the Story\\" I felt the boys had lost the plot and were a two album band.  But not so!  I think as a complete album \\"Don't Believe\\" is probably their best work.  True there are no really outstanding tracks like Chapagne Supernova or the massive Wonderwall but every one is excellent.  I particularly like Mucky Fingers and Let there be love.  Like their first two albums it does have a Beatlesish sound to it, but so what! It's still good.  Anyway if you liked Definitely Maybe and What's the Story you will love this, and if you didn't why are you reading this review? <br /> <br />By the way if you like these guys listen to a bit of Paul Weller.  He didn't cross over to the US really, but in England he is the grandaddy that made bands like Oasis possible (and he is better).
B00005JOII|4.0|\\"The man who said it's more important to be lucky than good knew a lot about life.\\" Thus begins Woody Allen's \\"Match Point,\\" as Chris Wylton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the film's protagonist and anti-hero, demonstrates the truth of that statement in the bleakest way possible. Chris, a tennis pro from a poor family, is taken by the wealthy lifestyle of his new upper-class friends, the Hewetts, and begins a romance with Chloe (Emily Mortimer), the sweet, pretty but somewhat conventional daughter of the family. Chris' plans to enter the Hewetts' privileged world, however, are shaken when he meets Nola (Scarlett Johansson), the current girlfriend of Chloe's brother Tom (Matthew Goode). Nola, an aspiring actress also from the wrong side of the tracks, is sexy and enticing in a way Chloe could never aspire to be, and Chris soons finds himself obsessed with Nola even as he still courts Chloe. However, just as you think that this is going to become a standard Allen drama of adultery and confused emotions, Allen suddenly makes a U-turn into a far more dire scenario. Chris is shown reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\" early in the film, and suffice it to say that \\"Match Point\\" contains aspects of that story, as well as \\"An American Tragedy,\\" Allen's own \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" and the works of Thomas Hardy and Jim Thompson. The film could have been tightened a little, particularly toward the middle, but \\"Match Point\\" still ranks as the most intelligent and thought-provoking of Allen's recent movies, and the least like a retread of his previous work. There is very little humor, however, in \\"Match Point,\\" and the ending is so corrosively cynical that some viewers may have trouble digesting it. It helps that, once again, Allen has chosen his cast impeccably. Scarlett Johansson may well be the most interesting young actress in movies today, as well as the sexiest, and Rhys-Meyers oozes reptilian charm as Chris. (Rhys-Meyers recently won a Golden Globe for his excellent portrayal of Elvis Presley in a TV miniseries, and in some scenes in \\"Match Point\\" he looks like Elvis' evil twin.) There is also fine work from Mortimer and Goode; from Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton as their parents; and from such stalwarts of British rep as James Nesbitt, Ewen Bremner, and Margaret Tyzack.is Presley in a TV miniseries, and in some scenes in \\"Match Point\\" he looks like Elvis' evil twin.)

B00000AFFF|2.0|I had high hopes for this. I like Bacharach's stuff..songs like \\"Walk on By\\",\\"Any Day Now\\", \\"This Guy's in Love with You\\",\\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head\\", \\"Close to You\\" and \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\" rank among my favourites of all time. Costello's smart but jagged punk anthems like \\"What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, and Understanding?\\",\\"Allison\\", \\"Blame it on Cain\\",\\"Everyday I Write the Book\\", \\"Less than Zero\\", and \\"Pump it Up\\" also hit a chord with me.<br /><br />So it's with sadness that I report that overall this disc just doesn't grab me much. Costello turns some nice phrases here and there but there aren't enough \\"stick with you\\" hooks. Bacharach's music acquits itself nicely but it seems like wasted effort in some of these cases: like spraying glitter onto peeling paint.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />\\"Toledo\\" is where Costello's girl lives...the one who won't understand his foreign tryst: \\"But it's no use saying that I love you/And how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me/For if anyone should look into your eyes/It's not forgiveness that they're gonna see..\\" while in \\"I Still Have that Other Girl\\" Elvis struggles to allow himself time to get over a lost love before seeking a new one:\\"Despite the temptation I try to be very strong/In my reluctance seems a surprise/It's not 'cause I don't want you...\\" \\"God Give me Strength\\" from the Brian Wilson homage flic GRACE OF MY HEART is another standout. (\\"Since I lost the power to pretend/That there could ever be a happy ending/That song is sung out/This bell is rung out..\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />\\"Such Unlikely Lovers\\" is the most mismatched pairing of Bacharach's stylings and Costello's wordplay. \\"The Sweetest Punch\\" is lovely musically but the meter of the lyrics seem \\"pinched\\" into the tune. It's just awkward sounding.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This should have been so much more. *sigh* It's not awful but I can't really say it's memorable either.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots.  His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR  takes its place in that arena of black comedy.  Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost.  Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner.  The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world.  He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries.  He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.<br /><br />Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox.  Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence.  His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law.  The resolution of the  story is not an end but merely a tapering off.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen.  Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation.  The film is painful to absorb on this level.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth.  Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker.  The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful.  It is unusual for  a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining.  Recommended.

0156027321|5.0|When I read the jacket, which compared the story to \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway, I put the book back on the shelf.  Something urged me to try the book anyway.  I am glad I did.<br /><br />At times charming, revolting, gritty, and humorous, this book pulled me in and left me desperate to know how the story turned out.  Pi Patel is an enigmatic character, beginning with the origin of his name (Piscine.  Poor kid).  He lives in a Zoo in India, practices 3 diverse religions, and would have lived a life of mockery had it not been for his resourcefulness.  He is a rich character from the start.<br /><br />The sinking of the ship is very sad, desperate, and strangely unreal.  It sets the stage for a very odd story to follow.  Pi is thrown into a lifeboat with a hyena, and is joined by a Zebra with a broken leg, a tiger (Pi mistakenly pulled him onboard) and an oragutan.  These animals cannot live in harmony, and one by one they are picked off until only Pi and the tiger (named Richard Parker.  Take note of the names in this book) remain.  Pi first struggles to avoid the tiger, and then realizes his salvation will come by taming the tiger.<br /><br />The days at sea pass like a hallucination, filled with gory details of killing fish, cleaning excrement from the boat, and drinking water wherever it is found.  The relationship deepens between Pi and the tiger, although he always remembers that Richard Parker is a maneating tiger and not a companion.<br /><br />The end of the book leaves you doubting yourself and the story you have just read.  Was the journey with Richard Parker a colorful retelling of the 'real' tragic struggle in the lifeboat, or did Pi cross the ocean with a tiger in his lifeboat?  I make the same choice as the Japanese insurance agents.  I choose the better story.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|Ok, so I wasn't really a big fan of Within Temptation until recently, when my friend encouraged or should I say \\"pursuaded\\" me to buy the album, and I'm glad that she did. This album is absaloutely amazing. As a fan of Evanescence, and Lacuna Coil, I was expecting something fairly similar, and I can say that Within Temptation are more opera based, which I think is good. THe notes that that the lead singer can reach really is outstanding, her voice is so mesmerizing. I have alot of respect for this band, I think that some people find it difficult not to compare this band to bands like Evanescence, Lacuna Coil and perhaps even Nightwish, whilst there are vague similarities, I think that Within Temptation are a very unique band that should get all the recognition they deserve. I would now consider myself a fan, however, this is the first album I have bought, and have yet to listen to their previous ones.  <br />I hope that if you're reading this review, or any of the other positive reviews, that you'll listen to a few songs by this band, and recognize the talent that they have! <br /> <br />In my opinion, the stand out tracks on this album are: Stand my ground, See who I am, Forsaken, Angels and It's the fear.
B00004STOZ|5.0|Five \\"Clavier-ed\\" Stars!! Bach's Goldberg variations, the last of the Clavierübung series, are part of his very ambitious and large masterwork of Baroque music dedicated solely to the harpsichord and are almost the only example of variations ever composed by Bach. Notice how the Arias (Number 1 and 32) bookend the thirty variations between them, achieving musical balance and reiteration. And how the Canons are repeated in intervals of 3 until Number 27.<br /><br />Mr Jarrett is a musician well known in the music world for his total dedication, awesome technique, and fiendish attention to detail, sometimes striking fear into noisy audiences. His execution of these 32 variations on the harpsichord are fabulous renditions. His blazing technique is wonderful as he articulates each of the variations with aplomb, bordering on sangfroid.<br /><br />My favorite 'Pieces De Resistance' are the 'Vituoso' pieces of 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, and 29, plus the 'quodlibet', the 31st variation. In this case, these variation parts exceed the Aria themes in my opinion, perhaps as they should. Bravo, Keith Jarrett. Five HUGE Stars.<br /><br />(Note: Legend says Bach was paid with a golden goblet full of coins for this alleged 'commissioned' Baroque masterwork written for Goldberg. If so, it wasn't enough.)
B000002U8G|5.0|that hasn't been mentioned countless times before? This was the beginning of the phase where PF finally found their true musical identity. Maybe one could have said likewise for their previous release 'Atom Heart Mother', which had a similar structure - a number of short/medium length tracks plus one long track taking up half the album. Except in this case 'Meddle' is a far superior and musically much more consistent offering. From here on right up to 'The Wall', PF produced a succession of albums of astonishing high quality with output that unquestionably stands the test of time. A true sign of musical achievment.<br /><br />If you are a PF fan, then it's safe to assume you already own 'Meddle' and love it. If you are just discovering PF for whatever reason, (they have been around for almost 40 years) then 'Meddle' is really the ideal PF album to get you started, before you hear DSOTM or WYWH. Everything about it, from the thundering  psychedelic opener 'One of These Days...' to the closing 23 minute epic of 'Echoes' elevates this album into masterpiece territory. A personal favourite track is 'A Pillow of Winds' a gentle, sleepy, folk-like song played on acoustic and slide guitars. This is an ideal track for driving lethargically down a lonely highway on a hot sunny day. It has a real haunting quality about it,and shows how well PF can evoke different moods and contrasts with their music.<br /><br />The track 'Seamus, which most Americans don't seem to 'get' perhaps deserves an explanation. 'Meddle' was recorded in 1971 on the tail of the '60s British blues boom movement. This song was purely a joke track that offered a light dig at this. That's all it was about, a brief bit of levity before the final cut, 'Echoes'.<br /><br />'Echoes' is pure musical excellence. It is one of those tracks that convinces me that PF probably represents the best example where rock music can very occasionally approach classical music status. Fifty years on it will still sound brilliant. As others have said, it's worth buying 'Meddle' just for this track alone. 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' recorded 4 years later is another timeless example.<br /><br />Overall 'Meddle' is essential listening, and an album you will never tire of playing.it's worth buying 'Meddle' just for this track alone.

B0001Z36PK|4.0|This unusual CD is very much a grower, as other reviewers have rightly said and as always with growers, you end up liking the least user-friendly songs best. First, Neil Hannon's voice dominates the proceedings - stating the bleedin'obvious, you may say - but it is a most unusual voice constantly challenged and egged on by some of the equally extraordinary and original arrangements and orchestrations. As a result, Neil's offerings can no longer be called pop music or even anything like it, with such oddities as a bass bassoon in \\"Happy Goth\\", a purely string backed song in \\"Our mutual friend\\", an almost music-hall setting for \\"Charmed Life\\" and God knows what for the instrumental \\"Laika's theme\\". <br /> <br />Neil Hannon can really really sing, and he gets those notes: sometimes, as you may guess from the heading, the whole thing reminds me of a much more thoughtful and emotionally charged Temperance Seven, fuelled by Whispering Paul McDowell's 20s voice and Joseph Kronk's exceptional arrangements. <br /> <br />The obvious \\"quickies\\" are \\"Absent Friends\\" and \\"Come home Billy Bird\\", the first sounding like a mad canter through the Big Country with a cast of Neil's unlikely characters and the second a light-hearted romp about a sad middle manager waking up drunk after a Belgian businmess meetinmg and trying to catch his plane home to see son's match. Very good, almost poppy but not quite. \\"Happy Goth\\", about the lonely adolescent girl locked in her inarticulacy, costume and attitude, listening to something awful like Nirvana, is deeply affecting in its portrayal of complete communication breakdown (\\"that's what she would say, if she ever talked to you\\")- and it features the bass bassoon: knighthoods all round.  I know a young girl like this and she is also lovely inside and out - but her beautiful self has almost sunk to screaming point under the loneliness and image. Desperately sad. \\"The Wreck of the Beautiful\\", Neil's frightening ghostly allegorical tale of a shiprusting to death, is just outstanding and shows a complete maturity of thought, writing, singing and arrangment - beyond all doubt one of the best two or three things he has ever produced. The same is true of \\"Sticks and stones\\" (\\"you and I go together, like the molar and the drill\\") about romantic breakdown and of \\"Leaving today\\" about Dad leaving home and all the heartache involved. Bye bye, bye bye. <br /> <br />\\"Our mutual friend\\", a witty story about being gazumped over a girl by the mutual friend (another refernce to Noel Coward) who introduced them, is a musical storm with the staccato strings and then a wall of emotion at the end, is great and so is \\"Freedom Road\\" which I find very chilling. It's built around one guitar clawhammer chord, except that orchestrations give it another new dimension of almost fear and a whole new chord sequence. \\"Laika's theme\\" is an odd instrumental that will not be to everbody's taste, but \\"Charmed Life\\", a genuine thanks to arriving at a happy state, includes the tribute line \\"Breaking up is so very hard to do\\" - nice touch!  <br /> <br />I suppose that any other \\"band\\" would have had 5 stars for this very odd and deeply moving work, but Neil is such a one-off that he has to be judged agaist himself, really. Make no mistake, you will play this until the laser guide disappears and it is incredibly good, well thought out and beautifully played (just get the bass and strings on Charmed Life). <br /> <br />When Neil Hannon gets a universal five stars there will not really be any competition left in this field, and there's very little as it is. Worth every penny of your money and this will stick with you for life, I guess. Excellent, unique - but also unsettling and chilling at times. Music isn't always fun, gang.
6302797519|5.0|The key to enjoying Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim on screen is accepting the hero's personal standard at face value: \\"if I lose without honor, then everything will have been for nothing.\\" We in the West often think of winning, often at all costs, and so to win with honor seems a noble goal. But what of losing without honor? Dramatizing this theme is what distinguishes this movie from practically every other film to come out of Hollywood. And Peter O'Toole's character enunciates this credo explicitly at the end of the movie, as he explains his decision not to run away from the consequences of his actions a second time.<br /><br />The movie was beautifully photographed in Southeast Asia, the screenplay is articulate yet concise, and the acting is uniformly superb. Aside from O'Toole's subtle performance are first-rate contributions from Paul Lukas as the elderly trader who plays a father surrogate role to O'Toole's Jim, an understated Dalia Lavi as his love interest, Eli Wallach enjoying himself as a local warlord, and James Mason almost delectable as an English pirate. Often overlooked is Curt Jurgens, who turns in a quiet but powerful character study of a drunk filled with self-loathing, someone who foreshadows what Lord Jim would have been transformed into had he chose to run away.<br /><br />This is one of the last great films from Hollywood's heyday.

B00005JOHI|5.0|The Jane Austen novel is one, that in my opinion, everyone should read. The first time I read this novel was when i was 8 years old, and though at first the colorful language of the story was difficult to comprehend, I must say, it was well worth the struggle. Now a 16 year old, I have read the book several times, and most recently, I have refallen in love with the story through the most recent production of Pride & Prejudice.  <br />Some say that they do not think that Keira Knightley being cast as Elizabeth Bennet was wise, but I think that she brought elegance to the role. She is beautiful, which differs with the book, but she does true justice to Lizzie. Her unique style of playing her is one of the reasons I was drawn to the film. I also believe that Matthew Macfadyen did a delightful job with Mr. Darcy. As the movie progressed, his softer side was revealed. Macfadyen and Knightley had chemistry that made the love passionate and real, without them, I doubt that I would truly be as fond of the film as I am.  <br />However, I must mention that I have not to this day seen the 5 hour BBC production, which I have heard is wonderful. I believe that the film is a great interpretation, and the young actors bring the passion of the romance to life. Like most have said, the socio-economic level of the Bennets could have been depicted better, and the entire Wickham story line was significantly shortened. Although despite these aspects, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The locations used along with costumes, music, and cast created a masterpiece that I can guarentee you I will buy. I was disappointed when Knightley didnt get the Golden Globe for this movie, yet I guess that's all I can expect, for she is still a young British actress in an American society. However, Mark my words, her day will come! <br />To this day, I have seen Pride & Prejudice 3 times, and only three because it became too costly to see it at the movie theaters. This fantastic movie quickly became one of my favorites, and I am confident that it will remain one.

6305807086|5.0|Without writing too much (most of the fun of this film comes from discovering its originality on your own), it can be said without doubt that \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is an amazing piece of filmmaking.  It reminds us where film can take us, and is arguably the best example of creative screenwriting in the last decade or so. <br />The film is about a puppeteer named Craig Schwartz (John Cusak) who, upon taking a new job filing for a small company, discovers a hidden door in his office, which leads to a long and narrow tunnel.  Crawling through the tunnel himself, he finds that the door is actually a portal in to the mind of actor John Malkovich: whoever goes through the portal spends fifteen minutes living the life of Malkovich through Malkovich's eyes.  A bizarre idea already, but the fun begins when Craig and his co-worker, Maxine, (Catherine Keener) decide to sell trips through the portal after work hours in their office are over.  Like a Malkovich theme-park ride. <br />  Without giving away any more, I will say that the film features great performances all around, but sticks out because Cusak and Cameron Diaz play characters so different than what they are typically cast as. <br />  The film features some classic scenes, including a climactic chase scene through Malkovich's sub-conscious.  Genius.  An amazing example of original filmmaking, directed by music video director Spike Jonze, making his feature-film debut.
0553573403|4.0|I'm quite impressed with the book and story, but it took me a while to get there. There are many parallel story lines here and it takes time to absorb and understand each branch.  There is a host of many sympathetic characters: a young boy who becomes a paraplegic and yet has dreams of flying, a princess queen by birth who is lost in a foreign country and yet showing greatness, a creepy boy king with a manipulative icky mother, awesome huge wolf pets, a bastard son cast into outer darkness yet who will have a role in some kind of future war, a 14 year old potentially genius military leader who may become king, a young tomboy girl who is delightfully clever, resourceful and who seems destined to have a great role in the future.  The honest and hard working father of some of these characters is too trusting too straight forward to make it in a world of creeps and vipers and his story is almost too real and too sad.  And yet as I make predictions about some of these characters, I realize that I may be way off.  There is no obvious story line here.  Any excellent character can have his or her head cut off tomorrow, and this makes the book far more realistic than other similar books which have an obvious story line that is playing out.<br /><br />There is also a somewhat politically incorrect view of the world which at first seems a little bit offensive but over time kind of grew on me.  Men are overtly sexual having various flings which result in the birth of bastard kids, young girls are virtually forced into sexual unions and yet seem to survive and even thrive.  It helps create this world that is different enough from our own that it is a bit shocking, but at the same time it makes it all more real and believable.  Obviously, the Vikings by today's standards weren't politically correct and yet their world seems somewhat inviting in a natural man and natural instincts sort of way.  This makes the book remarkably different from other such Tolkein inspired literature.<br /><br />There isn't much magic in this first book and yet at the end of the book it appears as if stronger doses are coming with evil non-humans who live in the far north as well as with the rebirth of a long extinct creature.<br /><br />The world created here is real and somewhat painful.  At the end of the book, we are left hanging in every story line.  But, I have the feeling that there will be some excellent payoffs in the next book.  There better be.  It's a lot of reading to be let down.  I'm going to resist the temptation to read reviews of the next book.<br /><br />So, give the book a try and post your thoughts.  I'd enjoy reading your reaction.<br /> <br />There isn't much magic in this first book and yet at the end of the book it appears as if stronger doses are coming with evil non-humans who live in the far north as well as with the rebirth of a long extinct creature. <br /> <br />The world created here is real and somewhat painful.

B000AL730O|3.0|Yeah, \\"Chaos\\" is a pretty good album, but I can't understand the extremes to which our customer reviewers are stroking Sir Paul and his latest creation. Many are saying this is his best album EVER. No, no, no. It's a far cry from that. It's strictly a three-star showing. If you haven't heard \\"Chaos and Creation,\\" you'll be pleased to know that Paul's voice and sense of melody remain undiminished. You will have probably heard that Paul played most of the instruments, and he plays them well, so instrumentation isn't an issue. Most of all, you'll be absolutely delighted that Paul seems to be singing about HIMSELF and his life -- his emotions as he clears the backyard of his life. No Desmond and his barrow, no Rocky and his Bible, no silver hammers. The problem, of course, is that he's mysterious about the precise meaning, leaving us backwards-album players to wonder WHO THE HECK BURNED HIM IN VANITY FAIR? As I said, this is a solid record. He has earned each of his three stars. On the downside, it's a very plain and -- forgive me for saying this -- dreary album. There isn't a song on there that I'd listen to first thing in the morning to get ready for work. Very little of that old rock and roll, you know? And, as another reviewer mentioned, a few of the lyrics are kinda silly. Forced rhymes. I'll listen to this record many times over the next 20 years, but I doubt I'll ever finish listening to it and ache to hear it again. Believe it or not, I'm a huge fan, but I'm not gonna blow five stars just because \\"he's brilliant.\\" And he is. So was John, and we all know John created quite a few stinkers. Call 'em as you see 'em.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|\\"Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World\\" depicts the adventures of the HMS Surprise, a British frigate trolling the Atlantic during the Napoleonic Wars.  The ship's captain, \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is ordered to track down and engage the French frigate, Acheron.  One foggy night, the Surprise happens upon the Acheron, with full out battle following.  The Surprise is forced to retreat, and a genuinely exciting game of cat and mouse between the two ships ensues for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Clunky title notwithstanding, \\"Master and Commander\\" is a truly superb action film.  I have never been a fan of movies about 19th century seafaring.  The battle scenes are too often both static and confusing.  However, Peter Weir is more than up to the task here; he's always been an outstanding director, but this film is among his best work.  The chase scenes and ensuing battles are suspenseful and fully engaging.  Weir also manages to infuse a great deal of humanity - each time a member of the Surprise is killed or even injured, it's heart-breaking.  Fortunately, he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for directing, his fourth.<br /><br />The Oscar nominated script is beautiful but never cloying, with wonderful acting contributing to its success.  Crowe and Bettany (as Dr. Stephen Maturin) brilliantly portray the complex relationship between their characters - close friends who respect but also challenge each other.  The film is, of course, based on two novels from the esteemed series by Patrick O'Brian.  I have not read any of the Aubrey-Maturin books, so I cannot attest to how accurate the film is.  However, clearly a viewer need not have read the books to enjoy the film.  Incidentally, I immediately purchased the first book in the series and hope to tackle it soon.  Finally, every technical aspect of \\"Master and Commander\\" is exceptional - the score, cinematography, costumes, and so forth.  All these elements add up to a lush modern classic.. <br />
B00026WU3M|5.0|Oh Mercy~ showcases the greatness of Bob Dylan. Dylan is not only an accomplished lyricist but also a versitaile muisician that can play a plethora of instruments, including piano, organ, and harmonica to mention a few. His vocals sounds crisp and the lyrics are well written and pertinent without being didactic. Some of the highlights of this album are Ring them bells, Political World and Man in the long black coat. The photo on the back is a nice one with Dylan looking very pensive but I do not like the cover and I have no idea what it is trying to convey. Even so this is a very good album that should not be missed.
0451457994|5.0|The movie glosses over much of the backdrop of this tale and thats a shame.  Its a lush contemplative movie but the book really fills in the holes.  Didn't you ever wonder what was going on inside the heads of those pre-humans as they met the first obilisk?  Ever ponder what was driving the space program or craved more as to what was going on inside Mr. Bowmans or Mr. Poole's head?  Curious to know what Hal thinks is going on?  If you want to know more you gotta read the book. As a bonus the book is a bit different than the movie turned out to be.  This is a classic!
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I really enjoyed this CD and just want to compliment Michael and the producers to keep this musical tradition going.  having said that, i must wonder, did Michael break any new grounds?  the answer sadly is no.  i think a i get a deeper and more seasoned musical from the likes of Tony Bennett, Mel Torme and of course Frank, chairman of the board.  i hope michael continues to work hard and explore new grounds.  my best regards and wishes for him.

0385504209|5.0|Why am I even writing a review for this masterpiece? This is quite simply the greatest book ever! from the characters to the story line. Brown brings everything together in an instant masterpiece. This is the \\"Mona Lisa\\" of Books. They should keep a copy of a book in the Louvere museum behind bullet proof glass.
0812550706|5.0|This is my favorite space opera type novel.  Of course i like Fred Saberhagens Berserker series (especially the short stories which have some good twists at the ends) but this is tops on my list.  Perhaps it isn't the most brilliant writing in the whole universe but it does what any great book should do - pulls you along, keeps you up reading long after you should go to bed, makes you think, and then tilts the world on its head at the end.  Read this before someone tells you the ending.  You will be recommending this to others until the end of your days.
0156027321|5.0|this book was addictive....and getting off the crack was difficult for me once i finished it.  350 pages in a single day is a rarity for me, but this one sucked me in from the start. <br /> <br />i much preferred the harrowing, allegorical version of the story.  it made all of the fantasy rapidly melt into reality. the words that kept ringing through my head after swallowing the closing pages were these: you don't have to have faith in god, but you must have faith in the human spirit. <br /> <br />the religious references were appreciated, but unmoving.  the power of this book comes from martel's storywriting abilities...the pure, tragic, magical, and grotesque...
B000AGTPUU|4.0|I thought this movie was great fun and I decided to give it a try because it has similar type graphics in the \\"Barbie\\" movies and my girls seem to like those. Anyway, if you have a sensitive child please be aware that before they even reach Santa Claus, that they have at least 5 near death experiences. It is very intense and my 5 yr old was crying and deeply distressed that they kids were going to \\"die\\". I was surprised at the intensity myself. Now my 3 yr old doesn't understand that walking on top of a train, or going across ice on a train can hurt you. But my 5 yr old is now old enough to know that certain things are very dangerous and was very upset. She now will not watch the movie and we had to put it away, maybe for when she is a bit older and can handle the intensity. I am not trying to scare you away from the film because I thought they did a good job with it, but if you have a sensitive child you may want to view the movie first before letting them see this film.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|This movie was great! there were parts in the movie that scared the heck out of me!  loved the evil dogs, zombie movies are some of my favorite in the horror/sci fi genre.  It was great seeing a new take on the Zombie storyline.  Unlike \\"Dawn On The Dead\\", we were actually given a reason as to why this was happening, and why people were coming back to life. <br /> <br />The Red Queen was creepy, but then again little kids in these kinds of movies are usually creepy to me anyway. <br /> <br />Loved the action! loved scares!
1932100385|5.0|<br />What is he selling? why is he writing? Unlike so many authors in this field who are flogging a branded/franchised regimen, T. Colin Campbell is offering the world the benefit of his scholarly wisdom. 36 pages of clinical references; this man doesn't mess around! His anti-reductionist admiration for the complexity of nature echos through the pages. Laid out logically and irrefutably,his interpretations of mountains of test results makes for an excellent read.
0060930187|4.0|i found it very interesting how plath, towards the end of the protagonist's recovery, dabbled in the fear of falling back into darkness...mainly because this is exactly what happened to the author.  her bell jar fell back down upon her and in the end, she took her own life. <br /> <br />i would not consider this book an extraordinary contribution to the realm of literature...but it was captivating, nonetheless, and the prose was astounding, this being the author's strength.  this story allows one to have a glimpse into plath's dark world...to see things through her eyes (though never through her mind, i still cannot get why she was so miserable).  good read, but nothing above any other autobiographical attempt to depict oneself spiraling into insanity.

B0000042HV|5.0|It is extremely difficult for a westerner, living in today's modern democracies, to have the full grasp of the extent of censorship and control of the Stalinist regime. During most of his creative life, Shostakovich was under surveillance, and some of his works were publicly censored by the self-intitled followers of the \\"Socialist Realism\\". The tension of censorship is reflected in his body of symphonies. The uneveness and limitations of some of his symphonies  are a reflection of his limitations under Stalin. His string quartets, however, are mostly free from these limitations. For one, it is extremely difficult to establish what is \\"socialist realism\\" in a string quartet. Since Shostakovich was not a follower of serialism, he could afford to translate into the string quartet medium most of his tortured inner self. These quartets are filled with humanism.  They are not easy listening in the sense of Hadyn and Mozart. They are rather deep, touching pieces, like the late Beethoven, Schummann, or Bartok. These recordings by the Fitzwilliam Quartet have an immense authority at a reasonable price. Lovers of string quartet cannot afford to be without the entire Shostakovich set, and anynone buying this collection will enjoy a lifetime of rewarding listening.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I can halfway understand the negative reviewers who give this movie one star and say \\"don't waste your time, money, etc.\\". If you didn't know anything about this movie before watching, chances are you hated it. This film is not standard filmmaking by any stretch.  It has its own unique place, and there are some who will appreciate and be receptive, and there will be others who will not get the point and write caustic reviews on Amazon.  The most fair suggestion I can say is, watch the movie first (or at least research it), then decide to buy or not.<br /><br />Statements such as \\"the Straight Story and Elephant Man were brilliant movies\\" can just as easily be refuted.  I hated both of those movies.  The reason I can sit through Eraserhead but not the Straight Story is because I WANT to see something different, something bizarre, something that is open to interpretation.  David Lynch is an artist; I view this movie like I would view a painting.  Is a Jackson Pollock painting 'garbage' or a 'waste of space' because you cannot discern an image in his swirls and sploches?<br /><br />A good review, or hundreds of good reviews will not change who will like and dislike this movie.  I like it, I stand by it, I vouch for it.  Your average person will not like this movie.  It's weird and hard to watch.  It's unpleasant.  Its low budget.  But those of us who like this movie will not be bothered by negative reviews; I feel the same way about almost every mainstream film that plays in the theatre.<br /><br />PS.  Why do people critique this movie on a moral basis?  Who ever told you this movie was ever supposed to be uplifting or have a moral lesson?  There are a plethora of other movies with prettied moral lessons or that focus on the 'good' points of humanity...go watch those if that is what you want!  Yin and yang....not every movie has to make you feel good about your life.  This is clearly a negative movie in many regards.  That does not mean that those who are interested in this film live in total negativity.al negativity.
B000007ODL|5.0|J.J. Cale is one of those underrated artists, whose recordings are most appreciated by other musicians.  Eric Clapton and Dire Straits are direct evidence of platinum selling artists love for the down home bluesy guitar grooves of J.J. Cale.  The man wrote two of the most appreciated modern day blues rock songs, \\"Cocaine,\\" and \\"After Midnight.\\"  What's interesting is hearing his original versions.  They are more laid back and have a groove that cannot be easily replicated. <br /> <br />I find myself embracing J.J. Cale's versions of his tracks the most.  He reminds me of Johnny Cash in a way.  He is so real and raw in his recordings.  This is music that warms the soul and invokes a certain comfort.  Like other artists who have been covered and sampled to death, J.J. Cale stands above the heap of commercialism in music.  He is a true artist.  An Oklahoma road warrior.  There are other examples, including a band called Cymande - on the album renegades of funk, where the power of hearing the true original voice of an artists' music is always a more authentic listening experience.  This best of collection is highly recommended.  I hope J.J. Cale knows that he is a true original in American music.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|\\"What if the blood, flesh, and screams were yours?\\" asks the movie poster.  If the sight of blood makes you queasy; if intense scenes of pain and torture make you ill; if the thought of being turned into hamburger meat makes you want to run and faint, so the anonymous, practiced voice on the commercial advises, go see another movie.  With all the juvenile tact of I-dare-you-to, the movie challenges you to see what is in essence a mainstream faux snuff flick. <br /> <br />But is it scary? <br /> <br />After nearly 40 minutes of two women playing every dumb slut stereotype and prancing naked, the blood works begin.  Everyone watching the film knows that the sluts are just soulless bait-everyone  but the horny poor back travelers that soon meet up with some rather pathetic even more soulless types that get their kicks in torturing people. <br /> <br />There is no suspense in the movie.  There is no lead up or character build-up.  The most sympathetic character is killed off just after the first 40 minutes and new characters who we know almost nothing about come into the movie.  Compared to the suspense master, Stephen King, the writer and director of Hostel, Eli Roth, lacks the skills necessary to have turned this movie into something other than how a meat grinder works. <br /> <br />Scary has an element of the unknown, in which suspense builds-up more and more until you cannot take it any more, sensing that impending doom.  Concurrent with this in a horror movie is to have your audience care for the characters and sympathize with them.  The movie fails to do this.  The movie is not scary-but it is \\"gruesome\\" to most. <br /> <br />As a former EMS worker, I have seen a man with half his arm off, bone marrow literally oozing out; a woman who fell into her window while standing on a ladder, cutting off with surgical precision half her lower face that flapped to the side as if she was wearing a Halloween mask.  I have sceen what a 12-guage shotgun does to the head of a manthat quite literally blew the top of his head off; a woman who was eviscerated in an alley way; and various assortments of other \\"gruesome\\" acts.  No, the sight of blood does not make me ill.  And no, this movie was not scary to me.    <br /> <br />What it was, however, was quite frankly unrealistic and evening boring at many times-and somewhat angering.  The premise is that there is this seemingly idyllic town whose main source of income is running an underground torture industry out of an abandoned manufacturing plant.  Sadists from around the world come and pay various prices for people to torture.  Local men are the lowest price; local women a bit higher; various prices for other Europeans; Americans topping at a higher price; but Asian women the most expensive: $50,000. <br /> <br />In one scene were a poor Asian woman is horrifically tortured, including her eye slowly removed, you begin to wonder just how exactly would this \\"industry\\" work?  Despite Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth claiming on the late night circuit that they \\"thought of how\\" and presented a realistic portrayal of that economic mechanics, they do not.  How, for instance, does one advertise such a service without attracting authorities or knowing how to target your sadistic audience?  And even if there are \\"people\\" out there that would want to do this, they too would wonder who would be running this kind of service to trust.  Is it an entrapment-by either authorities or maybe even sicker minds or those that want to eliminate such evil?  And the runners of this \\"business\\" just take people to be killed, treating them as if truly disposable and no one would care or eventually come to the town.  Despite all this, numerous clients and endless bodies amass-and the business thrives.  No, this is not a realistic film. <br /> <br />And what of the clients?  What makes them \\"tick\\" and drives them?  Why do they want to do this?  Is it out of past trauma, some unresolved anger or pain, insanity, or just boredom and apathy for the human race?  The movie never addresses these obvious questions.   <br /> <br />Putting yourself in the mind of one of these clients, wouldn't you still be worried of being prayed on yourself, discovered and retaliated upon by say the love ones who you tortured and killed?  Perhaps the people who you just paid $50,000 to pluck the eye out of the Asian woman, will then grab you, gag your dumb ass, and bound you to a chair for the next client.  Or perhaps that woman was the daughter of someone quite important or even more nuttier than you, took a chain saw to one of the \\"business people\\" and came eventually to your door, where one day you arrive home to find your family gagged and bound and get to see first hand a more imaginative use of a Black and Decker drill that your imagination was too limited to envision.  No, somehow I doubt this would be the volume or lucrative business that Eli Roth portrays.   <br /> <br />And what of the bait gals?  Are they dumb or what?!  They are working for people who are killing off the locals as well, and moreover these girls are pretty and sexy, the very type that some of the sadistic clients are seeking.  Yeah, you won't kill the lure so long as they are making the fish bite, but once crow's feet comes creeping in, then what?  Maybe one day the main mafia-like thug running the buisness fiugres he's made enough and now needs to clean house and move on and not too interested in sharing the real profits and fiugres he'll make a little more in departing and clean house at the same time.  Oh yeah, this movie makes total sense. <br /> <br />The blood and \\"gore\\" may distract you, but the truth is that despite so many saying was a great \\"horror\\" flick this is, it really sucks.  It lacks imagination and proves far more tedious than being a convincing real, honest-to-goodness \\"horror\\" flick. <br /> <br />Sorry Eli, strike two baby.  Cabin Fever bombed, and this one is not destined to be a classic.  Spew all the blood you want, but it does little to compensate for a lack of real talent peaches.  Indeed, after seeing this movie, you might want to take a chain saw to Eli Roth for having so inundated you with all the hype in the movie trailers and then letting you down at the end. <br />
B000BYRCH4|3.0|The lush Caribbean scenery and the delightful physical attributes of the movie's stars are the highlight of this otherwise routine criminal caper.  Paul Walker (TIMELINE, FAST AND FURIOUS) and Jessica Alba (DARK ANGEL, SIN CITY, FANTASTIC FOUR) are surely easy on the eyes, and the underwater photography is sumptuous.  Scott Caan and Ashley Scott aren't hard to look at either.  The storyline follows these four on a search for sunken treasure and their discovery of a downed airplane full of cocaine, which some nasty bad guys want, of course.  James Frain is the head badguy, a Britisher named Reyes, and Josh Brolin looking more and more like Dad James is aboard as a rival treasure seeker.  The movie starts out a little slowly, and you're wondering if anything's going to happen, but once it does, it picks up the pace and ends up being derivative but entertaining.
B0002IQEHI|4.0|I had viewed this film for a class I was taking in college, with no real intention of paying too much attention except for the music (it was a music in film class).  Surprisingly I enjoyed this film immensly! The only other Hitchcock film I had seen is 'The Birds', which I enjoyed but I found it kind of predictable.  However, 'North by Northwest' is constantly turning you in different directions so you don't really know what to expect next.  I havn't bought this DVD yet, but it will soon be added to my collection.
B000002HNR|1.0|Do not buy this CD \\"Absolutely Live\\" by the Doors. Pay the extra few dollars more & get the double CD, \\"In Concert\\" instead. The reason, the \\"In Concert\\" double disk has the live albums \\"Absolutely Live,\\" \\"Alive She Cried\\" & \\"Live At The Hollywood Bowl\\" all in one package with one exception: an unreleased live version of 'The End' (the main reason to get that double disk just for that song alone!). Get it & it'll be money worth spent.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|A fantastic soundtrack to an incredibly moving film. This soundtrack compliments this very emotional thought-provoking movie wonderfully. Willie Nelson's version of 'He Was A Friend Of Mine' is so perfect, you think it was written FOR the film. It captures the feelings so perfectly. Emmylou's, as many of the other tracks, are right on target. If the film stays with you for several days after you see it, this CD takes you right back to the same place.  <br /> <br />I am not a fan of country music at all -- but I love this CD. I never liked the original version of 'King of the Road' (heard in the film on a car radio), but I love the CD version.  'The Maker Makes' is a haunting conclusion to the CD, as is the final instrumental... which takes you back to the closing scene of the film. <br /> <br />I would have eliminated 'It's So Easy' though. I love Linda, but in the film it is primarily played in the background on a juke box to let you know what year it is. I usually skip over this song, only because I know it so well, and it doesn't really add anything to the mood.   <br /> <br />Still, it is a 5-star album...
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I share something w/ many of the previous reviewers--e.g. I am female and love Jane Austen novels; however, I am aware that movie interpretations of her book tend to be more of the 'chick-flick' category; this was the first movie I have ever gone to see by myself (because I wanted to spare my boyfriend the experience, given above 'prejudice'); I thoroughly enjoyed the experience together w/ an equally enthused diverse full house; AND it is the only movie I have ever paid for to see an unreasonable 4 times in the theater, which brings me to something I have in common with ALL the previous reviewers:  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. <br /> <br />A big fan of Firth myself, I actually prefer this version to the A&E series.  Despite the liberties taken, it aspires to be a much more real, down-to-earth vision of the novel, without the stuffy glorification of Britain's Romantic Era.  Firth is a natural Darcy (see other roles such as in Bridget Jones), but I loved the fresh youthful take of Knightly and McFaydden that brings modern relevance to this beloved classic and the growing pains of its timeless characters.   <br /> <br />Male/female, old/young, Firth-fan and Austinphile or not so much--this film is delightfully light-hearted, witty, and beautifully shot with a superb-cast!
0307276902|5.0|Frey's memoir is a modern masterpiece with enormous impact. Just like the Bible, there are people who are going to interpret every word in this story literally until the words have no meaning, and there are those who will be nourished and revitalized because their minds are open and they have no hidden agenda. It takes a lot of courage to free oneself from the prison of caring about others' opinions; James Frey has succeeded and I hope he'll continue to write from his heart.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|An excellent album. Not DT's best, but still an amazing album.  <br /> <br />1. Root of All Evil- 10/10. An excellent track that builds up slowly and then hits with a killer riff and some amazing guitar work.  <br /> <br />2. Answer Lies Within- 9/10. It's slow, melodic, relaxing, and the softest song on the album.  <br /> <br />3. These Walls- 10/10. One helluva track. Heavenly in it's own right. I love it.  <br /> <br />4. I Walk Beside You- 6/10. I never really liked this one as much as the others, unfortunately. It's too joyful. The instrumental work is great, as always, but I don't like LaBRie's vocals on this song.  <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack- 10/10. The heaviest song on the album, and one of the best. It hits you like a sledgehammer when it starts, and has a weird, creepy ending which promptly leads through into... <br /> <br />6. Never Enough- 10/10. The opening line is so good, I nearly jump out my chair with glee every time I hear it. It always gets stuck in my head. Another awesome song. <br /> <br />7. Sacrificed Sons- 8/10. A freaky beginning which goes on for a painful length of time. THe rest of the song is pretty good though. It's about war, and is quite slow. Cool tune.  <br /> <br />8. Octavarium- 50/10. An epic. An absolute, holy, sacred, blessed, incredible epic song. Stretching over 24 minutes, it leaves the listener stunned with silent awe. My ove for this song can never be broken. From the first three slow, echoing minutes, to the classic, screaming finale, there is nothing but pure power in this song.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007OASII|5.0|Kahn - Vocals  Thomas Youngblood - Guitars  Glenn Berry - Bass  Oliver Polatai - Keyboards  Casey Grillo - Drums      My friend introduced this band to me with a mix of Kamelot's songs from their early, early cds.  I wasn't that interested at the time.  Soon later, he lent me \\"The Black Halo\\", and boy it took me forever to give it back to him.  This cd was so addicting!! Khan's voice and the melodic music that fills the background interweave so well together, it's like Oreos dipped in milk.  \\"The Haunting(Somewhere in Time)\\" is well................haunting and one of the most ROCKIN\\" out songs on this cd.  It's Evergrey meets Dream Theater and all the best in between on this album.    This cd is mad packed with melodic choruses, headbanging guitar riffs by Youngblood, and insane break downs on the drums by Grillo to finish it off.  The orchestral appeal enhanced the quality tenfold giving it that enchanting atmospheric feel.  No song on here sounds alike, yet for every song they find ways to make it mesmerizing and atmospheric each time. Not too many bands are able to acheive this, especially on one of their newer albums.        \\"Moonlight\\" was the first song on this cd that I heard, and I thought it was so good that I would never have time to listen to the rest.  But my friend forced me to listen to the whole thing and woah, blown away.  Now \\"Moonlight\\" has become one of the songs I listen to the least, that's how well constructed these songs are.  The first song \\"March of Mephisto\\" is an armeggedon march kind of song and is an excellent intro into this album.  It is one of my favorites, and it also guest features Shagrath the lead singer of Dimmu Borgir.  I would like to go into every song, but I don't feel like writing a novel.    Overall, this album has become one of my top progressive metal albums after about one month on my shelf.  My cd player soon learns to play the songs without the cd I've listened to it so much.  BUT ENOUGH OF ME TELLING YOU HOW GOOD THISALBUM IS, GO CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!!!    John
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors are, without a question one of the greatest rock groups of all time. This debut album has some of their greatest songs (Break on Through, Light my Fire, The End). The rest of the album has good songs that weren't as popular when they were released (Alabama Song, Crystal Ship, End of the Night).This album stands as one of the best Doors albums, along with Strange Days, LA Woman, and Soft Parade.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|You may or may not want to admit it, but if you've seen your share of movies, you'd know that \\"Scarface\\" really isn't that good. Sure, it's decent, but is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a great movie? No. Sure, it's decent. The original '32 \\"Scarface\\" was definitely great, and I might even add influencial. The '83 \\"Scarface\\" remake had to have it's writing dumbed down, and throw in unnecessary violence and drug content to appeal to the group of morons that wanted to see this.
B000021XS0|5.0|James LaBrie - vocals  John Myung - bass  John Petrucci - guitars  Mike Portnoy - drums  Jordan Rudess - keyboards      Dream Theater = Definition of intricate melodious and atmospheric progressive metal.  This CD is in the \\"1\\" disk spot in my disk tray and every day when I come home from school, I turn it on.  Every song on here is enchanting and fulfilling for the soul.  It's candy for the ears.    According to critics \\"Metropolis\\" was the best thing that happened to the progressive rock world, and I highly agree.  \\"Metropolis\\" is a concept album of a girls death through the mind of a patient/her.  \\"Regression\\" is the intro song which presents a psychologist sending a patient into a trance of remembrance of these \\"Fatal Tragedies\\".  Every song on here is breathtaking, but the most incomparable song(s) is \\"Overture 1928/Strange Deja Vu\\".  Overture is the best instrumental ever written, with tempo changes all over the place(just like all the songs on this cd) and a melodic atmosphere.  \\"Strange Deja Vu\\" is basically \\"Overture\\" but with singing..........and James LaBrie is awesome!!!!!  His voice is so haunting, enchanting, and exhilirating.      I would go into every song, but it would take WAY TOO MUCH EXPLAINING because it's so intriguing.......you must check it out for yourself.  Go.......NOW!  My favorite songs are well.........look at the playlist and you get the idea.
B000002I27|5.0|This is the most psychadelic rock album and quite possibly, the Doors' best work. It contains five excellently \\"strange\\" songs which are: Strange Days, Love Me Two Times, People Are Strange, Moonlight Drive, and When the Music's Over. A must-have for any Doors fan.
B000B0WODA|3.0|There's no way Franz Ferdinand's high-energetic follow up is better then it's smash hit debut \\"Franz Ferdinand- Self Titled\\". While it's still a good album (and if you're a true fan, still worth the money) the lyrics seemed to be dumbed down, and not as original as in the first album. Has a few great tracks, but the cd is brought down by the single \\"Do You Want To\\", and a couple others. <br /> <br />Hopefully Franz Ferdinand bring it all back with the next album, I'll definitely be anticipating it.
0553801503|4.0|Four stars -- not bad. I am a pretty tough grader. To get 5 stars from me you have to border on perfection -- as the first three volumes of this series did. <br /> <br />Most readers will be painfully aware that this volume has been a bit of a struggle for Mr Martin; and unfortunately, some of that struggle shows. The breadth and complexity of the story are possibly becoming a bit much for the author, as well as his readers to handle. There may have been signs of winding down story lines and eliminating characters a bit precipitously to make room for newer ones (but of course we can never be sure...) and the story lines are becoming so numerous and divergent that it is becoming difficult to deal with even a subset of them all satisfactorily in a single volume. I have to agree with the reviewer who hoped that one day we will see a \\"director's cut\\" of the material in this volume and the next, rearranged in the originally-intended order and spread out across as many volumes as physically necessary.  <br /> <br />With the example of Robert Jordan before us (his _Eye of the World_ might have been another of my five-star books, if not for the direction -- or lack of same! -- the rest of the Wheel of Time series has taken), many of us are too quick to assume that Mr Martin is abusing his readers' good will the way Mr Jordan has.  <br /> <br />But no, Mr Martin still appears to be making a good-faith effort to deliver on the promise of the earlier volumes in the series. There does not seem to be anything gratuitous here; all the pieces seem to be meat, not fat. I do not recall anything that did not contribute to the whole, or anything I would nominate to be cut. In fact, if anything, Mr Martin and his editors may have cut useful prose that would have helped bring to mind minor characters when they reappear on the stage. <br /> <br />Back in my youth, when a fat trilogy was considered an epic, it was a sophomoric truism that a letdown was to be expected in the middle volume,when all the divergent story lines had been laid out and none had yet begun to be brought back together for their ultimate resolution. Maybe that 'wisdom' remains valid, only the letdown occurs in the middle volume of a planned heptology! <br /> <br />But please remember, Mr Martin, that a great beginning does not make a great work. I am desperately hoping that when all is said and done, you will have given us a five-star epic.  <br />
B000002J1U|4.0|The first 2 albums by Led Zeppelin were primarily blues albums.  The second album moved more toward Rock than the first.  Up to then Led Zeppelin had only done electric music.  With Friends, Gallows Pole That's the Way,and Brom Y aur Stom we finally get the acoustic side.  This albums moves into the direction Led Zeppelin would pretty much settle into.  There are some great Rockers on here as well including, Immigrant Song,   For me the real find on this CD is the blues song, Since I've been Loving You. This is among the finest blues guitar you will ever hear by anyone.   This is not Led Zeppelin's best, but it is certainly worth putting into your record collection. You really can't go wrong with Led Zeppelin.

B000002OX7|5.0|People talk about Tommy and Quadrophenia, but this is their best album ever. <br />This CD is loaded with great song ranging from Baba O'Riley to Won't Get Fooled Again, Bargain, Getting In Tune and Behind Blue Eyes to name the highlights. <br />The Who has always relied on high energy guitar with fast bass lines and fast drums to produce their sound. This album is no different. <br />What is good about this edition is that they added Pure and Easy from the first solo album Pete Townsend ever did. <br />You also get Naked Eye from the vinyl CD that was named Odds and Sodds. To top that off you get an alternate version of Behind Blue Eyes and some additional tunes that have appeared on various albums, or that were never released until now. <br />This is not only the Who's best, but one of the all-time classic albums of Rock.............
0143036556|4.0|Fascinating perusal: Diamond's \\"suicidal\\" theory could be used to analyze today's United States of America. Theory points out at destruction of environment, ruthless and exploitive management of natural resources, inability to recognize importance of global warming, multiplication of military conflicts created around the globe and myopia of ruling elite trying to solve rapidly growing disparity between poor and rich citizens by proposing privatization of social systems. In the 90es Jared Diamond belonged to the group of visionaries called \\"Third Culture\\". They searched for utopian \\"paradise on Earth\\" after collapse of Soviet Union and leftists movement. Today Diamond is afraid of USA demise and the whole western civilization. He is not alone. Joining him are British historian Niall Ferguson, French publicist Jean-Claude Ruffin and American political scientists Chalmers Johnson. Jane Jacobs (\\"Dark Age Ahead\\") predicts total calamity for humans; humans who distance themselves from agriculture and instead depend more and more on complex, fragile and chaotic technology.As one should notice, Aboriginals from Easter Islands, behaved in the same manner and author clearly describes their dismal fate. History teaches us: powerful nations of the past collapsed unexpectedly and quickly.<br />Also: why some countries/societies collapse or cannot improve in modern times - I suggest to check \\"The Ingenuity Gap\\" by Thomas Homer-Dixon and \\"Dying for Growth\\" by Jim Yong Kim (Institute for Health and Social Justice).
B00005JMFQ|5.0|There are so many reasons I love this movie.<br /><br />First, it's a romance, well several irreverent romances, some bawdy, some not, and not all totally realistic, but why do we like fiction anyway, for the realism?  Not.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the happy ending, and there are several, but there are also logical (believe it or not) and satisfying endings.  Overall the movie resonates and stayes with you long after it's over.  Love Actually is an upliffing way to spend an hour or so, and it gives you the feeling that life is well worth living no matter how crappy it can get at times.<br /><br />There are wonderful messages to be learned about love, and not just the man/woman type, but about love and loyalty within the family unit, and in assorted types of friendships as well.<br /><br />The line up of actors and actresses is awesome--there are some of my favorites of all time, and some new kids on the block who we'll certainly see more of in time.<br /><br />Many of the situations are a hoot. You'll laugh out loud every time you watch it, and you'll watch it often, I promise.  One of the best.  A classic for sure.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, Golda Meir, Victoria, Catherine the Great. Women historically have proven to be as capable as any man when it comes to ruling, and Elizabeth, as depicted in this film, is portrayed in a very strong, very proficient light.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett captures the authority of the noted queen perfectly, rapturing both her shy school girl resonance, then, as she is forced to either flee or fight, we see Elizabeth become the straightforward and forceful, but loyal, leader of England.<br /><br />The heart of the film deals with Queen Elizabeth's most deepened period of turmoil. The Roman Catholic Church has issued a private act of aggression on the queen, one that requires a number of assassination attempts. Mary Queen of Scots is involved, as is the Duke of Norfolk (the oh-so-British actor Christopher Eccelston). Where Elizabeth lacks momentary  initiative to rid herself of these enemies, she finds it in her very aggressive and very thorough aid, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Even here, however, we sense that Elizabeth is entirely competent when it comes to these dealings.<br /><br />Elizabeth is a film that depicts the legendary queen as more than the stoic, unflinching woman many history books have painted her as. She is a woman who is deeply in love with a man in the early portions of her leadership, and one that is quite aware of what it means to be compassionate as well as acutely just. Later, we watch this love turn to her nation.<br /><br />The film is highlighted by memorable performances by Rush, Blanchett, Eccelston, and Joseph Fiennes, who plays Elizabeth's lover, Lord Robert Dudley.<br /><br />This is certainly no \\"chick flick\\" and is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I'm an old school headbanger whose high school wardrobe consisted of little more than Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Slayer t-shirts, and to this day those remain my favorite bands. I watched as metal turned to garbage through the nineties. Tool put out some great stuff, White Zombie was OK, but then we got Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park and I thought good metal was over for good. I was wrong. Shadows Fall and Avenged Sevenfold showed a lot of promise of putting the metal back into metal, and it was about time for some bands that had been influenced by my favorite classic metal bands.    So it comes as a suprise to find out that the best metal band I've heard in a long time is more influenced by old prog rock than my classic metal favorites. Opeth have been around since the mid nineties but the first I had heard of them was on Sirius channel 27 which was playing The Grand Conjuration and Ghost of Perdition. Those two song sounded so powerful, so unique, and so good I had to buy this recording. I haven't stopped listening since, and each time I notice things I never heard before. I've never heard anything like this, a little bit Floyd, a little bit Cannibal Corpse, a little bit Rush, a little bit Maiden, and a little bit of a lot more stuff. In fact, track 4 Atonement sounds as though it could have been on Jane's Addiction's Ritual De Lo Habitual, right between Three Days and Then She Did.    The best part about Opeth is that there are actually great hooks and riffs here, sweet solos, and inventive drumming. The kind of stuff that made metal so great in the eighties. But it doesn't sound dated at all. And the softer acoustic parts help complete the songs. Think of the acoustic passages of songs like Master Of Puppets or Holy Wars...the Punishment Due. They sound lovely but eerily sinister at the same time. Perfect for metal. And don't let the prog aspect or the keyboards scare you off. Maiden's Somewhere in Time was very prog and keyboard laden and was perfect because of it.    Regarding the death metal vocals: I own a Cannibal Corpse cd, and I can't stand to listen to it, in part because of the vocals, but also because speed seems to take precedence over melody. Death metal growl vocals usually annoy me, but not here. Most of the vocals are sung in a normal (and wonderful) voice, and when the death growl is used, it works perfectly and adds a lot to the music. Maybe Akerfeld has a better death growl than anybody else, maybe it's because I can actually understand the lyrics when he growls, or maybe it's that the music that Opeth plays is better than any other death metal band, but I usually can't stand the death growl, and I love it here.    I picked up this release about a month ago and have played it probably thirty times so far. It just keeps sounding better and better. Currently my favorite song is Reverie/Harlequin Forest but the rest are terrific too. I always play this from beginning to end and have not yet felt the need to skip a song. I also picked up Opeth's 1999 release Still Life a few days ago and it sounds quite good too. I still like Ghost Reveries better, but if Still Life grows on me the way this one does, I may end up liking it even better.    I think any metalhead who has been disappointed with the past fifteen years needs to give this a chance. And any current metal fans should check this out as well. Download a song or two, check it out at your local record shop's listening section, or whatever. The song samples here on Amazon just aren't enough to give you an idea of what's going on. I truly think this is the best metal release since Iron Maiden dropped Seventh Son of a Seventh Son in 1988.
B000001GQB|5.0|Columbia SO recordings (NOT with the New York PO) , which are OOP, this Bohm is the one to have, the only one you need actually. As I've heard at least 6 other major conductors, Klemperer , Mackerraas, both Levine's etc etc.<br />The only 2 I kept are the Walter ,got mine from  a used cd dealer in the UK online :-) and the Bohm, complete sym set, which is the way to go for Mozart fans. There's quite a few very good syms in the 1-34.<br />All that stuff you read about Bohm being a  \\"kapplemiester\\" (germanic style/cold), old fashioned, tutonic, is very misleading. I hear nothing of the sort and wish these comments would stop.<br /> Though I was forwarned about Bohm being off track in approach with his german orch, I sense there is some anti-german sentiments in these negative comments about Bohm.  None of this criticism leveled against Bohm is factual, only a prejudice in their minds.<br /><br />As to<br /> Details, tempos, instrument quality, sound quality, orch size all are in perfect harmony with Mozart.<br />. Bohm and the Berlin show forth a understanding of Mozart that none except Walter can rival.<br />The Klemper/Philharmonia on TESTAMENT, not the EMI release(which are duds) are not too bad, but not in the same category as either Bohm or Walter.<br />I sat down one day and compred all 3, and concluded the Klemperer were not necessary , for sound issues and also not on par with Bohm's definitive recording.<br /><br />EDIT: I should mention that i read on a forum recently, he recalled Bohm from his vinyl set that the performances were 'a bit dull\\". Bohm does not speed read. Any conductor that takes Mozart too fast is doing  a  disservice to these richly detailed scores. Mozart requires detailed attention, which is what Bohm brings. Yet the life is there, not dull at all.<br />EDIT on Feb 21/07...<br />Mackerras' Prague is not in the same league as the Berlin. Many of the soloists in this Berlin use instruments that bring out a  chamber flaor, and also Bohm kept the orch smaller than many other orch's. This smaller chamber sound brings more to Mozart than many other recodings I;'ve heard. Even Walter's Columbia is \\"big sound\\", yet Walter's does present a \\"Mozartian\\" image. Bohm goes even further. Many other like conductors record Mozart with a  \\"Beethovenian\\" sound.

B000002HD5|5.0|[...]    This was red magazines number one overlooked album. It was listed without comment.  And if you have listend to the album you know why.  There is nothing left to say.    Just listen.
0140120416|5.0|I just wanted to add my own $0.02 to the already great reviews this book has gotten. <br /> <br />If you're like me, you'll have a hard time learning with other methods that primarily use sound/sight recognition and memorization (like the Rosetta Stone). <br /> <br />This book, however, takes a very common sense (and logical, in my opinion) approach to learning Russian.  For example, it will not show you a verb conjugation and just expect you to memorize it (like most Russian books/materials seem to) - its approach, instead, is to first show you how to conjugate a variety of verbs.  Armed with this knowledge, you then step into useful examples. <br /> <br />As others have recommended on here, I also recommend finding a course or tutor to attend in addition to learning with this book.  I took a cheap ($100) non-credit class for a semester at a local university ... it did wonders to - at minimum - have a native speaker to communicate with.  The book does do a great job at sounding out difficult pronounciations, but it can only go so far while a native speaker could correct you on the spot with minimal effort.  Sure, this book is available online here for $12, but don't underestimate the value of learning a language in an interactive environment (don't even begin to think such a minimal investment is all you need)!
B0000009SY|5.0|This was my first Zappa record.  A long, long time ago I picked out this album from a bin of Zappa records, mainly because I thought the long running times of the songs (Packard Goose runs at 11:38) was so very cool.  So when I finally listened to it, any conventional thoughts of my mind were quickly dispensed with.  This was the album that popped my Zappa cherry, as some other reviewers have put it (somewhat crudely), but regardless of your taste for the \\"cherry\\" line, this is one of Zappa's greatest and most unique recordings.  Originally two albums (a single album called Joe's Garage, Act One), and a double LP (Joe's Garage, Acts II and III), I decided to buy Acts II and III first, and never got Act I on vinyl.  I purchased the double CD a number of years back.  Every song is really memorable.  The title track is (surprisingly) sweet and moving. Catholic Girls is really funny.  A Token of My Extreme is really cool (with Zappa parodying Scientology and L. Ron Hoover (aka Hubbard) long before it became a well known cult).  Stick It Out teaches you all the German you need to know.  Sy Borg is the most romantic song on the album (sort of).  Keep It Greasey is hilarious, with the last half one of Zappa's most stunning instrumentals (with great drum work by Vinnie Colauita).  Packard Goose is funny and intricate too, and the instrumental Watermelon in Easter Hay is Zappa's most majestic and beautiful solo.  I always thought this song was written for Gail, Zappa's wife and lifelong partner.  The FZ Family Trust is very protective of this song for some reason, and I think that may be it.  I don't know, just a hunch.  The closer, A Little Green Rosetta, is fun, but the album might have been better had Frank left that song in the vaults.  It gets kind of silly.  Regardless, leave your tiny mind in the dustbin when listening to this.  Let Zappa take you over.  And then you'll be a better person....
B000002J1S|5.0|Well I have been a fan of Peter Gabriels solo stuff for a while now so I guess it was only a matter of time before I checked out Genesis. After reading the reviews here on amazon I was still ready to be let down. I mean you always here so much great stuff about a band like Led Zeppelin who are in my opinion are one of most overrated bands in history. So just like with many other highly praised cd's from this decade I expected the same reaction. Well I was very very surprised. This is an amazingly creative and original cd. I won't go into any real deatil about the songs but instead tell you to just go out and buy this cd. This deserves to be next to the likes of Low and Diamond Dogs by David Bowie which are both incredible and underrated albums of the 70's.
B00005U2JL|4.0|I'm giving this DVD four stars because the sound is good; it's excellent. I'll overlook the fact there are times he's singing, but the microphone ain't quite there. It's obvious Marilyn Manson puts on one hell of a show. This DVD is rockin', in that sense. Just remember, teeenie boppers, it's theatrics. Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and others, in the late sixties and seventies, did this sh--. Manson ain't nothin' new. It ain't like Satananic theatrics are scary anymore. This DVD borders on a three star rating. It's just that he does put on one hell of a show.<br /><br />Marilyn just isn't all that and a bag of chips. His theatrics are good, but it's hard to take a man, in a thong like S&M type outfit, seriously. Oh, when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous. I'm sorry. Smellin' his butt with his fingers just gets comical.<br /><br />I still give it the four stars because I like his music, and this DVD sounds good.<br /><br />The editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song. Sure it's well done, but it ticks me off when bands do this. Bad Religion did it; but, my lord, how much money does this band have and they release this kind of DVD? It annoys me.<br /><br />I probably should give this DVD three stars, but it does rock. You just have to get over the fact Marilyn looks like an idiot. He lacks that toughness to pull off the look, if that's possible. If he walked into a bar lookin' like he did with the thong leather pantie crap, a woman would kick his butt...You can reference a Guns 'n' Roses review of mine, I believe even Axyl Rose, in his cute little shorts, could kick Marilyn's butt...<br /><br />I know that wasn't politically correct, but it's true...<br /><br />Screw it, I should give it three stars, but the show is flippin' fun...
B000003TAR|2.0|Nirvana is one of the most overrated bands in history. many people say that this cd is filled with anger and pain and emotion but there really isn't much of any of that present. Do you want a cd that will show you what real pain and real emotion is while probably freaking the hell out of you and all your friends? Would you like to listen to a cd that is truly original? Then go listen to Last Rights by Skinny Puppy all the way through and tell me how In Utero compares.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|The naysayers be gone  This is the most amazing strokes album to date, though it is hard to say that considering the first two strokes albums are briliant classics.  I'm really annoyed about the critics reviews.  These critics with room on fire said the strokes were too formulaic, and repeated is this it?  Now they are saying the strokes have changed their sound too much and have lost their strokesesque feel.  They should make up their minds.  This record has many standout out tracks, such as \\"heart in a cage\\", which is by far my favorite song I have ever heard.  It truly is the perfect song.  But the rest of the album is amazing, and although some tracks stand out more than others, all of them are briliant in their own right.  Valensi and Hammond Jr are the guitar heroes of this generation, and no guitarists from any other band today can compare.  The strokes have been written off before, and called \\"media darlings\\" and \\"Critics favorites,\\" but if that was true, a lot more of my friends would have heard of them.  Heart in a cage should be their next single, becuase it is that song that has convinced many of my friends to start listening to the strokes, after I played that song for them.  This album shows how musically mature the strokes have become and I hope they continue this trend.  I still think they have that same unique strokes sound from the first two albums and have not lost it all.  They have merely improved an already classic, amazing, oft repeated but not imitated nearly as well sound.  They are an amazing and brilliant band, and in thirty years, when the youth of that generation look back at bands of this generation, they are going to regard the strokes as the greatest band of this generation and one of the greatest of all time.  Fie on the critics.  Buy this brilliant, classic album today and be prepared for greatness.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack.  The music on this CD covers such a wide range of emotions and feelings just like the movie.  My favorite song is A Love That Will Never Grow Old.  EmmyLou Harris has the voice of an angel, and this is by far one of the prettiest songs I've ever heard about a love that is so strong and constant.  He was a Friend Of Mine is a beautiful  sad love song about losing someone close to you.  Willie Nelson's voice is so moving on this song.  I loved the instrumental tracks on this CD especially Snow and Riding Horses.  I felt so peaceful listening to these tracks.  The Devil's Right Hand is another highlight on this soundtrack. I felt like dancing when I listened to it.  King of The Road is another one of my favorites here.  I felt so relaxed and carefree when I listened to this song.  It's So Easy and  An Angel Went Up In Flames are two very great songs that will make you feel good.  I loved the lively violin playing on An Angel Went Up in Flames very much.  No One's Gonna Love You Like Me is a very romantic song.  I think Mary McBride has such a pretty voice and she sings this beautiful song perfectly.  Brokeback Mountain is the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time.
B00005JM0B|3.0|First, let me say I did like this movie, but, as a third Terminator installment, it was like T2 part 2. When I heard the name \\"Rise of the Machines\\", I expected it was going to move forward into the war. Instead it only touches on its beginning after a familiar rehash of the terminator vs terminator and the humans he was reprogrammed to protect theme. The idea of avoiding the war should have already been abandoned as impossible (explained below). And I take it that the ever better terminators employed by the machines are a sort of butterfly effect result of tampering with time. It appears that eventually the machines will win this game of cat and mouse being that their technology gets better each time while humans can only seem to muster up another reprogrammed T101. <br /> <br />Terminator was about a machine sent back in time by machines to destroy the mother of the man who would lead humans to defeat the machines and the man sent back to protect her. T2 was about the same thing but now the target is the boy who will grow up to lead humans to defeat the machines and instead of a man being sent back, a captured and reprogrammed terminator is sent back to protect the boy. T3 is guess what? It's T2 again but with the bad terminator sent to destroy the lieutenants of the human who would lead the humans to destroy the machines. Well, that's how it starts anyway, until the bad terminator realizes she can kill him himself as well as his lieutenants.  <br /> <br />Now, it didn't take T3 to get the idea across that \\"Judgement Day\\" is inevitable. The storyline of the first two say that. After all, for John Conner to even be born, Judgement Day HAS to happen or his father is never sent back to protect his mother. <br /> <br />Any chance of moving ahead and into the war? I hope they don't launch T4:Operation Bloodline Erasure set in 1800s Wyoming... The T101 would be hard pressed to find good sunglasses or even the leather clothes or any of the now cliche' gags like he likesthere.  <br /> <br />Like I said, T3 is good in my opinion, but that road is getting overly worn. It was just too familiar to be better than average.
0440238609|2.0|This trilogy came highly recommended, so i dove right in. The first book caught me up in Lyra's world immediately, she is a great character. And ultimately, that's became my problem with these books. Some of the other characters are not as well drawn, especially Lyra's parents. I never felt her parents were completely believable parts of Lyra's story. They seemed to belong to some place other than Lyra's world, and maybe the writer should have left them there.<br /><br />Pullman has created a very special world(s), and for that i thank him for the introduction.

This is arguably the best Batman movie and Christian Bale gets my vote for being the best actor to play the titular character.<br /><br />The question for any filmmaker is always there, how can you make a comic book hero believable on screen?  Thankfully, the writers of Batman Begins (Christopher Nolan, Bob Kane, and David S. Goyer) chose to follow rule number one, cover all your bases.  It would hardly seem a stretch in hindsight.  Batman has no superpowers.  He's a man driven by anger and fear to become all he could be.  It makes one wonder how previous film incarnations did it all wrong.  But the real triumph of this film, like Revenge of the Sith recently, is that Batman's pieces finally fit together and the puzzle of the Dark Knight is completed.  In other words, we get to see how a young Bruce Wayne (played near-perfectly by Christian Bale), heir to a billion-dollar empire, becomes tortured by the murder of his parents and eventually decides to dress like a bat and fight crime.  This is the unbelievable part of Batman's mythology, but in this film it is made possible.<br /><br />Development of character is a staple and fundamental in film that is horribly rarely done well.  In this film's beginning, we are brought in to follow the development of Batman the only way it should be done, by starting with no Batman.  We follow Bruce Wayne as he acquires a certain fear as a boy, his horror as his parents get killed, his guilt over his parents' death, his vain attempts at self-training, and his eventual decision to fight crime.<br /><br />The film opens with Bruce being an inmate in some asian prison camp, learning the nature of criminals and training himself to fight them.  He is found by a mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) who trains him to lead the League of Shadows, a secret society mastered in stealth and several martial arts dedicated to fighting crime.  After training is completed, Bruce is to be initiated into the League by executing an unarmed criminal before their leader, Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  This is in conflict with Bruce's principles and the League becomes his enemy.  He then chooses to use his training to fight evil by using fear but not becoming an executioner.  He \\"finds himself\\" with that purpose and goes through a series of motions that leads him to become Batman.<br /><br />I said earlier that all the bases were covered.  How did Batman acquire \\"all those wonderful toys\\"?  Why does he have bat-shaped throwing blades?  What's with the ears on his cowl?  How does his cape allow him to glide through the air?  How does he develop a mini-grappling hook gun?  How does he discover a cave under his family's estate?  How did he get a bulletproof (sort-of) costume?  How did he even get a \\"Batmobile\\"?  How does he get the money for all these?  How does he earn the trust of future police comissioner Gordon?  Why are there so many psychos running around in Gotham City?  How was the bat-signal established?  Yes, all these questions are answered, including the most important one.  How does Bruce Wayne become Batman?  All these could be answered easily and matter-of-factly, but this film chooses not only to make it believable, but carry actual depth.<br /><br />One of my greatest admirations with this film is how everything is designed.  Everything seems so \\"prototype\\" from the batmobile (which we all know will eventually become some hot-rod racecar, but for now it's a tank) to the bat-signal (which only barely projects the silhouette of a bat).  The batcave does not have the multitude of state of the art computers.  The costume is in a wooden cabinet, not a metal container.  Access to the batcave is via mining elevator shaft, not a \\"batpole\\" or a hidden slide.<br /><br />My peeves are few.  Mainly the character of Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who has some vital moments in the film which lead Bruce to his decision to become Batman, but overall a forgettable character.  The film's score is barely there (no Danny Elfman-esque catchy main theme).  But I said that about Spider-Man as well, only to be proven wrong when the sequel revealed a main theme had always been there.  Batman Begins' score was composed collaboratively by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  I know Zimmer best for his score in The Rock but everything else he does seems a variation of his work from that film. Batman Begins included.  Howard is best known for his scores for M. Night Shyamalan's films.  I'm afraid I remember very little of his work in those movies, and that's not a good thing.  However, there was never a moment where the music seemed out of place but it just never had a voice of it's own.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe, who was the actor who saved \\"The Last Samurai\\", has disappointingly short screen time here.  Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, a Wayne Enterprises employee heading the company's applied sciences department (and unknowingly supplies Batman with his gadgets) plays the role well as usual.  He is quickly becoming one of the top thespians in my book.  Liam Neeson once again brandishes a sword and is powerful as Henri Ducard.  Gary Oldman plays Gordon, an honest policeman lost in the corruption of Gotham, quite well.  I appreciate him looking as he does in the comic books.  No more fat scottish Jim Gordon.<br /><br />Honorable mention goes to Cillian Murphy who plays Dr. Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow.  There is always something odd in his demeanor in the film.  Some creepiness hidden under the well-pressed suit.  And when he shows himself as Scarecrow, he is effectively scary.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is the film that should have started it all.

0385484518|5.0|I had never cried while reading just the beginning of a book. I was extremely touched with the description of the last class/last days of this man's life. I  really enjoyed the way in which the author used the metaphor of a classroom in comparison to life's lessons.  This was an incredible book that will surely move a person to tears as it did me. I loved the aphorisms and quotes that were used and enjoyed learning about ALS, a disease which will ultimately end your life. I really recommend this book!

It just doesn't get any more brilliant than that!<br /><br />Seriously though, there's a reason why T. Rex's music isn't widely known today. Aside from a few choice songs, it really isn't all that great and most of it sounds pretty dated. Today, the majority of T. Rex's music sounds like fairly run-of-the-mill \\"boogie-woogie\\" rock n' roll. Marc Bolan does deserve credit for spearheading Glam Rock, but he was soon surpassed by David Bowie who made the timeless glam-rock classic ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS.<br /><br />If you're new to T. Rex, just be aware that this forum attracts a lot of non-objective worship from die-hard fans. It's perfectly understandable that some people like this music, but moreso for those who were actually around to witness the glam rock craze unfold.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|There's a lot of good and bad in the film adaptation of Rent.   <br /> <br />First off, this is one of those musicals that is better on stage.  Yes, a lot of reviewers have said this, and a lot of others have said to go see the show onstage if that is what you were looking for.  But, for example, Chicago outshined it's onstage counterpart, and it is possible for a film adaptation to be better then the theatrical versions.  Rent is not. <br /> <br />Next, the acting is a huge problem for Rent.  The cast is too old.  It's simple.  And to anyone who claims these original cast members are the 'best' at their parts in the world, I encourage you to look again.  Rosario Dawson, as Mimi, does better then Rubin-Vega as the original Mimi.  If someone could be found that was better, as Dawson was, this could have been done for all the cast.   <br /> <br />Also, another big problem is these actors are trained for theatre.  It shows.  Their gestures are sweeping, their dialouge comes off as stiled onscreen, and their whole presentation is very \\"showy\\".  Contrast this to Roasrio Dawson's acting, which is very cinematic, capturing the sublte tones and small facial changes, and you have a problem.  She acts better, for this medium, and Mimi comes through stronger as a character.  Basically, the acting is not unified, and it's distracting.  (This is another reason why the original cast should have been dumped from this project).   <br /> <br />Next, I felt like the movie was a little long, and the plot seemed to lose itself.  The last 45 minutes felt like they were singing the songs just to have them there in the movie, because they were in the show.  The plot becomes second priotiry, in service of singing a song, and then another, and another.  Yes, again, you may be saying this is a musical, what do you expect.  Well, I expect an adaptation for film.  What works onstage doesn't always work on film.  Chicago understood this, and it walked away with six Oscars and well over 150 million at the domestic box office, because it was modified to work so well with an audience as a film, and not a 'muscial on film'.      <br /> <br />Good things?  This is Rent.  You should see it to have any exposure to this material, any way you can.  Rosario Dawson is incredible.  The music is amazing, and sounds better then ever.  Lastly, Chris Columbus, who has directed Rent, loves this show, and you can tell.  I admire his compassion for this project.   <br /> <br />Yes, I picked a lot in this review, and they are all the small things that are 'wrong' about this film version of Rent, but overall, this is an impressive effot, and I encourage renting to newcomers, and purchasing for fans.
B000AP04FG|4.0|The principle virtue of this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.  Part of the problem most big-ticket movies have had in the last several years is that they have been pretentious on the surface and hollow at the core.  \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is just big, supremely dumb, and gobs of fun.<br /><br />If you've seen the previews you know the basic story.  A married couple has settled into bland co-existence, each unaware that the other is a top-flight assassin.  When the two of them are given the same assignment and botch each other's plans, they are forced to train their sights on each other.<br /><br />That's it.  There are no layers, no profound themes.  Though a serious critic could get a great deal out of the fight scenes, which transparently conflate sex and violence, that's all smoke and mirrors.  This movie is about lush visuals, gorgeously choreographed combat, and coarse humor.<br /><br />It's true that the two leads don't put a lot into the acting.  Did you expect anything more from these two?  They deliver servicable lines and allow the camera to admire their stylish fighting technique.  That's all the movie demands, and that's all you and I need.<br /><br />It's not world-changing.  You won't tell your grandchildren about this movie in your glory days.  This is a movie to watch with hot buttered popcorn, a soda, and your sweetie.  It's plain the moviemakers had plenty of fun themselves, so kick back and enjoy.

B00005RG6B|5.0|I'm a big believer that most concert DVDs are wastes of money.  Honestly, how many times will anyone watch the same concert, with the same songs, and the same stage show, etc.?<br /><br />Every rule has its exceptions.  For me, `Operation : Livecrime' is that exception.<br /><br />The extras are nice additions, but this DVD is all about the performance - THE performance.  Queensryche were hitting on all cylinders at the time of this recording, and it showed.  The album being presented here in its entirety is nothing less than an underappreciated masterpiece, and the stage show underlying this performance, with it's animated characterizations of the album's key players, as well as an on-stage appearance by Pamela Moore (performing as 'Mary') accentuates an amazing story.<br /><br />If you were fortunate enough to have caught this tour, as I was, this will bring back some incredible memories for you.  If you weren't, and are discovering Mindcrime for the first time, then this will only enhance your experience.<br /><br />I reviewed Operation : Mindcrime for Amazon, and stated that the album belongs in every music lover's collection.  While I don't believe that true of this DVD, it is a definite must-have for anyone who loves the Mindcrime album.

0393327655|5.0|Author Sam Harris has a problem with the world's major organized religions.  His thesis, in particular, is that while the foibles of religious fundamentalism (of various brands, though always essentially bespeaking the same mentality) may appear to be more or less harmless, they are in fact a gravely dangerous phenomenon that threatens humankind itself with extinction.<br /><br />The problem is that with the more rabid varieties of religious fundamentalism we are no longer looking just at the ravings of those halfwit television evangelists who run the credit card icons across the bottom of the screen for the ensnaring of the gullible.  Now, on the contrary, we have entered an age- nothing similar to which has been seen since the Spanish Inquisition- in which whole hordes of religious zealots view themselves as being commanded by the \\"will of God\\" (whatever in the world that means) to torture, multilate, and brutally kill the rest of us.  It is this unreasoning willingness to commit acts of atrocity for \\"God\\" (under whatever name), based upon belief systems that are not only of undemonstrated validity but of absolutely undemonstrable validity, that bothers Sam Harris, and he does a truly eloquent job of explaining why, in terms of radical Islam, Christianity, and other belief systems.<br /><br />While Mr. Harris takes on Islam with considerable fervor, he certainly does not neglect the sordid side of religion in the West.  He argues, with regard to both the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, that it is only by selectively ignoring parts of the so-called sacred texts that many people, eschewing the more radical views of these belief systems, can function even as religious \\"moderates.\\"  He points out, for example, that in the Bible's book of Deuteronomy, one is compelled to murder anyone who \\"serves other gods\\"-specifically, \\"You must stone him to death\\" (Deut. 13:7-11).  (In what circumstances, one may ask, is one \\"serving other gods\\"?  There was a time when Protestants and Catholics turned this principle upon each other, as in fact they still sometimes do in Northern Ireland.)  Likewise Harris points out places in scripture where the death penalty, in no uncertain terms, is prescribed for such offenses as \\"taking the Lord's name in vain\\" (Leviticus 24:16), working on the Sabbath (Exodus 31:15), cursing one's father or mother (Exodus 21:17), and adultery (Leviticus 20:10).  It is not that most people subscribing to this belief system would actually kill anyone for, say, working the Sunday shift at Burger King- but in order to refrain from doing so, such \\"believers\\" must selectively tune out the textual command to do so.<br /><br />In the West, we have largely (thank God, one is tempted to say) separated religion out of public life.  The Founding Fathers were careful, in the Constitution, to disallow establishment of a national religion, even though certain modern Presidents have trampled upon this founding wisdom to the extent of using such lunatics as Pat Robertson as advisors on matters of international relations and nuclear proliferation. (How's that for scary?)  But in Islamic countries, no such separation of church and state has ever taken place.  One can make a fairly long list of countries in which the clergy and the police are the same people.  And here again, the willingness to kill whole populations of people failing to share one's own religious beliefs is founded upon systems of \\"thought\\"(the desire to fulfil the will of Allah) for which there is no proof of validity. Sam Harris devotes several pages to quotations from the Koran that demand that the believer murder the unbeliever.  And of course the terrible thing nowadays is that this phenomenon is the mindset of whole cultures, bent upon subjugating or destroying the rest of the world \\"on account,\\" as Harris puts it, \\"of religious ideas that belong on the same shelf with Batman, the philosopher's stone, and unicorns.\\"  Harris minces no words: \\"We are at war with Islam.  It may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so.\\"  He points out that the purveyors of this world-view are so narrow as to have no reasoning ability left to them.  Like the Nazis (Hitler, after all, having been a devout Christian who saw himself as obeying \\"God's will,\\" as Mein Kampt makes abundantly clear), the radical Islamists have no basis for rational comparison or judgment.  Harris points out: \\"Spain translates as many books into Spanish every year as the entire Arab world has translated into Arabic since the ninth century.\\"  Needless to say, this situation is appalling- and dangerous, in a world in which those deranged enough to think that some \\"god\\" is whispering murderous instructions to them can command nuclear arsenals capable of ending all life on the planet.  We can't afford this any more.<br /><br />\\"As long as it is acceptable,\\" Harris says, \\"for a person to believe that he knows how God wants everyone on earth to live, we will continue to murder one another on account of our myths.\\"  In the past sixty seconds, someone has no doubt died this way.<br /><br />Harris makes it clear that he is by no means opposed to the individual human urge toward spirituality- toward a sense of wanting to relate oneself to the universe- and makes it equally clear that he accepts the reality of the essential difference between right and wrong, in a primal sense not dependent upon undemonstrable religious belief systems.  Morality and ethics, he says, can be developed as a science.  And must be.  \\"No tribal fictions need be rehearsed for us to realize, one fine day, that we do in fact love our neighbors, that our happiness is inextricable from their own, and that our interdependence demands that people everywhere be given the opportunity to flourish.\\"  In short, we must learn to be good to each other because we want to, not because of religious dogma.  For this reviewer's money, he is absolutely right.  Humankind must outgrow the barbarisms of an ignorant and stultifying past and move on toward a vision of harmony inspired not by meanness of spirit but by clear and courageous thinking.

B000002J1S|5.0|With their previous album, the band had firmly established themselves as masters of the prog genre. One can see a definite evolution between 1971's \\"Nursery Cryme\\" and 1973's \\"Selling England by the Pound,\\" and how certain themes and ideas were carried between albums, and improved upon. But with \\"The Lamb,\\" the band not only stepped outside the box they had made, they traveled to the extreme left of it. Between the previous album in the band's discography (\\"Selling England\\") and this one, it sounds like \\"Lamb\\" was recorded by a completely different band.    Frontman Peter Gabriel (the band's vocalist, who had established a reputation for having an overly dramatic flair during concerts, even to the point where he dressed up as the characters in the songs) was responsible for writing all the lyrics, something his bandmates reluctantly went along with. However, as far as music was concerned, every member of the group had different ideas, all of which were brought to the table during recording. The result is two discs of diverse music, sometimes downright bizarre, but almost always gratifying. It is less an album than it is an experience.    Sadly, most concept albums are written off as pretentious, egotistical hogwash, and with good reason. One can almost taste Roger Waters's angst on Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" or puzzle over the A-Side of the Moody Blues's \\"Days of Future Passed.\\" \\"The Lamb,\\" with its bizarre story of a Puerto Rican punk named Rael who gets pulled into a strange mystical journey through New York City's underbelly, could be dismissed just as easily into the pretentiousness category. But then one would completely miss out on the musical wealth it contains. The band runs the gamut from the funky electro-pop of the title track (complete with Peter Gabriel sarcastically singing Eric Carmen's lyrics to \\"On Broadway\\" towards the end, proving that Genesis have not lost their dry, perverse sense of humor), or that same pop with low key funk on \\"Riding the Scree\\"; from the frantic and terrifying \\"In the Cage\\" (complete with radical time changes like any good lengthy prog song), to the muddled chaos of \\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\" or \\"The Waiting Room\\" (rivaling some of the finest moments of weirdness by Pink Floyd or King Crimson); from straight rockers like \\"Lilywhite Lillith\\" to the soft erotic, yet elegant pseudo-love ballad of \\"The Lamia\\" (one of my personal favorites). Genesis not only deliver everything under the sun, they actually do it well. Their musicianship would never be this brilliant at any other point in their career. First, there's Phil Collins. I still can't believe that the man who wrote songs such as \\"Against All Odds\\" and the soundtrack for Tarzan was ever such an inventive drummer.  From sporadic drumrolls, to hard rock pounding, to general noisemaking, Collins rises to the occasion in ways that anyone familiar with his solo work wouldn't think possible. Then there's Steve Hackett, who strives to make his guitar sound like a wide variety of instruments. But even when Hackett is outshined by Tony Banks's stunning keyboard arrangements, he still creates something beneath the surface, to the point where if it were absent, the song would fall apart. The same holds true for Mike Rutherford's bass (but then again, this is the mark of any great bass player. You'll notice if it's not there, and if it's gone, the song won't be as good). A few other songs of note are \\"Back in NYC\\" (Genesis perfecting modern rock before there was such a thing); \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" (somehow, on an album that ranged all over, all five members managed to write something so tightly focused. A moment of perfection that lingers even after the song fades away. Simply beautiful.); \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" (a fantastic prog romp. Much as I like Gabriel's solo career, his later work never really captured what impressive vocal range he has); and \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" (the band reprises themes from not one, but twosongs, and somehow makes it all right).     Of course, there are weak moments, but considering what Genesis was trying to do, that's bound to happen. Like most concept albums, it falls apart towards the end (though \\"It\\" does serve as a fitting swan song for Peter Gabriel in Genesis), but still, this album serves as an outstanding testament to where Genesis had been and where they were going. And even though the band would go on to record great music in Gabriel's absence, nothing else they would do would reach the level of ingenuity and musical fervor found on this, the band's masterpiece, and the best thing in their history to bear the name Genesis.

It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br />_I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.
