B0050PYNN0|2.0|The film, in the words of the Supreme Court of the United States; \\"No redeeming social value\\" , period. Why any actress or actor even allowed their name to be attached to this is a mystery to me. To think that James Franco, Natalie Portman and Zooey Deschanel (of all people) would think that this dog would furthur their careers defys logic. Contrived, forced and irreverent, even the gratuitous sex is pointless. Really
B003YL4LYI|5.0|5 *'s for this whole series! BUT--George, where the hell is Winds Of Winter? And, how could you do it George? How could you let HBO utterly ruin this unmatched grand epic? Stop/Intervene now...before they bring you past that monitarily-blurring &#34;point of no return.&#34; Don't look back through all the $$'s they used to cause you to take your eye off the ball!

B008QE9XD2|5.0|An absolutely joyous send-up for the original Barnabas Collins storyline. it's a wonderfully crafted vision by Tim Burton who admittedly had help from such notables as Michelle Pfeifer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Haley and the glorious Eva Green. Bella Heathcote gave a superb performance as Victoria Winters. Filmed in the typical Tim Burton style (Sleepy Hollow, etc) we explore the triumphs and tragedies of the Collins family. Well worth the price
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded the app not knowing what it was and I got into it right away. My four year old daughter and I play together and I play alone during any quiet time I have.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I have a bachelor's degree in physics and have always had a science mind, so a book by and about a great phsyicist with relatively little name recognition (dont believe me? Poll any of your friends who have a fine arts or polisci degree...not dissing them, just dofferent realms of knowledge). Anyways, the book is a wonderful insight into this great genius and despite my caveats above it would/should be an enjoyable read. If nothing else it will give a wonderful glimpse into a brilliant and quirky (even quarky...*rimshot*) mind.
0770435726|5.0|This is a very intelligent, well-plotted, well-written thriller. I could not wait to find out how it ended. Although the \\"financial transaction hijacking\\" that is central to the plot could not have happened as described (thankfully), the concept is credible enough that it's not necessary to suspend belief. I was an expat myself for several years and the author nailed it exactly. Can't wait until his next book and hope it is as cleverly written as this one.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Twenty Eight (28) years ago. Can you believe it? 1982 was the year we were first introduced to the world of TRON. Disney's entry into Sifi was lead by Director Steven Lisberger and starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner. For this new adaptation Disney picked Joseph Kosinski at the helm and again starred Jeff Bridges (Twice), Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde and once again Bruce Boxleitner. The continuity of cast members is a stroke of genius, lending something familair for those who remember the original. Excellent character developement, story line and back story for a new look at a 'coming of age' movie. And, of course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Ms Wilde. She is stuning in Disney's latest version of Tron Wear. The inlayed neon inlays allow for a visually unique effect. This is well worth you entertainment dollar.
B002G01EPC|5.0|This figure is of very high quality, I needed him to complete my collection but was hesitant to purchase him for such a high price, but I am satisfied and to me it was still worth the cash.If your a collector its totally worth it, if not your probably better of spending your money on coffee and cake.
1840226625|5.0|Great book especially for lovers of F.S. Fitzgerald and students alike this is a must read. You cannot go wrong.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the way it is written. you start wondering right from the beginning as the writer plays with the past and the present, your mind starts with what's going to happen to this girl? what happened to this girl? and you go back and forward all the way to the end.<br /><br />Great read!
1409120546|5.0|Where to start with this book... It was magical and heart breaking and beautiful and I just want to squeeze Park everyday forever. In the beginning Park doesn't want anything to do with the new transfer Eleanor; he simply helps her out because he feels bad for her. Eleanor also happens to be an easy target for bullying for many reasons. She is overweight, has unruly red hair and dresses like a boy. She is who I wish I had the courage to be. Through all the bullying she stays true to herself to the very last page. Park helps Eleanor out on her first day by allowing her to sit next to him on the bus. They soon fall into a routine that involves no attempt at conversation. Then enter the X-Men and Watchmen and Batman and tons of other awesome comic book characters of the 80s. They begin discussing these comics and music and other 80s pop culture, which is just woven into the story perfectly. I thought this would turn out to be a semi-typical love story but it was so much more. Eleanor helps bring Park out of his shell and pushed him to be true to himself and Park is Eleanor's savior on more than one occasion. The last few lines of this novel brought me to tears and made me feel so many emotions!<br /><br />Park's parents made such an impact on me. He can tell his mom is trying her hardest not to be judgmental and does learn to come around because she cares about her son's happiness so much. And Park's dad! At the beginning he is a bit of a hardass on Park but you find out he does have a soft spot.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell is a fabulous writer. Her writing is poetic and easy yet deep and compelling.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Amazing art work and storyline and a twist at the end I highly recommend reading this amazing graphic novel bye
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should buy this game. It is NOT a waste of money!! (= don't waste your time on the free version. Paid is WAY better!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is my new favorite show, and I can hardly stop myself from watching every episode all in a row.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie with fairly accurate details in regards to the military operations performance.  It is not a &#34;Rambo&#34; movie, it is a good movie.
B009R659L8|5.0|I don't understand the problems with formatting, font sizes, and missing words or pages others are writing about.  I had none of those problems.  I'm wondering if they downloaded on something other than a kindle.<br />This book is classic Mary Higgins Clark and I enjoyed it.  I had no idea until almost the end who the killer was.  I always try to make one of her books last longer than a couple of days.  I never can and this book was no exception.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Could not put the book down!!! Really enjoyed it, and I have also really enjoyed the diet and workout routines! I have already shared this with several of my friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids think this is the best game to play while riding in the car.  thank you for the great game.  do you have any new games.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I enjoyed the oral narrative of the story. It felt like a real primary source driven historical account as opposed to a zombie story.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|OWNS. haha. Simple and compact, can bring with you anywhere. I am not a HUGE knife guy but I indulge in my fair share.  This sharpener does it's job.
B000FA675C|4.0|Elmore Leonard once said about his writing: &#34;I leave out the parts people skip.&#34; Dan Brown could have done some of the same and it would have made for a much tighter and exciting read. I'm re-reading Michael Crichton's Disclosure and find it a well paced read, despite incorporating necessary techno babble related to the story. The Da Vinci Code also needed to pass on certain code and religious related info, but could have done it in a more concise manner while focusing more on character development.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this app is so so so cool only because it gas hktsrs and this us yorez hydt a bunch of do shizzlr

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I absolutely loved it! Not only is it extremely beautifully written but it offers another perspective for the holocaust.  I definitely recommend it.
B000093BDX|5.0|Ok, that may be a little overboard, but let me tell you my story. I kept hearing this song over the PA at work that I just LOVED!!! I had to do some research, then I discovered it was &#34;Come Go With Me&#34; by the Beach Boys. Of course! I LOVE the Beach Boys. I'm only 27 so I missed growing up with 70's music and sometimes I think I was just born in the wrong era!!! Thank God for &#34;Oldies&#34; CD's! Anyway, this is a wonderful collection of Beach Boys' music. It's got all the good classics you think of, like California Girls and Good Vibrations, plus some little known songs you will fall in love with if you don't already know them.<br /><br />I have literally listened to this CD about 200 times in the two months so far that I have owned it! And what an awesome (I purchased used) price! I was thrilled when this finally arrived in my mailbox!
B0000047CX|5.0|This was easy to rate.  Some one borrowed my Vinyl and never returned it!  I had to have a replacement.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The series it self was amazing trill,combination of acting and decorarive scene set up along with wonderful costumes that were made for this series made it so beliveble and realistic.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Definitely recommend this movie! Inspiring and creative portrayal of the life of an artist. It has a great soundtrack as well.
B005LAIISA|1.0|For me, this was a case of one installment too many.  They completely wiped the smile off my face the minute Scrat's intro had finished divvying up the world and the other character's showed up to complain, snipe, and mistreat the plot with a few too many life lessons.  My reaction was visceral; I really really hate this movie.  I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, I'm sorry I wasted my time watching it.  If they manage to cough up another recycled mess to serve as Ice Age 5, I'm not buying it.<br /><br />As for this Ice Age, it's fraught with an excess of problems not the least of which is poor characterization and a paper-thin plot swiped from a better writer.  The few themes presented are lazy and didactic.  We have the usual clich&eacute;s: peer pressure, intolerance, how to destroy a friendship in one easy lesson, and what it takes to be a family, which includes an overbearing father and a permissive mother.  Children are invited to challenge and ignore parental rules....et cetera et al.  Also, the attempt to cram humanity into a fistful of furry caricatures has never been so blatant and clumsily mishandled.  The worst of it for me was learning from their bonus feature that they compare this to Homer's Odyssey.  Such a claim, considering what they produced, is pathetic at best, delusional at worst.  And!  It is not an homage to steal someone else's ideas, counterfeit them as your own, then screw them up in the process!  If you can't come up with anything original or new then you're in the wrong line of work.<br /><br />If I was a skeet shooter I know what I'd do with this DVD.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it will work for about a month then it will crash and will not even get to the page with the start button.
B0089PJFFY|5.0|I somehow did not have this as mandatory reading along<br />the way! I think it should be for all of a certain age,<br />perhaps starting in Middle school.<br />i think of this wonderful young lady and I am very<br />inspired ,one can not say enough about<br />this wonderful classic.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My favorite new app. I am now addicted to shopping on ebay, I have found many things I havent seen since  I was little. I have purchased alot of things and will continue to thanks to this app.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show is fantastic! However, the streaming leaves much to be desired.  I have a very fast internet connection and I still rarely get HD shows from Amazon Prime.  I always get the optimizing option. Ugh!  Very frustrating!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The movie itself was very good, but the streaming quality was horrible. It restarted several times and we missed part of the movie.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|I was so in love with the all of  the characters of this movie that I was hooked immediately.  I can't begin to say how many times I have watched it.  What a great story!  A true romance!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|The movie started out a little slow and I was afraid I wasn't going to like it, but the personal relationships of the birders was skillfully interwoven with the birding and it turned out to be a great movie. I personally know a birder that would compare to Owen Wilson's character so the movie really resonated with me.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|SPOILERS...........SPOILERS................SPOILERS.............SPOILERS..........<br /><br /> Denzel Washington did a great job in portraying a chronic alcoholic, how they can function while drunk, how lying can be come as easy as breathing. He certainly was not always a likable person, and couldn't be trusted in some ways. However, he was a damn good pilot, and he saved nearly all of the persons on the plane, due to his skill. They proved that there was mechanical malfunction of the plane, and it was also a fact that the one flight attendant died because she was not seated and buckled in. Was the child in his own seat and fell out, or was he being held on his mother's lap? At any rate, I thought it was wrong that Whit was sent to prison. It was not his fault that the plane malfunctioned, there was no negligence on his part, and there was nothing that he could have done to change what happened. Instead, as said, he saved 96 lives and avoided the deaths of everyone nearby on the ground. He was a hero. I didn't like the relationship with Nicole and felt it pointless. It added nothing.<br /><br />I also didn't at all like his exwife or son. While he may not have been the best husband and father, he was supporting his son, as we see in the first minute of the film. He was paying for the son's private school, and also the home they were living in, and yet they treated him like dirt, while they were trying to get money from him. I didn't like the ending scene with the son either who seemed to want to twist the knife, and just demanded that Denzel spill his guts. They didn't seem to have any real relationship. I say again, if you don't want someone in your life, then stop harassing them for money, and pay your own way.<br /><br />Maybe Whit needed to have a house fall on him, in the form of being sent to prison, to finally get that he needed to change his ways, but I thought that the ending didn't fit the crime, since it was said that he had lost everything, and had no future.  Again, it was not his negligence that caused the plane to crash.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle has more confirmed kills than any sniper in the history of the military. Yeah, he writes about some of them. You are going to read about some of the missions he was a part of. But those stories, while detailed, are not what makes this book as powerful as it it. Chris also talked about parts of his life growing up. He talked about how the military affected his marriage. He talked about how it was easy to kill, but at the end, he was starting to feel the stresses of war. His wife added small parts to the story to get the perspective from her end as well. This book was not just about death, and it's a shame that the author met his way too soon.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I never would have believed that I would enjoy this movie as much as I have.  The real life honesty portrayed is unbelieveably funny and the characters pull it off so well.  I will always consider this one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|This CD contains some of Janis Joplin's best songs. I have replaced this album twice now, two LPs and now the CD.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I thought it would be funnier than it really was.  I had to stop reading it because it was not what I thought it would be.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is more than I ask for. This game is not like most Spiderman game s. This game I s like infamous in the way that you can do what you want.
B003XDXVXO|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over.  The chemistry between the actors is great and just a good story all the way around.  My husband even enjoyed it and laughed several times even though it's a &#34;chick flick.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing story this was a story where you think you had it figured out and them bam! Not at all what you thought. This is a serious page turner.I really loved this book.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Well written. Even though you can see the heroes headed for the abyss, you keep cheering for them right to the end. And, of course, the end isn't a disaster, so you can keep right on cheering for them.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Sent this to my sister-in-law, I had to share the love.  She loved this CD so much and said it was so heartfelt.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I love movies where the charactors have issues and someone teaches a great life lesson and true romance is found.  That happens in this movie for sure.  Good comedy, good story, and good chemstry.  Makes for a great show!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I wanted to listen to the cd all weekend over and over before I gave a review.  My first impression was mixed but once I took the time to really listen this cd is awesome. Hayley's voice comes through in so many different ways and I think the songs are deeper than in previous cd's. The interludes with the ukelele are okay but all of the other tracks are heavy-hitting and I've grown quite an attachment to them already. This is going to be played over and over for quite awhile. It's fresh yet still in Paramore style--which is fresh in itself. I love this CD!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME VERY CHALLENGING AND ENTERTAINING DEFINTELY KEEPS ME ENTERTAINED I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME WITH MY FRIENDS AND LOVE THE CHANCE TO GET A HIGHER SCORE.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed this book however it got a little tedious on some of the historical facts. I would still purchase this book knowing what I know now.
0061733199|5.0|This book is very useful in any situation. I would recommend this book for just about anyone, boy scout, hiker, adventurer. It contains valuable tips for every scenario you can think of. Glad I bought it.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show. I Love courtroom drams like this one. I would recommend this to my friends. One of the best courtroom dramas.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This was a good book that kept me up nights reading until I had to sleep. Similar to the first book there were a few tedious moments where I would pass over the historical facts, still a great read!
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Gary Moore was a world-class blues guitar player and a passionate vocalist. His covers of Hendrix ring true, but they are still pure Moore. The man could make the guitar cry and wail and whisper.<br /><br />He is jointed on two cuts by two members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience: Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox. The former nearly disappeared from rock after the death of Jimi, adding tragedy to tragedy. Mitch seems to tear up when he says he was \\"a lucky kid\\" to play with Jimi Hendrix. Cox is more jovial. Both play quite well.<br /><br />For any Hendrix and/or Gary Moore fan, this is satisfying material. And we are blue that they are both gone from this scene.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Easy read, interesting characters, Kind of transparent, but still keeps your interest.  Like the numerous twists and turns and so many dead people its just ridiculous.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the save me because If I'm on 4000 coins then if I want more then if I fall then I can just use a save me that's why I like save me.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The Master is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  What an absolute waste of my time.  I could not even finish watching it.  I watched about 1.5 hours, the last hour of which I kept asking myself, \\"why am I continuing to watch this crap?\\" I kept thinking it would get better, or go somewhere, or do something interesting.  But it never did.  It is disjointed and does not flow.  It does not flow because it has nowhere to flow to.  It goes nowhere.  It is irritating.  The music is terrible, and as such, complements the movie perfectly in its ability to irritate and confuse.  There does not appear to be any point to it.  I thought it was going to be a story analogous to the beginnings of the modern day scientology cult.  There is no story.  There are just a bunch of strange, creepy, and quirky characters that interact in uninteresting ways.  There is conflict, but nothing is ever resolved.  The actors are excellent at being irritating and weird and disturbing, but the movie itself is an utter waste of time.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|This app seems to work better than the regular app and is a lot faster at loading so thank you
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game but I think it is a knock off of Temple Run. It is still really fun to play.
B004PR71JC|5.0|My grandsons always want to see this DVD when they stay over at our house so I happened to see the making of the movie music clip on the DVD Bonus tracks and wanted to have the music on CD............ Really great tunes and it keeps my grandsons happy in the car too with me.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was a book chosen by my book club.  I can't wait for our book club discussion this week.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I ordered this for my Avengers loving son, but I and my daughter enjoyed it much more. Solid story, great message, a little history- bravo.
B004SBQALA|4.0|If you can tolerate the tweeny moments, you'll really enjoy this solid Sci-Fi movie with top-notch effects and lots of pretty young people.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I admire the Biebs because he can actually play and writes his own songs!  I became a &#34;belieber by default&#34; (11 yr old daughter)  and whilst i didnt think i could like the songs on Believe anymore than i previously did, this release changed my mind.  It is arranged well and Justin sings with conviction.  Good job and must have for Beliebers and acoustic music lovers alike.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book and surprise ending.  Would recommend as with all of his books that I have read.  Couldn't put it down.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|fun game ...easy to play.. screens go a bit too fast to read some cards opponents play. Only a few levels into  it but enjoying it
B009YX02T8|4.0|While I still think Taylor is still WAY hotter than anyone, I do finally think Bella and Edward are meant to be.  the first 3 movies i still thought Jacob was better, but honestly I just liked his character.  By end of #3 I know Jacob was better than Bella deserved.  I dont know I just thought her to be whiney, selfish person.  And the fact she kept wanting to be bitten was annoying.  I loved Edward when he said no.  I thought Edward was the best in #1 as after he became a secondary star.  This was far better than BD part 1.  Honestly wanted it to go on a little longer.  And the fight scene was awesome!  The end credits actually got me nostalgic, it was an awesome ending credit scene.<br /><br />And who was that HOTTIE from India!!!??  Dont worry Taylor, you will always be my fav!
B004N7B8DY|5.0|I love this movie.  Why they chose John Saxon for this movie I'll never know, but the story line is good and Bruce is top notch as always. For those of you who didn't know it, Jackie Chan makes a brief appearance in one of the underground fight scenes.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|installed the weather channel app on my kindle fire hd 7, did not need an email account, does need to be connected to wi fi for weather information, nice graphics, looks good.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults as well!  It was a fun take on Santa, the Easter Bunny, tooth fairy, sand man, etc.!  Really enjoyed it!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book follows to lonely people looking for companionship.  The characters are very likeable and you will root for them.  The book has flash backs to Jamie's life in an orphanage that are sad and graphic. The flash back aspect of the book works though because it creates two different stories that come together nicely in a climax. The beginning of this book was a little slow to develop, but I was pleasantly surprised in the end.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best super hero film ever made. If not, it's a tie with The Dark Knight. Great action scenes. Hulk smash.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Very, Very good graphics The only complaint that l have is I think the timer should be a little longer other than that the game is very good
6305428425|5.0|This movie is fantastic and really brings you back to school days when you could relate to the various &#34;clicks&#34;.

Doesn't even light up well considering the size I wouldn't expect it to anyway.<br />I also didn't get the 2day shipping like it stated as well. I purchase from Amazon daily and expect a delay every once in a while but I have waited one week for this one .

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the show. That's why I purchased season 2. DVDs 1 and 2 stall. I would like to have a new set. What do I need to do?<br /><br />Phyllis James
0316228532|1.0|I suppose I committed Amazon heresy by going to the local library to check out this book before buying it here on Amazon. I can tell you, I'm very glad I did.<br />I really wanted to like this book, I was excited about this book, I really wanted to see what she could do outside of the world of Harry Potter.<br />I hated 'The Casual Vacancy' . . . I'm sorry, but I did.<br />The characters were so unlikeable, I felt nothing but pity for them. It was an english countryside 'Peyton Place' with none of the sultry scandal or drama. It's a book populated with petty deluded angst riddled characters, grabbing for status, revenge, or their version of normalcy. Ms Rawling takes her much appreciated talent for detail and makes you wallow in the nastiness or despair of the respected characters. There was no one to cheer for, no one to feel happy for, no one you felt for, period.<br />I really tried to get into the characters & understand them, but i was just disgusted by them, and the ancillary characters that suddenly came to the forefront? Again, nothing but pity. You couldn't even feel their vindication or an aspect of their 'joy' because you couldn't feel anything for them despite the details presented to you.<br />I'm sorry, but I couldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The second season of Downtown Abbey delivers even more delicious turn-of-the-century drama. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with anything that includes Maggie Smith - but this may be her best role EVER! For anglophiles who love to examine gender and class issues with a sweet touch of romance this show is a must!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Though Tarantino stumbles a little here ...<br /><br />Worth every minute<br /><br />There are some great points ...<br /><br />Including the movie Lincoln, in the same two days, might allow some broader thought regarding slavery in this country ...<br /><br />And Tarantino himself, hidden again in this movie<br /><br />Seems to be enjoying a little too much White Cake, since Pulp Fiction ...
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Love love love a whole album! I hardly find an album that I can enjoy listening non-stop...over and over..fun and energetic musics that boost my energy every morning!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A fun read.  Hoping our government isn't that inefficient and crooked but wondering at the same time if maybe it is.  Good to know it was pure fiction.  Very creative and half way through figured something didn't fit.  Kept expecting some catch at the end.  Basically just fun to read and quick to finish.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book and Point of Retreat and can't wait for the next in the series. Awesome book. Bye.
B008M721MS|3.0|Just bought new Kindle HD 8.9, installed Skype and the video didn't work. I could see but not be seen. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling without success. Once I deleted from the tablet AND the cloud and then reinstalled, the video worked fine. Only 3 stars...seems to me this program should work the first time considering how long Skype has been around.
B005UWGRIC|5.0|As a Gary Barlow- Take That fan since the early nineties, this DVD is something I couldn't resist adding to my collection.  It was a delight to watch the five perform live.
B000OVLINI|3.0|This was one of my book club selections.  Though an interesting story, it was way too long.  I could picture this as a movie, with parts left out that didn't really add anything.  I found myself liking some of he supporting characters who were many times more interesting than the min ones.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and am passing on the title to friends and family. Intense read. Deep matters. Thanks
1476733953|5.0|I hope my boss doesn't ever see this review - as I took a day off work just so I could finish the book. Addictive. Incredible. Astonishing.<br /><br />I want more.<br /><br />Please read it, and read it well. I was so tense reading this whole book and any book that can make you feel like that says that the author has a very considered approach to the characters and storyline.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it's lots of fun to billed my very onen city and eren ponets. I like to pass time playing this game
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Enjoyable reading that provides some inspiration. Well worth the asking price and your time to read it. The title didn't grab me but the book is fun and interesting.
B008OOYALE|4.0|hi this game is cool.I like playing it I could play it all day.I think I can jump onto the dragon and fly
B0026IUXME|4.0|This movie was way before my time  but i had to watch it for class, learned a little more then i knew before.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book like all of Mr Grishams, kept me wanting to read more. I love his writing. And this particular book was spell binding. I can't wait for the next new release.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|If u don't like to lose then don't bother downloading this game. U might win 1 out of 10 games even when u have 4 cards. . .maybe. it freezes a lot and they don't return ur bingo chips the payouts suck and if u don't sign into facebook u cant complete a room. Everytime they update it seems to be worse instead of better. Especially when it comes to the power ups. U used to be able to buy 9 power ups for 1000 coins now it only gives u 4 and it keeps giving u the same ones that ur notable to use it all boards such as extra experience. I have 316 power ups 267 of them are extra experience and when u buy more 2 out of 4 are extra experience. It also seems like thegames are rigged. U can have 3 dirffernt ways to get bingo on1 card but only numbers around the ones u need are called. Its frustrating and annoying so I uninstalled itfrom my tablet because it makes want to throw it across the room.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Enjoyable, exciting, and, as always, suspenseful. These movies never let you down and Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hawk perfectly. Watch it!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great book, especially to those of us who have served and understand the brotherhood war brings upon men... well written
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is fast, and I am able to change translations in an instant.  I can follow the sermons on Sunday and read it any time I want.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love love love this series.  It is by far one of the best written, acted and produced PBS pieces.  My whole family fell in love with it and will continue to watch the series as it comes out.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I have the paid version of this and it constantly cuts out while on wifi and on mobile connection.  I wish the stations I want to hear were on iheart radio, the free version of that works better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|at first I didn't understand or hard to follow with everyother chapter from another person, but when it came together it really surprised me.
159315724X|5.0|Living your life is like building muscle. The greatest growth is made in that moment when you push past your previous limits. That's when you discover that you become more than you were.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The final book in Lauren Oliver's trilogy about a futuristic America.  I loved the first two books so the third was a must read.  It was good but a slight let down at the end.
1907947655|5.0|Beautifully written, the characters are very real and the description of the time and era is very Romantic. Coming of age story of a family who had its share of pain and disappointment, having 5 girls, so naturally they had to marry well to help the other members of the family. Very similar to what young women toady are told to look for from a very early age.
B007NG93CK|2.0|Maybe I have read too many Tempe stories. This seemed more focused on the history of diamond mining in NWT than forensics. More of a pot boiler than a mind stimulator. Good for a flight read but not a must read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Downloaded this for free from Amazon and am inpressed with it.  Not sure what the paid one does that this doesn't, but I am satisfied.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Can't say enough about this wonderful series.  It is truly a gem and we look forward to more of it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app makes it easier to get on Facebook from my kindle.  Love it!  I check facebook at least twice a day.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have it's own volume setting.  If you turn your Kindle volume off there is no sound when the alarm goes off the next time.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It's ok wish it had a notice that your game was over when you run out of turns. Other than that it's a great game. I like that you can customise decks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like every other Birds game, this is great! Enough levels easy enough to keep going and other levels difficult enough to frustrate me!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a fun site and the app makes it so much easier to access.  I follow garden tips the most and have discovered things I didn't know.  Problem is I could stay on this site too long!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator... it's free! ... and it works!  I can't find anything wrong with that. If you're looking for a simple calculator- this one does the job.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Very clever and well done!  Something lighthearted for the kids and pretty darn entertaining for adults - would recommend this for an all-around family movie!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I like historical fiction and have always been interested in Lincoln, but my husband and I both fell sound asleep a half hour into this boring, boring, poorly made movie. It was awful.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|fungame like the jarrasic park idea and its addictive to play my g/f even started playing it only downfall is the looooong tutorial but oh well still a great game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. Th plot twists had you on edge. I loved the ending. An amazing series. Well written.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Best movie ever as far as I am concerned - none better than McQueen!  A star-studded cast and of course all the elements that make a great movie of action and suspense!  Fantastic!
B0000558PI|1.0|The DVD didnt play in any of my dvd players. I just throw it away its not even worth paying the postage to send it back.
0553582038|4.0|I was cautious committing to read this due to the mixed reviews, but I ended up loving it. Sure Martin will never mention anything without a detailed description, and there are a few parts that seem unnecessarily long, but by the end of the book, he delivers, and I was left thirsting for more.<br /><br />After all of the epic happenings in Storm of Swords, the story kind of reboots in the book. It unfolds slowly and methodically. Martin paints exquisite pictures and his character development is masterful. I found myself savoring the length and patiently waiting for the plot to unfold. By the end I got why some parts were so long and labored. You get to know each character in such detail, and he includes lots of insightful backstory.<br /><br />I can imagine that would be difficult to read it and then wait 5 years for the next book, but since the next book is already out, I won't be able to complain like that until I finish reading Dance for Dragons!<br /><br />I would tell people considering this book that if they are looking for an epic story filled with incredible characters and intricate detail, keep on reading. You won't find such a rich, vast, interwoven story elsewhere. But if you are looking for a quick read with lots of action, this is probably not the book for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game that's fun and addicting for everyone! I enjoy playing it whenever I can. My only problem is that the charactersare so expensive.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I loved this!  We got is as a family gift for Christmas, and loved it.  If you've seen the Aliens movies, you have to watch this!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|We are enjoying this very much.  I read the first two books a couple years ago.  I highly recommend this.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this books within 24 hours. I could not put it down. It was fantastic! Now I have to wait for books #3...
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|This album is outstanding. Adele's music and singing talent will stand the test of time for many, many years to come. I don't know why I took so long to get this album.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|My husband is a big comic book fan, and really liked this particular story.  He just got part 2 and is looking forward to watching it.
B0012HEB32|5.0|Great series, that would have done well against the curremt crop of shows. Lena Headey is worth watching. As is Summer Glau.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|A lovely story of working hard to attain your goals,<br />with perseverance and respect for adults in your life.<br /><br />True story.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|If you like part one - you have to get part 2 and share with your friends - good sequel - get it now
1606995359|5.0|My husband is a big Carl Barks Fan.  he cant wait fro the next one to come out.  A great gift idea.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Like her other books it keeps you guessing! Thrilling stories with mystery and good side stories. Have read two of her books and will read the third.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I waited way too long to read this book. Part of it is because i have Slammed in a certain box and i was scared that any departure would make me disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong. Such as different feel from Slammed; there are definitely more sexually explicit situations and subject matter but this book rocked all the same. I can't say much without giving up all the juicy twisty bits, but trust me this was not just hype this book is awesome!  My goodreads gals never steer me wrong!
B004J64QSI|5.0|I loved it - it will go down in time as one of the greatest . Watched it many times
0062127241|5.0|My husband got this for Christmas.  He is a big Who fan, and it revealed some facts he didn't know, but found fascinating.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was flipping the page completely absorbed & realized I was done, leaving me completely shocked!!!! Awesome,Awesome,Awesome!!!  Must get the next book NOW!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put this series down, I read all of the reviews for this book some good and some not so good. But I loved every book
B000JQUKKU|4.0|What a long winded author (he was paid by the word!)  Another free classic worth reading.  The Mickey Christmas Carol is better as for the movie version!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|My husband has been collecting comics his whole life.  He has been educating me on the different characters.  When we saw this at the theater we were amazed.  Every character is mixed beautifully for the story.  Can't wait for the next Marvel movies!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I grew up with this movie and my kids loved it! I love that it's totally wholesome for a 4 and 5 year old boy to watch without any violence and good family fun! Definitely a keeper...we are buying it! GREAT classic!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|For the most part, when I check it has been 90% accurate.  The temperatures have been slightly off.  Oh well
B008602KQI|1.0|Now there's two hours of my life I'll never get back. I found the movie overly violent and sadistic. And for a lover of pictures like the Dirty Harry series and John Wayne war films that's saying a lot. The pace simply drug on and on. The only worse flick in this regard was Lord of The Rings Part 1. If you want to see a masterpiece go rent or buy Les Miserables. Hunger Games? No, absolutely not.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Excellent product....reasonably priced, fits very nicely and flush in my ExpressCard34 slot and functions as described.<br /><br />Plug n' play out of the box on my MacBookPro. I would highly recommend this product.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This book is an easy read.  I like the tb show & it goes along with the story line, too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really recommend that all read this amazing amazing series<br />It really is great and don't forget to read the first book first. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book.  Finished it in one day.  Loved the meaning of the title as well.  I think Colleen Hoover developed the characters really well and created an intriguing storyline that keeps you turning the page
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Don't waste 3 hours to watch this horrible movie. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Full of cliches-especially the future scenes. Go and sleep instead..
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I like the Nikki Heat stories.  I like the tv show.  They are both good.  I never grow tired of them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My brother loves it my older brother will not play with me he says let me beat my high score it is over 2 million he is so addicted to<br />it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1897299214|4.0|The premise of this book astounded me- Western cartoons are being produced in North Korea?! More shocking, Westerners are being brought in to oversee this? Whoa. This book us something I have to get my hands on!<br />My overall reaction - to the story - is WHOA. North Korea is every bit as freaky as the rumours, certainly the little bit the Delisle was allowed to see. (other reviewers have wasted time whining that all the author did was hang out in hotels with other foreigners- hey morons, did you miss the point? He wasn't able to do anything else!)<br />Now here comes the disturbing bit- I lived in South Korea some years ago, and Delisle's North Korea is not entirely dissimilar. \\"volunteer\\" is a word the South Koreans did not understand either - saying \\"no\\" to a proposed volunteer activity gets you raked over the coals. Fine, it wasn't a forced activity for the state, but not participating got you black balled. There was a lot of enforced group-think going on, and while it did not reach the propaganda extremes of what Delisle saw in Pyongyang, it wasn't a million miles away either.<br />This book was informative - it explained the Berlin subway carriages I saw in Pyongyang's subway in a recent documentary! Any book that can complement other material is worth the price! Bon travail, Guy!
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|There is absolutly no valid reason to not allow this to be streamed to a computer. Is this a complete joke?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I think it is cool because you get to wake up to your favorite song but the volume is not that loud
B005ES0ZKS|5.0|....that I don't really care if people think they're ugly.  I don't think they are mind you, but people have expressed that opinion despite that, I love wearing them.  I slip them on to run to the store quickly or wear them around the house...even around the camp site.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|We first watched this sci-fi/psychological thriller online and liked it so much that we decided to buy a copy. The plot is excellent, as are the special effects, the acting is convincing and the suspense keeps you guessing with many twists and turns right to the end. If you like intelligent sci-fi then you will be well-satisfied with this movie. However sorry to say the blue ray version is a pain in the butt, they seem so concerned about copyright protection that getting this legal copy to play on my laptop was almost impossible. The only way we could get it to work was by first downloading the bonus digital copy onto my laptop, entering the license key, then the blue ray would play - well just about. I'd give the movie 5 stars but only 3 for the blue ray copy for the hassle so 4 stars overall. I'll update this review again once I've tried it on a regular blue ray player.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|First, this is an excellent movie however the video quality was very poor (at times).  I have 50Mbps internet so I am thinking the issue isn't on my end.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|the star never appears even after successfully crossing the flames :( no fair!!  fix it please! other than that I love this game...totally addicted!
B009AVFSAW|5.0|\\"Disclaimer II\\" is great! This is a great debut album from Seether. This is a great rock album debut, as well. All (20) tracks on here are great.<br /><br />Track Listing<br />1.

B007ZMAL32|2.0|I want to like Sabaton.... i really do.  I've been a metal fan since the early 80's.  I love Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Scorpions....and even more modern metal bands.  But....there is something a bit too cheesy about Sabaton.  They are great musicians....but the lyrics and the vocals remind me of other cheese metal bands from the 80's like Manowar. Just not my cup of tea, i guess.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Best game I've played so far.<br />  Challenging yet good hints when you get stuck.  Hidden items not impossible to find like in some other games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book completely satisfied my every need i was looking for in any novel. Not gory enough for me to become disgusted but not too childish with the intense action scenes (if you know what i mean). The writing was SUPERB! Collins completely captured my imagination on every page and i was able to follow the story to the end with no problems. The romance was just enough and didnt go over the point to where it would get cheesy and cliche(*cough*50 shades of grey). Overall, a fantastic book that i am extremely glad i spent my time to read and that i will read many more times from now. :)
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I am a huge Volbeat fan and must say that they get better with each album....especially this one. From start to finish it is solid all the way through. BUY IT!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever !!!!only thing is I am sick of waiting for 0.7.0 to come out.the people for xbox thought they had to wait long!?!?!?! ITS BEENF***ING 6 MONTHS!!!!! WHEN IS IT GOING TO COME OUT!!!?!?!?!???
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|i enjoy because the acting is good, costumes and nazcting believable.  Im a little stunned how sexual it is and violent.  i dont know much about history and am excited about seeingb the other episodes
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book :) I love the dairy of a wimpy kid  book's I love Jeff Kinney books of dairy of a wimpy kid !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I have two kids, ones 6 years old and the other is 4 years old.  I try to not let them watch too much TV (mostly because it drives me insane with all the Disney Jr), and because so much of what's on TV these days is awful and has no educational value whatsoever.  (Little Einstein is awesome, but I need a break from that too sometimes.)  Last year they started trying to get my cellphone non-stop so that they can either pretend to chat on the phone or play my games on it.  (I don't think I need to tell you how much of a nightmare that is.)  So I got them a cheap android tablet around Christmas last year and loaded it with a bunch of free educational games like \\"Pics and Words.\\"  They really like it, especially my 6 year old who's in Kindergarden and has vocabulary as part of her class.  (It's also helped with her reading and spelling a lot too.)  I love all the awesome free apps on the android market these days since they're making education for a single mom a lot easier.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I purchased this CD because I have been a Groban fan for years and I have all of his albums.  I have two of some of them, one for the car and one for my office.  Even when he sings in a language other than English, I can sometimes understand the song by the passion, ebbs and flows of his voice.  His music is timeless.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|From the first page to the last, Lean In has great information for a future leader as well as those of us that have held leadership positions, past and present. Ms. Sandberg puts it all out there, clear and easy to read. A big thank you from a mother of three girls!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing hoping and waiting for the next one! So glad I actually read this book and got caught up in it
B00C32R64G|5.0|a band who added a guitarist really made a strong move and great sound strong lyrics. can't wait to see them live and hear new music from these guys
B000W91RUG|5.0|I am working on buying all of the Big Bang DVDs.  These are the quirkiest, funniest, cutest characters in the universe.  No matter how many times I watch these series, I still get a big kick of laughter from them.  They really lift me up when I'm down, although sometimes I'd like to grab Sheldon by his shoulders and shake him really hard sometimes.  I am truly hoping that at the end of all the series Leonard and Penny are together, Howard's Mother gets married, Cuthrapali can talk to any woman he wants to without having to get drunk first, and Sheldon wins a Nobel Prize for being the world's most self-absorbed human -- in a funny way, of course.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Great music. I couldn't wish for anything better.  Well done and a bit different from other albums I have.  Love it<br />!
B006AN78XS|5.0|The story is really believable in a sense of the past and the future and how he must get out of his marriage complications and back to a writers point of view.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is the best game I have played in a while. It's challenging and fun at the same time. I can't wait for Jewel Legends 2. It should be a blast.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  It was quite gripping. I'm sorry that I didn't get to see the movie.  It must have been great.<br />Jackie=Radisson
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this game was fun, it lagged a little bit but still fun. i liked the under water experience also, meow
B001I45UFC|4.0|I haven't finished it yet and I am engrossed with the fantasy of going into a wardrobe and finding all these creatures that are fun to read about.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Do not download this game unless you have time to burn. It is highly addictive and much more fun than Temple Run. The graphics are well done and it is nice to have a different &#34;temple&#34; setting to run in. My only complaint is how long it takes for the company's logo to move off the screen. I haven't actually timed it but it feels like it's up there for around a minute and there is nothing that can be done until it moves to the next screen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wish I had cable so I didn't have to pay for this season, but I am totally addicted to this show!
1481913417|1.0|This is a 100 year old document out of copyright which has been reprinted rather poorly in my opinion. It does not resemble later editions by Strunk and White. It is woefully out of date. This is the second time I have been ripped off on books. I went for $29-30 for a &#34;manual&#34; for Wordperfect3 or 4 years ago. Corel (wordperfect) sent me a pamphlet that your vendor ordered for me. The identical pamphlet came with my purchase of Wordperfect. Anyone could buy it from Corel for $7. If the vendors are the same--they have a similar MO--you should bar it from Amazon. It does your reputation no good.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Pudding Monsters is one of my favorite apps.  The gameplay is simple yet challenging and always offers more than one way to beat a level.  Even if you do beat all the levels, you can go back and earn achievements by completing them in different ways, such as earning all the possible star combinations (Crown mode).  If you like Cut the Rope, you'll love this app.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This film, based on historical events, is a masterfully made film, featuring excellent acting, great cinematography, and the unbelievably true story to back it up. The suspense and drama of the film is accented with brilliant humorous moments from Alan Arkin and John Goodman which bring you back again and again. Totally worth watching, owning, renting, etc.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I really enjoyed my return to Middle Earth. I chuckled through much of the movie in a good way and even had a few moments where I just got really stoked by the music and or scenery. I'm looking forward to the next two!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I found this to be a very entertaining movie. It keeps up the action and narrative at a fairly good pace. Not to mention what a gem this is with some good actors in it. I enjoyed the viking/spaceman/alien mash up story line. As strange as that sounds it actually mixed together a lot better than you would think. The movie is meant as a mental escape into scifi and at that the does a wonderful job. I would recommend if you're into scifi action...Enjoy!..I had never heard of this movie before...why I no idea because it should have been great in the movie theatre.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This series was extremely enjoyable. I loadedit up when I received a copy of the final movie. I must also say that Nathan Fillon was determining factor. The &#34;Star Trek&#34; similiarity comes through, which makes this series a great view for those fans. The characters are well developed in the very first episode and then depth is added in the others.<br />I definitely would recommend this show to others and find it hard to believe it only lasted one season.
B001974DG0|5.0|Lots of fun, although disturbing at times, but a good ride.  The evil in this book is truly evil, which is why it's so disturbing next to the dog, who Dean captures unbelievable well.  A great good vs. evil book, very funny at times with the dog antics, but scary as well.  I really enjoyed it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I enjoyed this thoroughly..watched it twice. I found Rodriguez to be an intriguing personality with a very interesting story. He appears to be a man with no story but in fact he is a man with a wealth of interesting stories. From seedy musician to South African rock star who lives in poverty in his own country. The man's journey, personal beliefs, values and outlook on life are the real story. I would highly recommend this if your looking for a deep thought provoking story (at least it was to me)...Not only is he an artist of music, he is an artist of philosophy.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|A big disappointment.  I expected a good movie about the hostage rescue attempt.  Even though Affleck seems to have made sure a late-1970s setting was used he failed to make a nonfiction movie with any action.  Actors were obviously told to use the F word over and over.  It became ridiculous and boring.  If you want to increase the commonality of such nonsensical movies and listen to lines full of foul language, watch it.<br /><br />If you expect some representation of reality, look elsewhere.
B008M34INW|1.0|This was nothing like the previews suggested.  I love Mel Gibson but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey, this is as rich in texture as Downton but the English life was on the opposite end of the income spectrum.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have been looking for a calendar for sometime. This product really fits my needs.<br />I had to work through some of the features by trial and error but I was successful.
B009XWD02G|4.0|Wish could download all music. Would be easier to make CD and/or listen to music from one source. But I like app and will use
B004O0TKWG|5.0|I wish they would release Night Owl on its' own. Until then you will have to settle for this combination.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Book for book club, it was a great read but still leaves some questions in the end. Felt like a true story. Great writing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Only a 3 star rating because I hated the ending.  Enjoyed the book and would recommend it to all without a word about the ending.  Let all root for Nick.  I still am.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game, subway surfers, is a really good, great , fantastic and a tiny bit hard. You can compete against your friends if you are logged onto Facebook. It is competitive and I would recommend it to my family and my friends!!!
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Assembly of the device is easy, and it serves the intended purpose.  The cutter tool is not exactly 90 degrees from the vertical metal piece, not sure if that's intentional or not.  A bit flimsy but good quality for what you pay.  Also comes with a tapper tool in case the bottle doesn't split by itself.
B007ED9FIY|3.0|Before I did my purchase, I did look up for details (and I did not find anything specific about airplay or HDMI adaptor for iPad). However, I watched the trailer of this movie using the Apple TV mirroring feature of my iPad and it ACTUALLY WORKED!! Then I decided to purchase this movie, but once I bought it and started streaming the movie to the Apple TV, it displayed a dialog box saying that HDMI cable/airplay IS NOT available with the app!!<br />Make sure you have the proper devices that work with Amazon Instant Video!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I'm 75% through the reading. I am of the age that went through the war with Germany and having perspective of both sides, is just too good!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Was able to keep up with charcters pretty good..At times was very hard to stop reading just to know what was next..I do not get the time to read as much as I would like and because of this I was able to get right back to follow.
B00000099Y|4.0|While it may not be the best produced. It takes the Psychedelia from later albums and meshes it with the raw anger and helplessness from pervious albums. This is where they broke away from simple song structures, although after awhile they get predictable it is a nice departure and adds to the atmosphere. The only thing holding it back is the mixing which seems somewhat flat. Other then that, almost every song on the album is a standout, even the \\"filler\\". Aenima is a prog rock masterpiece that knows its place and doesn't overindulge like other Tool albums.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|good for collectors its a good tv show great characters i recomended i happy whit this product and it arrive in good conditions
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book is perfect for those with high incomes living paycheck to paycheck. It answers the question about why those in that category can never seem to get ahead. It will make you look at each purchase differently. Do you really need that luxury car or pair of name brand sneakers?
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Definitely a first of its kind and turned the sex world upside down with its graphic S & M sex scenes.  Nevertheless the writer managed to catch your attention in the story line and leave you hanging (no pun intended) for the next book.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I bought this really for my kids to watch. But it turned out to be a really good family movie for adults too. But when the movie is on, my 4 year old and 1 year old are fixated to the screen. It’s a good family movie and the children love this movie. I highly recommend this movie for the family and for children in the home as well!!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I'm not saying it was this app 100% but it seems odd how it slowed my kindle HD down. I uninstalled it, and after doing so, in about half an hour the screen went blank for a few seconds. I have learned that something not safe usually has been installed when this happens. 2 days later, I got a phone call from my credit card company saying someone has been using my card for the past 2 days. Really? Doesn't that seem a little strange to anyone else? I am hoping this was not the case, but it did not seem to run right for me. It is a fun app and I enjoyed using it other than the credit card incident.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Got this DVD for my children to watch for Easter. They loved it, especially my 4 year old. It was a movie that I as well could get into with my children. It was fun to watch for children and Adults. Fun little family adventure movie. Enough Adventure to keep adults and older children's attention into it as well. Can't go wrong with this movie, if looking for a movie for the family to watch together. However if your children are a little afraid of villains or alot of action, or even possibly the idea of Santa wielding two swords may upset someone in the family. May want to keep on looking for another family movie to enjoy!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The movie just kind of drags on. Not really that funny till you get to the end. Shouldnt be called a comedy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for fans of Temple Run.  With new map updates the game never gets old or boring or no longer fun. You can play for hours on end.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Me and my wife lauged the entire time. Awesome.
B000050HTO|5.0|We bought this for our son-in-law for Christmas. It was a big hit with him. We almost kept it for ourselves
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The actors are great! The storyline is very interesting enough to keep my attention and wanting to watch more. I hope this show has many more season ahead.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic!  I didn't want it to be over. How can I ever find another book to equal it.  Anybody have a suggestion?
0061692034|5.0|Canada is so close to being on my very small favorites list. The only reason it isn't is because it wasn't as compelling as my other top favorites. The story was excellent, the characters were incredibly well developed, and the book was very thought provoking. This would be a great choice for a book group. I love the theme of nature versus nurture and all the psychological analysis Richard Ford included.<br /><br />My favorite part was the characters. They were all so unique. I get the felling Richard Ford is unlike any of them, yet he somehow managed to develop them, have them speak and interact realistically, and grow like true people.
B003Y3D9C6|5.0|I literally wear these shoes every day. They are so comfortable and cute; definitely the most comfortable shoes I own. I bought them in khaki/espresso also. These can be dressed down at the pool or beach or dressed up a bit with some cute capri pants. Definitely recommended to all!
0374214913|4.0|I heard this was different and compelling and it was. I enjoyed the story and some of the characters and read it quickly, at least for me. My only complaint was it was too tech-y. There was a lot of technology stuff and I am not really great with understanding coding and how Google works, etc. However, to get the story line and enjoy the book those parts aren't absolutely necessary to comprehend. There were scenes that had me on the edge of my seat, unable to put the book down. Best part: the glow in the dark books on the cover!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was really impressed with this knife when it came in the mail. The weight, design, feel, look, is all really good. I don't think everyone needs or wants a knife like this, but for those of us who do, I personally don't think you can go wrong with this.
0385536828|4.0|Sweet Tooth was smart, compelling, and different. Ian McEwan is such a great storyteller. Without giving away any plot, I especially loved reading the written stories inside the main story, very well written.  The characters were well developed and realistic, and the dialogue was believable. The ending was really good, great for discussing with others.
B002WJI63A|5.0|As a father with a three year old daughter my love for the super Mario bros. has been passed onto and absorbed by her. As expected she is a big princess peach fan and was very happy to get this as part of a birthday gift. It's good quality and looks cool.
0812983459|4.0|Unlikely Pilgrimage was a quick, compelling, and somewhat profound book. I really liked the premise, the characters, and the ending. Many quotes and character realizations at the end made me stop and think. Great first read of the year for me!
0307388921|5.0|I love Chuck Palahniuk's books. This is no exception. Right from the start this book takes off at an incredible pace and is a true page turner. At times the text is shocking and hilarious. At other times the text is compelling and deep. Overall, this is a great read and well worth the time and the money. I would also highly suggest readin Mr. Palahniuk's Fight Club as in my opinion it is his best work.
1451695195|4.0|I wanted to be assured heaven was real, and felt encouraged by the prologue where the author says the book is for people like me; people who haven't totally believed other NDE (near death experience) accounts. However, I wasn't completely convinced, obviously, since that was a ridiculous idea! He does give a nice account of his experience and a lot of science about why it was an NDE, not a dream or hallucination. For me, the one thing I need to know is that I will be with my sons when my time does come, and he says otherwise.<br /><br />Overall his experience was amazing and his recovery was nothing short of miraculous. I was more moved by the odds being stacked against him and he and his family overcoming and pulling through than with his account of heaven.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I gave this movie a five star rating because Sir Anthony Hopkins was once again amazing.  After the first fifteen minutes I thought I was actually watching Alfred Hitchcock.  Helen Merrin was also fantastic as Alma Hitchcock.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to Hitchcock fans everywhere.  After watching this film I made a decision to do something I swore I would never do again and that is watch the original Hitchcock masterpiece Psycho again.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a gem of a film.
0743297334|2.0|My obsession with Hemingway continues. Someone told me there was a lot of Hemingway the man in The Sun Also Rises. From what I've read, I think he put details about himself in Roger and Jake. The story was boring to me though. The characters were interesting and well developed, but nothing really happened, which usually doesn't bother me, but did here. Maybe because it was almost like rereading A Moveable Feast or The Paris Wife, bull fighting, Paris night life, heavy drinking, over and over. But I am still so intrigued by him, he is such a huge part of literary history.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It's addicting, but otherwise, it just plain sicks.<br />It's stupid.<br />It's something to do when your bored y ok death UUUUUUGGGGGGGG
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Time wasters, you know the type. The person: who reaches the front of the line and still doesn't know what to order; who never signals when driving their car; that checks all fifty lottery tickets at a gas station when you just want to pay for your gas, etc. Who among us has never experienced this? Perhaps we're guilty ourselves of being one of those people at one time or another. So when reading the synopsis to \\"Time Wasters,\\" I thought I was in for a great read as it's such an intriguing concept with disturbing end results. Reading the first page will definitely hold your attention as it did mine. The executions of the serial killer's victims are well-written giving the reader a clear understanding of what's taking place. However, that's all that I found to be worthwhile; hence, two stars.<br /><br />We have the two detectives, Max and Jesse, at the heart of the novel both of whom I found to be unrealistic and asinine. While others found them to be a well-developed, dynamic duo, I found them to be the complete opposite. In fact, there wasn't one thing that I found likeable about either one. They were both arrogant, narcissistic, smug, and very fake-like. I didn't understand them individually or as partners. The writing and dialogue between the two was ill-conceived and poorly written, at times very child-like. It felt as though two authors had written this novel, combining the two sub-plots (ie: the killer, and the interaction and relationship between the two detectives), thinking it made for a suspenseful mystery. Suspenseful? Absolutely not. Not only is the story predictable, so are the twists and turns the author has deemed to include hoping to stun its readers. For two supposedly smart people who are able to examine and solve how each crime took place on their first try, they both don't even catch the blatant and obvious clue a witness gives them; which would have directed them towards the killer. Perhaps the author thinks his readers will miss this clue likehis detectives.<br /><br />\\"Max is one of the best detectives Rockton has ever seen. He advanced quickly from patrolman to detective because of his natural instincts and great people skills.\\"<br /><br />Instincts? Give me a break! People skills? What detective grabs his partner's arm several times to guide her out of a room?<br /><br />Max to his Captain:<br /><br />\\"It says here she had offers from all over the country.\\"<br /><br />She has been on the force for four years already and is just getting promoted? Why did it take her so long?\\"<br /><br />I'd like to know how an officer of only four years on the force could be getting \\"offers from all over the country.\\" Does this seem realistic? Does it even make sense? Hell no! (cue eye-rolling, not once but several times).<br /><br />Half-way thru and I just wanted to toss this one into the trash, but I kept at it, and now I wish I hadn't. Aside from the executions, I found this book to be boring and tedious, full of mindless drivel. I have absolutely no intention of reading the next book in this series.

092389165X|4.0|This is a good little book about survivors of the atomic bomb. First published in 1946 and written by an American. It is really worth getting if you are into history. This should be required reading for all student.

B004TI5N38|5.0|Good book , it keeps your attention. Very complex plot that keeps your attention to the very end of the book.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie made me laugh from beginning to end! Cameron Diaz is brilliant as the teacher who doesn't give a s***! :) Seeing Justin Timberlake in this movie makes me wonder where all the sexy substitute teachers where when I was in school! I highly recommend! I loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this the best game ever and u all should play if u don't u got to be out of our minds
B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie is amazing! Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler are brilliant! Such an awesome love story! Parts that make me cry EVERYTIME but still so good! Must have!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Don't deal well with sociopaths and totally &#34;sick&#34; weirdos with no redeeming qualities.  I will not recommend this best seller.  I just don't get it!
B000NHQLPS|5.0|The cast in this movie is amazing! I love the plot, Wahlberg is excellent as is Damon and DiCaprio.. and everybody else! Some laughs in there as well. Brings me home to Boston :)
B00633W614|5.0|A gifted storyteller, Archer captivates the reader from the first page until the last.  I started immediately to read the next book in what I understand will be either a 3 or 5 volume saga, the Clifton Chronicles. .  Can't wait for the release of the third.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Intense movie.. intense plot, but an amazing movie! Sam Jackson and Christina Ricci are awesome! The fact that Justin Timberlake is in it makes it even better for me :) Short role, but he plays it brilliantly! Highly recommend!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was wonderful, and captivating. Full of suprises, and adventure. Plus, there's romance. Everything a GREAT novel should be !!! This book was extremely good, I highly reccomend this book !!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Way better then the movie I read the book in two day and I would recommend it to anybody who loves to read
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I was just a casual Stone Sour fan until I heard \\"The House Of Gold & Bones\\" Part 1. I loved that album! Then it donned on me that I was pretty stupid for not paying much attention to the band prior to this release. I went back and got all the older albums and pre-ordered Part 2. I can say after a few listens, Part 2 is a great conclusion to \\"The House Of Gold & Bones\\". I won't go through track by track, others have already done that. All that needs to be said is that if you're a Stone Sour fan, you'll love this album. If you're just a Slipknot fan, if you don't get it by now, you never will. If for some reason you're a new fan who stumbled upon this album first (as I did with Part 1), definitely go back and get all of their albums. Stone Sour are now in my Top 10 favorite bands because of \\"The House Of Gold & Bones\\".
B008VBYN80|5.0|You can do so much on your first day and you don't have to buy much at all. its awesome as the title suggests this is a app for all ages 7+
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I didn't see the movie in the theater but have read all of the story several times. I thought they did a pretty good job considering they have broken the book out into 3 movies. It was a little slow at times, but I thought it did well to develop the characters and story. Looking forward to the next round in December 2013.
B00BUI5GW8|5.0|I rate this album 5 stars because he has songs with with &#34;Old Wayne&#34; in it.. VS the Post Rikers Island Wayne... I like Days and Days, No Worries, Rich as F***, Gun Walk, Wowzers (love it), Love me, Trigger Finger, and Trippy (fun)
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game. it is addicting,  but fun. :) YOu can build your own city and watch it grow. really really fun!

I HAVE PURCHASED SOME PUZZLES, BUT DID NOT GET TO USE THEM, BECAUSE I HAD TO REMOVE THE APP AND START OVER. I HAD RECIEVED AN E-MAIL STATING THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS ON MARCH 18, 2013. THE PROBLEM STILL HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a good story with action going on at all times, and it held your attention to the film. There were some times in the film where you were wondering if they were going to make it or not. Great movie to watch, and I can see why it won awards for the film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was extremely shocking to say the least, unreal turn of events along with the adaption of new characters...
B003MYYJD0|2.0|The face of this watch is absolutly beautiful, but I find it to be so big and bulky that trends to looking fake.  It's to much money for the majority of people to think your wearing a $20 watch from the Flea Market.  I asked family, friends, and co-workers what they thought and they all thought it was fake or cheap.  But, remember, the face is beautiful. If you can get over all the other stuff, U will love this watch.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you run or not you'll enjoy this book. It's a great story with a lot of thought provoking information thrown in.
B008D37J6O|1.0|I was trying to find an app to listen to my wma music files on my kindle fire device. This doesn't seem to be the app for that. Don't really know what it is the app for. Hard to understand, and has been deleted.
1608871088|5.0|Really  love this album.<br />The Rise of the Guardians is the first film I loved after a long period. This was an emotional purchase, mostly and although the delivery costed me  a bit higher then the book itself, I never regret. Full explanations, nice drawings, sketches - all the story of the film creation, paper of a good quality. And i know I can't buy it in my country.<br />This book inspires me to proceed with my drawing lessons - I love all the characters and wish to draw them alike  someday )))))))
B004VOBIE8|4.0|No bells and whistles here, but that might be a good thing.  You don't want an app like this to be difficult to navigate or understand. Well put together and helps keep my stuff in order.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old grand daughter, and find myself playing it when she's not here.  It can be addicting, but is fun.  You must successfully complete each round, or you have to try, try again.  Very vivid graphics and a cute little frog with sound effects.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great read even for the second time.  Dan Brown has very good ability as a writer, develops his characters within the book.
B0084IRI9G|5.0|came fast and in good packaging, although there was no front cover skin, the book was cheap and very much worth the price i paid.
B009QU9X44|5.0|I was so caught up in this story. Every character felt like someone I knew. It was raw and lacking in pretense. Bravo, another masterpiece.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A good sequel to the first book -- the writer gets more into characters and their relationships.  I'm looking forward to reading the third book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie, Lincoln, was fantastic! It was socially and politically important to the understanding our country's efforts in trying to make real a democracy. It taught what few Americans know- Civil War history- remnants  we are living-out today. The movie was analytical, intelligent, unsentimental, and entertaining.
B001KT6JPA|2.0|it was so-so, not as intense ,and provocative as Silence, but ok. I am glad I didn't pay movie house money to see it , I would have been highly disappointed, lol !
B006YM9JSW|4.0|Nice chip, price is OK, but can always be better especially when you consider price of competition.  Otherwise, after I got my board sorted, its a nice chip.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. There are some interesting concepts in it and the way these are revealed kept me hooked. I can't wait to learn more of what will happen to the silos and the world. Thanks for the book. As with all good si fi books there are a lot of lessons to be learned about our future and where we should head.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was an amazing book. I would recommend this to children who like to read about Greek Gods. I hope you like the book if you read it
B0097HSS4M|5.0|8 gb did not have any thing to crop a picture with so I kept looking .99 worth the effort to let it go! No matter what you hear, I don't make decisions at the drop of a hat, I have to research the subject until I get the right answer!

B0037RDPEG|1.0|Why would you waste time chatting instead of writing a decent book? I understand having depression and I know how it feels to need to express your emotions. However I don't feel you addressed any serious issues with true passion, givng no justice to the substance in your life, nor did you elaborate on the fantastic moments in your life. I have never known a bigger ego than yours and mine is pretty big. There are six chapters in a row where you whinge about not being able to meditate. Try writing something meaningful. That might help. And to the editor. You should be ashamed. How this made it to the silver screen I'll never know. Unless a friend lends you the book- don't waste your money on it.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I love this movie and relived the experience over again by renting it on Amazon...  My son and I watched it together and it was fantastic, as expected.
B003B02O7I|4.0|The book was very difficult to get into.  Hard to keep attention.  I am glad I stuck to reading it because the spirituality was well worth reading.

B0075FM6N2|5.0|George Michael is the man.  It had to be said, and I said it.  His personal life is certainly in shambles due to his issues, but the man can make some music!  I got this album knowing it would be great, and surprise! it was.  You the man, George.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Classic Jimi with a couple of surprises.  I put this cd into my car deck and it hasn't came out since!  I can listen to it over and over again.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I didn't want to like this movie, because I felt I was too cool for it, as well as the books.  When my mom brought up the first book I was like &#34;Pssh, I'm not 12.&#34;  Then I started reading and really all three books were great--the movie was as well. I thought how are they going to make a PG-13 movie about these very violent books.  The atmosphere was perfect for the whole thing.  I am looking forward to the next one.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It's the same old Spider Solitaire game I used to love to play on my computer. It's a fun game if you like card games.
B007JCP8FE|4.0|Very few bands make music like Shinedown now, the basic actual instruments and great vocals pairing.  In a world of terrible manufactured pop music, it's refreshing.  Brent Smith is one of the best vocalists now, if not ever.

B0040JBAMY|5.0|A huge collection of hits from one of the greatest rock bands of all time, will never disappoint.  Fredie Mercury was gone too soon.  If you're reading this I'm sure I don't need to tell you which songs are the good ones.

B0083GQKQG|2.0|Sorry, I do.  Not personally of course.  I don't know her.  The kid that played the son (sorry don't know his name) was very good, terrifyingly good really.  In that role, he shouldn't have been that good.  I won't spoil anything.  It's basically about a kid that kills a bunch of his fellow students.  That's all I will say.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Acting, plot line, pyrotechnics absolutely wonderful for a TV production. The gore fades into the background quickly. Well worth the time & expense.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I never buy movies but this movie to me is so fantasic!!!  Great for the whole family and entertaning .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best TV productions I have ever seen. The acting, plot lines, period associations, historical data are all superb. Maggie Smith at her finest.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to watching it again...probably with my grandson who has seen it many, many times...it's a good animated movie for both children and adults...the hopping eggs were perfect little gifts as well.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|To help empower women everywhere to realize their full potential, Sandberg has opened up about her own career journey and lessons learned along the way. While the book is well-researched, its shining strength is the personal stories and anecdotes from both Sandberg and her friends and colleagues. Many books by high stature men in business share leadership lessons learned but few (really none I can think of)  share stories about having insecurities or feeling the guilt most working mom's experience at one time or another. Sandberg takes a lot of risk in this book with the clear purpose of making it OK to talk about the real issues women face.<br /><br />The focus of this book is on individual women leaders and how they can reach for their aspirations--whatever those aspirations may be. It is not a book about what others can do to help women -- corporate leaders, organization policies, government legislation and how men can help are all mentioned in the book and Sandberg clearly has views on all these topics. However, her focus is squarely on what women can make happen for themselves.<br /><br />Frequently top women leaders are criticized for some aspect of their lives or beliefs and Sandberg has been as well. However, I believe we need a broad diversity of women role model leaders. Some top women don't have kids, others do and still others can afford lots of help.  All are trailblazers from whom we can learn, and Sandberg's book is exceptionally rich in the depth of experience that she shares.
0547884591|5.0|Another awesome book by Tim.  I can't put this one down.  I have read it a few times already.  Order it now!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|the book is so good and so much better than any movie or play, but you got to love it for the music
0767020308|5.0|I've been reading the Jane Austen novels and watching the various film adaptations.  I'd purchased this \\"Emma\\" dvd title several months ago after reading the book, but have since seen the Gwynth Paltrow film and the Romola Garai series.  I also sat through \\"Clueless\\" since it is frequently refered to in discussions of this Austen title.<br /><br />All adaptations mentioned have something to offer my tastes, but this Kate Beckinsale version is most satisfying to me.  I wish it was a longer film to allow a little more completion.  I agree with many that it seems most faithful to the novel in dialog and intent.  Literary criticism of Jane Austen novels often reminds modern readers to remember the always present servant and laboring classes.  Contemporary readers of Jane Austen didn't need to be reminded or to have servant characters explicitly included in the novels.  They would have been as naturally assumed then as we take for granted the presence of electricity or automobiles in stories of the 20th century. This film remembers to include these working class citizens in the lives of the principal characters.  I read the novel and never \\"disliked\\" Emma or Frank Churchill, even though I disagreed with their behavior sometimes.  This adaptation allows Frank to be liked, forgiven, and included in the future family circle(s).<br /><br />I recently purchased/watched a more recent Jane Austen film biography titled \\"Miss Austen Regrets\\", circa 2008, starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen.  I very much recommend that film.  Approximately 12 years earlier she was cast as Jane Fairfax in this adaptation of \\"Emma\\".  Every man has his tastes in beautiful women.  I now stand with fans of Olivia Williams.  On now to google search to learn more about her....
0061730327|5.0|I loved the book and read it straight through over the weekend. One word of advice for physics teachers like myself: the science content is fairly minimal. William doesn't go into quite enough detail (for my taste) on all of his experiments and discoveries that lead up to the construction of his windmill. That said, the book was much more inspiring and moving than I expected. A good tradeoff.
B005FFW46S|4.0|The Discworld novels always entertain, but his whodunits starring Vimes are always the best.  This book represented Pratchett's continued excellence.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I usually don't leave reviews of a book, but this took my breath away, so unexpected every single chapter, it also give me a lesson of life. I'm definitly reading the other books of Colleen Hoover
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Wow... I'm giving this movie 1 Star because the vocals from the lead cast were lacking in the extreme.  Almost 3 hours of Russell Crowe's musical prowess was more than I could stand after the first 30 minutes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game and its a good way to keep busy on a rainy day. I recommend it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I rate this novel 5 Stars. I was pretty sure I knew the ending, but was truely in suspense till the end. I will look for other novels written by SJ Watson
141659521X|4.0|MY HUSBAND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE SELECTION OF THIS BOOK. FOR VINCE FLYNN FANS THIS BOOK IS A MUST BUY.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|This special edition is fabulous.  High, intense quality!  I love the special features -- didn't know that four people, including a mustached man, seamlessly combined to execute the final audition dance.  Can't tell, not even on pause.  I also love the extra CD with six of the movie's songs, especially Flashdance & Maniac.  This special edition blew me away.<br />P.S.  Jennifer Beals, I'd still like to dance with you.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|always kept you wondering what could they possibly happen and will they all be saved??<br />Bringing back Michael on the show and seeing Juliet & Sawyer together and then kates reaction and more importantly Juliets reaction was understood by anyone who's been in that situation before.. Very relatable
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I purchased this badge for a friend's birthday- and he loves it. It's the perfect size, and isn't too heavy, so it can be worn perfectly on a lapel without wrinkling or weighing down the fabric. My friend wears it all the time at work, and he's extremely pleased, as am I.<br /><br />Fantastic product- would definitely recommend as a birthday or holiday gift for any Trekkie.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app is a great addition to my new Kindle Fire HD.  I would highly recommend it, works very well.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|This book was captivating and once you start you can't put it down. The twist at the end was a great end to a great book and I can't wait to see the movie
B008P9M614|5.0|I'm glad I bought the series in this package. Nothing special about it and would have liked if it had more special features like other complete series DVDs. Other than that though its still a great buy.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|All three movies played perfectly on my blue ray player.  The packaging could be better its a little flimsy.  The quality of the movie is excellent.
B003U51D58|5.0|Firwst time I'd ever seen Lost. I watched the entirety of the series on Amazon Season 1 through 6 and enjoyed all of it. It was great; and it was great to watch it on my Kindle

B007CI81IQ|5.0|I started to read this book with curiosity, but after a few pages I realized that it will be a major contribution to my knowledge of real world economics.  Not only the topics are relevant and the text is well written, but the book makes you feel and understand that poverty is a human condition that has to be studied using the best available tools in the social sciences. I enjoyed every page of Poor Economics.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it didn't have that grab you feel - where you can't put it down you just want to keep reading it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|...and the French annoy the hell out of me.  It was a great movie and I laughed throughout most of it.  It doesn't make you cry, but it does make you enjoy your life.  Great flick!!  (even though it's in French--haha!)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can check the weather any time. It also gives you warnings coming up!<br />Very nice page! Penny Thank you!
1579128149|4.0|I have so far just briefly gone through this book, however, i get excited flipping through the pages of the various distinct elements in their unique shapes and forms.  Most of the elements are metals and i wish the book went into further detail of the uses, advantage, and disadvantages of each of the elements and their properties, it is mostly just a coffee table book with nice pictures.  I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of chemistry, but don't expect too much detail about the elements.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I like to play. One card at a time. I don't. Have enough control of the game.Thank you<br />penny that's. It!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book had me laughing and crying in perfect intervals. For anyone who's ever wondered what goes on behind the eyes of a dog, this is probably as good an interpretation as any. Lovely.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|For those of us whose photographic library consists primarily of 35mm slides this little gem is a lifesaver! Working with an art gallery for thirty years, collecting images from artists before the days of email and jpegs and all the magic that reigns now, meant having sheets and sheets of slides and when an article with the purpose of being a retrospective of an artist's career arose, that usually meant either a trip to a photographic studio/business for conversion purposes or (holding the breath) mailing them off to a far distant lab. No longer.<br /><br />Though I haven't used this device for anything other than slide conversion, that aspect of the device alone makes it a solid investment.  Making slides into jpegs now is a snap and the quality of conversion is excellent. Once the slides have been converted to usable computer friendly images that can be easily stored without worrying about damage, there is no reason to clutter the files with sheets and boxes of slides.<br /><br />This little pup is worth its weight in megapixels!  Highly recommended (and I haven't even tried the other applications yet!). Grady Harp, April 13
0425252868|5.0|I read an article recommending this book, and I was interested enough to search for it at my local library.  It seems I was not the only one looking for the book, since there was a waiting list for it.  When my turn came around, I was very pleasantly surprised by the nature and depth of the story.<br /><br />The first interesting turn is that so much of the story revolves around the German pilot involved, Franz Stigler.  Who he was, his background, how he came to encounter the battered American B-17 over the skies of war-torn Germany.  The American pilot's story is a great counterpoint to that of the German ace, and the intensity and drama of the intersection of their lives is fascinating.<br />Beneath the action of the story lies a fascinating context of war, honor, and misguided leadership.<br /><br />I thought so much of this book that after I returned the borrowed copy to the library, I bought three copies from Amazon.  One copy is to keep and read again down the road, and the other two are gifts for people who I am sure will enjoy the story.  I consider that in itself to be high praise, indeed.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|This was a great download. Very interesting game, kind of like temple run but it's still fun and different in its own way.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I like using this app helps when i need to take notes or put together a quick presentation. Really has good accessibility.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great it is similar to temple run but is simpler than the other game and has more characters that are way better the reason that I like this game more it is more addictive
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Haha this never gets old I do like the way this looks on my Kindle Fire, the kids love it!
B000B5XOSO|4.0|A must see for those interested in the Batman cartoons and movies. Michael Keaton shows a serious side as Batman and the fight scenes are memorable. I felt bad for the penguin though. He was not a good character, but his situation was handed to him at birth. Unloved he did not show love.
B00005AWMF|5.0|This Cd is epic. It is brilliant. Takes you on smooth sailing musical journey of love passion loss and life. This is actually my favorite best of compilation by Sade. This is all time favorite band. I have actually bought many copies of this, one for the car digital version and others from when I've moved about and lost it. I will continue to buy as needed over and over again.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|After seeing the Dark Knight movies made afterwards, it makes this movie seem cheesy; but there are good and funny parts the other movies do not have.
B001ET0826|5.0|Classic Prince! I enjoyed this CD! What can I say, you can not go wrong with Prince. He needs to put out a new CD!!
B000B5XOXY|4.0|I liked how they blended the characters and storyline together. Some of the special effects were a little cheesy, but it was good fun and more colorful than most Batman movies..
B008ALAHA4|4.0|order more than one, because one will go missing. I already lost one of the two i bought, so take my advice and buy extra. they aren't that expensive.
0060090367|3.0|I can't believe I'm only giving 3 stars to a novel by Marian Keyes. If you've never read anything else by this author, please don't judge her based solely on this book, which I understand to be her first.<br />In Watermelon, the pace is off (very little happens for the first ten chapters) and there were several places where Keyes seemed to take two paragraphs to make a point which could have been contained in one. And for me, the errant husband is also just a little too awful to be credible.<br />All that said, Keyes' writing voice is catchy, engaging, and the wit is as sharp as a needle. I loved her other work, admire her greatly, and will continue to be a loud supporter.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very fun!  If you like farming games and games where you take care of....really anything you'll love this game.....<br />Are you bored? Buy this game and have fun!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|App is very slow to bring up and it up dates slowly.  I have it on my phone and Kindle but not really into it since it is very slow.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Liked it and Jessica Chastain rocked! Story line was intricate and well written. All the characters seemed very real to life.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|There are so many things I love about this season and the ninth Doctor. He was, and still is, my favorite Doctor. I love the dynamic between he and Rose. There are so many great episodes in this season, it's hard to think it all happened in one season. The End of the World, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, and of course Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways are all wonderful. Each episode is beautifully thought out and brought me to tears. If you're a noob to Doctor Who, this is the season to start with.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor & Park, with its light-peachy, minimalist cover, drew me in from the first glance. I find the minimalist in me loves when book covers are clean-cut yet beautiful. With the backs of the two characters whose lives are captured inside this book looking out on the reader, it's hard not to love the gorgeous cover. The title as well. I could go on forever about the cover and every little detail on it but I rather this review not be the size of the novel itself.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is fashioned like a coming-of-age tale. Both of the main protagonists find out who they are as humans and also how they love along the way. Coming-of-age tales mainly focus on growing up and the way it changes the characters. In a way it's true for Eleanor & Park, but we find Eleanor much too grown-up for her young age. You see, Eleanor finds herself with an abusive stepfather, a seemingly-ignorant mother, and a new town. Cussing, drinking, drugs, and abusing his wife, is Eleanor's stepdad's favorite pass time. I've seen situations like this many times in reality so it's no far stretch of the imagination for me. It makes me so very angry to see Eleanor's home life and how it's mostly her coward of a mother's fault.<br /><br />The '80s is a marvelous backdrop to this beautifully written story. It makes me wish I'd actually seen the decade. There was one scene about Park dressing up as The Doctor on Halloween which--after I read that--I started hyperventilating. I am a huge Doctor Who fan so thank you for that, Rainbow.<br /><br />The story takes off as the two main protagonists meet and Eleanor eventually finds a new friend in Park when the new school she's attending starts. Park is different from any other young adult novel's male character. He's actually real, interesting, charming, and has actually dislikes and likes. Male characters are often arrogant and quite annoying. Park was a nice change of pace in the YA world.<br /><br />This novel isn't an insta-love story, not in the slightest. Park just wants to stay out of trouble, stay away from the bullies, and Eleanor is trouble. But when Park finds a way to let Eleanor in--and vice-versa--everything changes for the both of them.<br /><br />I definitely adored this novel. There was a lot of heavy cussing at some moments, but I was able to look past it as the plot of the book stole me away to the '80s. It showed me that love can be found even in most unlikely of people. Eleanor & Park is a classic novel and deserves to be noted as so. xx
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very unique, lots of action, and really bad badguys.Kevin Bacon is stellar, as are James Purefoy and Shawn Ashmore. If you haven't been watching it, what are you waiting for?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />Characters are complex.  Story is compelling.  Costumes are gorgeous.  Every episodes leaves you wanting more.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|A couple of listens, and I can't say enough good about Delta Machine.  I was a big fan of the Violator/SOFAD/Ultra arc they had going, and everything from Exciter on just was nice background music...but nothing that made you want to stomp your feet or hang on, waiting with anticipation for the next beep, boop, twitter or lyrical growl/groan.<br /><br />This, however, is different. It might be the opening strains of \\"Goodbye,\\" which sound like something off of SOFAD. It could be the fact that Gahan sounds like he's interested in what he's singing again. It could be the delightfully cryptic lyrics of \\"The Child Inside\\" - which screams \\"The Love Thieves\\". It might be that \\"Welcome to my World\\" has that same universal arms-open thing that \\"I Feel You\\" and \\"World in my Eyes\\" does.  Even \\"Broken\\" seems like it could have been a \\"Black Celebration\\" blast back in the day.<br /><br />DM's best albums always seem to have a middle-song test. A song that truly grabs the listener and ties it all together - and to me, that's what seems to make or break a DM album. \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" was one. \\"Get Right With Me\\" forced you to come along for the second half of SOFAD. The \\"It's No Good\\"/\\"Useless\\" combo in Ultra. Three different styles - dancefloor rhythms, slow and gospel, 90's blues/alternative rock.<br /><br />And they do it again with \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve\\" and \\"Should be Higher\\" - two songs that could totally have come from any of those three albums.<br /><br />I'm sure there will be criticism that the band hasn't \\"evolved\\" - but if evolving meant bland dreck like \\"Exciter\\", I'm more than happy to watch DM just keep reinventing the 90's...and providing great, deep, moody grooves.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This is good in the respect that it gets you used to looking for Slender Man. Not great because it's almost predictable.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daugher loves barbies and this is great!  She loves playing with it unzipped and it is great storage for her barbies.  It is bigger than a normal cube storage container, holds lots of items!!  She recieved a barbie bed and her barbie horse fits in here with no problem.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very insightful, well done and entertaining!  Of course you can not accept any Hollywood movie to be factual but the interpretation of Mary Lincoln managed to make her a &#34;real&#34; individual that you could feel for.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is wonderful, you can play multiple sounds at the same time and control their individual volumes. My only issue with this app is that there is a limited number of sounds. Personally, I would love it if they had crickets and owl noises, like a nighttime outdoors mix of some sort but that may just be my personal preference.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Its about as simple as a pocket calculator but for .99c its free of weaknesses! I would definitely recommend it! Another nice app is Fraction plus. Check it out!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not enjoy this book because the first half read like I was rereading the headlines from the Lacy Peterson murder from California a few years ago.  The second half provided a twist, but at that point I disliked all of the characters and felt like I had wasted my time.

B000BDLJBU|5.0|Rather than throw away yet another pair of headphones due to a damaged plug, I decided to try my hand at replacement.  I have minor soldering and wiring experience.  The plug is well designed, and I was able to replace without much trouble.  The repair has lasted over 2 months now, and has even survived a few very hard tugs.  I recommend this product.

B00BFTV09K|5.0|Do you know anyone who can put down a family pack of crisps before the pack is empty ???<br /><br />This is fascinating stuff, Michael Moss addresses the issue of obesity from a processed food industry perspective - &#34;The Heavy Users&#34; in Coke Cola terminology and highlights how the drive for profit has radically changed the composition of many products. The depth of research is excellent and the technical data is presented in a very readable style which makes the book a pleasure to read. Particularly interesting are the insights culled from interviews with ex-senior executives across a wide spectrum of companies on a &#34;What we did at work and what we now do as retirees&#34;. Also the &#34;dirty tricks&#34; - infiltration of the home cooking movement and funding of similar organisations to counter any public hostility.<br /><br />To be fair to the companies Moss also addresses the lifestyle changes that took place from the 60s onwards which undoubtedly has had a significant impact on the convenience element in food shopping and the influence of the military as they sought to feed the troops with palatable rations but that is not the major thrust of his thesis.<br /><br />On the downside Moss does tend to repeat many of his conclusions and comments as he moves through Sugar , Salt and Fat  ( the order of the book  is not the same as the title ) which to a certain extent is unavoidable as the conclusion is the same - whatever the research scientists employed by the major food companies do to alter the taste of the food the companies produce has a common objective - sell more .<br /><br />As a result of the book I have become an obsessed reader of food product labels .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is my favorite Temple Run.  I just can't seem to get to 10,000,000 points!  I keep dying at 8 million.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was half through the book, when my friend insisted on watching the first season. Needless to say we watched all episodes very fast and I was unable to catch up. I finished the book afterwards. Still a good read.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|if you have read the book, the movie is disappointing as they had to leave out a lot of items in the book that would have explained actions done in the movie. on its own, the movie would be a 7
B005SAV9SO|1.0|I wonder if Cameron Diaz lost a bet. Because this is flat-out horrible. Speaking of flat, her big agenda is getting implants. Because she has no other way to get a man, in this case, Justin Timberlake. And talk about a bi**h.<br /><br />Horrid. And I'm fairly open-minded. But this film, it just has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Wow.
B002PLALCO|5.0|I'd recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the versatility of P!nk's talent and music.  She does a range of songs.  Shows amazing energy that keeps the concert going-and-going-and-going.  Love the &#34;extra's&#34; on the DVD as well.  Grab your &#34;P!nk-loving&#34; fans and Cosmos and party like a rockstar in the comfort of your own home.
B007PS0DTI|2.0|Bad lighting as a way to cover up sub-par effects. Darkness, blinking lights and desaturation galore.<br /><br />Didn't work...they were just cheesy effects with bad lighting. Not too long after the beginning, I started getting really annoyed by it!<br /><br />Oh and the movie (storyline especially) is awful too. Just loaded with gore and unnecessary scenes.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|DM is one of DM's best albums.  I've been a devoted fan since the first time I heard People are People in 1984 when I was 10-years-old.  I can remember being the only kid in my neighborhood that had DM records, let alone even knew who they were.  I've seen DM evolve throughout the years.  I recall hearing BC for the first time with awe.  Then, DM just nailed it with MFTM.  In my humble opinion though, DM reached the pinnacle of its greatest creativity and artistry with its release of Violator.  But, being a devoted fan, I've grown to love every album thereafter.  And, each album had its own special gem.  For example, I think songs like Home, Goodnight Lovers, Judas, Suffer Well, and Come Back are nothing short of masterpieces.<br /><br />Delta Machine, however, is different than any of DM's post-Violator albums.  I'm still in the early stage of learning the songs but, I loved each song from the first listen.  While other post-Violator albums took me a little while to truly appreciate, I fell in love with this album right away.<br /><br />One of the surprising songs is \\"Broken.\\"  It was written by Gahan and is truly a great song.  It features Gahan's deep voice reminiscent to Little 15.  Another one of my personal favorites is \\"Should be Higher\\" because they retained their classic DM sound without making the song sound outdated.  And, the harmonizing--at \\"end up dust\\" and \\"guide the herd\\"--by Martin in \\"Heaven\\" is pure genius.  Those high points remind me of Martin's \\"rather be home\\" note in Question of Lust.  \\"Alone\\" is another one of my favorites.  There is really no one that can write a song like Martin.  While the themes in Delta Machine--i.e., sin, blasphemy, religion, seduction, love, lust, loss, and sorrow--are abundant in DM's prior albums, DM, with the help of Hillier, did a great job of delivering these emotions without making the music weak or boring.  In fact, the opening bass in the first song of the CD--Welcome to My World--sets the tone of this album.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm still learning the songs but I haven't felt this way about a DM album since I was in junior high and high school.  For any true DM fan, this album is a must-have.  For even moderate fans, I think you would enjoy this one.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this as it centers around teen drama, but it is so funny! Appropriate for kids, not so much, but it made me laugh out loud.  If you survived high school, you'll like this!
B006Z9SP3E|2.0|Caine and Abel this most certainly is not . This is a very weak story dragged out over two boring<br />&#34; chronicles&#34;
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great characters and cinematography! I love this show!! I am looking forward to the rest of the season.  If you like historical fiction - you will like Vikings! It's like SOA, but with boats,swords and horses instead of Harleys!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love it!!!!!!!! Best ever I would kill myself so everyone on Earth could play this! It's my new favorite game and I have never played Minecraft on the computer or Xbox! But I did watch sone videos of people playing Minecraft on the computer and.. Well I think Pocket Edition should get some more with it! You should be able to collect water and lava, play multiplier but with people everywhere, have switches, more monsters and the Nether! Mabey make the world bigger too because I could walk all around it in 1 day! I can't get MC on my computer so I hope this version can be improved!!!<br />&lt;3 IvySnow
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have many of Josh Groban's CD's and love each and every one but this one is TOP NOTCH. I would recomend this to everyone.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Might just be the best western of all time.Robert Duvall, and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent, as is the supporting cast of Robert Urich, Danny Glover, and so many more. Surely a classic. The characters leave you feeling as if you knew them, and wished you could have been there.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This game is awesome and highly addictive. Great graphics and its hard to put down.  Please add more levels soon!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|This movie is soso good,i like this type of movie so much. i watched it 3 times. now i am just waiting the next. ...:)
B0007KS7D0|4.0|Love this lens, makes any lens into a macro, but you need a tripod/monopod or very steady hands. Easy to use.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The only saving grace of the movie is some of the CGI were excellent.  Otherwise, it was surprising poor in visual quality, especially for an HD movie.  Also, it was three hours long, but didn't even complete the plot of the book.  Disappointing rental.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This is a no nonsense action movie. No plot, no problem! It has a little romance but what action movie doesn't.
B001HVZO9S|3.0|Good movie to watch to pass the time. I bought it because it was only $5. Good deal take advantage of.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love movies in 3d they are just the bomb and when I heard that the Hobbit was coming out with a 3D version I immediately pre-ordered it. This movie takes place before the Lord of the Rings series of movies began the story line is pretty accurate to the book, but they added to it a little bit more and what they added to it was pretty good. It's the main story line that is the most interesting. It's actually pretty complicated. But the main thing is Smogg the dragon looks pretty wild. Can't wait to see the next one and add another 3d to my ever growing collection.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|This album is some kind of laboratory experiment gone awry. The songs are inferiors--test tube aberrations. They are not just uninteresting--with only a few exceptions, they are as offensive as the cover photo.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great simple app! Very easy to use and I love the voice telling me how much battery is left! Well done!
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Really nice watch. It looks even much better than the picture. and its worth the price. i don't why I spent much more on other watches I would easily compare this with my Ebel discovery 1911. And I think that this is even better. Same quality with no issues my Ebel screws sometimes get loose.
B0098460O4|5.0|When have such young people ever had such control, accuracy, and talent at this age?  Musically perfect and always in tune, unlike many tenors who sing sharp or flat or fluctuate so much in their vibrato that you can't find the note at all.  Charlotte is spot on the notes and their blend and matched vibrati are marvelous.  Thank you, thank you for the chills and the tears.  There is not a bad track on this CD and I look forward to many, many more CD's to be released in future.

1400067820|4.0|It's a very enjoyable book.  Actually, I worry about it being *too* enjoyable.  It's a bit<br />to tempting to make consequential decisions based on Taleb's entertaining stories.<br /><br />There are lots of individual pieces of advice in this book.  I'll leave it to you to<br />decide whether reading through the stories and explanations that surround these pieces of<br />wisdom is enjoyable or tedious.  Taleb is a serious raconteur; perhaps it's his heritage.<br />If you decide that you do not need *all* of the stories and details and explanations, then<br />you may want to start with reading just the glossary and with looking up a few of those<br />term in the index.<br /><br />Much of the book is spent giving elaborate justifications for conventional wisdom, things<br />like: \\"Don't put all you eggs in one basket.\\" and \\"Do no harm\\".<br /><br />And, some of the book is merely advice that a well-intentioned grandfather or great uncle<br />would give.  It's of the \\"save for a rainy day\\" and \\"learn to enjoy life while you can\\".<br />One recommendation that I found interesting was to earn money in large chunks and in<br />bursts so that you can spend the rest of your time (weeks, months, or years, I suppose)<br />doing what you really want to do.  That's useful advice for some of us in some professions<br />I suppose.  It likely fits a successful researcher and writer like Taleb reasonably well.<br />But maybe it does not work so well for the rest of us.<br /><br />Come to think of it, most of Taleb's advice does seem quite situation specific: it's<br />applicable in some situations, but might be disastrous if applied in others.<br /><br />Taleb has a great love for the natural, for things that have evolved, and for what has<br />\\"stood the test of time\\".  But, evolution and natural selection is a very complex thing.<br />It does not develop perfect solutions or even ideal solutions; it develops what survives.<br />And, even those species survive in a particular set of conditions.  So, as with any other<br />technology, you need to evaluate each technology, innovation, consumer product, medical<br />procedure, or whatever individually and on its own merits and characteristics.<br /><br />Still, we can argue that technologies, products, and processes that have been in use for<br />longer periods of time are more likely to have had bugs removed and improvements made.<br />But, on the other hand, a newer innovation may offer features and conveniences that are<br />not available on older ones.<br /><br />So, I'd suggest that when you read \\"Antifragile\\", you also read [[ASIN:0199832617 The Shock of the Old: Technology and Global History since 1900]]. It also shows a preference for older, tried and true technologies.  But,<br />his way of arguing for those technologies is to show how well they've worked, rather than<br />to argue that some newer technology might blow up in your face, as Taleb sometimes does.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is with [[ASIN:038798738X how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality]].<br />Per Bak is concerned with \\"self organizing criticality\\", by which he means (I believe) a system that<br />is due for breakdown and for sequences of destructive events.  Taleb spends quite a bit of<br />time on systems that have been supported and kept in place until they become \\"critical\\" or<br />in Taleb's words, \\"fragile\\".  When Taleb is talking about long tails and fat tails etc.,<br />he is often talking about a system that has built up a critical state, that is, one which<br />has entered a regime during which breakdown and series of events become chaotic and<br />unpredictable.  Both Per Bak and Taleb are helping us understand systems in which there is<br />stress and in which sequences of events are random.<br /><br />Taleb's advice is to stay with systems that are stable (although he does not say how to<br />identify them) and to only take risks with unstable systems when the possible downside is<br />small and the possible upside is large.<br /><br />Certainly it is worthwhile to spend time thinking about identifying which systems are<br />stable (and which not) and about determining which systems degrade or change gracefully<br />(and which do not).<br /><br />A lot has been said about nostalgia for the past and for what is natural (as opposed to<br />modern or post modern?).  And, you have to select your<br /><br />Taleb is a raconteur, and that means that he is susceptible to what he calls the narrative<br />fallacy.  What grabs him is that which has an entertaining story that can be used to<br />explain it.<br /><br />There is lots of theory in this book.  See especially Appendix II.<br /><br />I had fun thinking about how some of Taleb's advice could be applied to my life and about<br />how my life might be different if I took some of what Taleb said seriously.  Would I put<br />most of my savings in something safe like an insured interest bearing bank account, but go<br />long gold futures with a small amount?  Would I try to insure everything I own?  These are<br />interesting thoughts.  They make for the starting points of some fascinating dreams.  But,<br />I'm not confident enough in Taleb's advice to make any serious changes to the way I live.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Don't normally buy soundtracks, but this movie sounded so awesome I had to buy this.  Hadn't heard of Daft Punk before but oh man, this soundtrack is awesome.  It is a black cd like Playstation 1 cd-roms but plays perfectly in my player and laptop drive.  Just an awesome album to experience.  Emotions conveyed merely by sound.
B008602KQI|3.0|i wouldnt buy it, but the movie got better as it progressed. the movie seemed like it would have been better with a more detailed director.

B008Q08T54|1.0|I have 12 MbS download and streaming was very bad. Had to wait too many times do I stopped watching it.
B006S009IY|5.0|I often wonder where I would stand on the debate of the use of imagination.  Like so many things it is a gift that can be misused.  However, this movie gives me hope that our imagination put to good use shows that we are made in the image of our Creator.  How interesting to imagine what James Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan might have been like.  Johnny Depp played him well.  Children of all ages need the whimsical joy and fun such stories can bring into their lives.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This has been one of the BEST stories that I've read in a long, long time. I enjoyed the way Elizabeth Haynes takes you from the past to the present without leaving you confused. It was difficult putting the book down b/c the story drew you in to the point where you needed to know what was going to happen next. Elizabeth provided a plot that held your interest. I WILL definitely be reading more of Elizabeth Haynes novels. This book is sooooo worth reading!!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I thought she was a good wife, but with all the secrets and lies to her husband and specially her children, she is just another self serving woman . She starts good then turns bad, bad, bad.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I love Michael Connelly but this took so long to get going the payoff at the end wasn't worth it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a great book for both women and men to read and relate to, and especially for women in their teens and twenties with lots of time to make decisions about their lives and career paths.  Everyone has different decisions to make, but this book makes you think about whether your pre-conceived notions about work and family have to be true.
B005SGXW9C|5.0|I have every season.  I watch them often...seriously one of the best on T.V. these days. Entertaining and every so often you learn something!  If you like geek and funny you will like this show.  Well written and the characters are hilarious and you grow to like them all.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|full of action, passion, kindness, and reverence. Giving this moving 5 plus stars for the excellent acting, directing and production that went into its making
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|For an award-winning film, I was a little skeptical about seeing this film. For one, I'm getting tired of movies based on books, are we becoming that illiterate and unoriginal? For another, I'd already seen a lot of movies dealing with the Segregation era of the 50's and 60's. It was only after hearing a good friend recommend it and seeing it on sale at Wal-Mart that I figured I'd try, awards or not. Turned out to be up my alley.<br />The heroine in this is my kind of protagonist, one willing to go out on a controversially risky limb to help others out, even at numerous costs. And costs really were numerous. Skeeter, a young woman who's in her early 20's and still single (causing her mother to worry if she's a lesbian) has a new job at a local newspaper, writing a column on housekeeping. While doing that, she's working on another project, a book from the point-of-view of black maids and what all they go through. Well, since it's set in one of the darkest times in modern American history, things do not always go well. A lot of times, white women won't refer to their maids as human beings or women, but as \\"negro\\"es, though a couple times in the film, they're called the more explicit version. Once with indifference to how they would feel, and the other time with anger.<br />Skeeter, knowing the risks of what she's writing, takes all the risks necessary to show the blight, and her editor says some things need to get provoked anyway (I definitely agree). But while Skeeter is focused on showing the blight, a friend is more focused on a  rather ridiculous thought- making separate bathrooms for their black maids, claiming they have certain diseases that are not localized in America (I wonder if that's a nod to the miniseries \\"Roots\\"?), which was frequently frustrating. Well, her obsession with separate bathrooms backfires on her in more than one comical way (in one instance, a \\"Yard of the Month\\" becomes my comical scene of the night). And she doesn't only have one problem, a maid she fired shows an apology, but just like the overt racism has teeth, so does the maid's attitude, and man does it become a truly comical storytelling device through the rest of the film. I'm not sure if I'll want chocolate pie after this movie!<br />There are many moments where the humor is not only knee-slapping, but also cheer-on worthy. Then again, there are moments that are deeply moving, nearly getting me to cry (I probably didn't have enough to drink for tears), so it became an appropriately-timed emotional roller coaster. Some people were completely likable, even if not 100% believable. Others were downright nasty (including one who warns that there are racists in \\"this town,\\" yet fails to recognize her own hypocrisy in the statement, but does evil really ever see itself when it talks about itself?), and had me glad I wasn't a kid during then.<br />If anything, the only real problem I had with this movie was, occasionally, it would switch back and forth from when Skeeter was a little girl to a young woman with no indication it switched times, so I had to learn at those random times what Skeeter looked like as a little girl.<br />Her past, each of the maidens' pasts, the racial blight of then, and the numerous story layers and twists and turns helped create a movie that not only got my attention in the long run, but also helped me see why this film got the awards it did.<br />Why isn't there more thought-provoking movies like this out there? Maybe we're too afraid to see where we came from so we don't repeat history?<br />Regardless, I truly did love this movie!a maid she fired shows an apology, but just like the overt racism has teeth, so does the maid's attitude, and man does it become a truly comical storytelling device through the rest of the film.

B003XUKVXK|5.0|Some pretty impressive blues musicans accompanying KWS on this live cd. You can't get any better back up performers than Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin (sadly both have passed since ) or even Lazy Lester. A hot performance from KWS with stand outs cuts such as &#34;HOW MANTY MORE YEARS&#34;, &#34;ROCKING DADDY&#34; and &#34;BLUE ON BLACK&#34;. a MUST HAVE FOR ALL BLUES FANS.

B003OBJV5W|2.0|We watched this based upon the iMDB rankings available on Amazon and this &#34;movie&#34; was ranked something like tenth greatest of all time. Higher than African Queen.  But it is just a reunion rehash. If you are a BeeGees-ophile go for it, but don't be fooled into thinking this is something special.
1455502758|5.0|The most honest and brave encounter about mortality and disease that I have ever encountered. The realization..  \\"I don't have a body.... I AM a body\\" hasn't left me for a moment since I read this book a week ago. This is a universal experience, for even those of us that will succumb to something other than disease will likely watch someone we love go through a similar experience at some point in our lives. The ability to see the world of the well from the vantage point in \\"Tumortown\\" that Mr Hitchen's shared with us is something that can only well serve all involved. The removal of all fantastical supernatural perspectives that so often plague terminally ill patients and those around them allowed for such a fresh and human feel to the account. Just buy this, and grow.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved this book and would have given it more stars except for the ending. I felt like the author didn't quite know where to go when wrapping things up.  Kind of how Stephen King books often rambled or failed in the end too...the ending of this book felt hurried and quick \\"I've got to END this book but I'm not sure where to go!\\" It is a good read if you don't expect too much in its finality.
075669812X|5.0|Bought this as a christmas gift for my son so that he can have the Green ninja (Lloyd).  He was so excited he ripped the plastic clear case out of the book.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really like movies of all kind, comedy, drama, adventure.  This one is very different, visually beautiful, interesting costumes and a very sad premise to the story of humankind, I wish I would have read the book first, but I think I will still do that anyway.  Unique and enjoyable.

B00BI73CVI|3.0|If they cut out the music and made it a movie rather than musical then I would give this 5 stars for acting but by keeping it an opera with the entire script sung as on broadway, then there needed to be a focus on singing quality which there obviously wasn't which made some scenes pretty bad but because I love Les Mis and the music no matter who is singing it, I still give it 3 stars.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Didn't expect it to be anything special - not really plugged into the movie industry PR since we pulled the plug on our satellite TV service a while back and stopped watching commercials. Gave this movie a chance and really, really liked it. I still like all the Bond movies but this one is hands down my favorite. Other favorites are the early Connery Bond movies. The movie was full of creative twists and turns. Good meeting of the old and the new. Anxious to see the next one.

B004ZNAXX2|3.0|This music needs no review.  What does need a review is the executive who thought it acceptable to release another Pink Floyd Immersion set without including a high resolution bluray or SACD of this masterful title.  What in the Hell were they thinking?  They want $100+ for a scarf, some demos, and yet another CD resolution remaster of the same material!  Thanks but no thanks.  I own both DSOTM and WYWH Immersion sets and SACDs.  They're both fantastic.  Hats off to Guthrie.  Ok, maybe Guthrie could have used some input from Parsons on DSOTM but the band made their decision and the sound quality is excellent.  I'd have given this set one star for its incredibly poor value but I gave it three since the music really is five stars.  Had they included a high resolution disc, even if only in stereo instead of 5.1, I'd have paid the $120 just like I did for the first two sets.  This is simply unacceptable even to this Floyd diehard.

B00AHTYI5M|3.0|One commentator worth \\"It is equally clear that a number of events were fictionalized in order to advance the drama in the movie\\".  To me it is equally clear that a number of events were fictionalized in order to credit the Americans with a result they did not achieve.  A generation of Americans will grow up thinking that this was the truth rather than the result of the bravery of its Canadian friends and allies.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I stumbled across this series by chance and was hooked within the first few minutes. The Industrial Revolution and its effect on people of all classes is shown with an uncanny realism that really brings the message home, how unprepared society as a whole was for the changes that machines brought to production of goods. So yes, there is plenty of (impeded) romance in this series and Brendan Coyle is starring as well, but what impressed me the most was the realistic depiction of early industrial England. But not just the Industrial Revolution is realistically shown. The series also paints a clear picture of societal differences.  London Society is shown as blissfully unaware of how goods are manufactured and what it entails. By contrast, the Northern industrial class of manufacturers and workers has to deal with the burgeoning union movement and the overall modernization of their environment.<br /><br />The actors do outstanding jobs in their respective parts. Brendan Coyle, while not playing a butler, but a simple worker, shows traits that fans of Downton Abbey will easily recognize in Mr. Bates. Richard Armitage plays the repressed, but also proud mill owner John Thornton. While Sinead Cusack does an outstanding job of portraying the mother of the mill owner John Thorton; portraying her as caring, but also hard. The major character, young Margaret Hale is portrayed by Daniela Denby-Ashe and we see how she comes into her own and grows up through the four parts of the series.<br /><br />I can only highly recommend that people watch this series. If I could, I would make this a mandatory viewing about the Industrial Revolution and the societal changes it brought about.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This is an incredibly fascinating read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is innately curious about how the world got to be how it is. One of the major questions I have had was fairly clearly answered by Jared Diamond's throughout the course of the book, \\"Why is it that Eurasian culture has flourished and taken over the world when intelligence and skill is not uniquely Eurasian?\\" If you've ever asked yourself a similar question, you are in for a good read.<br /><br />The book itself had it's peaks a valleys. We read this as a book club, and a friend sent out a note asking if anyone else was struggling to trudge through the initial chapters, and I can't say I really disagreed. A little later on it picks up, but not ever chapter will entice every reader. The discussions on politics and how central government arose were fascinating to me, but the discussion on domesticating crops was a snooze. In Diamond's defense, he worked to paint the whole picture - the reaction of the reader from one chapter to another speaks more to individual interests.<br /><br />Diamond is writing about his life's work, and he is certainly thorough in making his case and answering his critics. The topics for discussion are endless, and I would recommend this to any book club looking for something truly intellectual.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is the first Zac Brown Band cd I have ever bought and I love it.  It is playing all the time.
B00BEJ5O6Q|1.0|Based on a true story dispite the fact that it sounds, looks and reads like every other pile of garbage he's done.  The songs even have the same lyrics and exact same music as his previous stuff like he simply took the same songs possibly written for him anyway and added new sappy pre-school lyrics to them, turned on his auto tune and recorded a new bomb.  Pass on this it's complete rubbish.  It's talentless trash like this that ruined country music.

B000001GQJ|4.0|Despite its reliance on transcendant virtuosity, Liszt's Sonata is a serious work of art. Thank heavens the days are past, when a pianist could ride on it as circus stunt!<br />I know that many collectors worship Horowitz and Cziffra, who were probably the last representatives within living memory of this mannerist era, but their recordings are testimonies also to a kind of self-indulgence that did not shrink from pulling the music our of shape to suit themselves.<br />No such worries need afflict any lover of sheer bravura who is curious about Argerich's recording. She is a child of modernity and respects the score with the utmost fidelity. When we think of other moderns who have impressed us with such an approach, like Gilels, we have a basis for sound comparisons. The latter's Liszt was among the clutch of first recordings in the West; and this album by Argerich was also her debut recording after winning a contrtact with DG.<br />In many respect, the album is in a class of its own. This young lady must have been born as a lion tamer. This is superlative pianism of truly Lisztian magnitude, yet without the garish embarrassments dished up by the likes of Horowitz and Czffra. She is \\"serious\\", indeed \\"musical\\", but not at the expense of breathtakingly fast flashing fingers. Not inclined to let fastidiousness stand in her way, as Brendel or Curzon in her own immediate surroundings, her passion for virtuosity rules. As a result you get the best of both world - the stupendous bravura and the serious sculpting of musical architecture. Quite a stunning experience for someone who maybe hasn't heard her before.<br />The Ravel and Brahms numbers may possibly invite some reservations, because she tends to let fly at times beyond the more rigorously classical demands of those work; and the Chopin Scherzo is taken at an uncommonly fast presto speed - but this time a required by the score!<br />In sum: This is not an album where you must take the bad with the good. It is all good; brilliant from beginning to end. But with so much brilliance on one disc you are advised to pause for breath between tracks for longer than the 4 seconds allowed by the engineer. It is quite overwhelming!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Probably the most thought out game I have played.  From the opening screen to the actions of the dog (from the stash).  While not a complicated game it is challenging.  What I really like about a phone game is. Its short duration.  I can play several or just one pending on my time.
B000001GJU|4.0|Compared to his three earlier reading (DG once and EMI twice), this recording exhibits under its surface glamour a somewhat gelatinous heaviness. It is slower than before, and the orchestra sounds too corpulent and well-fed to cope with the agility demanded by this music. Moreover Karajan no longer has the vibrant rhythmic bounce at this command that made all three of his earlier version such memorable accounts of the symphony. Now his main concern is with beauty, a luscious instrumental sound from all sections of the orchestra.<br />It is not an inferior version, by any means, and technically it cannot be faulted. But it lacks freshness, the Bohemians joie de vivre that we associate with and love so much in Dvorak. Ditto for the Smetana tone poem. Listening the Villager's Dance reveals at once how staid Karajan has become.<br />A critic wrote of his earlier DG recording that it \\"Sings from beginning to end\\". Precisely what you will miss in this recording.
B003DXSXCI|3.0|I only watched it because my dad said it was one of the best movies he had seen. He claimed the car chase in it was the best in movies ever. I didn't find it all that great. Substandard story to it, in my mind a weak car chase. At the end I found myself asking \\"What did I just watch??\\"  Just wasn't all that pleased with it. It was a little boring to me.
B00000IWVS|3.0|The producer (Ruvi Grub, Walter Legge's successor) wrote a chapter on the recording sessions in his autobiography - chatty and utterly superficial, but calculated to prejudice the reader in favour of this recording over the other, made by \\"the other company\\". An obvious reference to DG, who recorded Argerich in the two Chopin Sonatas, as far memory serves me, within the same year. The upshot of Grub's argument was that the plentiful supply of black coffee was responsible for turning this issue into a classic. I wonder how anyone can lend this supposition any credence. But EMI followed the hint and put the \\"Classic\\" smack bang across the front picture.<br />Neither you nor I should be concerned with gossipy commentators. The only question to be considered here is whether this issue is especially good or not - i.e. so good as to qualify for top billing over her other recording of some of the same music.<br />My conclusion on since over the 30 years I've owned and samples this disc is negative. I find her duplications on DG the preferable incarnations, moreover they are much better recorded. This indeed is the principal issue I have with this EMI product. The piano has been placed in an over-resonant acoustic, which is unpleasant especially on repeated listening. The outcome is that climaxes are blurred and fast fingerwork frequently obscured.<br />The performance of the Sonata 3 itself is not noticeably different, nor the other pieces which she recorded again. As a testimony of Argerich artistry, this takes its place firmly below the issues of the \\"other company\\".<br />This is not to deny that owners will get a lot of pleasure from the disc. Only that such a hifalutin claim as \\"the 1965 classic\\", which is aiming at the stars, does not reflect anything other than propaganda and seeks to pre-empt the judgement of the listener before any comparisons are made. But I am aware that legends die very slowly, and so this album will undoubtedly enjoy an enduring audience for along time yet to come. But objectively, you would fare better with Argerich on DG.

630469654X|5.0|This was required viewing for an English class. I fell in love with it. Ordered it. And now I watch it pretty often. The story is awesome, the shape-shifting angle is wonderfully played, the jokes are timely, and the 80s background music/lighting/acting gives it such a nice aged quality that is a bit refreshing when compared to the modern movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|plot was certainly unusual, but the action and intrigue keep the pages turning. Found it good that the heroine was still bothered by her &#34;kills&#34;.
0525423656|5.0|Oh I loved this middle book of the trilogy. It's themes of love and rebellion are a classic example of those teenage yearnings on a grand scale. It is a great sequel for Matched and lays the groundwork for Reached with precision. I like to listen to the discography of Hammock while I read because the music helps me to imagine the picturesque landscapes so beautifully described in this book.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|I haven`t read a novel for pleasure in a while and I`m so glad this was my choice.  It has all the elements of a great, casual read, including a dashing but damaged hero, a whimsical and likeable heroine, the occasional exotic locale and enough details to truly get to know the characters. I laughed and cried in equal measure. Loved it!

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Some of the reviews I read expressed horror at the conditions and cruelty in the orphanages.  But Jeremiah says that the heart of man is evil, who can know it?

0307592731|3.0|In 2008, the tremors which shook trade publishing resulted in shrunken editorial staffs, shorter lists, more work by unknowns, a burst of serial titles, and a relentless search for blockbusters.  As one who spent his life in the trade, I was impressed by the efforts of multiple publicists and media outlets to create public awareness of this book and it's genuine, all-too-human themes. In addition, the author was tireless in her national book tours. The cover was universally arresting, and the metaphor the book proposed -- that the mythic open road can give one who has fallen mindfulness and a fresh start -- was magnetic.<br /><br />Why, then, was I unable to read more than half the book. Why did I sell my copy just a few months after my purchase?<br /><br />First, memoirs that recount long-dated events, or describe people the writer knew long ago, are constructs more than memoir. While I may have erred, I thought the writer couldn't have recalled the minutiae of encounters she'd had so many years earlier.  Second, the portrait Ms. Strayed offered of her early life did not evoke either a lovable or admirable character. I wanted a memoirist who would have the depth of vision to create a heroine with positive, as well as negative, attributes. didn't like the person she once was, and because of that, felt less motivated to explore her transformation. Third, the pacing fatigued in certain sections. Specifically, Strayed's endless ruminations about her oversized pack were repetitive and overwritten. Fourth, given the era in which she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, I wanted more of a feminist perspective, too, but didn't find it.<br /><br />I think the writer hoped to create a picaresque story in which a character travels from point-to-point, describing adventures and meetings along the way.  By mid-read, though, the events and meetings were mostly so muted in the telling that I can't remember one.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. There are moments when Strayed's writing is engaging, and her sense-of-humor sharp, but in a shrinking market, I don't feel the book deserved the accolades it received -- nor the special web and broadcast attention from which it gained share over more worthy titles. Cheryl Strayed is a very promising writer, but I don't feel she was as sensitive to the reader's need for character, setting, pace or tension as she might have been.engaging, and her sense-of-humor sharp, but in a shrinking market, I don't feel the book deserved the accolades it received -- nor the special web and broadcast attention from which it gained share over more worthy titles.

0857867970|5.0|Who would have thought that Zen Buddhism could co-exist with unrelated themes such as hard-core teenage bullying, suicidality, quantum physics, 9/11, Japanese fetish cafes, the tsunami, the way it feels to be 104 years old, climate change / environmentalism and Kamikaze fighters in the 2nd world war? `A tale for the time being' by Ruth Ozeki brings all these themes together--and more - in a seamless, intricate, well-crafted way. At the centre of the book is a series of insightful ideas about time--its back and forth motion, the way memory disappears with time, the way we remember and the way we forget. (For those of us who know little about Zen Buddhism, this book is a great introduction to it, by the way).<br /><br />From what I understand, this is Ozeki's 3rd novel, and it took her years to write it. In fact, as background for this novel looms the terror of writers' block, threatening to rear its ugly head at any moment. Ruth, a Japanese-American novelist (a clear autobiographical reference to Ozeki) lives a quiet life in an isolated Canadian island close to Vancouver with her artist / environmentalist husband, Oliver, and their cat, Pesto. Nearby live a string of quirky characters sharing in their country life. Walking on the beach one day, Ruth finds a plastic bag with a Hello Kitty lunchbox & a diary in it, written in Japanese. The box includes some very old letters, some of them in French, others in Japanese. It feels as if this bag was meant for her (although of course it wasn't; it was just washed onto the beach) and she takes & it spends the next period of time (months? weeks? a year?...unclear) reading the diary & trying to decipher the clues regarding where this bag came from. Was this bag washed up onto the Canadian shore after the catastrophic 2011 tsunami? Or did it arrive there through other, mysterious and complex ways? Perhaps it was transported by a Japanese black crow who circles around Ruth and Oliver's home?<br /><br />The diary is written by Nao, an adolescent girl who, like Ruth who misses New York, feels distinctly homeless in Tokyo. Although Japanese, Nao (pronounced=now) spent her early childhood in Sunnyvale California and is now regarded by her Japanese classmates as the uncool `new girl'. Nao writes about her miserable life in Tokyo which is filled with hideous, exceptionally cruel bullying by her classmates. She also is crippled by the constant fear that her unemployed, depressed father will finally successfully commit suicide after numerous failed attempts. Nao herself contemplates suicide, having lost all sense of financial (and other) security after the family's fall from grace--father losing his California job, mother becoming more & more distant, and Japanese school being a nightmare.<br /><br />Ruth takes her time to read the diary which seems to become the central element in her otherwise quiet and monotonous life. She becomes absorbed in Nao's tragic story and gradually gets more & more worried about her and her family. Is Nao alive? Her father? Did the diary reach Canada because Nao fell victim to the tsunami? The story the diary describes seems to have taken place 10 years before falling in Ruth's hands, and yet it acquires a `now-ness', as Ruth is reading it, filling her with urgency in terms of looking for Nao & saving her from suicide.<br /><br />For me, the most striking theme in the book had to do with Nao's accounts of the bullying she went through and her quiet despair (and collapse) as a result of it. Described in a bland, blank way, there are harrowing accounts of Nao's victimisation by sadistic classmates, who won't stop at anything--they stage a rape of Nao and even a fake funeral, ignoring her completely while she walks beside them. This is one of the most effective (and most tragic) descriptions of bullying that I've read (the other book that comes to mind, which also deals with bullying in an interesting way, is Cat's eye by M. Atwood). This theme is about bullying, but it's also about not fitting in and being stuck between two homes--that peculiar feeling of having two homes, or having no home.<br /><br />The other theme the book tackles that's moving has to do with Nao's great uncle, Haruki no.1, who unwillingly died a Kamikaze pilot in the 2nd World War. His letters to his now 104 years old mother, Jiko, can be seen as the heart of the book, and open an extremely interesting window, for the reader, into one of the darkest chapters of 20th century history.<br /><br />Finally, a big part of the story has to do with Nao's visit to her great-grandmother, feisty 104 year old Jiko, who is an anarchist / feminist nun at a Zen Buddhist temple. This visit proves a turning point for Nao and provides--in Jiko -- one of the most fascinating fictional characters I've come across in recent years. Zen Buddhism offers Nao many of the answers she's been seeking, in terms of dealing with her deep unhappiness, and yet she has a long way to go still.<br /><br />This all may seem disparate and kind of random, and the book does indeed contain perhaps too many stories for its own good. But I promise you, Ozeki brings it all together beautifully and reading this book will offer you a thoroughly enjoyable and very interesting experience. I think that books that open up new worlds, worlds that, in my case, I knew little about before, are always a joy to discover, and `A tale for the time being' certainly falls into that category.<br /><br />My one complaint was that--without going into details--the book attempts to `tidy up' as many loose ends as possible at the end. In the context of a book of such complexity and richness, I felt Ozeki could have left things slightly more open than she has. But this is a tiny complaint in an otherwise beautiful, illuminating (and very readable) book. Of particular interest is the self-referential, semi-autobiographical way Ozeki brings in herself and her husband (and her cat!) into the story, making the reader intrigued asto the reality or fantasy of what she writes, but also bringing in the author's interest in the Japanese `I-novel' which, as we learn in the book, is a literary genre where the author interweaves this story with that of his characters. In this way, `A tale for the time being' is a modern-day Japanese-American I-novel, and a lovely one at that..

0307361012|3.0|Being a mystery fan, Nesbo was strongly recommended to me by a colleague.  I decided to find and read The Bat first, as I like to go at least roughly in order with a series.  This being my first Nesbo, here are my impressions:<br /><br />The characters, the bureaucracy, the lead detective with a troubled history who tends to look too much to the past - all these remind me of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series.  There are some pros, to be sure.  It was suspenseful and some of the characters are well fleshed-out and interesting.  Also, I like it when history is entwined with the present so I enjoyed the Australian folklore aspects, although much of it seemed rather cliche.<br /><br />On the other hand, like Connelly's novels, there are often eye-rollingly bad decisions that lead to a fair amount of the suspense. (these are not from this book, so not really a spoiler alert)  Uncuff a serial killer and let him walk behind someone with a gun in their belt?  Leave a witness to murder unprotected in a place where anyone can find them?  Let the suspect know who your lover is and where they live?  Go without backup to try to take the killer down?  There's always some flimsy rationale behind it, and if you've read enough mystery novels, you can spot it coming a mile away.  There were several moments like that in this book, some I saw coming chapters ahead.  That really takes away from the enjoyment of the book for me.<br /><br />All in all, it was okay - something like a 2.5 out of 5 from me.  If you like Connelly or Nesbo's other books, you may like this one as well.  I have seen other reviews saying this is the worst of the lot when it comes to Nesbo, so I may give the series another shot.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I ever got !!!! My cousin enjoyed it so he downloaded it then told his mother who then told her friend ext I could never imagine my life without it
B009NNG202|3.0|This was too unfathomable . Could not suspend my disbelief. Doesn't anyone make realistic movies any more. Sick of vampires and zombies too. A little whimsy is fine but this was not even thought provoking. Trash.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We love this show!!! I only hope it lasts as long as House. It goes from Happy and Silly - to very dramatic.
B00BESM14U|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! Love, sadness, funny, touching. Great 80s throwback music, too. I recommend it.
0802473156|5.0|I have recommended this book many times over. Many come away, like I was, astonished how well it gets to the core of not only marital but everyday communication.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. Watched the whole season in 3 days. Highly recommended to watch season 1 and 2 first if you haven't already done so.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is the best show ever, I have had friends and family watch this and now everyone is addicted.  Its not only a show about zombies, but a show about people and how people handle struggle and get on with life after severe tragedy.  Cant stop watching it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I didn't get the newest update yet but already I'm satisfied. I have it on Xbox, so I gave it a try on my kindle. At first I was SO BORED, but when I actually gave the game a chance I loved it and I still do. :)<br />It's exactly like the other minecrafts but just starting out. There is no obsidian, the end, etc. But the game is still great. :)
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|The kids who are 7 and 3 were mesmerized and stayed with it the entire time.  Old school still works.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app SOO much! You can make dark pictures lighter, and the opposite of that. You can add effects! You can also type whatever you want! I made The Walking Dead pictures on it and they look fantastic! Buy this app. There will b no regrets!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very detailed review of Lincoln and the people who comprised his world both before and during his presidency.  A good read.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Insightful, well written, and even a few smiles. If you need to recharge your batteries, and make things happen this is a worthwhile purchase.
B009Z5975A|5.0|The price for three movies in one was really great! They are all really good! I would order more like them.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This is a good movie to watch if you want a few laughs.  There are some good lines which anyone around the age of 40 can appreciate with a smile.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read the whole series and loved them all. My absolute favorite . I liked the third book the best.The drama and excitement really gets to you.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I like how Jackson is &#34;deep diving&#34; the story to set up for the coming movies.  Where this movie ends you would not know so much if you were at the same point in the book.  He isn't giving away the story but setting up the conflict.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Its perfect guide for one to write and publish.<br />I recommend to read before you write and it will remove fear to write for Kindle
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I don't play games, but got this out of curiosity.  I am now addicted.  It's fun to try to get better each time you play.  I don't totally understand all the nuances of the game, I just have fun with it.  It's a wholesome game I can let the kids play. I recommend this game just for fun, or to get serious with.
B000FA675C|5.0|It's great novel I see the movie than reading the novel.<br />Novel become more interesting and  worth reading.<br />Most interesting novel I read
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a great game that challenges your mind and logic. You have to remember everywhere you've been and know how to trace your steps
B007A2O3FO|5.0|How did I miss this one? Maggie Smith delivers one of her most interesting and great roles in this movie, a loving grandmother and yet someone who manages to comminucate and interact with a rather stiff grandchild. A good lesson for anyone having a hard time with \\"generation gap\\" communication. One of the best roles I have seen Maggie Smith in.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Even though not depth of character development you do get somewhat of an idea of characters enough to feel something toward a few of the characters to the point that you are interested in what happens to them.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read all of the Reacher series and have completely enjoyed getting to know Jack Reacher.  This book was spot on with Reacher's linear, logical thinking and use of arcane knowledge.  The ending is awesomely Reacher all the way.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|there are several &#34;glitches&#34; throughout the three disks... I thought it might be my machine, but after trying it on multiple machines I now know it is the disks.  Bad product
B007FH9GA6|1.0|Why is this trilogy so popular?  Beats me.  I couldn't get into this movie at all.  I stopped watching halfway through.  I thought it was slow moving, disjointed, had completely unnecessary scenes with graphic sexual violence, and an annoying soundtrack.  Glad I didn't waste any more of my time or money on the movies and books.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I guess I don't know what I expected but the two actors are wonderful actors so I guess I was expecting something more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|You can set this to solve math problems to snooze and type in a password with many different characters (i.e. Ei3p90fvDDa) in which you'd have to be conscious to get through.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is a true entertainer - his voice is melodious - he chooses great songs - I could sit and listen to him all day.
B00785P2QC|3.0|the biggest complaint I have is that it takes forever to load (&#62;5 minutes). It has the same usual annoying offers to &#34;buy credits&#34; that every free game has now.
B009S33I68|5.0|This was a very moving book and I have seen the movie. I was married for 20 years to a wonderful man that was in that battle and never talked about it, until 20 years later when he had open heart surgery and they said it was like he woke up in Vietnam. The trauma he went through ended our marriage. He finally received help and we bacame friends before he died in 2009 at the age of 64. I never saw his name in the story and I realize you may not have been able to reach everyone to give them the credit due. Back to the story-----those were some of the best men and boy's anyone could have ever know and at the time I was only 17 and a new bride when he left for Vietnam and the impact of it never really hit me until Isaw the movie and read the book-------I am so glad those men or young boys at the time will be given the honor due them.  Thanks to Mr. Moore for his leadership that brought those boys home----because of that----I have a daughter and three wonderful grandchildren------but I would have liked to seen their grandfathers name in print------ a grandfather they never really got to know until the end.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids and I love this one.  They can't get enough of it.  Could be partly due to the fact that Phineas and Ferb is their favorite show but also the challenges are set up in such a manner that if you're stumped, you just skip it and move on.  With so many levels and so many ways you receive &#34;achievements&#34; it's well worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it.<br />Free.<br />Many fun games.<br />Sweet.<br />Great graphics.<br />Fun to play with family.<br />Carlos really likes to play this game.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Enjoying the film and the entire series. appreciate being able to view it again and get some of the things I missed seeing it in the theatre.
B0055MHD8U|5.0|This movie is very childish but then again that's exactly the kind of movie I want to watch after a days work.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have read the entire book series and naturally wanted to begin my DVD collection. I could not have found a better deal, the story in this series is beyond great!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Lots of issues watching, downloading and skipping with this one.  Contacted Amazon Support and of course they came to the rescue and made it possible to watch without the bugs!  Great movie; kids watched in 2x in 24-hours!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Read this book in one sitting. It made me think long and hard about medical ethics in a way I never imagined. Being a high school student who wants to do clinical and research medicine in the future, I now understand the importance of seeing things from the patient's point of view, and I am confident that this would make me a better doctor and scientist.
B0051XQI84|4.0|Like Dreamworks so much!  This one was a great one.  No issues downloading and watching.  No issues with skipping either.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This really is a great game no problems just have to use  a little extra space great strategy game and cool monsters it's awesome get this game
B003V5ED7W|4.0|Instant classic!!  Lots is issues with downloading and watching but Amazon Support came to the rescue and provided extra time to watch the movie since they had some issues fixing my kindle's problem.  Cute movie; should probably own this one!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow! What a read this was! I believed like Andy in Jacob's innocence as I read, I wanted Jacob to be innocent, that one day soon this family would once again be \\"normal\\". But what is \\"normal\\", anymore?
B00AREIAI8|3.0|GOOD GAME ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE HORSES. AS ALWAYS..EXPECT THE REALLY GOOD GAME STUFF TO COST REAL MONEY THOUGH. HAVE FUN!
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I liked the book. It was so cool. You should read it too. I hope you do read this book. Diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I couldn't watch the whole thing - this movie was so bad I wish I could get my money back.  I didn't think I could not like a movie that had Paul Rudd in it but I was wrong.  The constant bickering is so annoying and the gratuitous sex is ridiculous.<br /><br />BAD MOVIE!!!! Save your money.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|i love this album. love the new style. hope he does more. will always be a fan of bon jovi
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Product worked fine, but sound volume was the same as if using mic on the i-phone.  Good product, just not for what I wanted to use it for.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game, but not worth $5, especially since it is advertised as free before downloading and playing thru most of the game.  A deceitful practise, it may cause me to boycott g5 games if it happens more often.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES. This is actually my second time reading it. I know these aren't the type of books a sweet 13 year old girl would read, but this is the type of book you just can't put down. The vivid pictures Suzanne makes are amazing. If someone asked me who my hero is I would easily say Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire. When I was reading these books, I was often transformed into my hero. And I actually dream that I'm in the Hunger Games when I'm asleep. Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing my favorite books  of all time.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is great story with an even greater lesson, which is to cherish today and don't be in such a hurry for tomorrow.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to use.  Numbers are size appropriate for the display.  I also like the running total.  Several times I have gone back after several days to review my work and my work is still there
B001CWOCUO|5.0|Me encantó el concierto muy recomendable, la calidad de video es muy buena y el audio estupendo. se los recomiendo ¡¡
0385535147|5.0|I'm not much of a reader so it is hard to grab my attention and keep it, but Grisham usually does.  This book is no exception.  My attention was captured and maintained throughout the book.  I actually took time away from other things to read which is very unusual for me.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I must confess at first I had my doubts as to just how good this movie was going to be. It had a hard group of really good Hobbit movies to compete with. After watching the movie it quickly became my favorite of them all.<br />It had humor, it had an outstanding cast, and the flow of the movie was great.<br /><br />I am really glad it left the door open for the next one, which I will be awaiting.<br /><br />Michael
B000NTPDSW|4.0|This movie is a fantastic example of how Hollywood used to make movies, just great. But please see also my remarks concerning the<br />quality and presentation of this movie's Blu-Ray presentation in my review of the Special 50th anniversary Blu-Ray Edition of the excellent movie Ben-Hur
B003P2WO5E|5.0|As with all of Sanderson's work, his stories convey a depth to the world that is intriguing while not being overwhelming. I can't wait to see book two, and three and four and five and...
B005UG53NS|5.0|Huge fan of the Harry Potter series and great final. We looked past the differences between the book and the movie to enjoy the final part of the Deathly Hallows.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A fun, addicting game that keeps you hooked. No problems on first gen Kindle Fire; runs perfectly. Great for all ages, too.
B007SGM084|5.0|Omg! Awesome series! A must read! I could not put it down once I started reading! This series has everything anyone could ask for in a great book!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It got tedious for me.  I am not a prude, but I would rather have a good story and forget the sexual detail.  One of these books would have been plenty.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel has a lot of twists and turns.  One moment I'm feeling sorry for a character and the next I want to choke them.  I have quickly become a fan of Gillian Flynn.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute fun game fun for everyone. Love the graphics. Could be better if it was easier to earn coin and energy.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Is this the original scribblenauts that was released on the DS? Have the downloading and input problems been fixed? I really like this game and would like to buy it if it has been patched to fix the above stated issues I have been reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best horse sim I have ever played. worth a try for sure. better then paid apps I had tried before
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I am able to stream my personal videos to my Tv via my xbox 360. The dev releases frequent updates. The selection of channels to watch is excellent and growing. if you do not have a rokubox or similiar device I highly recommend this. Oh sometimes the new channels added can be a little buggy but the dev is quick to correct problems. I love being able to stream crackle and you tube using my kindle fire as a remote.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A great read although it was a bit graphic at times. Must read this!  Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game does NOT work on my Samsung galaxy. I try to open the game and it just force closes on me everytime i try. NO GOOD
B008602KQI|4.0|Initially the nook angered mr so I pit it dow. After a few weeks I started reading the book again. The story was engaging e and interesting.<br />What I did not like about the book was the amount of violence.<br />Over All I would rate the story a 8. I did like the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is the most fun game I have ever played. I Love it so much I will play it 24\7 because it's so awesome
B0000B1OE7|5.0|This is one of the best anime shows I've ever seen.  Definitely a classic!  Wish I had picked it up when it was in stores - but I couldn't justify the price.  Now, it's selling many times that new, so I had to settle for a used copy.<br /><br />This show is an example of the entire reason we got into anime.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Wow.  Now THAT was an emotional, heartfelt, strong and powerful story.  One that I'm still reeling from long after I've finished.  I decided on the audio for this after hearing so many great reviews and seeing that there were two narrators.  Since I'm fairly new to audios, this was my first story with two narrators.  I loved the idea of one for Eleanor and another for Park.  And man, getting the audio version was definitely the right choice.  It was amazing.<br /><br />These two characters are intensely realistic.  Eleanor, a larger girl with crazy red hair, who often wore mens hand-me-downs, was completely misunderstood and often picked on.  Park, who was half Korean and had a pretty strict father, came from a \\"white picket fence\\" type of home and fit in with the popular kids easily.  Though they both had their problems, they were complete opposites.  Eleanor came from a complete poverty-ridden home with an abusive stepfather.  Park, on the other hand, is blessed with loving parents and a good home... yet he's feels as though his father is never happy with the decisions he makes and is always looking for more.  Both have their own issues and stresses to work through... both doing the best they can with the hand they're dealt.<br /><br />These two opposites by chance end up sitting next to each other on a bus to and from school.  Park at first completely ignores the weird, new girl since talking to her would be social suicide.  Eleanor hates everyone (a result of a lifetime of being bullied) so she has no problem ignoring him and his pretty green eyes just as easily.  Though their relationship starts off completely silently, Park begins communicating with Eleanor through mixed tapes and comic books, and thus their friendship is begun.<br /><br />I can see where some may see this story as boring.  But I have to say, if you can relate to these characters AT ALL, this story packs a punch.  Eleanor is so reserved and snarky, yet you can totally see why when you learn more about her life.  Park seems to fall for Eleanor quickly, but throughout his scenes you can actually feel his feelings for her developing.  I definitely think the audio is the way to go with this one.  The narrators were impeccable, both of them.  Absolutely perfect.  I honestly can't find a single thing to complain about.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how amazing it is, so I'll force myself to stop now.  This story reminded me a lot of Juno.  It was, simply put, REAL.  If you're a lover of contemporary YA and you're looking for a sweet yet emotional, sappy yet harsh story, this is a must-read!  And get the audio!  :)re about her life.

B009A87ZKG|5.0|It is an excellent movie against the backdrop of World War II.  Perhaps, it has been &#34;Hollywoodized&#34; but it remains a classic WWII movie in my opinion.  I recommend watching this and comparing the details with such movies as &#34;D-Day&#34; and &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; and other, mostly, non-fiction WWII.  Reading non[fiction books is even better.
B00846REIS|5.0|The was a great book following the 60 shades series. After finishing 50 shades I wanted to read something similar in nature that would grab my attention an pull me in to the book. The sexy part of the story was great b the love story the nitty gritty behind the couple makes the story so much more interesting: pulling you into the story making you feel the raw emotion behind the passionate scenes.This was just the book I was looking for! I will be getting the next book today and the third book as soon as its released in June!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wish I could project myself into the future where all seventeen seasons of Downton Abbey were available so I would never again have to wait endless months for the next installment.  This cast of characters is like family:  I know them well enough to be able to predict how they will react to the joys and sorrows, the triumphs and tragedies of life.  But I do not know them so well that they cannot surprise me.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman are just a few of the leading men that Faye Dunaway starred against in serious movies...and Three Days of the Condor sums them all up....music and colors of the 70's ,mixed in with Max Von Sydow supplying that certain coolness that made your skin crawl.....in the beginning of the movie the actress Tina Chen is staring at her death and supplies this classic line...&#34;I won't scream&#34;. I often wondered why.......this movie really makes you wonder what happened to the characters...all of them......not to be missed
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As usual a truly good read. I enjoy the novels and the TV series. The stories are good, well researched and keep your interest from start to finish.
0062014536|4.0|\\"You know you can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes, right?\\"<br /><br />Summary:<br />After Lena, Julian and the rest of her friend go back to the wilds they realized that after all the trouble caused there will more problems on the way. The wilds are no longer safe and slowly but surely the invalids are being taken down and slaughtered.  Those who are left and those who are willing to help will try to band together and fight for their freedom and right to love.<br /><br />\\"But maybe happiness isn't in the choosing. Maybe it's in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we were intended to be all along.\\"<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />I loved this last installment of the delirium series. It is fast paced, action packed with nearly always something going on. In this book we get Hana and Lena's POV and such a big difference between their two worlds. One talks of war and the other a wedding. On Hana's side I belive that he cure didn't fully take, I would've figured her to be more of a dull robotic type of person who does what's told and not question and do the things she did.<br /><br />With and ending like the last book Pandemonium I was hoping a little light would've been shed on the relationship between Lena and Alex. I wanted them to be together. Nearing the end I was so worried about what would happen. When it comes to these kind of love triangles either someone dies, or is left heartbroken and in the ending there was nothing. Lena and Alex relationship was infuriating, I wanted Julian to get the picture and maybe back off of her that way Alex and Lena can get back. I wish Lena would've just told Julian and Alex how she felt. During the ending I thought they were going to get together but then they cut to the ending and I was left confused.<br /><br />_&lt;<br /><br />\\"We wanted the freedom to love. We wanted the freedom to choose. Now we have to fight for it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Live free or die.\\"
0385349947|3.0|If we all had the opportunities and the financial foundation as Ms Sandberg has had we could all &#34;lean in&#34;.  She definitely doesn't find it easy to speak to the women of middle class....
B0098VXDDS|5.0|I have watched all of the episodes they are so well done and the acting is superb. The sex and violence is great and that being said you get caught up in the story line it is so good
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show was much better than any of the recent Terminator movies.  Although called &#34;The Sarah Connor Chronicles&#34;, it is the most in depth and believable look at John Connor, the mythologies true hero, that we have seen to date.  Additionally, all the cast were great, but how awesome was Summer Glau?  I'd much rather have her save my life than the Govinator.<br /><br />Overall, just a great depiction of what the franchise could still be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So fun. The seven bucks are worth it. Very fun, and almost every one loves who plays it loves it. 1000% worth it. BUY IT
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|one movie I will definitely recommend to more than one of my friends and I cant believe that I have to write all of this
1419702963|5.0|Arrived in good condition, in a timely manner.  Was a gift for grandchild.  He loves this series, he has already read them and asking for more.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was different than what I expected. I enjoyed the twist for the end of  movie. I will be waiting for the next movie.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I went through the entire first season in one weekend, I couldn't turn it off until the season was over.
B004LUS390|5.0|It's not something I would recommend for a serious artist, but it's a lot of fun to work with. There are a lot of colors and brushes to work with. But, user beware, I have wasted many an hour on this app.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|i enjoyed this from the perspective of someone who is suffering from cancer and isn't really sure what they think about god, religion, prayer, etc.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|I like it, all my friends said to me it's Wonderful watch, but the strap is not good is bad is not Comfortable, so I will change the strap.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Read it but start with the first! No swashbuckling stuff but you will love it. I cannot wit to read the next.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Slow story, ok I get it, he was let out of prison for using a law that allows him to turn someone else in, and then has to go thru surgery and await his time to speak at the trial.  The premise was developed so slow and without giving away the big secret, it just took to long to get to the story line.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I've found that when the game crashes, if you hit your home button and exit out of the game then try and open it again, it works, by which I mean it goes back to your last point before it restarted. At least, it's worked for me. Hope that helps anyone else! It's fun to play, even though there are a few things I didn't adore, like the fact that during the tutorial you had to spend peanuts, but that's a minor issue. Otherwise, I love this game!
0671449028|5.0|This is a great bedtime book before my baby's last bottle for the night. The book rhymes so it sets a nice slow tempo when reading.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|For me at least logging into multiplayer makes me lose most of my points so when ever I leave a match I lose points and I bought a cts scope and later it was gone also some time won't let me purchase items at all multiplayer needs updates now
B007REV4T8|4.0|Excellent and entertaining! Plenty of actions and several inside jokes of past Bond norms, if you've seen them you will get the references.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|loved this show for the short time it aired.  terrific to be able to view it again whenever i want to
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book. Eye opening. I've completely changed my diet per doctors orders to help with immune issues. You won't look at grains the same ever again.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved this story. Being of Irish descent, but not knowing much about the place was what inclined me to read the book. Ms. McKenna's descriptive text and the interwoven storylines are the things that made it hard to put down. Enjoyable and informative.
B00BF11STU|3.0|First of all, it's long.  Overly long.  Secondly, I thought the writing was pretty clunky, especially when a character gave background information.  They may as well have had a big, flashing exposition sign over their heads.  I did, however, enjoy, Jessica Chastain's performance.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I love this team of actors....this movie is great!  Just like Shaun of the Dead and their earlier tv series Spaced...love em all!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD seemed to be having battery issues. It was taking two days to recharge. This utility seems to have cleared up the problem and I can see exactly how much time it will take to recharge. The visual is very handy. No more trying to look for the tiny little battery animation.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All six movies, plus three bonus discs in one complete package is a MUST HAVE! Finally you get to see Star Wars, the way it was meant to be seen,  in 100% digital video and 6.1 audio sound! Oh Yeaaah!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Having worked in a flower shop and a nursery I love plants,flowers, and in general the outdoors weather permitting. Found the plot keeping me on my toes when I thought she had found happiness wham bang a change comes again. Very good book keeps pages turning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its realistic. and really fun I think it cmould be better if u could replenish ur horeses energy quicker without having to bye gems
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|I love Rihanna and have since I was 12, when she was 18 and first started her career. I have yet to go to a concert, so this is the closest to a concert I have been to of hers. I think this is great for anyone who is even slightly a Rihanna fan.
B004GYY714|5.0|I had tried i-heart-radio, but then lost my password and could no longer get it to work on my Fire so I gave up. Pandora is ok, but not live.  No user ID or password required for TuneIn, and you can listen to just about anything, anywhere in the world! Timer is great so you can set it to go off after 15 minutes (or more) as you go to sleep, so you don't run down your battery charge. Very fun to use!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|You know how Monopoly has this sort of stereotype of being a ruthless game that can make a family hate each other in a single Saturday afternoon? Well, this makes Monopoly look like Candyland in comparison.<br /><br />Settlers of Catan (and the official expansions - Cities & Knights, Seafarers, and Barbarians & Traders) are games that are quite easy to pick up but very difficult to master. Strategy will usually win the day, but there's enough of a luck element involved that you can still defeat an entrenched and/or more experienced player.<br /><br />The modularity of the game board (which is composed of a bunch of different hex tiles) greatly increases the replayability of the game. I've written up custom rulesets and I've found scenarios online to play. It's awesome.<br /><br />If you buy this and you enjoy it, your next step should really be to just buy the multi-pack that includes all the expansions as well as the 5-6 player addons. Don't buy it piecemeal if you can afford to just buy the whole lot. Don't worry about having extra pieces - having a few spares lying around can never hurt.<br /><br />One of the best things about this game (aside from the rules and gameplay, which are always important) is the build quality. The hexes are on solid, sturdy cardstock. The pieces are made of *real* wood, and you're more liable to lose one than to ever break one.<br /><br />Buy this game, and it will sit in your family game closet for years - probably decades, even. Just keep it towards the front of that closet, because once you get into this game you're gonna be pulling it out to play it a LOT.
B005HSL626|4.0|Easy to learn easy to play.  Good for all ages.  Like sounds and graphics and overall look of the game.
B001TH16DS|5.0|This Bluray set may not be perfect, but it's pretty darn close, as after restoration, visual enhancements, and special effects upgrades, the season one episodes of Star Trek (1966-67), look absolutely amazing in high definition.  Although there are some signs of age, that a television program over 40 years old can look this good, is quite amazing.  Paramount Studios, and those who participated in this 2009 release, deserve much credit for this \\"stellar' release.  Anyone who can remember when Star Trek was available on DVD's with just two episodes each, can fully appreciate the beauty of this set.  The nice set of bonus materials is certainly commendable, unfortunately the cherry on top, a commentary track or two from one of the cast, would certainly have delighted the fans.<br /><br />Star Trek came to television when the space race was burning white hot, as America strived to get to the moon, and the exploration of space was in the consciousness of the nation.  Although the technological capabilities of television in 1966 may seem crude today, they were sufficient to produce what were then, cutting edge special effects.  And being a color production was simply huge, and something that Star Trek's production staff took full advantage of.  Just imagining how the program would look in black and white, it's clear that so much would have been lost, had the series come to television just a few years earlier.  Those familiar with the history of Star Trek, probably know that getting the series on the air was an arduous process, but it apparently happened with support from Lucille Ball, of Desilu Productions, who believed in the show's concept.<br /><br />While The Twilight Zone, and The Outer Limits, occasionally explored science fiction in a serious manner, Star Trek took the bull by the horns, routinely dealing with themes like war, justice, aliens, duty, personal rights, survival, and the nature of man, and other lifeforms.  Although preceded by Lost in Space, which was set on alien worlds, Star Trek dealt with space travel, and the universe, in a consistently \\"realistic\\" way.<br /><br />While there usually wasn't much time for romance, the element that Star Trek did feature in a BIG way was \\"sex\\", and predominantly in the female form.  Never before, had so many beautiful women been featured in space, and on alien worlds, with a wide variety of attire ranging from skin tight Federation uniforms, to flowing gowns, to exotic costumes of the future.  The emphasis on glamour was very deliberate, as in close-ups, the faces of males often exhibit stunning detail, while in contrast, the women often appear to have been shot through a glamour filter.  Males were not objectified in quite the same way, although Kirk was often shirtless, and Sulu also makes a notable topless appearance, in \\"The Naked Time\\".<br /><br />Enhanced visual effects are available as an option, and give the episodes a fresh new look, and do a good job of keeping the program from looking too dated.  For those that prefer them, the original effects remain available.  The only major flaw in the high def package, is that the audio drops down in a number of the episodes.<br /><br />From the very start, Star Trek featured outstanding stories, with soon to become iconic characters, facing provocative moral dilemmas.  These would prove to be key factors in the franchise's enduring popularity, as Star Trek's fan base grew during its run in syndication, providing the momentum for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and so very much more.  The genesis of all this, is right here in the first season of Star Trek.  All three seasons on Bluray are essential for any Trekkie, but with so much that is essential, Season One is probably the one to acquire first.set on alien worlds, Star Trek dealt with space travel, and the universe, in a consistently \\"realistic\\" way.<br /><br />While there usually wasn't much time for romance, the element that Star Trek did feature in a BIG way was \\"sex\\", and predominantly in the female form.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Score of words have been written about this book; analysis and reviews a plenty.  All I can say is I liked it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Wanted to read another of his books but they were not for Kindle, and I needed a new book right then.  Keeps you wondering the whole story, and has a surprise ending.  Kept my attention all the way through.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked from the first chapter.  As some have said, its not the most original idea, but it is well told.  The story is appealing and engaging.  Good for adolescents as well as adults.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I cried reading this book.  It was awesome!  The writing was so descriptive and made you feel like you were there.  I loved how it portrayed the relationships betweeen the slaves and the people in the &#34;big house&#34; of the plantation.  It was a great read!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Very good. Funny BOOK. I like Rick Riordan's books. You should read this book. I love his books. Like the new characters.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I needed to get some REAL singers in my head after hearing the poor singing from Hugh and Russell  in the movie version! This concert version is absolutely the best singing of this musical there is!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is the best game ever ! You can buy all kinds of dinosaurs with the money you earn in the game. You earn money by completing  missions and collecting money from the dinosaurs . It&quot;s the best game ever!
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I was astonished to learn that there were actually female special operations personnel in the  WWII theatre.  The story line is a suspenseful read that is hard to put down.  It is vintage Ken Follett writing.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I cannot even begin to tell one how amazing this is! The music is so pure and you will find yourself with a song in your head days after watching, happily wanting to put it back on and sing it out in surround sound.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I don't often have time,to sit for long periods and read-which I think this novel deserves. When I finally completed it I felt like I lived with the characters alongside lin. It brought me into another world, which books less and less often do these days.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|THis series just keeps getting better and better. It can definitely be a mind-bender at times but they never allow a story arc to get so twisted you can't understand it as you go. Excellent acting and great plot lines.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book because  this  book is full action and mystery and you don't know what's going to happen.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali proves that the political is personal. Her story is heart-rending and inspiring. I almost quit reading Infidel because her childhood was so horrible (but unfortunately typical for women for many 3rd world countries). Things got much better when she made it to Europe, and she worked very hard to improve her circumstances. I'm still not sure if the poor treatment of women comes from poverty or Islam, it was quite the discussion at our book club. Given that 1/5th of the world's population is Muslim, it is a important discussion to have.<br />  The murder of Theo Van Gogh and death threats against anyone that (seemingly) criticizes Islam certainly gives one pause. How to offer the ideals of the ability to make personal choices, the US Bill of Rights, and freedom of religion to the 3rd world AND be respectful of religion and cultural norms is the question of this century. Thank you, Ayaan Hirsi Ali for starting this discussion.
B0035W8QUQ|4.0|Termed 'Via Crucis', this album has nothing liturgical in it except some devotional excerpts from religious compositions of the early Baroque period.<br />The artistic concept is a great one, but there is a great caveat for those ears gotten used to pure bel canto singing.<br />I am no musical historian, but surely the singing in a number of tracks of this compilation is not in the classical bel canto style, so even if it is supposedly a 'period revival', it is not a pure revival but with modern elements (like STING singing Dowland).<br />So let buyers beware: do not mix up Sting with Scholl.<br />Apart from the above, I absolutely love the singing of Ms. Nuria Rial, who sung an even better version of Sances' 'Stabat Mater' than even Philippe Jaroussky himself some years ago in another Virgin recording.<br />The pure instrumental pieces are also great, with Bilber's \\"L'Aria\\" being the most catchy.<br />The modern 'baroque' movement is a good one, but admittedly not entirely for me whose ears are accustomed to bel canto singing instead of rock'n'roll.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was fully prepared to not like The Hunger Games but was hooked from chapter one. Looking forward to the next book!
B000063UR2|5.0|love to watch older movies with the actors starting out.  glad you made this one with tom cruise before he was real famous, liked the movie.  thank you
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|As one that has seen Clutch live (Blast Tyrant tour), one who has been forcibly ejected from a Clutch show (same tour), and one that has followed this band since the Transnational Speedway League days, the boys have done it again.  My wife and I saw them in Ohio (I think); tix were $22.50 each, and people were offering us $250 each before the show!  If you're not familiar with Clutch, do yourself a favor and get familiar.  This band, in my opinion, is one of those bands that you either get or you don't.  I've never played Clutch for someone and have them say 'yeah, they're ok'.  You either dig, or you don't.  Favorite tracks: #1 and #2, but this is solid.
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|To The Wonder: Starring Ben Affleck, Rahcel McAdams, leaves, and  woman dancing with a chicken. Leaves, leaves, leaves, and some more leaves.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|really enjoying reading this selection. going to watch movie after im finished.  seems like it may be a bit loooong but worth it!
0439023513|2.0|This book did bring closure to the trilogy for me.  However, it fell a bit short for me.  I think the story line was a bit contrived and was a stretch.<br /><br />I think the story line could've been a bit more developed and I don't think the author did her readers justice.<br /><br />The only reason I'd even consider recommending the story is because it is the end of the trilogy.  Other wise I wouldn't recommend this for reading
B000641D2Y|4.0|My kids were tired of watching our awful video tape of this movie so<br />we decided it was time we got it on DVD.
B005DI66N4|4.0|I think this is a fabulous tale.  Some people have called this fiction, while the author wrote it at fact.  Personally, I can't say for sure whether or not its factual or not.<br /><br />But I'll take it as truth.  It is informative, descriptive and well constructed.  It is too bad that the author couldn't find Mr. Smith after the war was over.<br /><br />Fact or fiction, its a good easy story to read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love games like this and this one was even better because of the Vermont theme.<br />I didn't realize that I could only play for a little bit before having to purchase but I thought the price was okay.<br />I love the storyline and the mini games that keep you busy! I would definitely recommend for anyone who loves the mystery games.  I like it even more with the use of Vermont in it as I am a green mountain girl myself and honestly games, books, and movies are rare to find that use Vermont as a main theme.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good book that describes first hand the combat in Iraq. Similar to lone survivor if you liked that book. Patriotic and important to see what soldiers go through in war and at home.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone was talking about this series so I was delighted the 2nd season was on Amazon Prime for free, watched them all in a few days. Of course, my husband finds it to be a dreary version of every PG Wodehouse story ever written, especially the stories concerning Blandings Castle. I recommend you read Summer Lightning and compare it. I don't see the resemblance myself. Now if they introduce an Empress of Grantham pig, I might change my mind.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put down this book. Now, I'm buying the next one. I can't wait to see what will happen.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Lot's of fun. A good diversion for long plane rides, or anytime. You can't beat the price, and the ads are unobtrusive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play minecraft and this is a really cool game. I have the PC version and i think both are good if you but thsi app make sure to also get PocketInveditorPro it  allows you to be epic :D
B00C32TPZE|5.0|Great band, continuing to put out solid albums.  can't wait for next one to come out.  band puts on an excellent live show as well
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Hey well this game subway surfers is just addictive I love it!!! It is free to download and it doesn't have many ad ons it doesn't ask you to pay for bonuses or anything it is by choice. It is fun for all the family my little brother and sister and older sister are all addicted to it and love it. The animation is also great and great quality, it never freezes which some good quality free games do!! I recommend this to all
B0000025JT|5.0|I love these together and this is a fantastic album... love singing to her and just adore her on this album.
B008476HBM|5.0|I read a version of this novel at least once a year. It always delivers an expected joy. I recommend it to readers of all ages.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|When I read a book, I let my imagination run wild. This book has so much detail that you can SEE everything as if you we're there. Great from start to finish!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When something's working fine, I really hate to mess with it! Google Reader was just great, but it's going away - so I shopped around for a replacement reader, not really expecting to like the substitute, especially at first. Feedly was a great surprise -- all around easy, and it works just like Google, only better. It's slicker, faster and more intuitive than Google, with some features that I already couldn't live without, and it syncs on my table and pc. So . . . yeah, I love it!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A well acted Lincoln by Daniel Day Lewis really had me believing I was seeing the real Lincoln. Conflict, tragedy, humor and depth of feeling are well portrayed by all the actors.  Creative use of lighting helps to give a feel for what non-electric lighting was like to live with. This is not a movie that is filled with intense action seens, though there are enough to give you a feel for the tragedy of the Civil War. If you enjoy the play of character strengths and weaknesses between people, and want to get a feel for what life was like in the 1860's then you will enjoy this movie.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|A little paranormal, a little hot hot hot, a little lust and longing.  Overall a good combination for a beach read.
0385344228|4.0|I read Mission Flats and was so disappointed in the ending, I never imagined I would read another Landay book. However, when I saw the reviews, I decided to give Defending Jacob a try. I loved the book from page one and the story line was very engaging. I felt myself sympathizing with each of the characters, my opinion changing several times as to Jacob's guilt or innocence. The twists at the end of the book were shocking, but once again, the ending gave no closure, only a lot of unanswered questions.  I was expecting the \\"last\\" chapter, which was never written. That's why I could not give the book five stars. Maybe the author wants us to dream up our own ending.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|This was a gift for my Dad and he and his girlfriend are fans.  Not a huge Abba fan so I cannot comment.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo is a wonderful series.<br />I enjoyed it on TV years ago and I am really enjoying it again.<br />I ordered it and got it in a timely manner.<br />Thank you
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|Got this for my Dad and his girlfriend and they are big fans.  Never saw it myself so I cannot comment.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith's style is refreshingly open minded and positive.  I found her perspective touching and inspiring, and could not put the audiobook down!  This book left me curious to know more about her music and her life.
B00000DLVA|4.0|I bought this only for Erase/Rewind, I put it on a mix flash drive.  Like that song, not a big fan of the rest. Don't get me wrong it isn't bad, just not music taste.  I could see a fan of the Cardigan's catalog liking this album a lot.
B000FA675C|5.0|Bought the hard back years ago when it came out. This was a free app of the day or something, so I snatched it up! I don't read many books but this one I had to read. I really liked it. Couldn't get interested in the movie(even with it starring the great Tom Hanks) because the book was just so much better! imo
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked for me.  Built a cable to hook my car to my lap top and get codes and troubleshoot problem and simply clear the error codes.  Worked for the one time use I needed it.
B006RZZ9YY|5.0|In many years, I never had intentions to watch this movie. The movie is well done. Good message, has action, fun and emotional moments. Recommended!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can I say?  It's a calculator,  and it's free. It gives the correct answers and everything. Nice big numbers, easy to read, and it's FREE!!
B00000AD94|4.0|This is very nice album recommended for prog fans. It sounds kind of like Kansas to me, which is not my preferred style. There are some impressive instrument playing passages through out this album. It may require a couple of playings to allow it to grow.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was well done and the actors definitely did fine jobs with their roles, making it a five star movie for those who enjoy action and post WWIII / civil uprising type fantasy.<br /><br />If you have read the book you may find much of the character development and parts of the story missing.  It is nice to see a movie shown in one part (The Hobbit in three parts would be better without having to wait two more years for the end), but this movie would have done more justice to the story if it was longer or shown in two parts.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch if you are alright with a story based on games involving death of teenagers as part of governmental control.<br /><br />Looking forward to \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mocking Jay\\" releases.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Good movie, good plot. Above my expectations. I would have thought it to be more predictable, but it was actually well made.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|The easiest way to listen to your amazon music on your android. Wish it had more bells and whistles, such as downloading libraries to SD card but meh, it's perfectly serviceable.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is my daughters favorite movie.  What more can I say Beauty and the Beast!  Quick to ship very pleased
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The story was a little bit immature for me, but I did finish it.  I would think that this would be a good story for 15-20 year olders.  I did think the stars and stargazing added to the story.
B007REW8DO|5.0|This is a great CD for all ages everyone in my family loves it.  I love it and will buy others
B007PYEY9M|4.0|Had a 7, 10 and 12 year old that really liked the movie.  I would recommend it as a good movie.
B003OUXECE|3.0|Companion book for the Bioshock video game, I'm a big fan of the game so buying this was a no brainer. But the story is so-so.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was okay. sophmoric college humor and use of foul language was a bit of overkill and certainly not a movie for children even though there is a teddy bear as the focal point. Parents BEWARE&#62;
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|I love this movie. Blu ray quality is amazing. I love the special features. I also comes with the Digital Copy and DVD.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Best video-game to movie adaption I've seen in a very long time. They can do so much more than this but it was nice to see Master Cheif from the perspective of young cadets.
1401924751|2.0|I didn't care for the deck or the pictures. I gave it away because I had no use for it. I love Doreen's Therapy Angels I bought several other decks of hers thinking they would be as good as the Therapy Angels Deck. Not so. I gave all away except the Angel Therapy deck.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|a feel good book. once you've started you can't stop reading!i love how kinsella persuades her readers by her words to read more....
1401937268|3.0|Beautiful pics, nice deck. But just not to my liking. I gave them away. I did not find them to be very accurate. I bought most of Doreen's decks. I gave all away but the Angel Therapy deck. That one deck I really find to be helpful. I wish I could say the same for the rest of her decks. But sadly, I cannot.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I know this isn't something amazon can really control but when 4 digital books cost  almost 50% more than 4 printed books I will never buy them and will happily support those that pirate the digital copies. Publishers need to wake up.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I truly enjoyed the mystery and change of pace of this novel. it was written in a different way<br />than most novels and leaves the reader wondering what will come next. I hope the author<br />writes more books in the same manner.
B004478AS4|4.0|The clan in Nigeria and the coming of the British rule are paralel world's with different frames if reference.  The natural world of the clan and community runs counter to the corruption and illogic if the Whiteman,s rule in west Africa.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really enjoy play on my Kindle Fire.  I wish screen zoomed a little bigger than it does, though.  I'd still recommend though.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|If you own a 3D TV and 3D blu ray player both are capable of playing any 3D bluray in 2D.  There's no need for separate discs.  Stop reviewing things that are not released.  If the 3D release has the same special features and gets released at a similar price to the 2D than it doesn't matter.  On top of the fact that this might be a marketing typo.  The product hasn't been officially announced yet and every ones getting upset.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I'm just writing  on my dad's kindle to say that this game rocks! You can literally make anything you want! As for it installing slow,there must be something wrong with your kindle. It really only takes like a minute. This game is very fun for all ages and is a must have for your phone or tablet! I made a flying hungry giant rideable rainbow waffle. Lol!
0767824571|5.0|Ok. So this is one of the best movies EVER! This was a brand new movie, in the cellophane. Works just like you would expect a new DVD movie to work. Is wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is quick and easy to learn.  It is addictive but lite and whimsical.<br /><br />But has components of skill which are again addictive.  I got this one for my daughter but found it more for me.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great Movie and the HD quality on my Kindle Fire is excellent! My husband is a huge Bond fan and feels this was one of the best yet.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I really like Ankers latest high powered 24 watt, Car Charger. It's performance is exactly as stated by Anker, and I love the sleek highly polished and elegant white finish that it comes in. The charger is extremely well built, and it has its 2 sides done In a lighter shade of grey. It fits my hand perfectly, It feels ergonomically designed, and it sits in my hand as if designed personally for my grip.    It looks great. It works very well, and it is compact and sturdy at the same time. . It doesn't have to be shoved into the charging port. this charger glides right into the port, holds itself very firmly once seated in the port, and slips back out easily once I am done using it.    I use these 12 volt car chargers very often at home, as well as when I am driving. It is very useful to have around the house. A friend of mine showed me his Wagon brand AC wall adapter with a Cigerette Lighter port on its other end. I loved the idea of it. So I bought 3 of these, and they work incredibly well. This way i can use these car chargers anywhere in my house and I also don't have to constantly grab AC power cubes and also a bunch of car chargers for when I am out in the field doing residential installations all day.    I tested this Anker product. A good car charger that delivers an actual 24 watt power supply is very rare. This Anker car charger has two ports which are elegantly marked by using a wonderful etching outline that clearly demarcates the Apple Port and the Android Port. The Apple Port in the instruction manual is rated at 2.1 Amps at 5 volts. And the Android port is rated at 1.5 Amps at 5 volts.    If you are like me and use only Apple IOS Devices there is no need to worry. The instructions clearly state that as long as your iPhone has IOS 5 or higher it will charge at full power levels in the Android port. This means that I can now charge, simultaneously, without overloading the charger, both my IPad 2 AND any of my IPhones.    So this is what I tested for to seeif this was true in real world conditions. I plugged the Wagon adaptor into my watt measuring device which is called a Kill-A-Watt meter. It actually is pretty accurate meter. The meter goes into the wall outlet, the Wagon Cigerette lighter adapter is plugged into the Kill a Watt meter, and then I plugged the Anker 24 watt car charger into the Wagon adaptor and the meter.    With my IPad 2 plugged into the Apple marked 2.1 Amp port, my watt meter reported 10.7 watts being used. I then also plugged into the Android 1.5 Amp port my IPhone 4S which has a higher IOS system then the required system 5, and I checked my meter and it was reading about 16 watts with a 1/10 of a watt fluctuation occasionally. I left both my IPad 2 and my iPhone 4 plugged into the Anker charger until my Iphone charged to full. ( About an hour ) They were both charging at their listed specs rate as stated on Apple's Website. My IPad capacity level rose as usual in that hour.    The Anker 24 watt car charger was not even WARM. When I came back in an hour later with both devices charging at their usual rates of charge, I thought the car charger would be hot like so many others get. But this one was room temperature. Simply amazing. The product performance outdid its own rated numbers that Anker assigned to it!    It is easily one of the best performing car chargers available. Maybe the best one. It is so very useful if you work away from home or out of an office all day, in order to keep your devices topped off and constantly charged, it is very convenient and very well designed. It's highly polished white gloss finish is very attractive and also makes it easily findable, and this is very important for me. It is lightweight but with no trade off on specs. And it easily and fully charges one IPad 2 and one iPhone at the same time without producing noticeable heat.    I am very happy with my new charger. I like Anker's products because they all last for a long time, they stand up to being droppedoccasionally, and they are all very well designed. I am and will be using this charger a lot and am very impressed with its overall performance and design. The Anker Car Charger is an all around winner in my opinion.
B00B5A9FOG|4.0|I ended up ordering the last season after Sci Fy decided to move the last few episodes to May sweeps. We enjoyed the season but the last episode was a little drawn out. I thought  when I ordered this that it was supposed to arrive on the release day; however, for some reason it did not.
1596434252|3.0|Marion Bataille, ABC3D (Roaring Brook Press, 2008)<br /><br />I will say right up front (which is a silly thing to start off a one-paragraph review with, but there you go) that I ended up very reluctantly taking points off this delightful little tome because of its fragility; it's a book you're going to want to enjoy a great deal, but you'll be forced to keep it on the shelf rather than on the coffee table if you want it to last any length of time at all. But the pop-ups, transparencies, slidy bits, etc. are all lovely little marvels that will keep you nicely entertained; I just wish the publisher had made it a bit more durable (this is entirely possible, viz. review below of Jungle Animals). ***
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Tyler really puts himself into every song on this album. From the sappy love songs, to the outcast schizo kid, to making fun of trap rappers, this album really embodies everything Tyler is about. If you want a soundtrack for the summer while you're outside as the sun is going down, you're gonna want to have this album.
1594487154|2.0|I had to put this book down 3/4 of the way in. It was advertised to be more of a psychological take on how to sell, but focused far to much on technicalities. I wouldn't recommend it. I believe his past books are much better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game but i can't connect with friends when we are on the same wi-fi  but if anybody knows please tell me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very engaging with great characterizations. Would like to see season 3 for free as soon as it becomes available on Amazon.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I thought this movie was funny and honest about the idea of having &#34;benefits&#34; with friends. The ending was typical but, overall a really good movie.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I'm always on the lookout for platform running games, and this was a good find. The story makes it more interesting, and the controls are decent. Took off one star because it seems like the swipes don't always register when done too quickly, causing death. Plenty of fun and challenge nevertheless!
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Very good product, beautiful sound. You must buy CD+DVD, see the people, the places is wonderful. Amazing project. Waiting for PFC 3.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great selection of noises, we most often use the rainstorm, although some other favs are fire, rocking boat, and ocean waves. Lots of nice custom options like blending sounds together, fading in or out after a certain time, using it as an alarm, ect. An app we wouldn't want to be without, in fact we love to take it traveling too!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Very good product, beautiful sound. You must buy CD+DVD, see the people, the places is wonderful. Amazing project. Waiting for PFC 3.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was definitely worth our time and the amazon rent a movie feature is one of the best, and best price, we have found.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I bought this CD off of a magazine review recommendation.  I'd never even heard of the band before.  Pleasant surprise.  The music is great.  Reminds me a bit of Simon & Garfunkel.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />The ultimate \\"feel good\\" \\"live happily ever after\\" motion picture! I certainly cannot add anything to 428 reviews except to explain why I think we like the film so much. Years ago, I saw the Music Man as an outdoor stage production before seeing the motion picture and spent the next day until now (60 years) trying to understand why it did more than entertain. The film is loaded with human values that are not apparent on the surface. The following quote from Cervantes \\"Don Quixote\\" and then two quotes from Maxwell Maltz' helped me to answer my question. Cervantes said, \\"Too much sanity may be madness. And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be. Maxwell Maltz adds this insight in his book Psycho-Cybernetics: \\"Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a 'real' experience....Imagination sets the goal picture which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of will, as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination.\\" (I believe Psycho-Cybernetics is the best psychology book ever written; better perhaps than all other psychology books combined. At one time in my life I was a psychology major so I've read more than a few psychology books.)<br /><br />76 Trombones can lead our big parade. Change what you imagine and you will change your future. Your dreams can come true. What we imagine, embrace, hope for, and love, becomes a part of us that will change who we are.  In this way, we create our mind, our soul, our nature, and our very being. Expecting and imagining our loved ones to be better than they actually are, will lift them up also.<br /><br />See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures of enduring significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.<br /><br />Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute healpain.net and saveusa.biztute healpain.net and saveusa.biz
B00009NQQO|1.0|I was exited for my 3 year old at first but that was until bath time...This piece of crap didn't stick to the bathroom tiles! It didn't even stick to a mirror. I tried everything to get it to stick and it just kept falling off. To be fair, only one suction cup didn't stick and kept popping out, but whats the point??? I'm not trying to teach my son how to make a basket while intoxicated. If I could give it a zero, I would. there's no point in this toy if it doesn't stick to the walls in the bathroom. Smh...I hope Alex Panline recalls this product and gets the suction cups to work.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|IT IS FUN AND  IT IS FAST AND MY 2YR OLD LIKES IT AND  SHE LOVES THE FLASHING COLORS<br />THANKS
B005FISBTO|5.0|I cannot wait to see Season 7; but, I also think that the prices on Amazon right now are way too high and I cannot and will not pay that much for one season that only has 12 or maybe 13 episodes.  I will wait until the price is right for me.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|Took a sec to get everything set right, between router and app.  Makes me want to get more cams.  I never give 5 stars.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I loved this book.  I have wanted to read it for a very long time and kept putting it off.  Once I knew a movie was being made I quickly put this at the top of my reading list.  I enjoyed the journey this young man took.  The will to live is strong.  The ability to adjust to circumstances amazing.  The words filled my mind with imaginable scenery that was breath taking.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Margin Call follows the employees of a large Wall Street investment bank during the beginning of the 2007-08 financial crisis. I'll leave it at that to shorten the review, although the story is a lot more complicated. Margin Call is a smart and consistent drama.<br /><br />The story in Margin Call covers an often sensitive subject, and creates a compelling drama. This is a film that relies solely on its dialogue. It does this right as it creates engaging and immersive conversations consistently that continuously move the movie forward. The ending of the film is amazing, and felt like a huge blow. The acting in this film is superb; Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, and Zachary Quinto are the standouts with their magnificent performances, although the rest of the cast did an amazing job. The music in this film was also great and matched the atmosphere of this film, and the editing was exceptional.<br /><br />Overall, Margin Call is a brilliant and compelling drama with excellent performances. As of 4/12/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, and a purchase is highly recommended.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very good book, kept me in suspense the whole time I was reading it, I think it would make a good movie
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I gave this book a 4.0 rating, thinking it was a sweet story, but somewhat predictable, right up until the last chapter which revealed a  heavenly, heart-felt ending - just like Notebook.  Any book that can make me unexpectedly have to wipe tears from my kindle, well deserves a 5 star rating.  I have read many Nicholas Sparks novels, but there is something about Safe Haven and Notebook that stand up on their own, one step ahead of the pack, allowing the reader to take away a real-life message and  keep it forever in your heart.  I never saw THAT coming, and yeah, I loved the book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun epic and it like a cop vs robber movie in now this is what people should call a game not like black ops<br />:)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this game. Play it everyday. I have spent a good bit of money on this game. The only issue I ran into is that I can no longer expand my zoo. I have reach full capacity and cannot rescue anymore animals. I would hate to see some of my habitats have to go into storage :(  there could always be more updates and better improvements.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book!  From half point on I just could not stop reading. I knew something was coming but it kept me on edge right to the end!!!!
1573226521|4.0|I was on holiday (from the US) in Australia, bartending in a Melbourne nightclub when I first read this book. The adventure Richard went on inspired me to quit the bartending gig and backpack up and down the eastern coast of Australia for 6 months. One of the best decisions I've ever made!
1401324649|3.0|All in all I enjoyed the book. That said, I wish the author would have put the primary focus on the centenarian's current adventure, as opposed to the Forrest Gump type back story of his life. If you're into history, you might enjoy some of that background as I did, but if not, the story may feel bogged down at times. I really enjoyed the characters in the present day segments of the book and would have probably rated this a 5-star had that been where the emphasis was.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|That is a strong statement coming from someone who has watched Toy Story since he was a small child.  But I truly believe that UP is Pixar's finest achievement.<br /><br />The movie starts with the most heartbreaking and tear-jerking opening I have ever witnessed in a film. Not many things, in film or otherwise, can just push me to cry out of sheer emotion, but by god, UP had me in tears more than once during its 96 minutes.  The opening shows how the protagonist,  balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, met his future wife, Ellie, as a boy.  She is adventurous and energetic, and shows Carl all her secrets about what she wants most direly to do when she gets older: build her dream house on the edge of Paradise Falls, a beautiful waterfall in South America.  The film then goes on to show a summary of the couple's life, from marriage to old age, and finally the death of Ellie, leaving Carl a bitter old man.  This scene only lasts about ten minutes, but it had me sobbing.  It was probably the most touching thing I've ever witnessed in a film.  As Nostalgia Critic said, they probably could have ended the film right after that scene and it would have still been amazing.<br /><br />Carl begins his dull day, and we meet the boy scout,ahem, \\"Wilderness Explorer\\", Russell. He's a determined kid who wants to earn his final badge, Assisting the Elderly.  He reminds Carl not only of himself as an adventurous kid, but as the son he never had. (Oh, did I mention Ellie couldn't conceive? Did I also mention how sad that opening is?) Anyway, Carl is annoyed by him at first, but over the course of the movie, they form a strong bond, trust me.<br /><br />That's as much of the story I'll give away, as I would like to say a little about the animation.  It is unbelievable.  Pixar always demands high expectations, but lord, this film is gorgeous, especially on Blu-Ray.  The colors are beyond vivid and pleasant to look at, and the attention to detail is astounding.  As the movie progresses, Carl begins to grow white stubble on his face, as he doesn't have the time to shave.  The fur on the dogs looks so real, but the dogs themselves are cartoony in design.  It makes for a perfect blend of realism and cartoony-ness that makes Pixar's animation so charming.<br /><br />This movie is quite perfect, from its characters to its story to its animation.  It is paced extraordinarily well, hitting you with powerful emotions one moment, and having you chuckling or outright guffawing at a well-placed joke the next.  It has all the quality Pixar is known for times ten.  I not only believe this is Pixar's greatest masterpiece, but it is certainly one of my favorite films of all time.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I really like the Allman Brothers music and I think Greg has a great voice.  I also love the blues, especially for the heartfelt, pure, sometimes even gut-wrenching emotions that come out through the music.  That being said, it seems this is a bit flat.  I can't hear any fire.  With most of the songs being covers, it's hard not to compare them to earlier versions by other artists, and mostly I prefer other versions of the songs...mainly because of the emotion.<br /><br />i.e.<br />Little by Little < BB King on Blues Summmit<br />Blind Man < 'When I left Home', Buddy Guy on Stone Crazy  (sounds like basically the same song with a different title)<br />I Can't Be Satisfied < Muddy just about any version<br /><br />Maybe I'm setting my expectations too high, but I know that Greg is capable of displaying that level of emotion (Live at the Fillmore), it just doesn't seem to come out on this disc.  Other reviews say the sound it terrible, but it seemed like the 'sound' of the music is the best aspect.
B005R32L66|1.0|this didn't work I could get broken sound and maybe the forth time a hello but no picture not worth wasting your time on.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Simply the best.  My daughter who is 15 loves the &#34;corporate corruption&#34; song LOL, and the boys love it so much.  Thankfully I have on the movie on the iPad so the kids mostly watch it there.  The code was very easy to enter.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with the characters in the first chapter and from then on, I couldn't put this book down! John Green is an incredible author!!! I definitely recommend this book to everyone who loves to laugh, cry, and be inspired!!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Finally On Demanded Argo this past weekend. The movie certainly deserved all of the high acclaim it received from the critics and the film award associations. It was well written, entertaining and quite thrilling.<br /><br />The movie is the depiction of how CIA operative Tony Mendez led the rescue of a group of U.S. Embassy employees out of a hostile Tehran during the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis. I understand that there is some controversy over how some of these actual events were portrayed for the sake of dramatic effect in the film versus how the events played out in reality. But look...it wasn't supposed to be a documentary; it's a Hollywood movie. So of course true to form there were some times where Director Ben Affleck self indulgently seemed to make his character the only logical voice in the room while portraying the CIA brass as obtuse and indifferent emotionally to what was being suffered by the hostages. That's Hollywood.<br /><br />Argo is a fine telling of the story of how 6 US diplomats were rescued and brought home from what must have been absolute Hell at the time. Don't skip Argo. Great movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The cast is great, I love that Watson is a female.  The Plot lines are interesting and have good twists.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Don't let the stills fool you. There's a great mix of new and old graphic styles, and they work together perfectly. Classic game with updated graphics.
B005IQZB14|5.0|SUCH A GREAT BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. THIS BOOK HELPED ME  TO THINK MAYBE I'VE BEEN OVER-Thinking lots of stuff. Thanks Cheryl.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great graphics. Great controls. Great is just how to explain this game. If your a fan of Mario Kart and Temple Run this game is a mix of the two. Looks as good as it plays. Samsung Galaxy Note 2. However seems a bit more laggy on my Nexus 7 which is Tegra 3 powered which this game is optimized for?
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Great game. Awesome graphics. Too much Hidden object rounds for me but still an ok game to play if you have time to waste
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My grandchildren get so very excited with Angry Birds and anything Star Wars. I can keep them entertained for hours (if I let them) with this game. Lives up to the Angry Birds creativity.
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Title says it all. Do not watch with children around. Michael Fassbender is absolutely amazing. I watch this movie all the time.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My autistic grandson loves this movie. He can't get enough of it, and can't stop talking about the &#34;good Jack Frost.&#34; So glad to have films with happy characters.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|THIS BOOK WAS ALRIGHT ALTHOUGH IF IT WAS LKNGER THEN IT COULD BE MY KIND OF BOOK ! I hope you enjoy it tho !!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good for family and children. Would be good to have a version of the game that doesn't require items to be purchased with real money and more options for mini games!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Very interesting view into the politics and partisanship of the times.  I am very thankful for Lincoln and more so after seeing the film.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|This show is very funny and I love the characters. I wish I could hang out with them in New York!
B000FA675C|5.0|I LOVED this book! It kept me on edge  till I finished the whole thing. It felt like I was holding my breath.<br />The story mixes fact and fiction, but it all feels like fact... so entertaining!
B0093ST02E|4.0|Michelle Williams was amazing in her performance. Her character swallowed me up as I lived her life with her. She portrayed a woman who was likeable and charming one moment and annoying the next. It all worked. Loved it.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|love the movie.  nice to be able to watch anytime I want.  would recomend to anyone who loves a great romance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun,addicting and awesome.I was first all,they copied temple run.now I realized Subway Surfers is better than temple run<br /><br />GET THIS GAME,ITS RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As good as the first two books were, I feel the author phoned it in on this one.  I was disappointed pretty much the whole way through.  Bummer
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This book had a fairly interesting concept that ended up so muddled in football crap that the entire book was a disappointment.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Simple runner but in first person view and in a car, think temple run for kids :) also not to hard to earn coins which is . Nice.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is really useful and informative I like using it before leaving the house to see the exact battery on my kindle fire. I think it work really well when you use your phone or tablet for long periods of time and don't look at the battery often.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A great read. Couldn't put it down. A well written book about life in combat and life as a SEAL.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The plot is very week and poorly written.,The story has been told many times by many authors! It is not worth the money,each book is only a little over 200 pages long. The author is pumping out a book a month. At $2.99 to $3.99 a book it is not worth the money.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Well here we are talking about another classic. What can be said about this master piece. This movie covers part of Lincoln's term in office that has never been addressed. There was a President Lincoln other than the Civil War times, yes this covers the President political life as well as the famous War. This is a good movie to sit down with your children and watch and enjoy. I recommend it!
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Fun read! A feel good book. I found myself laughing out loud at times. The characters are warm and endearing.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle has always been consistantly good, but  Season 5 is the best of the series! Hope Season 6 puts it to shame !!!
1439148953|5.0|I did. It's not there.<br />Jean'll be awfully sorry if we don't show.<br /><br />Sure you can tune in to Mad Men and you'll get your fix for the past sure enough. If you want it New York style best read Brooklyn, by Colm Toibin. Eilis's journey from Ireland to America is the real deal. Her richly drawn character will have you pacing the showroom floor at Bartocci's clock watching and thinking of her sister Rose or her handsome boyfriend Tony.<br />Authentic and endearing characters like Father Flood and Mrs. Kehoe work to pull all corners of this fine coming to America novel in tightly and completely. Toibin doesn't skimp on details and markers such as the spare use of heat back home (Ireland), compared to lavish use of electricity here in Brooklyn. This novel kind of reminds me of Dreiser, in the very direct way that Eilis takes over the mind of the reader with new experience and unspoken mores. When a family tragedy occures, suddenly Eilis's new life and love are threatened, and it is only a turn of fate, unexpectedly so by Mrs. Kelly that serves as  rudder to Eilis' lost ship. Noone could claim dissappointment from reading this gorgeously written novel, only in that there is an ending. Toibin captures a time period so accurately, and one that America seems to have risen up and stepped away from as if the mold having been broken, now so changed may never recognize the beauty in what simple pleasures and lifestyles once held. A fine read from start to finish.
B0064W652A|3.0|Long time fan boy that I am, I would have liked more Barman and less of the Catwoman romance angle. Beyond that this was a good read with a few decent twists.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It's angry birds with different backgrounds.  If you like the original you'll like this one too.  Plays the same as old one.
B008MM9630|4.0|we'll... its good for occupiying little childern. the only reason rated it for stars instead of five is because in order to complete some quests;  you need to buy diamonds which cost real money.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read! I had to put down sometimes because I could not stop laughing! The characters were well developed! I'm going to miss them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great application. Only one ad between each game. I enjoy that I can choose a random or winning deal.
B004GYY714|5.0|Although I have the very good UK radio player, Tune In does that little bit extra and covers many more Radio stations from around the world, wouldn't be without it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game. Colors and graphics are good. Tiles large enough to be able to see the design. I have not played all levels, but so far,so good
1878424319|5.0|A gentle and loving guide to better living. Ancient wisdom mythology meets with relevance in our modern day. Impeccable word, don't take things personally, don't assume, and do your best.
B00452J5IW|5.0|One of my favorite classics, the first &#34;Starship&#34; album though not really a &#34;Starship&#34; album. Based on the work of Robert Heinlen with a definite counter-culture twist. There are some unexpected gems here, particularly the first 2 songs, Mau-Mau and The Baby Tree. Mau Mau, a high energy protest song and the Baby Tree, sort of a lullaby contrast perfectly and speak to the contradicting philosophies of that era. SQ is good for that time although the album sounds better in all its analog glory. I waited a long time for this CD and am happy to add it to my collection. Lots of guest players, singers  and contributors. A must have for baby boomers even if on the tail end of this era as I am. Three thumbs up.... LOL!!
1401924751|5.0|These cards are amazing.  I've had wonderful readings for myself as well as for my family.  Love them  not only for your life's purpose but advice to pull you through your day.  Well worth it.  Highly recommend!
B004G6TD4S|5.0|...until I moved into the higher quality sound arena then I went back to the first two ELP Albums. That is not to say I do not hold this album in high regards but when I began to be more fussy about sound (late 70s) this album fell by the wayside. Then i heard there was some re-mastering done to their catalog and of course I repurchased this CD and there are improvements to the sound, enough for mew to move this back into my listenable category. If you are considering this re-master go for it! The album itself is great, I love this version of what we called &#34;classical-rock&#34; back in the day but I believe may be &#34;prog&#34; today. If you are looking at this then you know what this CD is. Hit the Purchase button man, you won't regret it!
B002WN35DC|5.0|I would recommend everybody to read this book, especially children, I loved it, price is awesome and I think classic books are great
B00A1OZBSQ|5.0|A very well written, well researched look at how the big food manufacturers use what science has discovered about our senses to tailor their foods to be as delicious and addictive as possible. It's no accident that Kraft Dinner is delicious, that kids love Lunchables and that kettle chips have that amazing crunch.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|if you like suspense, I recommend this book, it`s a masterpiece, it teaches you no matter how good you think you are at being bad, it`ll get to you sooner or later
1932735410|5.0|Anyone looking to study and take the PMP exam must have this book. I bought it a a great price and have been studying like crazy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great for kids, I play it whenever I`m bored, I`m not too good, but i enjoy trying to get better
B009YP9L7U|4.0|An enjoyable read. Likeable characters and an interesting story. Four stars only because it wasn't very original. I knew what would happen as I normally do with romance novels, but still a fun read.
0140544518|5.0|I have always loved this book since I first read it in elementary school.  My son is three and now I am constantly reading it to him.  We read it every night before bed.  It's a fun twist to the traditional story.
B00006O9YN|3.0|Good cover but not a lot of protection for phone. no padding in cover at all. Good fo just attaching to belt and carrying.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I expected more from Ellen - but this book was a great disappointment.  Still love her, but will not take a chance again on her writings - she needs to stick with her show and unique way of entertaining.  Putting her thoughts on paper just doesn't come across the same.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  It had a lot of spins and twists when you think everything is going smoothly!  Really great read thanks!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|If the zombie apocalypse ever does befall us, this will be your manual. Although some may find that the lack of a central storyline a disappointing, don't worry, the different stories make up for it.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|This was shipped very fast and the product is perfect for Tummy Time and playing on back. My baby (3 months old) loves the tiger that makes sound and can hit the ball making the sound on his own. If you are looking for a toy to help development this is a great one to choose! Tummy Time for my baby became more fun because of the mirror and the rattle ball built in.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|\\"Gothika\\" is one of those movies that does everything wrong. The ghost story is wrong. The murder mystery is wrong. Even the title is wrong.<br /><br />And while it has a promising premise, this ghastly horror movie dives headfirst into a sea of bland cliches, and promptly drowns itself. The plot is an insane self-devouring plot hole, partly because the ghost seems to act completely at random -- and Halle Berry gives an embarrassingly bad performance, although it's not wholly her fault.<br /><br />Dr. Miranda Grey (Berry) is on the way home from her job at a mental hospital when she has a nasty car crash. The cause: a naked blonde girl who promptly bursts into flames.<br /><br />When Miranda wakes up, she's locked in a cell in the mental hospital, and is told by her friend Pete (Robert Downey Jr.) that she murdered her beloved husband Doug (Charles S. Dutton). Now she's being held for observation while the police investigate -- and before long, a spectral presence begins attacking her. Of course, nobody believes her.<br /><br />Miranda begins ineptly trying to puzzle out what the ghost is trying to communicate to her, and why it possessed her so that it could murder Doug. All she has to go on is a mysterious tattoo of a burning woman, and the story of a doctor's dead daughter. But if Miranda figures out what happened to the ghost, she might end up in even more danger.<br /><br />There is literally nothing about \\"Gothika\\" that works -- it fails as a murder mystery, it fails as a thriller, it fails as a ghost story, and it fails COMPLETELY as a horror movie. Swimming pools? Not scary. Thunderstorms? Not scary. Empty hallways? Not scary. Tossing your head and screaming? Not scary. Halle Berry's hair? Well... maybe a little scary.<br /><br />The script feels like it went through a dozen rewrites, leaving it with little internal logic. For instance, he ghost seems to be acting at random -- she swings between guiding Miranda and trying to kill her. The dialogue is horribly trite (\\"I don't believe in ghosts.\\" \\"Neither do I, but they believe in me\\") and there are long scenes that seem to have no point. What is the point of Miranda escaping just so she can be caught again?<br /><br />It also has a downright weird attitude towards mental illness. Apparently being placed in a mental institution INSTANTLY causes you to act like a lunatic. Oh, and that traumatized woman who claims that Satan regularly rapes her? She's actually sane! Really!<br /><br />Halle Berry's performance is just wretched here -- she spends most of the movie thrashing, shrieking and running through empty corridors with no real goal.

B009GEYX5E|3.0|When the photos decide to work, they look awesome. when they don't work, you become very sad. i needed 7 photos for a project and i ended up having to buy one more pack due to an amount of duds, like 3 out of the first eight pack. second pack i bought, same thing, about 3 duds and the rest worked. beware the enticing aroma of nostalgia
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale is one of those rare actors whose devotion to his craft goes way beyond the usual \\"I gained/lost ten pounds, so give me an Oscar!\\" stuff.<br /><br />No, this guy whittled himself down to the bone for \\"The Machinist,\\" a movie where nothing can be trusted and nobody is what they seem. This is one of the movies that convincingly depicts what it's like to lose your mind, little by little, and director Brad Anderson fills the entire movie with a bleak, industrial feeling that makes you feel like you're locked in a dystopian nightmare.<br /><br />Trevor Reznik (Bale) works in a factory in Los Angeles. He hasn't slept in a whole year, and barely eats anything. He's only able to keep his life organized with post-it notes. Clocks are stuck. His sole comfort comes from the nurturing prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and his nightly visits to a restaurant to speak with the beautiful waitress Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n).<br /><br />But strange things are happening in his life. Someone leaves a hangman game on his fridge. A coworker (Michael Ironside) loses his arm in an accident. And a mysterious new worker named Ivan (John Sharian) seems to be following Trevor everywhere -- but everyone else claims that Ivan doesn't exist. Trevor becomes convinced that a conspiracy is being built up around him, but the only way he can get to the truth is if he remembers the past...<br /><br />Christian Bale is the key to \\"The Machinist\\" working as a movie. He gives a brilliant performance as a man whose life and sanity have been slowly chiseled away over a year, yet he doesn't seem to realize that anything is wrong with HIM. It's painful to see an essentially nice, ordinary guy degenerate into a wild, forgetful maniac convinced that everybody is working against him.<br /><br />He also lost sixty pounds to do this movie, and his emaciated body and sunken eyes are just PAINFUL to watch. But you have to admire the dedication of a man who does this sort of thing for his art -- especially if he's playing Batman next.<br /><br />But Brad Anderson's direction is important in making that performance shine. Everything is bleak and industrial, with lots of steel, concrete and glaring fluorescent lights. Everything is filmed in a sickly grey-green color that leaves everybody looking washed out and dirty, and everything we see and hear seems slightly \\"off.\\"<br /><br />In fact, everything has a feeling of profound WRONGNESS. Everything feels surreal and off, and the world sometimes seems to warp as Trevor drifts through it. Trevor's increasingly erratic behavior begins to reveal that the madness all centers on him, and it's only at the end that things finally snap into clarity.<br /><br />And yes, it's crammed with symbolism, but it's not immediately clear what some of it means. The most shocking example is when Trevor rides into the \\"highway to hell\\" funhouse, and is confronted by demons, corpses, fire and severed limbs.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\" is not an easily movie to watch, but it is a brilliant one -- a bleak, bizarro film revolving around one man's guilt and madness. And Christian Bale proved through it that he is one of our greatest living actors.ng for his art -- especially if he's playing Batman next.<br /><br />But Brad Anderson's direction is important in making that performance shine.

B00B2064IY|5.0|Tight, three-piece rock. I was feeling down, looking for music to pick me up. Jimi's songs make me feel good.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|An instant classic, this movie cracks me up every time I watch it.  Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore and more all at their best!  Slightly dark and bizarre humor with many quote worthy lines.  Some of the Cohen brothers best work in my opinion.  Apparently &#34;The Dude&#34; is roughly based on a person with whom they went to college.  Somehow that makes the movie even funnier!  Not sure I care for the cover artwork on this Widescreen Collector's Edition, but I was penny pinching and wanted to get the instant download (which ironically enough did not work, however Amazon Customer Service apologized for the technical error and gave me a credit on my account).  Skip through the &#34;extras&#34; and enjoy the film!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie was very well done; the acting, the sets, everything was top notch. Learned a lot about the 13 Amendment and the political pressures leading to its passage. Highly recommend!

B007XHWNRG|5.0|I enjoyed his 1989 album and his other solo one as well. It has good songs and Davie crosby on it.
B005USZYDU|5.0|A fast paced cleverly written novel for kids and adults too. Theo is quite the boy hero. Now I must read the Seahawks.
B0012GMXYM|5.0|he never changes at all. he stay the same. i like all of his stuff. this one is a good one to have.
0061950726|5.0|More than a heart-warming, well-written story, this novel casts light on an important but little-known phase of American history. My mother was one of the 200,000+ children sent west on orphan trains from New York City. We are still trying to find her background. A good read, a beautiful portrayal of a relationship between two tough yet vulnerable people -- a teenager and an older woman -- and incidentally educational. (I love having my horizons expanded while I'm enjoying myself.)
B0049VGTGA|5.0|I liked his genesis stuff but his solo stuff is good as well to have. I like this one because it is his first and it has In the air tonight and missed again.
0451196716|5.0|When I first read 'The Long Walk' in the 1980s I thought it was a story primarily about a bunch of teenagers acting like brats whilst on some weird forced long march through Maine.  The kids play mind games on each other, and it all gets very cruel.  But upon rereading the book I paid closer attention to the entire concept and the author's description of how the folks watching the long walk behaved.  I found parallels to America's current obsession with game shows and reality television.  It's all very ugly and Stephen King brought this ugliness to light in this dark fable.<br /><br />Bottom line: Stephen King himself probably didn't realize the staying power of this book.  Strongly recommended.
B000002H1T|5.0|I like there early stuff and this one is a good one too. I like the poster and the album.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I noticed some spelling and grammatical errors.  It feels rushed and incomplete.  I absolutely hated the ending.  Love the series, just not this book.
B000002OTL|5.0|I loved the movie and the sound track. it is a good sound track to get and one you well enjoy.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A good read and a good cry!  You will be drawn into the story and rooting for the heroine. You'll love it!

B002UZ5J72|4.0|We liked this book because it was adventurous, scarey, funny and the people were brave. We liked all the characters even the witch a little bit! We loved the lion the most.
B002R68U7K|5.0|I wait to get this one. i got it and love it. it has b sides and her hits as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the first book I've read in years! And this is by far one I will recommend to friends! The author does a great job captivating you and wanting more.  I can't wait to start the second book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is 'the' top bingo game out there in 'my' opinion. Very and addictive! Whoever thought of the power ups is a genius!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I guess, I like more fast pased games. I like playing bingo at the fair and places like that. This was the first bingo game I tried on my Kindle. I thought it was too slow. Kinda boring.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the good ole days! If you are a fan of Pac-Man, this is the game for you. Only thing you need is the old school joy stick to make it perfect.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a good game for both kids and adults. All three of my kids (9,8,4) love this game. It is technically too difficult for my 4 year old, but I help him and let him think he is doing it. He loves it, lol. I have played it some too. It is addictive. I like that it makes you think.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My son is addicted to all the Lep's World games. Lep's World 2 is more challenging and more fun too!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|It is kinda hard for the kids (9,8,4). It takes forever to load on my kindle, and it freezes up quite a bit. However, we do like the game concept.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I had no problem viewing it, but the storyline was a little boring to me. I have watched it multiple times, but I still feel it was just an okay movie.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a good matching game for the kids, and a good time waster for adults. It has two different ways to play. They are both timed, but it gives some variety.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love the show! I Had no problems viewing it. I Can't wait for next season. Im hooked on it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've always love this game, it's make you think and be creative.<br />There's in app purchase where's $1 will grand you extra level and any future level.<br />another in app purchases are for avatars set for $1 per 9 avatars.
B002M85TF4|5.0|Whole family enjoyed it. We all thought this was a better version than the newest one. Recommend it for all
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I liked this story because the events could be non-fiction in the near future. It was refreshing to read something that didn't contain any malicious power struggles. A great adventure story for space-buffs.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I ordered this one because I'm fan of Alien.<br />and this Anthology is really worth to keep in your home!<br />cover, inside, full color, hardcover, glossy and shiny, very luxury.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|John Stockwell just wants to pass high school, so he sneaks onto an Army base and steals an odd machine to use as his science class project.  What he doesn't know is that the machine does more than just flash some pretty lights.  Soon, the whole town is in an uproar, as everyone is trying to turn off the machine!!  Very well done, and enjoyable to watch.
0810994739|4.0|Kinney's Story \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules\\"<br />The Middle Child<br />\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules\\" focuses on the problems of Greg, a middle child. It starts with him telling about his lousy summer, and that his older brother Rodrick is the only person that knows the secret that could ruin Greg's life. The story is a series of diary entries wrote by Greg about his journeys through life. Greg is a nonathletic unpopular kid who is always in some sort of trouble and trying to keep his brother from telling his biggest secret.<br />  Greg is a nonathletic kid whose dad wants him to be great. Greg's dad forces him to join the swim team every summer. Greg was the worst swimmer on the team, he was even afraid of the starter pistol. Greg \\"tried to convince dad to let him do Water Jazz (p. 5)\\" just so he could get off the team. Greg doesn't have many friends which is one reason his summer was lousy, with his best friend being gone on vacation for the entire time. When he returns to school he is always trying to be the center of attention so he can get noticed and be known for something.<br />  Greg is a bit of a trouble maker. At school he wants to be the class clown, Chirag Gupta was his punch line. He got his whole class to pretend like Chirag was invisible. This leads to his mom getting a phone call at home. Even at home he was always doing small things to get in trouble, like eating the gingerbread house and then lying about it. He even helped Rodrick hide a party that was thrown while their parents were gone. One of the worst things was trying to trick his mom. She was trying to help them earn money \\"she called the money mom bucks (p. 66)\\", it was fake money from a board game they could cash into her for real money. Well Greg found what game the money was from and took a bunch, so he could have money whenever he wanted it.<br />  So during this whole story Rodrick has a secret about Greg. Rodrick uses this to get Greg to cover for him, such as not telling their parents about a party that Rodrick had and helping Rodrick clean up so he doesn't get caught. Greg is always looking for some dirt that he can use against Rodrick in case Rodrick tries to tell everyone about his most humiliating secret. They seem to have a lot of the same troubles and fights as most siblings. This makes for some entertaining and funny interactions between them that you might be able to relate to.<br /> Greg seems to have a hard time as the middle child, always in the wrong place at the wrong time, with a humiliating secret being held over his head. This was a great story to sit back and read for a relaxing night. There was no thought required only laughs to enjoy. It is a good story to read to kids with a lot of lessons to be learned. It is the second book in the series by Jeff Kinney \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\\"<br /> <br />Reference<br />Kinney, J (2008). Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules. New York, NY: Amulet Books
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Wonderfully done story of Santa Claus in New York.  Edmund Gwenn plays Santa, who replaces a drunk fake-Santa in Macy's Christmas parade, and becomes everyone's favorite.  Even the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa...a very young Natalie Wood...starts to believe.  With Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and William Frawley, this one is truly a must see, and a classic for every Christmas.
B000FA675C|5.0|I first read The Da Vinci Code in hardcover a few years ago..Still an excellent book! Very intriguing. Hard to put it down.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I know you think its too expensive, but this app is worth the money! There are tons of filters, fonts, and other effects. The pics save pertectly! I highly recomend it!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|A down to earth story about the new girl in town meets the boy next door. Too bad the initial attraction wasn't more fully developed to warrant the degree of disappointment displayed when things didn't work out. Otherwise an okay read.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|There are a sufficiency of precedents for this movie, but that fact matters little. Everything has some  preceding model.  Where this film  stands out are the performances which director, Martin Scorsese, elicited from his cast and the suspense he was able to create. It is the kind of film in which revealing almost anything can help undo some of the pleasure of watching. Suffice to say, DiCaprio is a Federal Marshall, on assignment to an Alcatraz type of island in Boston Bay, home to a  Federal Prison for the Criminally Insane. He has been assigned a new partner; their job being the capture of a dangerous escaped patient. All but the opening scenes take place in or about the hospital on the island. Quickly the Marshall comes to the conclusion that something is amiss. What are the real problems? Who are the good guys and who the bad. The  mystery comes to a typical Scorcese  climax in the final scene.<br />I can recommend this to those who like enterprising 'who dun its'.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|This cd exceeded my expectations . I am more of a Rock and Roll kind of guy but really enjoy Eric's music. Lots of great guitar and old style vocals . Not the pop sound that is taking over country music of today. This isn't one bad song on the entire cd. The production quality is very good so enjoy
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The game of thrones series of books are a great can't put them down series.<br />Only problem is that at the end of book five there is no telling how long it will be before the next one is out.
1451675046|5.0|Richard Dawkins has penned another very accessible book that advances the cause of rational thinking, and entertains along the way.<br /><br />If only the religionists, astrologists, supernaturalists and the other quacks could bother to read this book the world would be a much better place.<br /><br />Dawkins has written a couple of books that dismantle fantastic thinking, but he does it so simply and easily in this particular book that one must admire the sheer economy of the endeavor.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />BTW - isn't it interesting that every 5-star review of this book has \\"0 of 2\\" or \\"0 of 3\\" etc readers finding the positive reviews to be helpful? I'm guessing the Christianistas are about their business, trying desperately to vote down yet another book that they have never read and will never read, lest their childish fantasy world of talking snakes and Jeebus returning from the dead come under assault. It really is a transparently infantile exercise, is it not?
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It was a good game but once I finished it, the best I could do was try to beat my time.  Lost interest after that.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Robert Downer Jr is famous now due to Iron Man however he is a true actor and this is one of his best performance. In addition Charles Chaplin is famous but few people nows what was behind this comedian. The adaptation is very good and you can learn a little history on this movie. I have seen this movie at least 5 times and I would watch it again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|First of all it is 6:25am and I have yet to go to sleep thanks to this book! I simply could not put it down. What a well written, roller coaster of a story. Though the characters are quite young, the story is completely believable and full of everything from drama to love to heartache and humor. I went back and forth for a few months, unsure if I should buy this book or not. After finally buying it only last night, I'm extremely happy about my decision. I can't wait to read more from Jamie McGuire. What a fantastic story!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It was okay.  I think my grandkids would have liked it better than I.  I was a just a little disappointed in it, but overall, I would recommend it for a young family.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Respect for women and children, patriotism, and Stan Lee!  Good verses evil, where good wins but not without cost.  In a world where patriotism, sacrifice, respect, love without sex are rarely seen, this is an uplifting movie.  Better yet, not all ends happily ever after, but you understand the sacrifice.

B008KMHFJY|5.0|I have to say I loved Beautiful Disaster.<br />I read it in under 24 hours. it was addictive. I stumbled across it when looking for something similar to Fifty Shades, Bared to You trilogy and Crossfire series. I loved all the books but this one was different. It has more of a story to it. You get caught up in their lives and the Will they/Won't they.<br />A really good read. Highly recommended.[[ASIN:B009CRJLHU Beautiful Disaster]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it was a true adventure and bet the others will be better gonna read those to!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give it a 5 star.<br />U can really feel what she's feeling<br />I've read this book over 60 times and it still makes me weep

B005MLOOJA|5.0|I quickly became addicted to this show after finding it on Amazon prime. I watched 3 seasons in less than 2 weeks. I love the court scenes, the interaction of all characters and the love triangle.

B005K17RU0|3.0|I don't like the fact I have to shut the app down every time I use it. When I get out of it it should close without using juice on my phone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my new all time favorite book.  Hugh Howey is an amazing author that bought his story of a dystopian post apocalyptic world where people live in a silo to life.  His descriptions played out like movie in my head and the story remained quick paced.  I have already started the second series and am looking forward to him publishing the third.  I think of a fan for life.  I would recommend this book to anyone young adult and up.  There is some foul language and some violence.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|Nice movie if you are into musicals, but be aware that it has strong sexual overtones that children should not watch. Otherwise, a nice diversion from reality since it is totally make believe. Acting was average, nothing to speak of and the actors are boring and lacking in character development.
B00156VGX8|5.0|The movie is definitely not for everyone especially not for children. I am giving it five stars for the acting it was really good it made me feel for the characters pain. The subject matter is what was conflicting and disturbing though a reality because it’s something that does happen to people it make it more real and the acting on Monica's part just made me want to kill the freaking guy I won't say more to not ruin the movie for anyone interested just don't let the kids watch it will traumatize them for life
B00633W614|4.0|Good story, too bad the next in the series is not available yet.<br /><br />Still the kindle price is the same as the paperback.
B0094M2O7C|5.0|What can I say anything with Kate is just great oops that rymed anyway I must say It wasn't as good as the first two she was in but I still loved it I'd go see another if she's in it. Its a good movie even if your not a fan of Kate Beckinsale but they need to bring back a specific charicter if they make another I won't say to not ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not much depth. Lots of unusual uses of words/phrases that probably would not be said normally. Ex: &#34;we'll have two portions of pancakes&#34; when they are at IHOP. Who says that? &#34;If it pleases you, kind sir, may I beg you to provide me with a Big Mac and a portion of fries?&#34;<br /><br />Also, try counting the number of times she blushes/flushes. Probably over 50 times.<br /><br />I only read it to see why it has been #1 on the NY Times list for so long. I am still not sure why.<br /><br />I think the best part is the cover -- great color and layout :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 6 year old daughter really enjoy s this game. She plays it every night. It really is enjoyable for her to take care o f her horse. She is even loves animals and this game is great for her.

1476733953|5.0|\\"Wool\\" is a great read, except for two things: (1) there, geologically speaking, is no oil under or near Atlanta (the apparent remnant of a city seen in the distance from Silo 18 [see page 293]). Mineral (metals) deposits are possible, but in only very low to low quantities and types. Howey should have done better research as to the mineral/oil wealth under his silos. And (2) using the so-2010s saying \\"going forward,\\" which he uses a lot is an indication of too much \\"today\\" (buzzwords/phrases)influence.<br /><br />The presence of metal ores and oil (petroleum) under the silos seems to play a big role in the long-term survival of the silos. Howey's error is so common among writers; they take science for granted --- for, often, they do not have a good science background.<br /><br />I look forward to reading his next book; however it proves to me, as a writer, that when you use technology or science, of which you have little strength, one should be careful. When I write, let's say, about medicine as it might affect a character, I am quite nervous. I seek the advice of experts. Howey should have done the same.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a wonderful surprising and exciting product for all ages. It's a great idea for kiss mainly I love it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It has been years since I picked up a novel and read for recreation. I'm someone who has not done alot of recreational reading since high school (30 now) however this book, out of several I tried to pick up, has grasp my attention to read again.  I have a passion for reading up on our advancement in space travel such as following Mars 500 and this book captures the possibility of events and breath taking moments of what could be a reality.Thanks Andy for igniting my imagination once again inside a book, it has been way to long.

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This 4-port compact hub is pretty small and lightweight.  It measures about 2 ½ X 2 ½ inches and is only about a ½ inch thick.  The built-in USB cord extends about 6 inches (including the USB plug) (about 4 inches if you don't include the plug).  At first I didn't like the shape of this hub. I thought having the ports all in one line would be better, but after using it for a while I realized that this design (of having one USB hub on each of the 4 sides), leaves plenty of room for USB plugs that are wide, like some of the flash drives that I have. They wouldn't fit together if I had to place them side by side.<br /><br />This product is very practical to have. My computer only has 2 USB ports on it. With this product I went from 2 ports to 5. I have used this hub mostly for uploading pictures from my camera and have found that the speed was great. There was no reduction in speed at all with this product. I have also used this hub for connecting my external hard drive and I have found transfer speeds to be really good with that too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a handy product to have to expand the USB capability of your computer.<br /><br />N.B. Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|This lovely controversial film dances out on the piano keys of Floyd Cramer and starts with a lively, young and happy tone.  The soundtrack (Paul Englishby) then becomes smoky and faintly erotic while detailing a relationship that plays with the boundaries.  Director Lone Scherfig pulls the emotions of the character of Jenny to equal anything of a much larger scale.  Her depth of feeling matches that of Britain's own coming of age story in the early 1960's.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan (Oscar nomination) comes prepared and is so convincing as Jenny. She does not want to settle for what she feels will be a boring and complacent life after University and dreams out loud of better things.  Quite conveniently, David just happens to come along at the right time with an offer that Jenny cannot refuse; Himself. Coming from her young and intelligent beyond-her-years point of view, this is so easy to understand.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard brings a whole character study to David along with an emotionally vulnerable side.  He is able to seduce Jenny's parents (Alfred Molina - a standout as her father) right on board as easily as he influences her with a tall-tale of an author and dreams of Paris.<br /><br />Jenny and David quickly become a couple.  An older man and a confident, headstrong schoolgirl on the verge of graduating, then onward to Oxford.  She takes a sharp left, against the advice of her Headmistress (Emma Thompson) and favorite teacher, Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams), and decides to go to Paris, among other key considerations with David and his friends.  Jenny desperately wants to be an adult, live in a glamorous setting and stretch out her arms to embrace life.<br /><br />Their age difference does not condescend you as the story remains plausible; warm and positive possibly in its absolute full conclusion, after the gut wrenching plot twist (\\"it's just another one of David's muddles and misunderstandings\\").  It leaves the cast, along with the viewer, reconciling their scattered feelings and then allows Jenny a logical discernment for her ongoing life.r scattered feelings and then allows Jenny a logical discernment for her ongoing life.

B000UR366S|5.0|When this cd came out I bought it and listened and that was it. I felt it was too downbeat. Recently I listened again, and, maybe it's the times, maybe it's just me, but this is a beautiful album on many levels. I can't believe how good it is. Musically it's gorgeous, pure Joni, matured, masterly. The lyrics/poetry reflect her consciousness -- hope/despair -- about the state of the world, about the environment. It isn't as bleak as as I thought; it's clear-eyed and poetic with layers of meaning and images that take me into myself to contemplate life. I have been listening to a lot and am not tired of it at all. She's a great artist.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|The way it is written and the general approach was a great fit for me. Loved the swim types explanation and the visualizations that the authors went through.

The art is wonderful and I enjoyed the sassy, funny and loving relationship between the two main characters, but had to take off a star for the setting which is not clearly explained.  How does magic and science co-exist?  What is the history between their two peoples (empires?, universes?)? Hopefully volume 2 which is set to come out this year will clear up some of the confusion.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Backstory:<br />I picked up a pair of the same headphones about 13 years ago at a music store local to me for about $120. After 13 years of abuse I still use these headphones almost daily and they still sound fantastic. The earpads have since worn down to the point of having to replace them but it doesn't diminish the quality of the sound at all.<br /><br />Anyway, I've been working a lot at home lately and decided it was time to get a good pair for late nights when I can't use the speakers for fear of waking the wife + baby. So I thought i'd look into getting the same pair of Sony's I bought 13 years ago. And am I ever glad that I did!<br /><br />The Audio  - 5 Stars<br />These headhpones, simply put, produce some of the richest audio your ears will ever hear. Crystal clear with an impressively wide range for earmuff headphones. These are not overamplified and over-EQ'd like crappy Beats, Bose or similar brand headphones. They have a relatively flat response and do not 'color' audio like Bose do! Since these are 'studio monitor' headphones they are meant to be used in a mixing room environment to mix and produce master tracks for studio recordings. And studio producers demand accurate reproduction of audio when they work their magic. That's what these headphones were designed to do and that's what they deliver - clear, accurate audio from your source. Even at lower volumes you will still get a remarkably rich sound (unlike Beats, where you literally have to crank to get a full range of audio out of them). I've also literally worn these for hours without experiencing aural fatigue like I do with earbuds / other over-the-ear headphones.<br /><br />Fit / Comfort - 5 Stars<br />I have a big noggin'. It's often really difficult for me to find any sort of headware / apparel that fits me properly, let alone headphones (they're usually too narrow). These fit like a glove. You quickly adjust the length by pulling down on the ears and that's it - you're in comfort land. Theydon't pinch / fatique any part of my dome either.<br /><br />Price - 5 Stars<br />You can easily pay twice as much for something twice as bad. If you're looking for audiophile quality headphones without breaking the bank then look no further. Forget Beats, forget Bose, forget all of the other crap - the sony MDR7506 headphones are what you want!

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those books that intrigues you in the beginning and has sufficient twist and turns to keep you interested.  Unfortunatley the author ran out of steam by the end.

0553386794|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" by George R.R. Martin is a fantasy book set in a mythical world.  It is the first book of an ongoing series call A Song of Ice and Fire.  It has a reach mythology and does not take the expected twist and turns that you might expect.  The main focus of the story is much like a detective novel, with other underlying stories that get explored in the follow on books.  With this in mind Martin has help usher in a period of realism to story and characters that people are looking for.<br /> Sets fourteen years after a civil war in the land of Westeros,  you are introduced to two key characters in the book, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, called Ned, and King Robert Baratheon.  The story starts with the death of Jon Arryn, who helped raise both Eddard and Robert.  Jon was the essentially the Vice King and the King has come ask Ned to the same position.  From here you learn that something was amiss with Jon's death and Ned, who was initially hesitant to accept, decides to help protect Robert by finding out what is going on and heads south.  Ned takes his daughters with him to the trip to the capital called King's Landing.  Once there he beings trying to find out why Jon was murdered.<br /> Other stories branch of from this main focus.  You are introduced to the rich history and back ground that Martin has created with these sub plots.  You learn about the Wall, a massive seven hundred foot tall wall made of ice, the formation of the Seven Kingdoms and how they were concurred over three hundred years ago, and the dealings with people of power to get more and retain their power.  These stories usually have a Point of View character associated with them.  The benefit of this method of storytelling is that you see both sides of the story, one character might be a hero to some or a villain to others.<br /> The two other main subplots are the training of Ned Stark's bastard son Jon Snow on the wall and of Daenerys Targaryen the last daughter of the rightful ruling family of the Seven Kingdom's.  The story on Wall is slow moving at first, much like the beginning half of the novel, and does not pick up any steam.  The story of Daenerys is a long road of finding out her inner strength standing up for herself against her verbally and physically abusive brother, who wants to raise and army and retake the Seven Kingdoms.<br /> The pacing of the story is perfect.  There is a lot of learn and absorb in the first part of the novel and so the pace is slow at first but, as Ned's search for information reaches a climax so does Daenerys leading to unexpected events.  The last quarter of the part of the novel helps set up the epic events that follows in the remaining books.<br /> George R.R.

B002MUAJ2A|2.0|As mentioned in other reviews, this book is mostly a collection of blog posts. It's an easy read, and just glosses over the topics.<br /><br />Perhaps if someone is contemplating starting a small side business, this might be encouraging. However, for existing business owners there little to learn here. A waste of my Sunday afternoon...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome so play it everyday. I recommend you purchase and play this game. Please note this game is highly addictive
B000000H4V|5.0|CHAOS A.D, a masterpiece, is the point where SEPULTURA change their fast, raw, relentless THRASH METAL to something with more groove, slower but incredibly heavy...in fact, it´s something that happens with many THRASH bands( i think that comes because of PANTERA)...well, CHAOS is one of the best METAL albums from the early 90´s with huge classics like TERRITORY, REFUSE RESIST, BIOTECH IS GODZILLA, SLAVE NEW WORLD and AMEN....SEPULTURA is one of BEST METAL bands of all time, and i recommend this one to every headbanger of this world!!!! Try BENEATH THE REMAINS, ARISE and ROOTS too....WELL DONE, SEPULTURA!!!!!

B000V6BE6C|2.0|AVENGED SEVENFOLD´s first 3 albums are way way heavier than this self titled album....There´s some good songs like ALMOST EASY, SCREAM and UNBOUND, but is clearly a way more POP collection with some songs for the radio like DEAR GOD and AFTERLIFE....I think they really are trying to create a more accessible sound here, but what they did on WAKING THE FALLEN and CITY OF EVIL are way better!
0547564651|2.0|If only Mr. Tough's anecdotal account (supported by some weak social science) was right, I'd be the first to cheer. Unfortunately, his story line is incomplete and misses some key elements of the problem. Like most journalists today, Mr. Tough perpetuates the current romantic myth that achievement is largely unaffected by cognitive ability. Instead, when good teaching fails to raise achievement, Mr. Tough believes the problem is inadequate character development spawned by the conditions of poverty. Of course poverty, particular urban poverty, restrains achievement. But the impact of dysfunctional socialization is relatively small, perhaps explaining 20 percent of the variance between high and low achievers. More than 50 percent of the variance is explained by differences in cognitive ability. Unless the story line explores this reality, the dots will remain unconnected as they are here.<br /><br />Teaching and reinforcing character qualities we think are necessary for adult success is a good thing. It's just not the only thing or, perhaps, even the most critical thing. You'll need to look beyond \\"How Children Succeed\\" to find the whole story.
B000002GK1|5.0|SOUNDGARDEN is one of the coolest HEAVY METAL ROCK bands of all time, and all their albums are great...but this one.....OH, BADMOTORFINGER  is their masterpiece! While i really like SUPERNKNOWN and LOUDER THAN LOVE, this is the point when Cornell was at his peak of creativity and the band created their most famous songs like JESUS CHRIST POSE, RUSTY CAGE, OUTSHINED, FACE POLLUTION and ROOM A THOUSAND YEARS WIDE....in fact, try ALL SOUNDGARDEN's albums, but try this one first to see the power of this AMAZING band....WELL DONE, SOUNDGARDEN!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIII0|4.0|Let me start off by saying the 4 stars are for the movie itself.<br /><br />The film is quite interesting and very well developed. I wasn't crazy about some of the CGI animals, but overall it was pulled off rather well. I've read other reviews asking why he kept doing a certain thing and it makes me think that maybe people didn't fully understand the movie. Others complained that it was slow, but the pacing seemed fine for this type of film. It's not supposed to be a big action movie so I can't imagine anyone wanting to speed up the story telling. In a lot of ways, it made me think of Ernest Hemingway's book The Old Man and The Sea. It felt very much like that in so many ways, but Pi puts in a little more craziness. Overall, I thought the film was very good and worth the rental fee.<br /><br />Now, as far as the blu ray disc...it doesn't seem to work in all players. I actually rented the Blu Ray disc and it would not play in my blu ray player. I did the usually stuff like updating the firmware to the latest update. Still, no go. I tried playing it in my computer which has a blu ray player. Nothing. I updated the blu ray software on my comp and still nothing. I did some research and some people have stated that because of a very new type of menu on the blu ray not all players will be able to play it, even with all available updates. It seems that some companies have not updated their software / firmware to make the blu ray work, but I am sure it will be fixed very soon. I had the same problem with the blu ray version of Skyfall. Hopefully, this issue can be worked out as I prefer the clarity of a blu ray over a dvd.<br /><br />4.2 / 5

B0040HO01Y|5.0|Story and characters are so charming and interesting.  I could watch it all day.  I bought the book, too, but it's a little different.  The author is very descriptive of scenes in 1880-1890's England and this reflects the differences of social rank very well, without being adversarial.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I ordered the CD after seeing the play. The sound quality is great. It makes me feel like I am sitting in the theater watching it.<br />The songs are fun and most are really upbeat giving you a good feeling.<br />Unlike some musicals I guarantee you won't be bored with this audio CD or download.<br />I would definitely recommend this product to everyone, even if you are not the play going type.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It's a great picture. I don't like the reason these folks wanted to seek treasure when they already had what they needed to survive. No need to kill for stupid material things. However, as far as the film production and actors go, well it's a good film.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|It took me long enough, but I finally caved and saw `The Hunger Games'.  I'd read the book late last year and have since then intended on seeing the film but had just never gotten around to it.  I'll say pretty much what I had said in my review of the book; if you have a problem with the nature of the material then don't watch the film.  I mean, it's not like the themes here or the general plot itself isn't wholly explained on the outset.  You aren't going to be surprised by the violence since it is widely known and publicly criticized.  If you watch the movie or read the book then you have no grounds to complain about the violence.<br /><br />You've been warned.<br /><br />That said, I totally get the criticisms or the media and our society in actually targeting our youth with this `entertainment'.  Kids killing kids isn't something I think children should be entertaining themselves with.<br /><br />I watched it though, so I can't say much.<br /><br />For me, the film doesn't quite hold up against the book, which delves deeper into the political aspects of the films themes.  It actually speaks to a more socially conscious narrative than one would assume.  Sadly, the film attempts to condense and provide the audience with a more streamlined `action film' and because of this it changes up key segments and creates a less arresting experience.  The technical aspects of the film are also a letdown since they distract from the action.  The fire in particular is embarrassingly bad.  Still, Lawrence is exceptionally good here.  She cycles Katniss's emotional range with expertise.  The cheeky gaudiness of it all is engaging, but some of the rougher edges of the film really distract.  The jeering of the kids is so fake feeling, and the underdeveloped plotting of the `villains' is just too much of a head-sore.  The book was much better than I imagined and the film was more underwhelming than I imagined.<br /><br />It's good, but that's about where it lies.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Did you know the Easter Bunny is from Australia?  I didn't but I think I like him a lot more because of it!!  This was an awesome and creative movie!!! I don't usually get into these kind of holiday movies but I really liked this one.  I ordered through Amazon Prime, got it for $15 and it arrived the next day!!!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|There are some films that are just so overbearing in their `LET ME DRIVE THIS POINT HOME' that they lose all appeal and wind up being an exercise in the obvious.  `Flight' is that kind of film.  It isn't awful, but it becomes rather pointless by film's end because it never manages to become anything more than an elaborate exaggeration.<br /><br />`Flight' attempts to be a moral tale revolving around an alcoholic pilot named Whip who uses cocaine to sober up after binge drinking before a flight.  When the plane has problems and starts to descend rapidly, Whip winds up landing the plane in a rather remarkable manner and saves the lives of many on board (only losing a few).  He was a hero, until his toxicology report shows that he was drunk and high at the time of the flight.  Over the course of the next two hours, Zemeckis beats us over the head with Whip's addiction to the point where I just wanted him to get hit by a drunk driver and let the irony completely take over.<br /><br />I'm not trying to belittle addiction, because it is truly something serious, but the manipulative nature of `Flight' is too much.  Washington is in fine form, but this is a breeze for him.  He's played a similar character before and he doesn't really shade Whip with anything other than the obvious.  The introduction of Nicole was unnecessary and yet again completely part of Zemeckis's approach.  There is no subtlety here.  Everything is overdone and oversold to the point where I was exasperated and completely uninterested by the film's end.  In fact, the ending courtroom scene made ZERO sense.<br /><br />And don't get me started on John Goodman's take on a drug dealer.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Wow. What a sound assault this album is. Beautifully played and recorded...just full throttle musicianship on display. Killer riffs throughout! As another reviewer mentioned, not the greatest lyrically, but the full brutal audio assault and length of the album make up for it. Not a low point, just plain awesome!!!

B0052OSTOS|5.0|This a very nice app it is very relaxing-if you have problem going to sleep this will help you with that.plus the voice on it is very soft.
B0027MJU00|1.0|I have read all three of Gillian Flynn's books. The stories are well written, however, if you like animals or at least don't hate them, be warned. There is an unnecessary amount of well thought out explicit animal cruelty. I truly wish I hadn't supported her. I had to skip through many pages in order to not have these disgusting images imprinted on my brain.
B0082208XC|2.0|it's not practical to use since you cannot operate the foot base at the same time with your left and right hands.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Uplifting and inspiring, coming of age film, definitely watch it if you are an avid outdoorsperson action sports fan! Not 5 stars because it is a bit predictable but still very good nonetheless, based on a true story.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|My 10 year old daughter writes: It's a really cool game, but its kind of hard to get Gems! Most of the dragons, one needs Gems. It is not that addictive compared to other viral games. But it's pretty good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to play and good to learn how to care for horses and a good way to have life filled with nature but just by a game
B004T32SOK|5.0|I have 50 GB Box storage and this is awesome. I have tons of music files, power-point, word docs. Easy to upload, and access on the go. Never had issues. combines with Pogoplug app, and Google Drive, this solves private/public cloud infrastructure for my personal use.
6305090564|5.0|I bought this movie because i enjoy being scared, so i liked this movie very much, it was a little hard to find on other movie websites, and since i bought the movie i have watched it several times. they met my expectations for a fun afternoon with popcorn and good friends.
B0015S7M3E|4.0|This is as good as most of my operas.  The orchestra parts are very good.  Most of the singing is also good.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|The beginning of the cult classic. I liked this series because its not easy to find on TV anymore, and not all movie sites stream video's from this series, so i have the classic in my video library where i can watch them when i want, if you like the one that stared them all movies,and 4 TV series, 3 of which went 7 years in duration. The price is good and the memories are better. if you expect good viewing, buy an episode and enjoy.
B004YKSXYW|4.0|From the title I expect this book to cover the ENTIRE globe. It starts out good but the 90% contents covers western civilization. It barely touches China and India.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|My husband only likes action movies with comedic slants (i.e. Rush Hour, Beverly Hills Cops, Bad Boys, and Lethal Weapon).  So if your husband is like mine, rent it for him.  He will enjoy it.  (And you get to see something that you haven’t watched a gazillion times!)
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Very cheesy and hard to follow  Messy writing made the plot hard to follow. I will not recommend this book.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Watched it before the award shows so I could at least have seen one of the nominees. It was worth the rental.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I've had more interesting experiences waiting in line at the post office than watching this film. If I knew how bad this movie would be, I would never have spent the time, let alone the money to watch it.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|About one thing is that you'll gain many practical ideas for moving yourself to your one thing.  I'll be purchasing a copy for each member of my staff.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I also read Sharp Objects by  Gilian Flynn. Both books are very well written, characters well crafted, and the dialogue in both fits the age of characters and the autor as well. Dark Objects was a little more difficult to get into , but it's plot is very rewarding and exciting. I recommend it to all mystery lovers.<br />Edward Gosselin
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Yes, I like Michael Bolton music.  I have other albums and this latest one is a MUST have for anyone.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game worth every dime I spent on it. I find myself playing every single chance I have great great game
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The graphics are wonderful and when I miss a level I get Angry!!! I really enjoy this app and how it helps me forget the world as my day comes to a close.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|There is definitely a lot of beautiful people and bodies to be seen in this Brazilian movie. The film itself is fairly average and is nothing to right home about. A bit better than the average gay movie.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Definitely a good filmed version of the books although it went further afield from the book than did the first season.  Too much material to fit in 10 shows.  But I still felt it did a good job of capturing the essence of the story.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Loved the new cd, classic music that never gets old! Justin timberlake is definately bringing the sexy back again and again!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This thing found my location within 7 seconds the first time I used it.  INSIDE MY HOUSE, in a corner that is under a tree.  I had used the pucks that had come with my DeLorme software for years and this is MUCH faster, smaller and NEVER looses signal.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I wish there was someway of looking for the videos besides looking throught the 100s of other videos I don't care about.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|so awesome I cant stop playing it<br />I will play for 5 hours non stop cant yet me to stop playing it cause its so funv
B000W93CHC|5.0|Beautiful book, pleasure to read. Ken is a gifted storyteller and one can picture the story as it unfolds. Looking forward to reading more of his work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More features are added!  It's great.  If you like the 1st one, you'll love this one.  Not only jumping, turning left and right, and ducking, but swinging, buying things, upgrades to your player and also includes 3 different people.  Will they make a Temple Run 3???
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good story, good characters, light reading that can keep you hooked. I enjoyed this book and now I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
0061733199|5.0|I did a quick thumb through and for what I have seen so far looks very good.well worth the price..
B00004CXYO|1.0|Well to start this fiasco is my fault for sure but being new at this online shopping I didn't realize what I was doing.  We love the movie from years ago BUT this dvd came in the European format so we can't watch it.  This review is to warn others new to shopping thru Amazon and similar sites be aware of any little print somewhere that tells you the product is not meant for use in the United States what a bummer that was in the Easter Basket.
0345528581|5.0|I wrestled varsity through high school, so I've been through some grueling workouts. But since being married, having kids, attending college, and working; I stopped working out. This, though, has given me a routine which minimizes my time and maximizes my results. Fantastic.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|It is a great movie with a look into the past with what could have been a reality. With James Earl Jones first film credit, Peter Sellers playing not one not two but three very different roles and Slim pickens riding the bomb into history. This is a movie which you should see at least once if only to hear the exchange between the president and the unheard premier. Just don't look at the big board while your not fighting in the war room.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game when I got my kindle and I loved it! Then I did not play it as much. But, no I am addicted! So funn
B0030SCPZ2|4.0|I've put off watching this movie forever, and so ... waiting so long to view it, I think I built up in my head that it would be more than it was, but ... I still liked it.    I honestly didn't know what to fully expect from 3 very different guitar players.  I found the bits with Jimmy Page the most enjoyable parts, as he is just such a happy and free person, who even at his age, still plays air guitar to his favorite recordings and curls his lip into a snarl of enjoyment when banging on his low hung Les Paul.  I've always been more of a Led Zeppelin fan as a whole vs considering Jimmy Page a guitar god idol, but, I have to say ... this film made me like Jimmy Page infinitely more, simply because of his attitude, and the fact that his spirit for music doesn't seem to have diminished with age.  Also, seeing the house where they recorded \\"four\\" and getting some inside info about how they recorded certain sounds was awesome (like the drums on \\"When the Levee Breaks\\").  They recorded in every room of that house, even out in the yard!  It was very interested to get the Edge's perspective, and also see where he came from, and why he is the way he is.  I think all the s*** that went on in Ireland during the time of his upbringing and the rise of U2 scarred him, and understandably so.  He seems like a quiet individual that is always thinking about more than he's saying.  It was neat to see how he uses a plethora of effects, almost as another instrument vs just \\"effects.\\"  Most people, myself included, would get lost in hundreds of buttons and stop switches connect to 2-3 racks full of effects processors or pedals.  For the most part, I think the Edge keeps it all straight, but it was also neat to see that he does a lot of just random button pushing to see if the sound he's looking for will just happen by accident.  Lastly ... Jack White.  I appreciate someone who doesn't try so hard that their efforts towards perfection actually snub proliferation (in some sense).  While I love guys like Eric Johnson and Tom Scholz, their insane studio perfectionism definitely hurt their careers as a musician, and prevented not only more of their music getting out, but also just their bare musical souls getting out.  Then there's Jack White.  In my humble opinion, the man seems to be trying just as hard as the aforementioned, just in an inverse way.  When one tries so hard to fight against the man, technology, and progress, I think it is equally debilitating.  Jack White just kind of came off as having too much of an attitude for my tastes.  Besides, I often find that someone who states that they want a guitar that is hard to play, that it should be struggle, is often covering up for the fact that they just aren't that great of a guitar player, and frankly, don't want to put in the effort to become that.  There is nothing wrong with a well-made guitar that is set up properly, and a well-made amplifier that sounds great.  There will always be a struggle if you hope to achieve something better than what you are now.  So ... I just found Jack White to be a bit juxtaposed.  All I have to say is ... look at Jeff Beck.  He struggles with the guitar every night, and still has one of the most legendary attitudes in music history, yet his struggles are towards not being satisfied.  In that respect I liked Jack White's words towards the fact that if you're satisfied, you're done ... there's no where else to go.  James Hetfield has stated something similar.    All in all, great film, and a great watch if you're a guitar nut.
B004TI5N38|2.0|I am a David Baldacci fan but was disappointed in this purchase. The story was fine but I did not realize it was just a short story, if I had I would not have spent the money.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It was a good choice.  Unexpected sometimes and anticipated at others.  I would recommend it.  It is a pretty quick read.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I have not used this application so far however, I am looking forward to using it.  thank you for the program
B009PJ1Q82|4.0|Good movie
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Captivating.  Should've been a five book bundle. I  Don't know how how HBO will  make this a series, so much detail.
B004QX07G4|4.0|This book was funny and entertaining.  It was much like her standup comedy routine.  I would recommend it if you have had a rough day and need something light to relax and laugh.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Hugo's works have stood the test of time.  His flair for the dramatic is reflective of the period.  The notion of a man finding redemption and his personal sacrifice for someone else is moving.  The agony of his own soul pulls at the reader's heart.  The only challenge to the book besides its length is his diversions into protracted discussions of French history.  Although it is good background, it does impede the progress of the story at times.  In that vein his writing style is similar to Herman Melville's work -- Moby Dick.  I must confess that I did some &#34;speed reading&#34; through some of the historical pieces.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Im 37 and i love thos and wheres my water. Those games keep my occupied but are also very addictive. Be prepared to be frustrated.
B000FA675C|3.0|After all the hype I finally decided to read this book.<br />What a disappointment.  The story was ok, but it was too full of long descriptors intended to make it sound authentic.  Could have given it 4 stars for the story, but it was a drudge to read.
1400032717|5.0|I love this book. The story and writing style captivated me. I felt like my point of view was somewhere between being the reader and being part of the main character's mind. The way Christopher's autism is portrayed made it so clear to see and feel what he was feeling. His voice is direct and uncomplicated, but yet the book is about dealing with a very complicated family dynamic.<br /><br />Fellow readers, enjoy the book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this because I am a Marine and it was one of those things I felt obligated to do. I was shocked and read this through in one day. It had none of the self inflated talk that \\"Lone Survivor\\" did and the author actually portrays his professionalism and commitment to duty. It was refreshing to see that red tape and \\"the good idea fairy\\" affect even the best of us. I would recommend this book to anyone regardless of there thoughts on America's politics or conflicts.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Love this. So glad I have it on the go it's good fun and I can explore new things at any time
B006VGGAC4|1.0|I'll admit, I bought this book and read it because of the scandal and gossip. What I got instead was a rags to riches story with Mr. Schwarzenegger expressing how \\"interesting\\" he found everything while coming up. That single word was so over used in this book to the pointing was annoyed. If I had known more so this was a look how amazing I am and I can do no wrong story then maybe I wouldn't have been so over this book by the end of it. I honestly think Mr Schwarzenegger is out of touch with reality and has fantasyland recollection of the past.
B00BF124PC|3.0|I'm not entirely sure what the goal of the director was with this movie but I felt the buildup to the actual event was slow and the event itself was boring at best. Perhaps more a function of my expectations, but I was disappointed with the lack of action toward the end. I'll credit the director however with (allegedly) providing the viewer with more of an accurate account of the story than just an action packed run of the mill military shoot out flick.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've been told for years that I should read this book.....I love dogs and I love cars. I never re-read books, but this is one that I definitely will. It's a great story, a unique perspective, and you don't have to love racing to enjoy this book. Fabulous! I'm so glad I finally got to it, and sorry I waited so long!
B00001YXH6|5.0|vcr tape was pkg'd well and arrived in like new condition. Had received the gift of attending a performance of &#34;Quidam&#34; with my daughter and birthday gr dau. in Arkansas recently. Although this was performed in Amsterdam it will be a great memory of that special day!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very durable i wish it came in other colors i have has this case for 2 YRS  and has been dropped and the Kindle had not so much as a scratch..
0739313061|5.0|I really like this story & this author. She writes really good books, & my audio book is a great addition to my own audio library. I own several of her audio's. This seller listed it as, &#34;Like New&#34;. It is just like that. The CD's are clean & played good, too. Lisa Gardner is an author I really like. Her style of writing, & stories make it hard to put down. I would rate this seller with a a 5 star.<br /><br />Thank You Very Much:<br />Laura J. Loe
B008NMT684|5.0|Perfect. Cheap. Entertaining.I would recommend this to anyone with a younger child. My two year old absolutely loves this  game and he caught on quick with it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When I couldn't find it at my video store (because of the popularity), or local library, I had to purchase the second season. There is never a dull moment at Downton Abbey. Between the family issues of the Crawley's and the personal issues of the staff, there is always a twist or turn to the story.  I can't wait to view Season 3.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have downloaded this game multiple times and EVERY time it will work 3 or 4 times you open it and then after that it will not open at all. it sucks
B009KYXEY6|3.0|the 1st disc only contains 12 songs when there should be 15! I'm not pleased about this as I was really looking forward to receiving it!
B008X6N1OA|4.0|I ordered this as an addition to my new 3d home theater, and am very happy with the result.<br /><br />Ice Age is a very good family movie, and the 3d looked great.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|meets the expectations well. I submit to anyone looking for similar product. excellent buy! would not hesitate to buy this product again.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I love this book. It is  such a good read. I would reconmend this book to everyone I know. Fove stars.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|The movie was excellent. I watched it with my two sons, and truly enjoyed the underlying<br />theme of the story &#34;never give up on your dreams&#34;, &#34;focus on your present and future, not<br />your past&#34; and &#34;believe in yourself&#34;. It was very well acted. I highly recommend it.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Volbeat for quite some time and have always been enamored with their unique style and fusion of multiple genres into their music. I knew Rob Caggiano was a great guitarist, but I was curious to see how well he would fit in with Volbeat. Turns out Rob was a great addition, the new album is extremely good from top to bottom and well worth the low price I paid for it.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I think I may have just had higher expectations for this book, but  I was very disappointed. It seemed like nothing ever happened and there were so many random parts that just dragged on forever. Definitely not my favorite.
