B00BESM14U|4.0|I wasn't totally sure what to expect with this movie but I really enjoyed it, as did my husband. It was funny, heart wrenching at times, and overall an interesting, entertaining story.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Excellent Saga collection of Martin. Is amazing. Better than you already watch in tv HBO. For me one of the best ever.
0765325950|5.0|With some 1500 reviews already in place I wasn't going to bother adding another but finally decided to offset one of the one-star reviews posted by someone who did not read it.<br /><br />The book was much, much better than I expected.  Books 1-3 were excellent, 4-10 gradually declined in quality, 11-13 got better.  The series ended on a high note and was probably the best book in the series since book 4.<br /><br />Sanderson did a great job of finishing the series from Jordan's notes.<br /><br />High points included every scene with Mat and a forsaken finally worthy of their fearsome reputation (although to be fair Ishamel was formidable in the early books). Low points included some unresolved plot elements and obvious Deus Ex Machina moments. The highs far outweighed the lows.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I can not rated this app because I never used also no try . That is the reason is impossible gave my opinion
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A story that includes real science and facts, and it actually helps to drive the plot. This is all plausible and that makes for a more enjoyable story. However this book could have used some proof reading: There were numerous typos and mistakes. Not hard to ignore, but still, a once-over would have helped.
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|I would have liked to see the author make some changes from her fan fiction work , but saddly she did'nt I stilled enjoyed it was an original, but not as much as I did as a fan ficiton.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My kids love one direction and needed this to complete their collections.  I even like some of the music, but they are crazy for this band.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|E L James I knows how I feel about the fan fiction story and I wish I could tell her I loved it as an Original just the same, but to me to make it truly an original work she needed to make changes in the story line make it truly Chistophers story not  Edwrads with a new name.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is a book I enjoy rereading frequently. The eloquence of the language never ceases to amaze me. Excellent read.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I've loved this story since the first time I read it when I was a teen, Austen make the reader feel like they are part of the story. She has away with making the reading not put down the book to see whats going to happen. You can feel the tentions between the two main characters.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game with nice graphics  and hints for older people like me.<br />The story is enjoyable I love the hidden object games. And it has a happy ending.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Superb performance, audio and video by one of the most intellectual rock bands that ever existed. Fully recommended for anyone who can appreciate true musicianship.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|some puzzles are impossible to win.  most are very good.  Some need more birds.<br />very entertaining and amusing. I Play it for hours
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|This is another game which sat in my wishlist for a month, then popped up on FAOTD as a pleasant surprise. It reminds me of Metroid, constantly running. Jumping is easy to control, and you'll only die once or twice before getting the timing right for each obstacle. Graphics and sounds are great too.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book was definitely the best in the series. I have read the whole series and it is definitely my favorite book series ever and i love the movies as well!
1401941893|1.0|If this were a book aimed towards really young teens with inspiration to be a model, go somewhere else.  This does not empower young women or enable them to \\"treasure themselves.\\"  How aweful.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it.  I like playin Bingo.  This one keep me until one 'oclock in the morning.  Its good for people who can go to real Bingo Halls.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was like reading a good book and couldn't put it down had to watch season 1 & 2 over the weekend I have ordered season 3 can't wait till it comes thank you
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's a nice clock. The wake up sounds could be better tho. My favorite part is that I can plug it in and dim the brightness. That saves my battery life.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  Well done on all levels from costume to cinematography.  Excellent.<br />I need 6 more words so, it is Excellent, excellent, excellent~
B000JMKQX0|3.0|WWZ was one of the better novels of the zombie genre. I liked the various perspectives of the people from around the world and the various strategies for survival and coping with the apocalypse. His view of the the world's militaries seemed to reflect a negative bias rather than a projection of how they might perform. There's plenty of historical examples of the world's militaries losing first battles and it certainly could have happened in WWZ, but his description of Yonkers seemed almost cartoonish and unbelievable. I've been in the U.S. Army for 25 years and the description in the book didn't remotely resemble any of the worst units I've seen. His choice of language was full of cliches. The U.S. Army running out of ammunition in the Yonkers battle? The same could be said for his description of the Russians. That being said, the insight about the lack of communication protocols between the Iranians and the Pakistanis and the subsequent nuclear exchange was well done. I found myself lost in the second half of the book as he took us around the world in various stages of the crisis. Overall, a good read and I'd recommend it. I'm looking forward to the movie this summer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|First of all the App is free and just functions very well. This will be used all of the time.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I never could get into the original Dr. Who series, but finally, now available via streaming, have had a chance to dip into Dr. Who. I really have enjoyed it ... especially as the series got past the halfway point and character development deepened.
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|This CD was a gift to a family member. I like some of the songs on this CD, but Rihanna has to grow on me a little more
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great book. I found myself saying \\"just one more chapter\\" all the time. The characters draw you in and never let go. I would go to work and think about what was happening in the book & trying to figure out what would happen next!
B005VT42BS|5.0|Necessary for any geeks tool box. List's all used wifi networks, full of all the basic tools for network administration.
0345803493|4.0|This book was very good, i like the way the author kept things going from the first book. I was very suprised with the outcome n cant wait to read the final book..
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I read these books first in high school, and am rediscovering them and enjoying them even more!  All animal lovers should read them.
1451648537|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my son. He states it is very interesting reading. He is happy with the book.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|One of my favorite shows on TV!!! Any one who likes hot guys and monsters will love this show :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ii is fun .It is Delly.  You can die.  You can kil.I can oil. It Is fun. It is fun.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I have read a couple of books on the coming robot revolution and this one provides some fresh insight on the subject
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Drama with humor and great performances from all the actors involved in making &#34;The Good Wife&#34; an engrossing and thoroughly addictive series.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|You only need this if you are a serious gamer.<br />If you don't plan on programming complicated macros, and lots of them, then you would be fine with a G15 keyboard instead.<br />This on the other hand combined with a G15 is SICK!<br />Perfect for games like World of Warcraft, where there are about a trillion different conceivable things you could macro, and abilities and buttons to push. This keeps it at your fingertips.<br />I've also had some nice success at MW3 and COD putting together some really nice combative combo macros...<br />An expensive toy, but if money isn't a problem and you are trying to be a top 1% gamer, then you should think about using this.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|WOW. That is probably the word that kept coming up constantly during the concert. It's really that good! From start to finish,  this is a masterpiece of a show that is a must watch. Prior to this concert I wasn't really into Kylie, but after watching this I  believed in her. The whole production value that went into this concert is one to be admired and appreciated. The end result is phenomenal. Definitely watch this!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Interesting science, lots suspense, with humorous dialog.  The characters are interesting.  The main character is a joy to follow as problems are thrown at him.
0767811070|3.0|I GOT THIS DVD AS GIFT FOR MY SON. WE ARE NOT MUCH INTO VIOLECE AND DRUGS. HE REALLY ENJOYS THIS MOVIE
B007IXWL2C|3.0|possibly worth skipping.  I read the first book in two days, the second in a week, and the third over the course of a month.  It was fairly slow moving and anticlimactic.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I'm not a big fan of many instrumental soundtracks, but this is the best of all! I wasn't entirely sure if Howard Shore could do better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but he absolutely pulled it off. I especially love the dwarves singing The Misty Mountains! I'm so glad I got this deluxe edition. I'm one very happy LotR/Hobbit fan!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|not as exciting as the first book but still worth reading if you are interested in following the story line.
0060775858|3.0|I bought this book because it was such a popular children's story. I did not grow up with this book so I have no emotional attachment to it. The story is basically identifying objects in a room and saying goodnight to them. It's cute but not something I pick up frequently to read to my toddler. It also lost a star due to a few frayed edges when delivered by Amazon.
B0044VTC0A|4.0|Delivery was fast, but at the the quality of the movie was not 100%,  there was a bit of distortion.  Was still able to watch the movie till the end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery manor is a fun game but it does have its down falls. I think the energy needs to restore quicker and after you charge a collections you shouldn't have to charge it again. It takes a long time to get objects you need. I have also had trouble getting it to load sine the last update. The game is fun and addicting even with its issues.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app because i have a device that doesn't text.So this is helpful in finding and &#34;kiking&#34; my friends.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Glad some friends of our recommended it. We enjoyed the series, waiting for the new season to start this fall.
B004SBULWE|5.0|It's really awesome. It actually made my device a lot quicker and less lagging. I would recommend to anyone. So if i were you, i'd get it if ur device is slow.
B000OWAFPE|5.0|What a value we got this movie at!  No complaints here!  Keep it on our kindle for on the go movie watching for a 5 year old!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Maybe the stories are too long and there may be more focus to using all this knowledge but the book is very good stuff to read and to have in your library to use it more and more and more. Good job done and would be interested to read more of these things.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I do not tend to pick up books on whims; I wait for strong recommendations and proven track records, and thus tend towards older works in science fiction over contemporary work.<br /><br />However, I have a shattered elbow and needed to get something on my kindle, without having to convert and sideload something from my computer. I popped open the kindle store and bought this because it was #1, almost 500 pages and 6 bucks.<br /><br />The first story hooked me perfectly. The willingness to do what is done in that first section is really great.<br /><br />I don't want to go in depth in analyzing plot or characters, but this is the perfect kind of science fiction that doesn't feel like genre fiction. It's a solid read that you don't want to put down, but holds up well to speculation and consideration. There are few issues with the plot, and the world feels really well developed, without overloading the reader with exposition. It sets the readers mind to imagining the rest of the world.<br /><br />Too bad I'm through my book budget right now, because I'd like to get on to the shift omnibus soon.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I am so happy this is able to be played on my kindle. to bad it is frozen on the install screen
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|A fairly good movie with a great deal of action from end to end.  Not really like the early version with Arnold, the Govenator.  Plot could weave together just a bit more.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|So anyone who uses Steam knows that once or twice a year they put on MASSIVE sales where you can get AAA games for super low prices, sometimes even for $5 or less. The only problem is, particularly with the winter sale, you're not usually able to sit around your PC checking on updates to prices, hourly sales, polls for the next major discount, etc.<br /><br />This app lets you do all of that. You can see your friends that are online and talk to them, as well. But mainly, you can buy games directly from the app. (Though that is a bit of a hassle the first time, it's still not annoying enough to lower the 5-star rating.) So during the sales you can see EVERYTHING that you would usually see on the PC application. You can browse all of the catalog, search by categories, vote in the polls, see all of the special pricings (there's a specific tab for that!), AND remotely tell your PC to download a game (if it's already on and online). Pretty much the only thing it doesn't let you do is play the game on your phone (give em a couple years ;-) lol)
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love the diary of a wimpy kid book series. The third wheel is probably the best book that I have read in the series. However this book is amazingly AWESOME.<br /> I sure hope the author keeps making more books from this series. I love how he is trying forever to date holly hills. And then at the very end of the book he meets a new girl that he likes and gets to date her. And also he is seen wearing under woman underwear. And at the same time he's being filmed and will soon be on TV.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|My nine year old son read this book and others ,base on what he tell me about the book i give it that rating thank you.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. It is on her Kendal plus it is our amazon account. It helps her pass the time while we are at the ball field
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How can you not love looking at the faces of the DA characters on a daily basis?  Great calendar with lots of room to write appointments and such.  I leave it on top of the desk in the kitchen and look at it daily.  Will need a 2014 edition for sure.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. I loaded this movie on her Kendal plus we have an amazon account so she can watch it anywhere
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty good app. Its not my favorite, but its good for taking up time. You don't have to buy anything, but if your impatient this is not the app for you.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downtown abbey<br /> just love this story .parcel arrived well packed and sealed played well fast service will use this service again
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Definitely a great movie, even if you haven't read the book. Great cinematography. I just love the storyline of all the characters.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|A great movie with the right direction for this genre just needed a bit more of a kick that would really leave an impression to younger / older generations.
0143121316|5.0|excellent overview of China's 20th century foreign policy -- divide, appease, absorb the enemy -- which Kissinger traces to historical roots
B00BQUUH7E|3.0|I thought it would be a little deeper. It's amusing at 5 minute intervals every couple of days. But nothing I can spend serious time with. If your looking for a simple 1-on-1 hockey style game to waste a couple of minutes on from time to time, then this game will make you happy, I don't think they should charge a penny more then .99 cents for this game.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My son got me hooked on this show.  It's dramatic and tense.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Love it!
B00B8WXEXO|5.0|This newly released CD is so great!  I love the cover artwork - but that does not even come close to the contents.  The music is so rock n roll.  LOVE, Rival Sons!!!!!!!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The process went very fast. Put about 90 slides on my computer in a little over 1 hour. As far as quality of the picturs. the slides were almost 50 years old. I think results were as good as could be expected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my brother plays it all the time and my mom and dad and my rest of my family. and my friends
B0064X7FVE|5.0|the app makes finding out the temp and up coming weather easy, one of the best apps, that anyone needs on there kindle
B004LROUW2|4.0|Enjoyed getting so deep into the thoughts and feelings of the characters. It's strange, I feel I have a lot of, &#34;But what happened to that person...?&#34; and &#34;What about that storyline...?&#34; However, it doesn't bother me like I feel it would if this were another story. I feel really fulfilled, in other words. I would have given this five stars, but there was a certain stretch I didn't feel engaged.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Best game ever and its not one of those games were you have to spend money to advance great game
B005K17RU0|5.0|This App provides you with everything you need and then some. Looks good and works well on a Kindle Fire.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I am a bookworm and i love my kindle touch. Almost evry book i read i like and thats the same thing with this book. This is a TRUE CLASSIC for young adults. im 12 and i read these classics. great descriptions plot characters and ending. if u want a real classic read this book!!!:):):):)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The DVDs were in great shape and arrived quickly with no problems. I am very pleased with this purchase and I would buy from her again in a heartbeat.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game because I will never be able to afford my own horse. The only thing is I wish I could turn the sound of without turning the volume on the Kindle.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|This was by far exceeded my expectations because you did not hear a lot of buzz about it. Well Done!!!
B00846F1YW|1.0|Anything that forces me to rate it gets one star. Developers that beg or force you to rate are pathetic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read it. I promise you. You will enjoy this book. You'll cry and laugh and just want to marry it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It's a GREAT game for people who love brain teasers and like to think outside the box. Has ABSOLUTELY NO GLITCHES!!!!!!(: Recommend this game for anyone.
B000002LAC|5.0|Such sweet music from such very professional ladies I just love to play it when I am driving on a long trip so I can sing along
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I absolutely love this game. So does my younger brother. I would definitely recommend this game to ANYONE!!!!<br />Beware: ADDICTING!!!!(:
B0054JZC6E|5.0|whenever your feeling bored play this it has 132 games so you never get bored some games are very tricky but then one day out of the blue you'll play it once and beat it. that is how I beat all pf the harder ones
B004SDEP38|1.0|Used this app previously on a palm. This free demo requires purchase of full to read pdfs. Don't bother. Get a free pdf reader. The description should specify how limited this app is.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Sometimes you pick up a book just to pass the time, and you find yourself lost in a new world. This book was just that. It introduced me to the Discworld back in 1992 when I first read it, and it's just as good today!<br /><br />-Criss.
B0026P40NU|5.0|Aidan Turner was amazing............  love him  I really enjoyed it very much.  I will watch it over and over for a while
B006HL9G10|5.0|I have used self hypnosis and meditation for years and found this helps focus.  The gongs/bells do help in focusing on measured breathing techniques.  Hardest part is deciding what bells/gongs I prefer.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a great Tolkien fan. I have read all hi books at least once and watched all LOR works several times. This movie did not disappoint me at all even if it was not completely faithful to the book. I can hardly wait for the next episode.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Works great with the other ram mount pieces to provide a custom way to mount my iphone. Solid and easy install. Great for bicycles, I mounted one on each bicycle and transfer the rest as needed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome.i would recommend this game to horse lovers of all ages.one of the many features of this game is horseback riding(my fave).
6305428522|5.0|Very well made and great acting about  a game show scandel based on a true story. It is worth a watch.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great story and every character in this show is interesting.  We could easily go through several episodes in one sitting if time permitted
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Terrible movie! No chemistry. UN-FUNNY. Save your money.  The characters are undeveloped  and unrealistic. Fun times are depicted as grandiose. Ultimately a terrible pick.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This a wonderful fantastic story of courage, faith, and endurance with an ending that leaves you with a choice of what is to be believed. The 3D experience enhances the story that the whole family can enjoy. Richard Parker, the tiger, is rendered believable and at times menacing but the plot would not work without him. As we now own this 3D movie we will watch it often.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Not sure I liked the ending. Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. The book is usually better than the movie.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I am a huge musical fan and Across the Universe is wonderful.  Don't believe any of those one star reviews.  I grew up in that era and the movie captured both the spirit and the turmoil of that period.  I thought it clever to tell the story of the sixties and early seventies using Beatles songs. It captured the naiveté, conflict, disillusionment, anger, love, sex, drugs and turmoil and the significant changes in music during that period.  It was lusciously directed by Julie Taymor whose background is in theatre.
B0036JU6CY|4.0|I adore Rain and really wanted to watch this movie. I rented it on Amazon video for 48 hours, costing $2. The movie itself is predictable and a bit campy, but I enjoyed it. The action sequences are pretty silly, but still it was fun to watch! I would definitely recommend renting it on Amazon; it cost more to rent on other sites and I wouldn't pay more than two dollars to rent it.
B00C0OOV5O|1.0|This is a review of Amazon Instant Video not the show since I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!! It's always in my queue before work, not today! I may need my money back if the episode is ruined by coworkers. Slackers! An hour later and it's available in HD for $2.99. I bought the non-HD season. I feel cheated'
B000059MEK|5.0|LOVED this album when I first heard it years ago, gives you a GREAT energy to keep you dancing around the room (^^)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Love it and will recommend to others.  Helps to stimulate your mind.  I love the sound and special effects.  Give it a try.
B00002DE4L|2.0|I don't know why I thought that this whole album would rock. It doesn't. Not for me anyway...not saying others wouldn't like it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is an awesome, funny movie!<br />So many one-liner quotes that you can't miss!<br />Kept me laughing throughout and after.
1451695195|5.0|This is truly an awesome book, in the true sense of &#34;awesome&#34;.<br /><br />Simply and elegantly written, it makes the most profound and strange experience of this man completely accessible and moving. This is a book to share with people you hold dear and one to read and re-read over and over. I'm grateful to Dr. Alexander for sharing his insight and to whatever forces brought the book into my life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is AMAZING my kindle has its batteries almost constantly dead its addictive! Wish I could write more! A MUST buy game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so cool that I want to fly and I want to put one of my new shoes
B00ARAO720|4.0|So the main reason I even watched this is because I really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and have been a long time fan since his 3rd Rock days. With that said this was a good movie!  The scenes from the view point of the bike messenger were unique and gave you the feeling that they really process a scene that way and that quickly. Chase scenes where good. Acting from the main characters was also very good. It kept my interest and I have a new fascination and appreciation for bike messengers!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the app it is really fun and if u r thinking about getting it u should u will be addicted I am telling u
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This is a nice app.  I like the maneuverability on the screen.  It makes it very easy to get to and open documents and folders on the remote screens.  Great for when I want to check things on the work pc from anywhere.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Download videos for free I give this app five stars I downloaded a bunch of videos before a long car ride and was able to watch that 70s show
B00493E1GI|2.0|I really enjoyed this book, and watched the movie less than 24 hours after reading...<br /><br />Overall, it simplified and romanticized a book that is deep and profound. It striped it of everything I loved; it was a completely different experience. Neither my boyfriend nor I enjoy chick flicks, and so neither of us liked this movie. (I wouldn't consider the book to be a 'chick-lit\\".)<br /><br />I will say that I loved the photography and use of light throughout this movie, that was beautiful. (Also, you should watch it after you eat because the Italy scenes will make you hungry.)<br /><br />I recommend reading the book before watching the movie. And, if you watch the movie and didn't like it, it isn't too late to fall in love with the book: [[ASIN:0143038419 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book. Although the relationship between Matthew and Diana was predictable, I loved the way their relationship developed. I had a hard time putting the book down.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Looks like it should -- since it is a gift I have not viewed the dvd's but the packaging looks good.
1476734941|5.0|I've lost 6 pounds in the first month using this method. Weight loss has slowed to one pound a week, but I'm happy with that. Don't want to lose weight too fast. Two days of &#34;fasting&#34; each week, limiting to 600 calories, is easy. You'd be amazed how filling 600 calories can be - especially with the included recipes. Highly recommend this for those who want to lose a few pounds or a lot.
B00BIK3FAI|1.0|It wouldn't install I payed good money for this and it wont install it.. don't wast your time or your money on this app
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wow, this movie was the most amazing movie I have ever seen and the cinematography was EPIC!  Beautifully shot, great effects, heartwarming story, and overall, a completely captivating film! I highly recommend this movie, especially for anyone that loves animals, or who just wants to see a quality movie unlike any other!  Absolutely loved this masterpiece! Two paws up!
086571701X|5.0|Very informative. Such a helpful book to help get this system started, we really enjoyed it & hope to have a productive garden soon.

B00B2166BS|5.0|Given the price of the Nexus 10, I expect some quirks, charging,...however, wasn't one I expected. This cable, makes that a non-issue, and should honestly be shipped with EVERY Nexus 10.<br /><br />It works how you'd expect, magnetically snaps into place, though I'm not 100% sure it works clockwise, as we ll as counter-clockwise(seems to be magnetically stronger one direction vs another). But, always charges terrifically using stock plug, ZERO issues.

0062082353|2.0|Book could have been an insightful look into the war in Iraq and some reasons why the `terroistst' fought so hard.  Instead the author just writes a paint-by-numbers story of his narcissistic life.  \\"Blam, got one...  Blam got another one. \\"Gee I'm so lucky.\\"<br />I found the way he treated his family and children, like they were just ornaments.  Got tired of reading, \\"Yeah, we got into a brawl at this bar in Mojave and kicked their assess.\\"  I finally put the book down.  Very repetitive.<br />i am sorry he got shot down in cold blood by a deranged marine at his home shooting range, but the book is still not worth the read.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is amazing addicting and extremely accurate to the movie saga that has been such a big hit and now the game is a hit too
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A wonderful description of after-life.  It strengthened my faith, and perked my interest in heaven.  I have recommended it to friends
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son can't watch this movie enough!  I like it too :))  The ongoing action is great too.  Please watch!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out easy but then it gets challenging.  I absolutely love playing this game, it keeps me on my toes.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie not only kept my 3 year old, myself, and my 13 year old entertained the whole way through but it was delightful and had plenty of humor!  I would recommend this movie for any age.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far so good. I was hoping that all of the games were available at ones but overall it's a good game.
B002V092M4|2.0|Although I could understand the methodoligy in writing this book I found it too disconcerting when trying to tie the story together.  This is probably because of a TBI (brain injury).
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this playing this game in my free time.  I really hate when I have to put it down.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Since this movie is older than me and I was required to watch this movie for a class, I was unsure if I would like it. However, I found the constantly changing and expanding storylines to be exciting and since I love mysteries, the murders in the movie, as well as the family and business connections had me hooked throughout the film.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I feel like I'm actually in the temple running myself.  I get so excited playing this game everyday.  Great graphics!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|From the start White Noise was easy to program with a sound - not loud, but enough to still let me think.  And I can set the duration.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A frightening glimpse of the persecution of Jews in second world war Germany. The story follows the events of WW2 until the eventual fall of Germany in 1945. This book kept me riveted, and was another I found hard to put down until I had finished it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the events of the second world war.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album was great! It may have been seven years since his last album, but that doesn't seem to have made a difference. Justin Timberlake has delivered in this fresh, yet nostalgic, album. In an age where purchasing music is rare, I did not hesitate to buy this after listening to it only once on Spotify.
0061733199|2.0|This is another manual from a military mindset, with a narrow outlook on perspective disasters. I suggest using a manual that goes over several scenarios combing several techniques that include defensive measures like this manual.

B002NXSRVG|3.0|Absolutely ridiculous and over-the-top, this is the type of movie that critics love to hate. In reality, it's nothing if not entertaining and, at times, a hell of a lot of fun to watch. There's some great stunts and special effects to be seen here, mixed in with some over-acting and cheesy dialogue. The last half is pretty over-produced but as long as you're ok with parking your brain and leaving reality behind, this is a great action movie that's a blast.
B009EAALII|5.0|This is my first Chris Isaak DVD and I really enjoyed it. I would have preferred more of the Sun Sessions music, but it was still great to watch.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Riddled with bad reactions from test audiences and plagued by re-shoots and 3D conversion during post, not many people believed that this film would ever be released. Alas, almost an entire year after it's original release date, G.I. Joe: Retaliation has finally seen the light of day. Compared to it's predecessor released four years ago, it's a stronger and better film, although it's still completely over-the-top and lacking in any meaningful plot. With that being said, it's a hell of a lot of fun!<br /><br />The premise behind the film involves the G.I. Joes being framed for the theft of nuclear warheads by master-of-disguise Zartan, who is impersonating the Commander in Chief (Jonathan Pryce). The fake President gives the order to eliminate the team of Joes, culminating the annihilation of their leader Duke and the rest of the team, save for three members; Roadblock (Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (relative new-comer D.J. Cotrona). Together, along with the help of Snake Eyes and Jinx, the Joes go after Cobra Commander, Zartan, Storm Shadow, and the rest of the baddies to put a stop to their maniacal plans for world domination.<br /><br />Johnson continues to prove he's one of Hollywood's most entertaining action stars, as he plays the part of the typical macho man with ease. His on-screen camaraderie with Channing Tatum is easy and believable, and he delivers his one-liners perfectly. It was also nice to see Palicki, of Friday Night Lights fame, in the female ass-kicker role, and Bruce Willis is very John McClane-ish in his cameo, which makes for some fun on-screen moments. One of the standouts for me was Pryce, who completely owns his role as the Zartan-impersonated President, and has some of the best lines of dialogue in the movie.<br /><br />There's some great stunt work and special effect moments that make this movie a blast to watch. One in particular that comes to mind is a breathtaking sequence that involves a sheer cliff and ninjas...need I say more? The CGI looks better than in the preceding film as well. When it comes down to it, I think there was only one goal the filmmaking team was trying to achieve with G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and that was to entertain. Do yourself a favor and grab some buddies, pop some popcorn, and enjoy this kick-ass action flick.ay more? The CGI looks better than in the preceding film as well.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing it is the best game of the century I love it because it is so modern and with different colours making it look realistic.
1401937519|5.0|This thought-provoking, inspiriing novel had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end!  I highly recommend it!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|it is a must get game for every one to at least try so what are you waiting for buy it it is free
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very cool game. Would highly recommend to my friends. Wish I could move my game from facebook, since I am at a higher level.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have always had issues with putting on weight. That is, until I found this book! I have only been following the program for 3 weeks now and have already seen 3.5 lbs added to the scale. Not to mention that majority of the weight is lean muscle! Mike really knows what he is talking about and he is very active and supportive of his readers. I get updates emailed from him all the time, and if you check out comment threads from his products, he always responds to people. I also have his book The Shredded Chef and it will get 5 stars from me too when I get to reviewing it. Thanks Mike for such a wonderful book that has helped me accomplish what I used to think impossible!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'm a fan of both 30 Rock and SNL and to see this behind-the-scenes look at both is fascinating.  Fey has a very self-deprecating style but delivers with tons of funny stories and quips.  Definitely a must-read for any fan.  Her take on balancing work and home life is a good guide, I think, for any working parent.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Cute and fun especially for kids and those still kids at heart. Own tons  Of pets minus all the mess to clean
076115678X|3.0|Idont know if i agree with the definitions of the curls.  actually i let someone borrow it and never got it back
1932735410|5.0|This is a wonderful book - there is information in this book that is NOT in the PMBOK, so you must get it to pass the PMP exam.  This book is terrific and makes studying for the PMP much more enjoyable.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I like the watch but I did not realize that it was self winding as long as you wear it and your hand is in motion. Other than that it is great and a great price for a Seiko watch.
B00933JF74|4.0|i didnt like the free version but i am hooked on this version.  no adds,  fun  and i play it on my kindle. i dont have to buy anything in order to play.  it takes a few min to get going but then it is hard to put down
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is very moving and full of inspiration.  The cinematography is a feast for the eyes and the story is wonderful with rich relationships.
B00933JL0A|2.0|this was the free game and the add was on the top and so i could never see what was going on, add wouldnt go away
B00APUYWYA|2.0|On top of  my list as one of the top 10 boring movies!!  A waste of money! I thought this was a comedy!
B0012HEB32|5.0|Was one of the best shows on TV. Still wish it was on. Season 3 would have been epic. Needs to be brought back
B0029QRA1U|5.0|This product far and a way exceeded my expectations. For the price, I was expecting to have some problems. I had none. It is exactly as advertised. The software is great, it tells you what to do after loading it to have the computer sound restored to the speakers (a common complaint I read about while researching these types of turntables), the filter it uses to try and mask scratches is excellent and finally the ability to have the system advance the tracts or you do it manually is a great feature (as the more scratched the records are the more difficult it is for the system to determine where the start a new tract. The older I get the more confused I get with technology, but as my title implies this product is BULLET PROOF.<br /><br />Love it.
1250006341|5.0|Bought this as a special birthday gift for a real dyed in the wool Downton Abbey fan.  She loved it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki, What more is there to say. Great movie! I have been working on collecting all of the movies Studio Ghibli has released. I love them all!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I continue to be amazed that this series lasted only one season.  The stories are very well written, the characters are well defined and the acting is excellent.  The wide range of technology present on various planets allows stories to range from a cowboy-western to futuristic SF.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|MiniSquadron is plenty of fun and well worth the asking price as you can see from many of the other reviews.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  The pacing is slow initially, but builds. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys watching anything from the BBC.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is exactly what I needed and was looking for. It fits perfect on my BJ City Micro stroller and holds things great. And you can't beat the price.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|When I got the cover I was a bit surprised that I have to take the kindle out completely  in order to use it, but after 2 days I realized it is very convenient and I really like it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I love the John Corey character and can't wait for the next mission! Keeps you engulfed in the twists and turns of the story in a &#34;can't put it down&#34; trance.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|There are several story lines plus characters you want to know about.  Also enjoy scenery and costumes.  We always enjoy this time period.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like this becouse it will help me know how much time I have left on the device so I know when to put it on the charger
B00991TCOG|5.0|Beautiful music!!!! It is so relaxing to listen to every song in this CD. I love Lindsey's music and now I'm a fan of hers.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The Hobbit is a great tale, but it's very short in comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I was confused how Peter Jackson et. al could extend it into 3 nearly 3-hour movies without adding some filler material. Well, they added plenty of filler material. It was well done, but I found my attention wandering at times. This movie, and presumably its sequels, were crafted clearly with the intent of milking the franchise for every penny, rather than telling a good tale. It's kind of a shame, but I guess I'm not surprised.
B00991TCOG|5.0|A great cd! Awesome for long car rides. I could listen to it constantly. You get the great classical music feel with more of a modern affect. You can't go wrong with some dubstep.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I love this movie! Only movie I have seen in theaters, that I wanted to watch it again, while I was still in the theater.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|would be fun but it has a tendency to lose all progress.  I also ran into a stuttering problem.  losing all progress is extremely frustrating.
B009K0P10K|4.0|Season 2 was pretty good but I watched season 1 on netflix and found it to be much more entertaining when Emily was &#34;X-ing&#34; out people.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love everything about it.  Wish it was around before I got married and started having kids.  I will use it to help give me ideas for a future home after the hubby retires from the military.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. It is very addicting and challenging, and it was free! How could you go wrong on this one. You won't be sorry. I'm adding to this review as I just finished my last free game on it and now to go further they want you to buy it. I do like this game and probably will purchase the full version of it at $1.99, which is still a great buy. It was just a little disappointing when I thought I was going to be playing this for a long while.
B00A3XWAU2|5.0|If you like early Bad Company or whitesnake you'll really like this. Great album from what is a great new band. I hope to hear more from it.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|You guys still have it... can't wait for new material and videos too for all you greatest hits. I have been following you for years.
B000F3T7R4|3.0|It has some songs found elsewhere on Whitesnake albums. A Decent album but probably one of my least favorite Whitesnake albums.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|First of all Sydney is amazing and im still trying to get kim she is awesome.they have a new board its pretty cool.i would also recommend this to people who also like temple run.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The thing I loved about this book is that Tina Fey never resorts to being mean or nasty to be funny. She offers funny stories and some insight into her life.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is so fun to see all those animal and buying a lot of stuff.<br />I hope they come out with a another.
B007N31YH0|5.0|This movie is excellent teaching tool for students to visualize swindle. My eighth graders loved the movie.It is a classic. There is irony in the movie. A great time for discussion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I love this game alot it's like running here and there every were and the best part is you don't even need internet to play and that's way I love this game
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Much too lengthy ...really hard to get into...this is definitely not the type of book I usually read and I find it hard to understand how they ever made a musical from it!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|No needed anymore .<br />it is a bad item , and poor quality , it made my PC slower than before .<br />i didn't expect that from amazon's sellers, but this is the fact .
B008YI91HS|5.0|Is a lot better then the movies released today. I was really glad I could share this with my kids.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Amazing game.!!!!!!!!!!ONE REASON IS THAT THERE IS SO MANY CHARACTERS TO BE.ANOTHER REASON IS THAT IF Y O U  CAN UPGRADE EVERYTHING.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|BEST alarm clock app for people.  You need to get all of t is free<br />I meant to find a different kind but this is a better apps.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game keeps me way to busy.  There's a regular version, a timed version and the one I like best is the version of the game that keeps track of your best time.  There aren't that many different game boards to play, but you can play the different versions for entertaiment.  The game is stable and the graphics are crisp.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this should be the app of the day the way this calculator helps me it's like my best friend
B00BF11UM0|4.0|I thought the film spent too much time on the interrogations preceding the assault. I realize the importance of the interrogations, necessary to collect intelligence and that the producers wanted to convey this importance to the viewer. After hearing mulitple sources who knew (or know) how we handle detainees during interrogations, it appears that the film went on the extreme side, depicting sessions of torture that probably didn't happen as portrayed. The producers of the film admitted that they didn't consult with intelligence officials as to whether their portrayal was accurate.<br /><br />No attention was paid to the SEALs preparation in a mock facility made for them, just about identical to the house that Bin Laden was living in. Also, no attention was paid to the agents that rented a nearby house to monitor and photograph the target house. This was a risky operation in itself. This would have made it more suspenseful for the viewer. Instead, after it was determined that Bin Laden was likely in the home, the SEALs were all of a sudden getting their gear on and heading to Abbottabad. I also felt that more time could have been spent on the raid itself.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Product came in a reasonable time, got what i asked for. Brand new. Happy customer. Highly recommend this product if you have a go pro camera.
B00BGI076M|1.0|One of the most precious atributes that distinguishes us from any other species is our ability to empathize with our fellow man.<br /><br />I was barely able to get through the first episode of THE FOLLOWING, at which point I decided I would not be able to bear the agony of continuing to watch -- and vicariously experience -- the gut-wrenching terror of one person after another being so realistically tortured, then brutally murdered.<br /><br />Shameless, unpardonable trash, which can only serve as \\"creative\\" inspiration for the most deviant among us.

B005S9EKCW|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Les Miserables for over 20 years and have the complete symphonic recording and 2 previous movies. I have even seen the play 3 times. I was excited to see this movie and was very disappointed in the way the movie was put together. First, they actually changed many of the words in the songs, some actors like Russell Crowe absolutely butchered the vocals of Javert, and some of the acting for some of the scenes was just plain bad.<br /><br />You can say I'm an aficionado and this movie was very disappointing. I'm sorry I bought the blue ray. Do yourself a favor and rent it when you get the chance instead of buying it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book it is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very good book

B003M6EAXM|5.0|Excellent show.  Disappointed that the series had to end.  I'm looking forward to the possible movie.  Like the previous seasons, Season 8 had multiple surprises and Jack always has to answer the moral questions and decisions he has to make.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|All-around great game. Perfect way to pass the time or give your brain a quick workout. Tons of levels, easy to learn, simple yet challenging. Love it!
B007SGM084|3.0|This was an interesting book. I'm still not quite sure how I feel about it. The major problem I had with it was it seemed like she kept writing the same scenes over and over, just changing a few words here and there. And the language was constantly repetitive.  It was an interesting read but mostly, I was bored with it. I could have been so much better.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Spielberg assembled a great cast for this film.  Was strongly moved by the scenes of the horrors of the Civil War, which could have been simply shocking.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Its very usefool but for concret structures sometimes beeps diffently, i think  is perfect for drywall construction, altoght i fully recomend
B00AX7PGQS|4.0|Wow!!! This is not a movie for the casual viewer. But if you love film as art, and have some patience, there are huge rewards here.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A man in a room has a key on his finger (or part of his finger?) and opens a concealed door onto the balcony of a cinema where a naked child is running down an aisle (nod to Au revoir les enfants?) followed by a slobbering, loose-skinned hound dog (nod to Un chien andalou?) He looks at the movie screen where we are introduced to Mr. Oscar, who is chauffeured around in a stretch limo and has to  meet \\"appointments.\\" These appointments require him to adorn theater make-up and perform different roles. Some roles are not even human. So what's the scoop?<br /><br />This is as off beat a movie as you're likely to see. If there is a thread running through it that can be pulled to gather the disparate elements you'll need to dig deep to find it. Like a film by David Lynch or a play by Harold Pinter, you feel lost. But there's something going on that might be making sense at some level. Maybe I just couldn't find it, or maybe this is cinema for cinema's sake. In some scenes Mr. Oscar merely seems to be playing a role. In others he seems to be a real person and the people he interacts with know him as that person. In one scene, the person he interfaces with has the same job as him. Really off the wall.<br /><br />This is a beautifully shot and seamlessly edited film. The music is good and Denis Lavant, as Mr. Oscar, is really good. Edith Scob plays his chauffeur. In one scene she dons a mask similar to the one she wore in 1960's \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" which makes me think that the director, Leos Carax wants to treat his audience to the joys of film.<br /><br />This is one heck of a film. Again, it's not for everyone. But if you are a lover of the art, this is for you.
0385341008|5.0|I liked this book so much I bought copies for several friends that I knew would love it too.This book is a fascinating way to tell history and the daily lives of the people involved.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Been wanting this a long time and it was worth the wait. Some I didn't know but enjoyed the lyrics and music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hard to put this book down once you start it.  I wanted to go into my own silo and ignore the rest of the world until I finished it.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is amazing and very well written.  It is very interesting and keeps you thinking long after you put it down.  I finished the book three weeks ago and I still think about it.  I would recommend this to anyone that has an interest in the butterfly effect.

1451695195|4.0|This book gives further evidence that there is a whole lot more after this life.  It is so very comforting!!
0553801473|5.0|I have read much criticism about this 5th book and its flaws: too many characters, too many points of view, not enough action, unresolved plot lines, and overuse of stock phrases like \\"words are wind.\\"  These \\"flaws\\" are real.  I have moments where it is hard to remember who all of the characters are and how they are connected through historical or current events.  It is often a long wait until Martin returns to my favorite characters point of view.  I suppose there is less action than in the first three books, though here Dances only pales in comparison with its own predecessors; there is still plenty of action.  Martin is a master at creating suspense and he does leave us yearning for more.  And, yes, certain phrases are used frequently.<br /><br />That all being said, the book was immensely enjoyable.  There are so many impossible to anticipate plot twist and unseen connections between the disparate plot lines its hard to find a good time to put down the book.  Martin is such a good story teller, that the flaws listed above of are little concern.  Martins storytelling continues to be too dark and gritty to let me believe he has \\"sold out\\" to commercial pressure and forgotten his roots.  Dances leaves us with many unanswered questions, but our desire to find out the answers only demonstrates the authors gift for suspense. I only hope it won't be too long a wait.<br /><br /> There is a huge world of folklore, history and mystery that Martin continues to build for us.  It is a rich landscape and fascinating for those of us who wish to delve into it, however that remains at the readers discretion: as with Tolkien's Middle Earth, there are many levels at which one can approach the stories- as a casual listener or as a historian or academic.  The presence of an expansive back story need not get in the way of the exiting tale being woven.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this sick thriller. Great acting by all. The various actors/actresses were perfect for their roles. I have yet to be disappointed by Matthew M's. portrayal of whatever character he becomes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! I cant even stop playing it its that good!! I love my beautiful horse that s awesome!!!!!!
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|When this movie first came out, my wife feel in love with it. She kept saying she wanted to get this movie but couldn't never find it. When she saw that I had bought it for her, she went crazy. Overall this is a pretty good movie.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Oh geez where do i start? Iet me start off by sayin i love the TWD the first two seasons were a amazing, season three started off so strong the first 2 episodes was awsome very strong got straight to the point didnt waste alot of time i will make this review without giving to many spoilers away for those who havent seen the show, after the killer within the season went down hill an seem to waste alot of time not really getting anything done just episode after episode was pretty damn pointless its like the writeing was really sloppy an didnt make sence at all, alot of stuff happen way to soon i guess glen mazzarra was goin for the lets shock them rout but it just did not work. Season 2 was so good simply because it took its time this season just rushed things an wasted to much damn time week after week it left me wanting so much more but never deliverd so i can see why they got rid of the show runner he tryed to destroy the show hopefuly season 4 will be an inprovement, if your reading this review an ur considering whatching this show give it a chance At least the first 2 seasons because those were flawless  but my overall rating 7 out of 10
B00417HV14|5.0|As always, Joe Bonamassa delivers.  I particularly enjoyed the insight given<br />into his development as a premier guitarist.<br />He has an emotional involvement in this concert which adds to the enjoyment.

B0093LINVK|5.0|Update: Six months later and this device has provided uninterrupted service without a glitch. My review stands.  I even added a webcam that turns my TV into a HD video conference station.<br /><br />Here's the original review:<br /><br />----<br /><br />I needed a compact device to run a home media streamer connected to my TV to run PLEX.  I ended up purchasing this and I think it's great.  I run Windows 7 PRO with 8 GB RAM and a 128 GB mSATA from Plextor.  Total hardware build cost was about $475 (I think I would have been fine with a 64G drive and 4 GB RAM).  It boots in about 8 seconds including the PLEX client.  I transferred my Windows ISO to a USB drive and had it installed and running in under an hour. I run Win7 PRO so I can remote desktop in from my workstation to install software, etc (you could use VNC if you only have Win7 Home edition). This unit remains headless (no keyboard or mouse) on my TV.<br /><br />It's smaller than I expected - even smaller than I needed.  It runs warm but not hot, it has a small laptop like fan internally but is so quiet I cannot hear it (it sits behind my TV).  It has dual HDMI ports, but I'm not sure why.  It's well constructed with an aluminum housing (sans the shiny plastic top you can customize).<br /><br />The 2x2 core processor and graphics chipset stream 1080p movies perfectly without any issues - unlike these other devices that can start to choke up under load like the Popcorn and lower end Rokus, etc.  Some people complain about lack of USB 3, but I don't think it's necessary at all for video streaming applications, or anything most people will need for a box this size.<br /><br />For a HTPC application, this device is a great choice.

0812983459|4.0|I'm very interested in walking and travelling on foot (I write a blog about it - The Walking Post), so naturally this sellout novel greatly interested me. I was not disappointed - Harold Fry is a really good read. If a bit of soul-pleasing character development doesn't turn you off (let's say, for example, you actually well up when the boys in Dead Poets Society get on the table and shout, \\"Oh captain, my captain\\"), chances are you'll be in tears by the time Harold ... well, let's not spoil anything here.<br /><br />Harold Fry is one of those guys that nobody wants to be, but that we observe people morphing into all around. Since he retired from his job as a travelling beer salesman, he sits at home in his comfortable little house on the south coast of England, occasionally mows the lawn, and is generally bored with himself. He and his wife, Maureen, have nothing left to say to each other, and their only son - a Cambridge graduate, so much better educated than his parents - has disappeared from their lives. Harold doesn't like memories very much. And if every once in a while one dares scrambling out of its cave to bathe in the gloomy sun of Harold's consciousness, it is usually of the variety that is best stuffed back into where it came from. Like, for example, the memory of his former boss, a rowdy brewery owner; or the memory of his six-year old son, in the danger of drowning during one of the family's annual holidays at Eastbourne: In this particularly unwelcome memory Harold sees himself, stopping to unlace his shoes, and the coastguard sprinting past him (without distracting himself with shoelaces) and slicing through the waves to save the child. And he sees the look in Maureen's eyes.<br /><br />One day - Harold Fry sits in the kitchen and thinks about what to do (inconveniently, he had already cut the grass the day before) - a letter arrives. It is a short note from Queenie, an ex colleague at the brewery from twenty years ago - one of those memories that quietly seeped away. She's at a hospice in Berwick-Upon-Tweed up on the Scottish border. A cancer is killing her.<br /><br />Harold eventually pulls a few sheets of paper from the dresser drawer. But what can one say? He ends up drafting a very short note of regret and leaves the house to walk to the closest pillar box. But once he gets there, he can't let go of the letter.<br /><br />And thus begins Harold Fry's unlikely pilgrimage, from the first post box, to the second one, to the next one, and on and on. Soon enough, Harold realises that he is not looking for pillar boxes anymore. He is walking 627 miles across England to the Scottish border to see Queenie.<br /><br />Harold walks without preparation, without luggage, and with only a very basic plan. He walks away from the life that he lead for more then sixty years, and the further he gets away, the clearer he sees what he left behind. He looks back at the forest that one only sees when stepping out of it. Harold is not used to walking, and the way is hard. The daily trudge along with the eventual nights of sleeping rough and days of eating with the help of a second-hand dictionary of wildflowers, slowly change his body. And with the physical transformation, inner walls, consciously and unconsciously built during a lifetime of quiet desperation, start to tumble. Ghosts, friends, and foes, buried deep down in their graves in Harold's brain emerge like souls on Judgement Day. Self-deceptions retreat and make room for real memories.<br /><br />Or, at least this is my own reading of the Harold's journey on foot.<br /><br />Travelling on foot changes our bodies, our routines, and our minds. The little frame, through which we're used to looking at the world, shifts and changes. It might even break. No doubt, there will be another frame that we're not conscious of, but certainly one that's going to be wider and more open than the old one.<br /><br />Long-time (radio play) writer and first-time novelist, Rachel Joyce, doesn't spend much time analysing her hero's inner journey. Her writing, although conveying profound emotions, is as unsentimental as Harold's character - even though Harold learns a great deal about himself, he never self-elevates his journey to the pedestal of pilgrimage. (Actually, when he feelingly becomes a media sensation, he doesn't run away from it - his English sense of duty wouldn't allow it - but he can't wait for the country to forget about him again). Harold walks, and he'll keep walking, and he - so he makes himself believe - will save Queenie by doing so. That's all he cares about. But somehow the physical effort of walking every day, the beautiful (and beautifully described) landscape he journeys through, and the quirky characters he meets on the way, naturally lead Harold to a slow but steady re-consolidation with the way his life went. And once the journey ends, we do feel that what started as posting a letter has turned into an unlikely - an accidental - pilgrimage: a slow, contemplative journey, purging the traveller of his sins.

B007I8S1TY|4.0|As the demands on a website increase, so does the need for deeper knowledge, particularly when so much contradictory advice pervades the technical forums.  I didn't rate it five stars mainly because while it's a trove of valuable information, it's not particularly well-organized in the pedantic sense.  Still--if your on-line presence is growing, you need this book on the shelf.

I finished it the same day I got. Its page turner with a great premise and plot. I can't wait to read the next in the series. This is a must have for any sci-fi reader.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I don't consider myself a work-out fanatic by any means, but I am in good shape and work out pretty intensely 5-6 times a week.  I have been doing so for about 10 years.  With two very small children, I can't make it to the gym, so I do work-out videos at home daily.  This was the first video I tried after the birth of my first child.  For me, even just a couple weeks after giving birth, it was way too easy and not enough of a burn.  I would bundle work out 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 1 and 3 to even feel like I was getting a work-out.  None of these work-outs made me sore.  For people who are used to being more physically active and looking for somewhat of a challenge, I would suggest instead trying No More Trouble Zones or Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  If you're looking for a really challenging work-out, try Killer Buns and Thighs.  I think Jillian is a great trainer, but this one is just too wimpy for me!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I completely loved this book. It was much better than the original book in this series. I can only hope that when they make the sequal movie that it is executed better than the 1st. The book is so good and suspenseful. A great read!

I saw this film 3times, in a very large theatre.  What an incredible adapted French show into a movie.  The supporting people are well known too.......&#34; Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Redmayne, the lady who played Eponine.  Everyone was incredible.

B009AMANBA|5.0|A bunch of my friends already own this DVD.  Daniel Day Lewis has to be the best actor always !!!!What an incredible  portrayal this man has done of Abraham Lincoln.  I personally will love remembering this entire movie.  Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are incredible.  But being directed by Steven Spielberg is what brought this film it's greatest strength.  The early 1800's were displayed so very well.  I really think Steven Spielberg and Lincoln should have won Best Director and Best Picture.  What a great film !!!!!
B009ZQ7M1U|5.0|Moving film that borders between documentary and entertainment. Fresh insight into what many inner-city teachers might face on a daily basis: student abuse, lack of appreciation from society and a struggle more difficult than Sisyphus faces.<br /><br />I walked away in awe and a reborn appreciation for teachers.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Great story and although some theatrical license was taken, it was historically grounded.  If you are interested in seeing a little of what early Christians endured this movie does a good job of illustrating what secular history as well as the Bible describe.  I highly recommend.

B001HBYHFA|4.0|I was just turned on to Firefly recently; such a pity they didn't produce a complete first season! Fox never realizes when they have a great show.<br /><br />If you liked the show, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. It's rare that fans get any type of closure in instances where a show is cancelled mid-season, and I appreciated the opportunity for some closure on this series. Serenity tied up all the loose ends remaining when Firefly ended, and is overall a great &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; film.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|As my headline states, it's best to ignore the negative reviews.  For anyone expecting a fast-moving movie based on a J.R.R. Tolkien novel, you're expecting the wrong thing, especially since this is the first installment of what will become a trilogy.  One critic complained that too much of the first portion of the movie was spent at Bilbo's house.  My counter to that is that this installment is laying the groundwork for subsequent films, and that the first 45 minutes or so are designed to establish motive, characters, and the basic framework of the plot.<br /><br />In Peter Jackson fashion, this movie is full of sweeping panoramic scenes of the incredible New Zealand lanscapes.  On Blu-Ray, the crispness, clarity, and sharpness of the picture almost makes you feel as if you are there.  The acting is top-notch, Martin Freeman is delightful as Bilbo, Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf and is excellent, as usual.  Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield, is terrific in his portrayal of the Dwarven king.  Special effects (especially the motion-capture effects of Gollum and Azog the orc) are wonderful, leaps and bounds above The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Howard Shore's musical score carries over many of the motifs set forth in The Lord of the Rings, but additional compositions of original motifs make the score every bit as rich and sweeping as his previous work.<br /><br />For the Tolkien fan, I recommend this movie highly, and I cannot wait for the second installment to hit theaters.

B0090SI4OC|2.0|I've never read THE HOST, but based on the story presented on film, I don't think there was ever a way this was going to be a very good movie.  Earth has been taken over by a benign, peaceful alien race that occupies the bodies of humans (hosts), squashing the personality / soul of the person who once inhabited the body.  These aliens are, generally, passive and talk slow because that's how we know they are peaceful.<br /><br />A few human are struggling to hide from the aliens.  I'd like to call them a resistance, but they are far too passive themselves.  They live in the rock formations around Shiprock, New Mexico and sneak \\"into town\\" for supplies from time to time, but otherwise, they are not really making much of an effort to rid their planet of the invaders.  In a way, this makes sense, because they are so hugely outnumber, but it doesn't make for very good drama.<br /><br />Into their midst comes Melanie, a tough teen...who unfortunately has been implanted with an alien.  But Melanie is a fighter, and her personality has never disappeared, so she has a constant dialogue with her invader (who comes to be called Wanda).  Most of the drama comes from the fact that Melanie really likes a guy named Jared and Wanda, even though she's an alien, is drawn to Ian.  So we've got this weird \\"triangle\\" between 3 bodies / 4 souls.<br /><br />It's possible that some of this COULD have been interesting if told with either a) verve & energy or b) a breezy, light-hearted attitude.  But the movie THE HOST fails its own meager story by moving at a glacial pace in a drably colored world.  The rocks are brown, the costumes are browns and grays and even the crops being grown by the humans consist entirely of brown wheat.  The movie's score is ponderous...and for me to actually repeatedly notice the score, it has to be really good or really dreadful.  Sadly, THE HOST is dreadful...it sounds like public-domain music that would have been labeled \\"Acoustic Folk Instrumentals:  Slow & Sad.\\"<br /><br />I was simply amazed at how slowly paced the movie was.  Very little happens, but what DOES happen is dragged out seemingly forever.  The very few action sequences there are have no zip.  THE HOST was written by Stephanie Meyers (of TWILIGHT fame), and it's clear the sci-fi trappings are of little interest to her, except as a way to create an awkward love triangle...much like the vampire/werewolf/human stuff she brought us in her more famous series.  But as terrible as the TWILIGHT movies were, they had a sense of humor and touches of tongue-in-cheek playfulness.  THE HOST is so earnest, it is deadly dull.<br /><br />Melanie/Wanda is played by the interesting young actress Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, HANNA).  In the past, she's turned in some very nice performances.  In this film, she seems trapped by the pacing, and because Wanda the Alien is mostly in charge of her body, she plays most of the film with a look of wide-eyed wonder on her face...but little else.  She hasn't ruined her career here, but she hasn't exactly launched herself into stardom either.  But she fares much better than her two love interests, played by Max Irons and Jake Abel.  Granted, these guys have no real character development...but the two actors invest their roles with NOTHING.  Thus, neither of them has one smidgen of chemistry with Ronan.  Also, Ronan is still clearly a teenager (she's 19 now) and the men are well into their twenties.  Their love scenes feel vaguely icky and inappropriate.<br /><br />Diane Kruger plays \\"The Seeker\\"...an alien bent on recovering Melanie/Wanda, because she knows how dangerous a combination they are.  The part is also under-written, and Kruger also manages to do little with it.  William Hurt plays the \\"leader of the humans\\"...a man who also happens to be Melanie's uncle.  Hurt tries to infuse his character with some kind of heft, but again, the part is underwritten.<br /><br />The whole thing feels underwritten and half-baked.  No one feels committed to this film.  Nothing stands out as worthwhile.  Many bad films are at least full of energy, full of the EFFORT (wasted though it may have been) of making the film.  THE HOST feels like the film those same folks would have made...while sleepwalking.

B00BNWWUDY|4.0|SIDE EFFECTS is a tough movie to review, because any description of the movie that's of any value tends to be a spoiler.  Heck, that sentence alone is a bit of a spoiler.  So I'll apologize in advance if I appear to give less information than I should about the film.  I'm assuming you haven't heard too much about it, and might enjoy discovering the film on its own.<br /><br />Director Steven Soderbergh has made a slow-burning movie here.  It never really moves at a fast pace, but it maintains a pretty high level of intensity throughout.  It is a film that deals pretty directly with how Americans are perhaps a very over-medicated society, particularly when it comes to anti-depressants.  And how we don't always know about all the \\"side effects\\" (hence the name of the film).  But to his credit, he's pretty non-preachy about it.  Some of the things people do in this film while under these drugs are pretty scary...but it's all presented in a non-alarmist way.  It acknowledges that these drugs have a place in our society as well.<br /><br />There are four star performances here.  Least successful is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a psychiatrist who may have some nefarious motives.  Her part is a bit unrealistic and feels more like a caricature.  Channing Tatum is more successful as a Wall Street trader just getting out of prison for some insider trading, and looking to readjust to life on the outside and to find his new place in the world.  Tatum doesn't LOOK like a typical \\"wall street tycoon\\" that one might see in film (he's no Michael Douglas or even Charlie Sheen)...but he brings nice touches to the domestic side of his life in his scenes with Rooney Mara, who plays his deeply troubled wife.  This is Mara's film to win or lose, and she does a nice job.  The temptation in a role like hers would be overact...but Soderbergh is interested in having his team UNDERPLAY things.  He's got a compelling story to tell and there's plenty of suspense to be had.  But he's playing it morelike a `70s political thriller than a `00s potboiler...and the film is all the more admirable for that.  And Mara gets her tone just right.<br /><br />As does Jude Law as her psychiatrist.  He's every bit her equal, and he gives us a nuanced character that we root for and root against at varying turns.  He can be either genuinely ingratiating or repulsive.  Law has always been a terrific actor, but never QUITE made it to real stardom.  It would appear as he moves into the \\"middle age\\" of his career, he's going to give some really solid character turns (his recent work in ANNA KARININA is another example...he stole that film).  Yes, he's fun in the new SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise...but a lot of actors could have played that part.  But when he's called upon to give a real, rounded performance, he delivers the goods.<br /><br />Some may find the pacing of SIDE EFFECTS to be just a little too deliberate.  As I implied, it is a slow-burning affair.  But it has genuine excitement and surprise, a mostly intelligent script (the Zeta-Jones character being the exception), very competent direction and some very nice performances.  It's certainly for an adult audience with a decent attention span.  But if offers many rewards and is very much recommended.

B009NH6AOQ|4.0|The first season of The Walking Dead is one of the very best dramas written for television-ever. It is as good or better than even HBO's classics like The Sopranos and Deadwood, in my opinion.<br /><br />Seasons two and three suffer from those in charge mucking with the superb team in charge of producing/writing the show. The show is very popular regardless, but I can't help but wonder what might have been, if the greedy suits hadn't wrecked what had the potential of being the best television program of all time. As it sits, seasons two and three are worth having, and are better than 90% of all the other garbage on television. Both seasons have moments of greatness surrounded by underwhelming sludge written by unimaginative writers who just ought to be employed at something more suitable to their talents. I guess some of them are related to the lawyers trying to save money, or something. They certainly can't write worth a damn.<br /><br />The cast, art direction and extraordinary realistic approach carry the show through the weak writing. Once in a while a brilliant moment happens- those times when the characters act like real people, dealing with an outrageous situation where their humanity is tested and glimpses of season one's impact manages to shine through.<br /><br />Season two is marred also by decisions to pinch pennies in locations. There is really no excuse for this with a show that brings money into the barn by the bale. The show's original director wanted to show the audience the story of the soldier in the tank from the end of season one....we would have gotten to see the military bravely face the dead in Atlanta that led to the poor sot in the tank. Pity the suits got rid of such creative talent in favor of soap opera flavored sludge in between the zombie antics.<br /><br />Season three, in my opinion, is slightly better than season two. Epsiode one was particularly well done. Unfortunately, the tendency to try and keep topping the excitement with moreand more main character deaths, instead of making the writing better and better,  and this does tend to kill off everyone you care about. I wonder what will happen when the show's producers realize there is no one left that the viewers care about to kill off? Will they look for quality scripts, or start a new story following the tales of the remaining walking dead that are still shuffling about?<br /><br />I suppose time will tell.<br /><br />For all my complaints, The Walking Dead is still good. Cross your fingers that AMC doesn't decide to cut more corners and decide to let gradeschool students submit scripts to get out of paying union writer fees, or that they don't set the show entirely in the studio restrooms for a season to save on set fees and put all the money they make into their vacation homes on the coast of the Dominican Republic.<br /><br />I recommend that anyone who cares write the studio and demand quality writing for this otherwise horror-gem. If we say nothing and keep watching, with ratings rising each season, perhaps we have only ourselves to blame when zombie-brained writing creeps onto the screen. This show deserves better.

B004ISVH6G|5.0|Rough and Tumble is an addictive rock album by one of the greatest male vocalists of all time.  I bought this album being a bit unsure of what the content might be, but hoping for some good rock and roll.  This is one of the hardest albums John has produced, and is solid throughout both lyrically and energetically.  My wife grabbed the CD from me after hearing \\"Skyward\\" and has fallen in love with this album.  I enjoy diverse artists from the counting crows to the white stripes, and this album competes well for my listening attention.  I am impressed with both the musical complexity and the lyrics of this album, truly impressive for someone who could be resting on his laurels.  John has a number of superb musicians collaborating with him on this album, and the sound is rock solid.<br /><br />We attended a concert on Friday night in Agoura CA and had a wonderful evening. John sang \\"when I see you smile\\" acapella with the audience during his encore.  He can still sing with versatility and power.  It is clear that John loves the heavy guitar, but isn't afraid to insert an occasional ballad.  Get this album, you'll be reminded that there are real musicians out there who don't need auto tune and a bevy of technicians to make a good song.  Highly recommended.

1476734941|4.0|I've been using this plan for about a month and I have lost weight and I like the fact that (other than the price of the book) I've spent nothing on this diet plan. I am not someone who weighs themselves, but I can tell that my clothes are getting roomier and I feel better. I've been on so many diets in my life and most of them have worked for a while. I think this one is interesting because I am not radically changing what I eat. I pick my fasting days and sometimes (sick as this sounds, haha) I look forward to them because I know the next day will be normal and somehow the food tastes great.  I will have to go with this for a while and maybe check back about how it's going.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|this google app is awesome and you can surf the web super fast.You can do wonderful things on this app.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it would be better if you didn't have to invite friend to advance the game<br />. its also hard to see everything on a kindle or smaller device
1452658145|4.0|I listened to the audio CD and enjoyed it. Gave me a lot to think about. I think he understands what helps a child succeed despite the challenges of socio-economic obstacles and how teachers and mentors can bridge the gaps way beyond head start's first attempts to access learning success.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I'm not really reviewing the album because you just have to listen for yourself. Plus others have already put out some very detailed reviews.  Floyd is so unique that its very hard to compare it to anything else imo.  Long time fan here and I have owned multiple copies of DSOTM and other Floyd albums.  I would put this album as a top 5 album of all-time and maybe even top 2-3 of all-time.  It's spectacular on so many levels.  The more you listen, the more you hear.  And each time the music seems to elicit different emotional responses...at least for me.  Very powerful on a level that very few other artists can reach.<br /><br />This is definitely music to sit down with.  Don't try to listen to it in a hectic place with distractions..you'll miss soo much.  Find a quiet place...put this on a good system or a good set of headphones and Zen out.  This music is beyond awesome and the album would be worth 5 or 10 times the price.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy enough to be fun, challenging enough to keep your interest.  I would recommend this game for most ages.  Children and adults alike
B009KEN87O|3.0|I played this game on easy mode on my Samsung Note II, and it works pretty decent.  I've only had to FC this application a couple of times due to a glitch that prevents it from reopening cleanly.<br /><br />Game play is extremely easy, but the power-ups are a mixed bag.  The invulnerability power-up is especially annoying since you can't hit anything on the edges of the screen.<br /><br />Bosses are stupidly more difficult than normal waves.  The end boss is way frustrating, and really ended my enjoyment of the game.<br /><br />I would not have paid for this game.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This move is a must see. Should have won an Oscar. Jessica Chastain was amazing. I would highly recommend this movie.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This is a block switcher maze type Puzzle game.  Graphics are good, runs great on my Galaxy Note II, and I have never had a FC or crash.  Most levels are not too frustrating, but it fails to really grab my attention. I will play it for maybe 30 min on any given week, and I've had my fill.  4 stars for a fun game, albeit repetitive.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Has various cuts, theater, director, unrated/alternate...... Google the differences, otherwise you have to watch all three in row to notice the subtle differences.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run never looked so beautiful as this version does running at max settings on my Galaxy Note II.  All the powerups are back, the challenge of coin collecting, and the agony of the mis-swipe.<br /><br />Seriously, the mis-swipe made the cut!  Nothing will frustrate you more than tilting to get past a ledge and then swiping a turn, only to have your character flying through the air.  They made resurrection cheaper, so it's not nearly as frustrating as the first version.<br /><br />Once Imangi fixes mis-swipes (how a swipe to the side can ever be misinterpreted as a swipe up is beyond me) this will be a five star game!  Definitely worth every dime you pay for it!  And even worth some micro-transactions.  Even if you are occaisionally frustrated by pointless deaths, the game will keep you occupied for quite a while.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|the Rza delivers a kung fu flick as true to form as any.  loved his work on afro samurai, love his work in the wu-tang clan.  this is a pure kung fu movie, philosophy and action, that's all there is to it.  acting...ok, but great direction, everything moved and flowed pretty naturally, and the fight scenes were beyond sick...did catch myself missing bruce lee during it, though i take nothing away from the fighting actors in the man w/the iron fists
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Beach Buggy Racing is a promising game, but with a really steep playing curve.<br /><br />You start out with 30 seconds on the clock, and must hit distance check points to earn additional times usually around 15 seconds each.  Coins earn you power ups, but you'll be frustrated that you can only get 20-30 coins on each run.  It isn't until you upgrade a car (minimum 800) that you'll start finding your games last a little longer and become more challenging.<br /><br />There seem to be 3-4 different track layouts, but all on the same wacko island.  The gameplay is fun, the cars are neat, the other drivers pointless, and the coin system very frustrating.  If they gave you a more realistic block of time each time you played, then this would be a 5 star game.  Right now I feel like the only way to progress is by taking advantage of the Micro Transactions.
1416575464|5.0|I love this book. It is really pretty to not only have as a coffee table book but gives you great ideas for every room of the house. The little black design guide in the back is great for finding what you see in the book.
B008N1V11U|1.0|This app looked great.  My son bought it using a gift card he had gotten for Easter.  Unfortunately, the file was so large, he would have had to delete 912MB of data off his Kindle for this to download.  I am not sure why this app is listed as being for the Kindle when there is not enough space for it.  Would NOT recommend buying this unless it is like the only game you have on your Kindle device.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its quick and easy--pretty 'mindless' just what I wanted to pass time in waiting rooms and such. Don't like the ads much, but easy enough to get by them
B002SRQ214|4.0|Oh god, I've been waiting for this the only issue is the fan it's TOO LOUD.<br /><br />After that, it can run anything! Now I have to up the Graphics Card
1606863622|1.0|This book had so much potential as beings another  great love story from Nicholas Sparks, but sadly it was not. How could Savannah love John sooooo much that she marries Tim? The way the timeline transpired it is alluded that she got engaged around the same time John was done serving. She couldn't wait huh? Love him my butt. Don't waste your time with this book of crap read one of his other novels like A Walk To Remember, The Notebook or even The Last Song.<br /><br />I wouldn't even bother watching the movie version of this book. That adaption was horrible too.<br /><br />Poor John.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|Thud app can help you take handwritten notes and it is very helpful. All in all this app is a good note taker to use.
B009NH6AOQ|2.0|After a perfect season 1 and 2, season 3 was messy, poorly written, had far to many sub plots and the awful and wimpy Governor and his idiotic town. For quick money, the show got rid of it's good executives and stuck us with Gale Ann Hurd (WHO?)! Buy it if you are a fanatic, rent it if not. If season 4 is not especially brilliant, this show is dead!<br />Lastly, David Morrisey and Laurie Holden have to go, as must killing off characters that would help the show.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is amazing and the game is so fun to play. And the game look so great it like u are in the game.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|I liked this album a lot. The songs were well thought out and the music is great. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Southern Rock with a little country thrown in for good measure.
0312330863|5.0|All Herriot stories are great. Some funny, some very sad but all are touching with a variety of personalities portrayed. Great series of books.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This will be an important movie in our collection for years to come.  The quality of the DVD itself was great.  The movie on it was outstanding.  A great historical production.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|Infidelity, temptation, fatal attraction -- it's always something people love to hear about, especially if all three elements are together.<br /><br />And they certainly are in \\"Chloe,\\" a strange little movie that centers around a very confusing little triangle. Atom Egoyen crafts the movie as a more modern, elegant, art-house version of the 1980s erotic thriller, with beautiful direction and a powerful pair of central performances, but the second half begins descending into Hollywood melodrama.<br /><br />Gynecologist Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) seems to have the perfect life, especially in her marriage to hunky professor David (Liam Neeson). But his constant flirting, a missed flight and a suspicious photo leads her to suspect that he's cheating -- and on impulse, she hires a beautiful prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to tempt David, then report back to her.<br /><br />Chloe goes off to flirt with David, and reports the secret sexual encounters back to Catherine... who finds them kind of a turn-on. And rather than confronting David, she continues meeting with Chloe in secret, even as her attraction to the strange young woman grows. But at the same time, Chloe's obsession with Catherine is growing to dangerous levels.<br /><br />\\"Chloe\\" is apparently based on a French movie called \\"Nathalie...\\", or at least the first half of it seems to be. It's not a surprising revelation, because it feels more like a French movie than an American one -- the story centers around a woman hiring an innocent-looknig young prostitute, and it proceeds in a much more elegant, restrained way than other erotic thrillers.<br /><br />And Egoyan crafts every scene with care, wrapping the actors in symbolic light and shadow. He also draws out some wonderfully complicated characters, who are neither hero nor villain, and whose thoughts often go unsaid. Unfortunately, the second half starts to deteriorate into melodrama as soon as David starts suspecting Catherine of having an affair. People start yelling and getting overwrought, and having dramatic scenes that don't seem to lead into anything.<br /><br />Julianne Moore gives a wonderfully nuanced performance here -- she starts off cool and implacable, but cracks in her mask appear as she spends more time around Chloe. Eventually everything about her seems to collapse, and all her misery and insecurity floods out. Seyfried also gives a glorious performance here as a doe-eyed young prostitute whose motivations are left a mystery. Is Chloe a cruel manipulative femme fatale? Is she just unhealthily crushing on an unavailable woman? Or is the truth a bit of both?<br /><br />However, Liam Neeson's performance is... weird. Atypical. He feels like he's absent mentally. But I blame neither him nor Egoyan for that, since apparently Neeson's wife unexpectedly died during the movie's filming. It's amazing he was able to do this at all.<br /><br />\\"Chloe\\" is an interesting twist on the erotic thriller -- it's an elegant, intricate story about what human passions become once aroused, but it comes unraveled in the second half.fair.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|We truly enjoy this CD.  There are always a couple songs one doesn't &#34;love&#34; as much as the others, but as usual Josh Groban has produced a very fine CD that is perfect listening music at any time.  He obviously has a very good background of pronunciation of other languages, and because he understands what he is singing, this comes through in each song.
B0015XHQTY|2.0|\\"Dirty Harry\\" was a gritty, brilliant suspense movie. \\"Magnum Force\\" was more of a Hollywood product, but still a solid timeless thriller.<br /><br />Sadly \\"The Enforcer\\" is the first misstep in the classic Dirty Harry series, skewing the series in all the wrong directions -- we've got dated villains, a weird soundtrack, and an oddly defanged Harry dealing with TV-drama woes (oh no, he's got a WOMAN partner! And she's BY THE BOOK!). Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever, but he seems to be sleepwalking through large portions of the story.<br /><br />After getting in trouble (again) for using excessive force, Harry (Eastwood) ends up exiled to the personnel department, where he's forced to deal with inexperienced cops being made inspectors. But when his newest partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), is fatally injured by an extremist group called the People's Revolutionary Strike (what?), Harry is launched back into the fray.<br /><br />To his dismay, his new partner is Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), who has never made an arrest or worked a real case. But because she's a woman, the publicity-hungry mayor wants her on the case. And when a bomb is set off in the Hall of Justice, the uneasy partners are forced to go after the people responsible -- with shocking and tragic results.<br /><br />\\"The Enforcer\\" doesn't really feel much like the previous two Dirty Harry movies. In fact, it sometimes feels more like an overlong episode of a '70s cop TV show -- just look at the whole subplot about Harry getting an \\"odd couple\\" partner who, of course, complements him well. And let's face it, the whole revolutionary bomber thing has not aged well, nor are any of villains very memorable.<br /><br />And James Fargo doesn't really inject much life into the lackluster story. There are some humorous moments that elicit laughter (Freddie the Fainter), but the more script isn't as witty or tight as you would expect. And the action scenes are completely derailed by the soundtrack -- we get this weird cheery jazz music that sounds completely out of place. Whose idea was that?<br /><br />That isn't to say that there aren't some powerful scenes -- there is a very intense scene when Harry speaks to a dying friend, and Eastwood pulls it off with a real sense of repressed rage and grief. But they're too few and far between.<br /><br />Eastwood himself seems to be going through this one on autopilot, probably because Harry seems oddly defanged in this one. Oh, he's still awesome and hard-boiled, but he just doesn't seem as menacing or independent here. Tyne Daly does a pretty good job as Kate, though, and the inexperienced but brave cop does complement Eastwood's hard-bitten Harry well. Too bad she didn't appear in any future movies.<br /><br />\\"The Enforcer\\" stumbles badly by having very little in common with the previous two Dirty Harry movies -- it feels strangely generic, as if it were a copy of a copy of a Clint Eastwood movie. Watch only if you want to see the complete series.et this weird cheery jazz music that sounds completely out of place.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I could hardly wait for this to arrive.  I did not get to see it at the theater.  It is a truly great movie, and I am so glad it has been put into DVD for a great number of people to enjoy.  I have seen it on the stage in Washington DC, so I am aware of the characters and the story.  The actors did a great job in my opinion, and this will be a very important DVD in my collection.  I love it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game. love it a lot. I play it all the time and it never gets old. It is just plain awesome.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is my second Ice Age DVD.  And it is just as good as the others I have purchased.  All of us in the family love it, no matter what the age of the watcher - four years old or eighty-nine.  A very fun movie.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|very awesome I love playing. time flies while playing. already level 17 and loving it. cant wait until I hit the Max.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is quite a historical novel, so it has both history and story.  I felt the actors did a fine job.  It was a gift for a member of our family who is from England, and she loves it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It definitely helped when my phone was destroyed but the speakers for the kindle are not as loud as any phone. This however forces me to choose naturally louder songs/themes for when I have to wake up. It doesn't drain the battery unless you keep snoozing over and over (even then it will take forever to waste the battery). I don't have to keep the screen on for it to work. It has some good customizing features as though.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great product for a decent price. Product was as descibedl and arrived on time. would definitely purchase this again, Thanks!
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I was ready to buy this, thinking it would include the sweeping end credits medleys.  What a disappointment!  The people who put this together had a chance to differentiate this soundtrack from the other versions of the musical around with added bits of the score, but they chose to stick to just the songs.
068987474X|5.0|As a single woman living in the city, I live by this book! It's funny because friends will justify a man's non committal behavior and I just think \\"well, even if there's a reason he won't commit, the point is he isn't committing, I'm not out to save or change any man and I deserve more than that.\\" And it's true!
1476734941|5.0|This is an easy-to-follow diet that is working for me and my sister. Dr. Mosley has written a concise book that outlines a new eating strategy that can be followed for life. There are recipes with appealing photographs to help encourage healthy eating. I am looking forward to seeing how my next blood work tests reflect this new, improved diet.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|No problems with this product or the price. I was very excited to be able to find this one to complete my collection.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|LOVED the story. So fantastic. Written in a way that you feel present for the whole thing. The dynamic between him and the rest of the characters is so well played.
B004KKX80A|4.0|so good but it is a attack typ and it seems like its a balance typ but not in a bad way
B003O86FMW|5.0|5<br />Because it was good<br />I don't know yet<br />I would recommend it to all of my friends, I think they would like it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an amazing TV show.  Too bad network TV can't step up and start bringing us some shows more like this one.  Great acting, superior story line, just great watching all around.
B008220C56|2.0|To echo what others have said, the key to my disappointment in this movie was the emotional distance, largely induced by the stylization. The acting was fine, but I liked Anna less and less as the movie proceeded. So other than the eye candy, the movie left me cold, and this is a type of movie and story I normally love. I can appreciate it intellectually, but I wanted to be swept away!<br /><br />A MUCH better historical period piece this year is the Oscar nominated foreign film, A Royal Affair.  Based on historical fact about an unbalanced Danish king, his queen (Alicia Vikander, who played Kitty in Anna!) and a German doctor who enters their lives, it kept me enthralled.  So if you were disappointed with Anna, but normally like this kind of movie, don't let subtitles hold you back from seeing something much more satisfying. We're going to see a lot more of Alicia Vikander, too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great book - it expanded my horizons - I could not wait to finish it and start on the next book.  The characters were so very believable that I laughed and cried through out the book.  All my friends have read it and recommended it to their friends.
B00005YU98|5.0|I have just recently discovered Mike Scott and the Waterboys. Out of the six CDs I have - This Is The Best!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an even better book that the first on of the series.  I fell in love with all the characters even more than before.  AND it made me look a the whole bondage experience in a whole new light.  Although not for me it was an eye opener.  Definetly would recommend it to anyone who asked, and have recommended it even to my adult daughters.
B004132HZS|5.0|Always liked and was a follower of Benedict Cumberbatch. BUT his Sherlock is beyond words - How could anyone do anything as overdone and banal as another version of Sherlock. OMG SOOOO WELL DONE BENEDICT.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Just another chapter in the life of Kay Scarpetta and her world.  I have recommended this entire series to all my friends who love to read.  Patricia Cornwell writes so well you feel like you know the characters and cannot wait to read another chapter and another book in the series.
B000008M54|5.0|Another great CD by the Mike and the Waterboys. Has Yeats &#34;The Stolen Child' - fantastic for us Yeats fans
B002436WFI|5.0|This movie was well worth the 5 bucks i shelled out for it.  I've read a few of terrys books and had never read the books this movie is based off of.  The Color of magic captivated me for the whole three hours, usually when i watch movie that long i get restless and bored.  i recomend this movie to anyone who likes a good fantasy and a sense of humour.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Enjoyed this Kindle read. Thoroughly enjoyed the story and the evolution of the characters. Just wish the series was longer. Really hate to see the characters go.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Enjoying this,game it plays a lot better than the first one and the graphics are great. Also it's free you may have to buy some game coins but so far I've been able to play without buying them it just takes longer
B00A8LYYI0|3.0|The biggest problem I have with this is why was the 3D Blu-ray combo pack released a week later than the regular Blu-ray combo pack. And then when it was released it couldn't be found in stores because the stores didn't stock it like they were unaware of it. Secondly, for the price and the extra time, the &#34;extras&#34; are disappointing to say the least. A short &#34;Behind the Scenes&#34; doc and that's it. The one positive I have is that this film does look excellent in 3D but I would've still liked to have had more content, deleted scenes, alternate endings etc...
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun and addictive! Great to take your mind of things. can't seem to get enough. Can't wait to see how far I get
B000002GYW|5.0|i was working as a dj when this lp was released.  a friend bought it and brought it to the station.  i auditioned some of it and was just blown away.  i had enjoyed the eagles early singles but the album wasn't that hot--actually i bought it and sold it to another guy.  \\"desperado\\" was a whole other level of writing words and music plus it made a great \\"theme\\" album.<br /><br />asylum records hated the thing.  \\"tequila sunrise\\" was released as a single and didn't do much--sad because it's a great song.  the album was mostly treated as a bust by am radio which ruled then.  as for me i bought it and wore out a few copies.  was thinking about it the other night and could not find my copy so ordered this one.  this is a 40 year old cd friends--and it still sounds great.  think any of this crap on the radio now will be getting listening time and considered \\"great\\" 40 years later--yeah, justin you just count on that for your retirement income.<br /><br />you want great words--\\"she passes her time at another man's side and i pass the time with my pride\\".  i get that and if you're anywhere near my age so do you.
B007712XAU|5.0|I highly recommend this series. Not the ususal run of the mill drama series. Very good television! Thank you PBS!!!!!
B00C4QWDYY|1.0|I wish they had an easier system like ITunes where I am able to download movies without difficulty. Please someone fix this system. Well I just found it in iTunes. Goodbye Amazon instant video
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I went on a backcountry day trip and was learning about avalanches so I was in a lot of snow. It was a beautiful powder day  and snowing throughout the day so usually my phone would have been moist and wet and struggling to work but this case is amazing! I had dropped it in the snow a couple times but when I checked it at the end of the day it was fine and it was like I had never been in stormy conditions :) I highly recommend this case it hasn't broken or ever let moisture through. I work with kids and it has survived many a stray snowball hitting it. Which means it is a great case in my book <3
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps you busy.It is AWESOME!!!!It will sometimes give you some twisting stuff. Its just cool like the other games like this.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I just enjoy this game so much. it challenges me on great way and I can feel my brain working to figure out the different levels. worth the dollar. you will not be disappointed.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|As I anxiously await the release of #3, it was fun to rewatch this wonderful movie and discover the special features.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was surprised that I liked this show. The only show I like better is, Breaking Bad. It is the best ever!!!!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|My favorite part of this is the bromance between Bruce Banner and Tony Stark. Every time I watch I look forward to their moments on screen together, unmasked and as their alter egos. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. leave me in awe of their chemistry every time. The Avengers is marvelous.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Love Lizzy!!!! They are great in Live also...AWESOME!! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love all the extra scenes and special features. I love the 11th doctor and have recently watched the 10th and 9th and they are awesome too. This was the 1st season I watched and it got me hooked!
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|The movie introduced me to the graphic novel. The graphic novel filled in some loose ends.  Then there was simply reading pleasure.<br /><br />RDG
B00005JPS8|5.0|I sold my first copy, but realized I missed it. So, I bought it again and I'm happy to say it is just as amazing as I remember.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I've watched it twice. After the first time I had to tell my friends they had to see it too.
B0035G04TI|5.0|I'm a therapist and often refer to this book or encourage clients to pick up this book. I've heard that there are other books in this series, but this book is good enough for me to teach families how to communicate, not just couples. It's easy to read, as well.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who loves the TV series! Could not put this book down. Must read.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|An absolutely must have for anyone running a media server and multiple platforms... hell it organizes it for you too.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|If you are looking for a DVD that will make your sound system shine, then this is the one.<br />The sound and picture quality transition from the 12 minute background information to the actual concert is amazing.<br />If you are an Eagles fan, don't miss out on this concert!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|SO B.A. they did good adapting it from the book, and i liked the look of the white walkers, cant wait for seas 3
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This book had a very realistic feel to the story, very believable. I felt I gained a better understanding of the journey to and from adiction. While being quite educational, this book was still entertaining. well researched and well written.
B00005JKBC|5.0|I didn't know if I was going to like this movie or not, but I had the chance to view it this last weekend and all I can say is, \\"Great!\\"  You have to pay attention to the storyline, but it will definitely hold your attention once it has you.  Redford and Pitt do an amazing job of bringing out the tensions that exist between the characters they portray and the underlying respect and friendship they build. The characters are intelligent (almost frighteningly so) and the scenes are exceptionally well done.  I thought it might just be another shoot-em-up or blow-em-up movie, like so many other action/ adventure films, but this one has an intellectual component to it that's missing in other action/adventure movies. It has more than one unexpected twist to it and it will keep you wondering.<br /><br />I definitely will be watching this movie again.  I don't know how or why I overlooked it the first time.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I could watch this every five minutes. I love Seinfeld and have enjoyed this product very much. This is a terrific series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved that you could feel what the characters were feeling, that the main leads were awesome it had me reading it when ever I could:)
B00B2166BS|4.0|The cable works good and seems to charge a bit faster. As others have stated, the only real draw backs are the length (should have been 6') and that it won't charge while the micro usb is in use (limitation of current hardware?). Zons shipping fast as usual.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This was watched at our house on Easter day. The kids 5 & 8 loved it. Just a little cheering going on at the end...
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I am not one who is big on superhero movies, but I must say that I did enjoy, \\" The Avengers\\". More of an action movie, which I am fond of, I definitely loved the action packed cartoon inspired movie. I was never brought up with a comic book in hand, and can actually confess that I have never actually read a comic book and to me, it was boring to watch all those Saturday morning cartoons about the superheroes who always came out with the win. I mean what's the point? We obviously know the good guys are going to win, and after seeing the repeats every week, I could not stand to waste my Saturday morning watching another episode.<br /> Even though I was a kid then, I still never went to see any of the Marvel movies and when my professor said we were going to watch it in class, I rolled my eyes and sat back in boredom. About an hour into the movie, as everyone else was getting up to take a break, use the bathroom or tweet about how we were watching a movie in class, I sat in my seat the whole time because I was so engaged in the movie. At the end of it, I was extremely surprised that I sat through the whole 2 and a-half hours. It is a shame I did not see this in theatres because it would have definitely been something I would of watched in a nice cozy chair with some popcorn. There was action, as all the superheroes in the end were fighting off Loki and his evil plan to destroy everything in his path. I was shocked at the end because I was certain all of Loki's mischief would play out in his favor. Throughout the movies, The Avengers struggled to come together as a team and work through all of their struggles. Everyone thought they were right about what was happening and could not put their stubborn ways aside to work together and stop Loki the evil villain and then of course, there was The Hulk who had quite a temper and would go out on these tangents and destroy buildings only to go back to his original human body having no memory of what just happened.<br /> At thebeginning of the movie, you think to yourself that there is no way these superheroes can put their differences aside and work together, but they know the world needs them in order to keep peace within the world and fight off all the bad guys. Without watching this movie, I would of not recommended it, but after sitting in class for the 2 and a-half hours, I would indeed recommending people to rent this movie. It is definitely worth watching.
0446556750|4.0|I'm not sure as to what book the one-star reviews are referring to, but this joint effort from Haller and Bosch really fires up.<br /><br />The pairing works well, and contrary to some reviewers' opinions, magnifies each of the other's skills - or shortcomings.  Connelly's style is as polished as ever, and as usual he guides the reader through the thrust and parry of the sometimes questionable legal system with ease.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Very well done.  Makes the reader feel the pain of the primary character.  Insight into  the world of this  victim.
0399157565|1.0|This is a shocker - for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I've only managed to stay awake for around 200 pages, and what's happened in the entire first half of this book?  A body has been found.  Uh... anything else happened?  Nope; that's it.<br /><br />This has to rate as one of the most drawn-out, long-winded plots I've ever come across.  So much extraneous verbiage, virtually no action, and no meaningful plot development.  The reader also needs the help of an acronym dictionary with the alphabet soup of various governmental departments, medical esoterica and data bases etc.<br /><br />Scarpetta hs turned into a selfish, cynical shrew who seems to think the entire world is out to get her, whilst Marino is now such an offensive caricature that he should be written out permanently.  The working relationship between the two just doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />The shadowy Benton is in the story for what purpose I couldn't identify, and daredevil niece Lucy is a laughably cookie-cutter figure... oh, and she's a lesbian.  Wow!<br /><br />Give this dreary tale a miss folks, and say a fond farewell to the \\"old\\" Kay Scarpetta - who Ms Cornwell has consigned to a literary grave.
1616550414|5.0|Very awesome book. Recommended for all fans of Zelda's series. The art of the book is beautiful and the historia is complete.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|This is a great game for children.  I use this in my Kindergarten Classroom and my children love it.  The levels are perfect and it helps them count.  It also teaches them to listen.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|This book was entertaining to read because, it told about a kid named Grey and how his summer was. He tried to impress a girl to think that he was a cool guy.
B002S45V32|5.0|very nice and clean movie, good movie to watch with family and kids too, no the heavy  movies people are watching this days
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really thought this game was fun and I especially like it with the games seperated into squares!! I'm glad I got this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Can't wait to finish this review and start the next book in the series.  I thought the book would be repulsive...kids killing each other....on tv....adults taking bets.  Well written!
B005OZE9SA|3.0|While this product works OK, please be aware that Focusrite provides almost no customer support for their products. I have been very frustrated with one specific issue, but have not been able to get any response. Their website is only a point of sale. All support is through phone, which is rather antiquated foe the current century. In that way they are far behind other companies with similar products that work just as well.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|A wonderful book that that I wish my mother had 20 years ago. It really deals with parenting and how different cultures seek to motivate their child. Thank you Amy Chua for this book.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I watched it on vacation with my family and it was definitely compelling.  It brought back memories of the hostage crisis.<br />DVD arrived on time and in good condition.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book! Honestly it was a little hard to get into, but the character development was excellent, and in the second half, I couldn't put it down. Great read, and made me tear up. That's definitely an accomplishment to be able to make me cry while reading as book. I highly recommend it!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fun, exciting, well written, addicting. Really enjoyed this book! Got it from the Amazon Prime borrow library, and will definitely get the other books.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Loved the personal touch the first person perspective and diary style writing gave. I felt like I was snooping and reading someone's secrets throughout the book, which I enjoy doing in real life. it was honestly and well written which I appreciated. watched the movie immediately after and maybe I should have waited longer for the book to sink in, but I found the movie kind of boring.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Amazing to see the 5 Phantoms at the end of the performance.<br /><br />This was a spectaculare event! So wish I could have attended the live performance!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|After watching the movie, I wanted to read the book it was based on and definitely enjoyed the book more than the motion picture. An unconventional love story and easy read.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This treatment,&#34;capture&#34; of the stage musical is an amazing prize!<br />Wish the movie version of The Phantom of the Opera would be reshot in the format of this film.
B0060MBJCK|5.0|It's hard to write a review about this book without giving the game away... suffice to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't believe I haven't read it before. It's hard to write a short review because there is a lot to the plot and there are also many underlying themes. I listened to Fight Club as an audio book and it's the 1st book ever that 5 seconds after finishing I started listening to it again.<br /><br />The narrator, who is never named, is a young executive with a flash apartment, IKEA furniture and a refrigerator filled with a large range of different brands of mustards and salad dressings. He knows his life is superficial and perhaps this is part of the reason he suffers with insomnia. The turning point comes when he meets a girl named Marla Singer who he consciously despises but unconsciously desires. Also at this time Tyler Durden enters his life. Tyler, who later has a sexual relationship with Marla, blows up the narrator's condo, which results in him moving in with Tyler. Tyler goes on to establish Fight Club (a string of illegal, after hours, bare knuckle clubs round the USA) and Project Mayhem aimed at recruiting an underground army to create anarchy, all of which he funds with his soap making venture. Tyler, like the narrator, says he had no present father when growing up and according to his philosophy he and the narrator together with the members of Fight Club, are \\"god's middle children\\" who, because they've failed to attract the attention of their fathers and god by doing good things, will try to do so by doing evil things.<br /><br />At first, the narrator goes along with Tyler's escapades but later, thinking he's gone too far and concerned he may harm Marla who the narrator has developed feelings for after spending more and more time with her, he decides to try and stop Tyler by shutting down Fight Club and Project Mayhem. Tyler's final plan is to destroy the national museum by blowing up the Parker-Morris building, the fictional tallest building in the world, and to die as a martyr for Project Mayhem.<br /><br />The narrator and Tyler end up at the top of the Parker-Morris building and Tyler puts his gun into the narrator's mouth meaning to kill him while the building blows up. But when Marla appears on the rooftop too, Tyler vanishes. The explosive malfunctions but in spite of Marla's pleas, the narrator pulls the trigger of the gun in his mouth.<br /><br />The bullet exits through his cheek and he ends up in hospital not wanting to \\"go back\\" to his life outside because some members of Project Mayhem who work at the hospital whisper to him that \\"everything's going according to plan\\" meaning Fight Club and Project Mayhem are still going strong.<br /><br />I like a lot of things about this book. The characters are real, I love Palahniuk's stark style and his succinct imagery is just perfect. \\"against the sort of cave paintings of dirt in the toilet bowl\\" is just one example. It's an unusual plot with a great twist and it covers a host of themes that have the potential to provoke animated discussion.<br /><br />\\"I'm breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions... because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.\\" Tyler whispers.<br /><br />\\"Only if we're caught and punished can we be saved,\\" says the narrator.<br /><br />And perhaps that is the main dichotomy.ing in the world, and to die as a martyr for Project Mayhem.<br /><br />The narrator and Tyler end up at the top of the Parker-Morris building and Tyler puts his gun into the narrator's mouth meaning to kill him while the building blows up.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|great game, very entertaining. beat all the levels, now playing arcade mode.  some levels are frustrating but still a very unique and fun game. drains the battery tho so be careful.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is a get game it make yu feel like you have your own zoo!! You have too feed breed ,love them. You can also visit your friends zoo if you like . Help them out around their zoo !
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a very good, different, well-written book but I did figure out what was going on fairly early in the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you love a fun game with adventure and skill then this one is perfect! I love this game and I'm sure you will too!(:
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|First, I am partial to this as Kelly is my favorite artist and I think her voice can do no wrong, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The deluxe edition is a must have for any true Kelly Clarkson fan. Not only because there are more songs (it has new songs that aren't included on the regular edition) but a DVD with ALL her music videos...except Catching My Breath, or any videos released after that. The DVD is simple, with a basic menu. You can play all her videos, or pick one.<br /><br />The main thing to remember, is a greatest hits CD is not going to be all that interesting. You have heard most of these songs hundreds of times and probably can sing along with all of them for the most part. The new songs are a nice touch, so you get a little more for your money.<br /><br />I love having this CD because it is a nice compilation of her work throughout the years. I love her new songs too. It is a great CD for the avid fan or as a gift for someone that doesn't have any of her CDs.<br /><br />Hope this review helps. God Bless!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very amazing game and I love how it changes  you never get bored of it. I hope everyone gets a chance to play it
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Thus is really a good movie if you like musicals.  The a Capella is so good!  Would highly recommend it!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been enjoying this game a lot. My only request would be to add a way to refresh my memory of the special powers while I am playing. The game is fun and engrossing.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I've read several books about Google, but if you want to know the inside of Google, this is a must-read.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I was at Justin's show at the Garden and having the show on DVD makes me feel like I am there all over again! Love the behind the scenes footage! Concert was one of the greatest I've been too! Rated even higher than NSYNC :) Must have for any JT fan!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game. have a great time. it helps pass time when there is nothing else to do. very relaxing and easy
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It is fun to go back and watch earlier seasons.  Not only do you get the developing story of The Doctor, but you also see how broadcast television is maturing when you watch later seasons.  There were at least 3 episodes I think I completely missed watching before going through them this time.
1596434252|5.0|Great Book. Great Price. Timeless and beautiful. Well crafted and wonderfully designed. Every kid and every designer should have one.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance, as do TLJ and Sally Field.  However, the script is hokey, predictable and utterly without imagination.  Yes, I know its about an historical event, but it would have been hard to make this historical event less interesting.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I just got this game so I could get coins for another game, well I haven't been able to turn it off.  I feel I am still learning how to play but that keeps it interesting.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this to replace an older USB to serial adapter (from another manufacturer) that wasn't Windows 8 compatible.  This Plugable USB to serial adapter uses the Prolific PL2303HX Revision D chipset which is Windows 8 compatible.  I use it to connect to various Cisco devices and haven't had any problems.  Can't beat the price too!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a really good app but it doesn't have redstone, sattles, hunger, breeding, and some other things like some types of blocks but it does have multiplayer.
B00002438V|5.0|I like Dvorak and Rickter is a great performer.  Before I heard this work, I was not aware the Dvorak had written a full piano concerto. I thought that his work was restricted to Symphonic and folk dances.
1400067820|5.0|NNT's best book. Lucid and entertaining; this book has become to be one of the most important of my life.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|All the Echoes!!!!  This is a GREAT cd. I play it all the time at home and in the car. He has a beautiful voice.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I had the free version but needed more bells and whistles to keep the 2 year old interested. He is amazing with is one. I think he liked all the different steps especially cleaning up the dishes and washing them!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I don't like this book because it takes to long to get where I want it just give me some help
B00275EHJG|5.0|The movie was just as described and had absolutlely no flaws or skips. Shipping was fast and my grandson loves to watch one of the Toy Story movies everytime he comes over!!
014241543X|4.0|This is one of those wackadoodle books where a young woman on the cusp of life meets a tragic fate and then floats around in a dead/near-dead state observing her friends and family. This type of plot intrigues me because the character always learns a lot about Life when she is reduced to an outsider incapable of action. It also bothers me, though, because I think: if a character is dead or comatose, shouldn't she be, you know, dead or comatose? As a reader, my imagination has very few limits; I'll accept ghosts, vampires, dragons, superviruses that only infect hermaphrodites born on Tuesday afternoons during a blizzard, but invisible floating (semi-)dead girls? That's crazy!<br /><br />Qualms about the premise aside, If I Stay is a short book overflowing with emotion. It unrolls over a single day and we alternate between the comatose protagonist Mia watching her friends and family cry in the hospital waiting room and the comatose protagonist Mia remembering happy stories with her friends and family from the past. The crux of the novel concerns Mia's choice. After suffering a catastrophic car accident with her entire family, Mia asks, in the famous words of The Clash, \\"Should I stay or should I go?\\" That is, should I keep living despite the fact that my life as I knew it ended today? Or should I simply give up and die, having nothing left to live for? The plot largely succeeds because the flashbacks are well chosen; we get to see what is at stake for Mia, what she'd lose (or depending on religious perspective, what she'd regain) if she dies.<br /><br />Pondering what you would decide in Mia's situation is fascinating. It depends on your faith and on your relationships, but for anyone, it's a question with no good answer. Seeing what Mia chooses and why she chooses it makes If I Stay a worthwhile read.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|really impressed with quality of the book and point of view. Lots to learn here and the book is a great place to start.
0142420891|3.0|Well, this is a bit awkward. The only reason I read If I Stay, the prequel to this book, was to eventually read Where She Went, which has rave reviews and is considered better than the prequel. And now, here I am, having read both books and having been decidedly underwhelmed by both.<br /><br />Truly, I don't have much to say about Where She Went. It run-of-the-mill YA in my opinion, only with MORE angst, something I never really thought was possible since YA already owns 99% of the world's angst. Yes, there were some heartfelt moments. Yes, it was a fairly thoughtful exploration of loss--both in the sense of death and break-ups. Yes, it was decently well-written. But was there anything special about it?<br /><br />In my opinion, no.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'm going to keep this short as I don't feel worthy to write a review of this book.  If Kvothe knows the name of the wind, then Patrick Rothfuss knows the Name of the Storyteller.  This man is truly a wordsmith.  An artist who can paint pictures with words.  Beautiful, rich pictures where you feel you are living in the painting, it becomes that much a part of you.<br />I loved this book.  I was drawn in on the first page and filled with wonder on every page after that.  The only thing that heartened me at the end was I knew there was another one waiting.<br />Well done, Mr. Rothfuss.  So over and above well-done, I don't know what else to call it, so I'm going to close now before I start sounding like Gimli son of Gloin trying to describe Galadriel.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I am a fan of John Grisham and have always enjoyed reading his books.....until now.  The characters in this book were not likeable and the story was frankly boring.  I was very disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone.....especially a John Grisham fan.
B008K8H9C6|4.0|My 4-year-old grandson likes this game and loves to play it on my Kindle whenever I come to visit. It is a great exercise in abstract reasoning and helps him to think about how things work.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE OVER TEN (10) TIMES AND EVERYTIME I SAW IT I LOVE, LOVED IT.  NOW I WANT TO OWN IT.  AND, I DON'T EVEN OWN A DVD.  HAVE TO BUY ONE JUST FOR THIS MOVIE.<br />SUNSHINE 310
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|If you are a great fan of humor books I highly recommend it to you  THIS IS A GREAT BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Very Romantic, but a chick flick for sure.<br />This P&P is by far the best one out of all the other remakes.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Actors are good! I like the cast and the action. I go to the range but never take the shots the hero makes but know some who can and do! Technical stuff like when they visit the all knowing gunsmith was awesome! I like such scenes that are comparable to a movie called The Day of the Jackal ( not the Brue Willis one) that came out in the 70s. in that movie the Jackel meets with the gunsmith in Geneva and they disgust the Jackal's weapon of choice...
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very challanging but not stressful.  Love the music and graphics.  Highly recommend this game for those who can visualize into the future.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|Yes, as so many other reviewers have indicated, this album is different. But I view it as an opportunity for Dido to experiment and have fun. In the midst of the electronics & rap, it's still the chill & melancholy Dido that I've always appreciated.<br /><br />I find the rap in \\"Let Us Move On\\" rather appealing, and not at all out of place. I don't feel that the electronics are overdone. And a number of tracks, especially \\"Day Before We Went To War\\" and \\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\\" are close enough in style to Dido's previous albums that her fans shouldn't feel abandoned.<br /><br />Something about \\"Let's Runaway\\" strikes me as a particularly pleasant balance between her typical sound and a bit more pop than we've been used to.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the variety of styles will cause some, perhaps myself included, to pick & choose our favorites for our playlists. But I hope that longtime fans will see this as Dido branching out rather than completely reinventing herself.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|if you haven't seen it, see it. if you don't own it, buy it. it is everything Skyline wanted to be but wasn't.
0930289234|5.0|Walter Kovacs might say &#34;The novel makes the dark clouds wheel over my head like the drunken strippers under the lamp on the corner. The lamp that illuminates the dark corners of filth in their minds. Revealing and harsh. Truthful.&#34;
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Easily one of the best movies of my generation. And a look into what would have been with a live action, big budget Halo movie.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|This finds the Dead in a really interesting period.  They were on a break from the road and trying to incorporate Mickey back into the fold.  There are so many classic cuts on this record that would become staples in the Dead's repertoire for years to come.  In some ways it reaches back to the &#34;Live Dead&#34; and &#34;Anthem of the Sun&#34; era with complex time signatures and long pieces with several movements, but it also combines elements of &#34;Workingman's Dead&#34; and &#34;American Beauty&#34; with rich harmonies and epic stories to tell.  While this isn't my favorite sound the Dead came up with in the studio, the compositions have stood the test of time and deserve to be listened to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a competitive game between my son and I (he is 7... I am 29), and he beats me everytime!  Love it!
B008YCMM2A|5.0|I love this new bootleg series for Miles.  This volume captures Miles when he was in yet another transition from his acoustic/electric sound (&#34;Miles in the Sky&#34;, &#34;Filles De Kilimanjaro&#34;) to his more electric sound (&#34;Bitches Brew&#34;, &#34;Jack Johnson&#34;), and it's really interesting to hear his sound.  Miles still has some serious chops, and the bands sound has shifted from being more melodic to being more free and intense.  This music is not for the faint of heart.  Jack Dejohnette and Chick Corea are really intense.  They're constantly pushing the envelope while Dave Holland holds down the groove on double bass (this was before Miles had an electric bass player in the band). If you're interested at all in the period of Miles' music I highly recommend checking this out.  Vol. 1 is amazing, too!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Everyone should read this book.<br />If you read it as a child, read it again as an adult. Read them all
B00371V918|3.0|I found this book to be charming<br />It's well written<br />The story is good<br />The main characters are solid<br />And the romance is nice just lacks a small bit of sparkle
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Love their sound! Saw televised concert from Red Rocks and was hooked. Can't wait to see them live in Houston!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all seasons.  1, 2, 3  mostly on my Kindle fire.  Just showing how times have changed  and often repeats itself.<br />Can't  wait for next year  episodes.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|So glad to see he has such a great debut cd! He is so talented. Has a variety that switches back and forth.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|So fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat, the puzzles were fun and kept your brain at work can't wait for the sequel
B00006AG5N|5.0|All the favorites are on this cd.  Good for long road trips.  I also play it when I'm cleaning house.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We watched this season and had to watch the second season immediately.  We are now addicted to this show.  We like it even more than 24.  It seems more plausible, even though aspects of it are way out there.  It's exciting to watch!  Tremendous acting and great casting. Can't wait for more!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play all day everyday on my phone and tablet, so addictive. I wish there were more in app games instead of just kung fu scrat. But its fun, something me and my 4 year old both love playing and that's rare for us to both like the same type of apps
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Seem to have no problem on my laptop (WIN 7) with this program.  However, my Old XP unit still works and is often watched while I do other things. In Xp it crashes from time to time, freezes fairly often and once you watch a show, often you have to restart the browser if you want to watch the next episode. Win 7 or higher is recommended and you will have no problems. The sounds is decent, the picture is good and I love seeing them from beginning to end.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Downloaded this so my son's parental protected Nabi 2 could get youtube without me having to unlock the parental controls every 30 seconds. But now he's like addicted to Youtube watching random dinosaur documentaries or clips even commercials for dino toys. I REALLY don't get the fascination but since he can go to youtube and get content instantly its hard for me to get him motivated to do the more learning games on his Nabi, which was my whole intention for buying him his own tablet.

B000FBJF7I|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith has written another fine mystery, as much about honesty and integrity as about the mysteries themselves. His feeling for Botswana,the culture and countryside  makes the reader feel at home and comfortable.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love it great change from the last one all characters are involved so makes the story great. Also see who has what powers and how strong they are. Woo hoo!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie has great music, comedy and fun.  I didn't expect it to me nearly as funny as it was.  Fun movie!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I wanted to see a movie about Lincoln. His life and times depicted honestly and because of Spielberg's involvement, I was expecting more. This movie is about passing the 13th amendment and should be titled as such. I really wanted to see this movie when it came to the theater, but I am so glad I only rented it. Propaganda at it's finest is what this movie is about. Considering the slop that is coming out of Hollywood lately, I shouldn't be surprised, but I was.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|My parents and I were killing ourselves laughing at this movie.  Though my son enjoyed it very much as well - the humor in the movie is just great.  Love Seinfeld and love this movie.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|I recommend this album to any country music lover. I just recently got back into the country music scene and have been very pleased with the purchase of this album. I love every song on it. 30/m/southga
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|If you are a writer and you need to jot down notes and ideas you can easy organize them and keep them in here. You can also email them to your email account. I love this app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It just got better and better as I watched all 3 seasons at once.  Am looking forward to the new season, whenever that may be.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Fits great. Looks great. Only recommendation is a place to snap in your stylus. I usually just put the hook of my stylus pen through the strap but I would rather have a place to snap it in. I don't know what other cases for kindle are like but I'm happy with this one and the price is right. At least it was when I got it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I felt kind of luchy as I watched on the seasons at once, and like everyone else, thought they were fab!
0345803507|2.0|I have read all three books and the premise of the books is absolutely unbelieveable. To the point where it insulted my intelligence. I was given all three books and as I read I kept expecting the storyline to get better. Unfortunately it did not. A girl of just 21 years old runs a company? Grabs a gun and then attempts to rescue someone she's known only 3 months from an insane kidnapper? Meets a millionaire and within 3 months she is married to him and sipping martinis on the French Riviera? A bit too hokey for me. It's one thing for a superhero to rescue a bus load of people from godzilla...but these books implied that this was actually something that could happen. The &#34;star&#34; of this book is just 21 years old and accomplishes more in just 3 months than 99.999% of the rest of us accomplish in a lifetime.<br />I also wanted to point out that as a woman I was offended to see a woman (albeit just 21 years old) who allows a man to control her in every way. And yet she has the maturity to suddenly know how to handle him? She's only 21 years old but yet she knows how to go to a bank alone and withdraw a million dollars (for the kidnappers!) without ever having written a check in her life?
1451695195|5.0|Saw Dr. Alexander on the Katie Couric show. I have copied the front and back of the book and passed the stapled copies out to people at the nursing home where I work and at the senior home where I live who expressed an interest in it. Bought it for a lady here in the senior home who can't afford it but I know will enjoy it.
0345803493|1.0|This book is simply an insult to my intelligence. I do not know of any 21 year old girl who can suddenly run a company (2 months after being hired rght out of college), snag herself a multi-millionaire and marry him within 3 months, chase kidnappers with a gun, and explore her sexuality - at 21? It wouldn't have surprised me if the author had her also cure world hunger within 6 months.<br />The book would have made a whole lot more sense if the star had been in her 40's - had some life experience under her belt - and didn't quite stretch our boundries as readers into trying to make us believe that she is the all-knowing heroine. Don't waste your money on this one (or the other two books!).
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm pretty much a beginner (having given birth 7 months ago) and love this DVD. I feel motivated, and I'm already seeing a difference 1 week in. My one irritation is not being able to skip the intro. Otherwise, love this
1452110581|5.0|This book is wonderful - made me laugh the entire way through, and so TRUE to the way cats are/think!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is a fantastic cd my entire family enjoy it.  We heard the group on television and had to get them.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|The race card is always hard to handle; Michael Connelly does a respectable job of showing different sides of the issue while telling an interesting story. Classic Harry Bosch.
B00BF11STU|2.0|The movie was about a very important time in our history but, I found most of it boring and slow.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is the version that you have to buy but it still lots of fun because you don't noticed how fast the times goes. You can probably spend hours playing this game and by the time you noticed a couple of hours has gone by
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I don't look forward to many movies anymore, but this one lived up to all of the hype. Even though you know how the story ends going into it, the movie is crafted in such a way that it keeps you engaged and keeps you on the edge of your seat up to the last moment.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I like how it looks like a diary of sort with the straps when you close it. I also like the fact that when you close the cover it actually turns off the tablet therefore conserving battery when you not using it. It's very similar to the cover for the IPads but it's a great alternative for this tablet. Highly recommended
B007DIQC90|5.0|I first heard Little Talks on the radio. Then i watched the music video for it and King and Lionheart. Bought both of those songs. Then I listened to samples of the others before i bought the whole CD. I have to say this is one of my new favorite bands. Great lyrics, great music. Most of the songs are soothing in a way so it's great to listen to if you want to just sit down and relax a little.<br /><br />Overall a great CD and a great band. This is one of those few CD's that i like every song. I highly recommend it!<br />Can't wait to hear what they come out with next.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app that will tell you how much battery you have left on your tablet and will show you how long you have for watching videos, reading, use the Wi-Fi among other things which makes it a great app. Would highly recommended
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The best game ever !!! Could not wait to get this app on my phone :)<br />Now they made it for Kindle so I can play on all my devices , does not get better than this.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Wow this game rocks I live to play it<br />Well almost but still omg I thought it was a baby game but it's really fun you've got to get it if you don't there is something wrong with you!
B008FC4WA4|3.0|Interesting story for a late night bit before sleeping. Otherwise, the story seemed truncated and unfinished. If I were an English teacher, and the author my student, I would give this a C.
1452110581|5.0|I found this little book in a friend's bathroom and took waaay too long in just reading it. It truly expresses the thought processes that we see in our little furries. Got a copy for me, and another cat lover friend.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Excellent CD, love every track. Second track featuring Kirk Elling is fantastic. Very well produced.<br />Would recommend this album to any jazz fan or anyone who just loves good music and great musicians. Lee Ritenour seems to get better with age in my opinion.
0670021652|5.0|Ms. Gilberts journey that continued from &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34;  was very helpful and entertaining at the same time.  I have been asking a lot of the same questions she did about marriage.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great combination of hot topics, including domestic abuse, violence, fear, love.  A page-turner for me.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks and/or suspense.
B00746O3X8|5.0|This product turned out to be way better than I was expecting. I ordered this for a cycling trip I'm taking. As a compulsive photo-taker, I needed something that I could wear 5-7 hours a day while cycling that would keep the weight of my very heavy DSLR off my neck and shoulders. After strapping myself in and wearing it for a few hours, it's better than I thought. There is no strain on my neck, and no soreness in my shoulders. The weight is evenly distributed and holds the camera and it's long lens securely in place. Excellent purchase, strong build and great material. Love love love this!
0800141849|5.0|speedy service cost efficent! Would use again definitely! thanx so much for timely service and good merchandise Rhonda P. Brooks
B00127RAJY|3.0|im sorry but i dont like that jillian stops to show how others are doing with there form. i love when the trainers keep on with their background folk. i do like level two for some reason. i guess because i dont like jumping jacks. i dont like the up and down but because im not light so i dont have the spunk yet and the speed. im a step behind them. personal problem right. the video has just enough challenge without being too intimidating.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Loved the twists and turns just when it started to get predictable. Wish the ending was different. I couldn't stop reading.
068484267X|5.0|Anaother great Franl Mc Court book. Well written in his usual style with attention to detail. Try as your fist Mc Copurt book or complete reading all of his books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played many solitare games, frecell, pyramid just to name a couple. The first app I downloaded when I got my kindle was spider solitare. There are apps of this game from different developers, but this one is by far the best. Options include background and deck appearance, difficulty levels. Love it!
B009ZFPQOQ|2.0|When Waze works, it seems great.  May be that my phone (Motorola Defy XT) doesn't have enough resources, but Waze seems to lock up or cause the phone to reboot.  ...maybe the next version!?<br /><br />Each time the phone reboots, waze returns to a novice-level user.  Aaargh.<br /><br />Revised downward.  Never could get this to work correctly on my phone the second time.  ...love the idea, though!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie despite being a devout pixar fan. I LOVED IT. It was so cute and well done!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Ienjoyed the game from start to finish. The story line was very well layer out. What I really liked was all the locations. I thought the game was long enough. The price was really worth it. G5 is always my favorite. Great job all around.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The acting was really good, the movie was well done. The only thing I didn't like was the portrayal of pilots. They aren't really like that, and i felt the movie took a lot of leaps to try to get the plot across. otherwise great acting and very well shot!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The game is fun.have had a few issues with it freezing up and having to restart my kindle because of it, but uninstalling and reinstalling it seems to have fixed that problem for now.
B000001F7R|5.0|This special edition CD has a special place in my heart. It is very hard to come by with the 2 extra tracks and it arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I highly recommend this seller. Thank You very much.
1572816295|5.0|The most beautiful pictorial tarot pack, the card details are fabulous, full of the right information and a joy to use;  I have bought several sets, one for myself, daughter and a friend and then other sets for friends who have admired them, as birthday gifts.  The images are small, complete pictures and are worthy of being displayed on a wall, as a piece of art work.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|I DO see what the great Eric Clapton is talking about, Robert Johnson was a TRUE MUSICIAN. It's too bad he wasn't appreciated in his time but we get to enjoy his talents now, Thank u for this CD. Highly recommended seller!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome I love trying to get to train part or even past. that it is an awesome game:) ;)
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved this game. Lots of scenes, places to search, and help when you need it. Long enough and an extra chapter.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Mitch Albom is a great writer.  It's the type of book that you feel much better after having read it.  I will recommend this book to my friends.
030758836X|2.0|The problem with this book for me was that I hated both the characters.  As the plot developed I could not figure out which of the characters I disliked least!  Kept thinking something would prove some human connection, but was not to be.  I finished it and consider that quite an achievement!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Good Fun. As good as any of the other game I've played on my kindle/ phone. Worth your time...if your playing game on a device.
B005UPOAT2|4.0|I won't go into any of the story points, I'm sure others have already played amateur film critic for you, so I'll just say this was a fun film to watch.  John and Kate had decent chemistry, and you wanted them to end up together.  Yes, the story was hokey, but it's heart was in the right place.  Soundtrack was good, as well.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw this in the theater and just had to have it at home.  The music is outstanding and the Blu-ray disc quality is just like being in the theater.  All of the actors are great including the ones everyone may not be familiar with.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I've seen three films I can think of where the filmmaking had to be nearly perfect in order to keep the audience entertained.  12 Angry Men and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest were the first two, and Argo was the third.  Ben Affleck's masterpiece has every right to go down in history as a film with a controversial subject (US-Iranian relations), set in period (1979-80), that still managed to be funny and edge-of-your-seat intense.  And that doesn't happen by accident.  The Academy honored all of the right individuals, except for Ben.  It won for screenwriting and editing.  Great story, and great pace.  Those guys were at the top of their game.  Anyway, I highly recommend this film.  Yes, there's a little history lesson, but it's one of the most enjoyable history lessons you'll ever have the pleasure of learning!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Great performances by Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. A great look at a great President and his quest for the 13th Amendment.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Wow - I can't believe some of the comments about this album!  Apparently some people don't know how to have any fun.  No, this isn't a brilliant musical gem like \\"Tailgates and Tanlines\\" but this album is great for what it is - party music!  I will definitely be cranking this up while sitting around the campfire enjoying a cocktail with friends and cruising on the pontoon boat this summer.  I am well beyond \\"spring break\\" age, (as is Luke Bryan I might add, since he is the same age as me) but I still like to party and get my drink on.  I just hold my liquor better in my 30's than I did in my 20's.  Loosen up everybody, have a Coke and Crown and enjoy!
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This was an exceptional performance by Daniel Day Lewis. I ve seen him in Lincoln, now this movie and feel even more so that he was robbed of not winning best actor for \\"Gangs of New York. If you like his work you will love this movie, its dark, mysterious, and disturbing at times. The fact that its about a real life person and how the oil business was started made it even more interesting.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It's hard to believe it can be so engaging. I was caught up in the story finding it hard to put down. It makes you more aware of those you love and how tough it is to see through the troubles life throws at you.<br />The author has a great knack at making you feel at one with the characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'd been wanting to read this book for a while now and I knew that it was a movie, and I like to read the book before I see the movie. So I finally read it and just WOW! It was truly wonderful. I won't share details because I don't want to ruin any part of it for anyone, but please read this book if you haven't already. I loved it and I'm sure you will too :)
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|...and my fiancée hate them! lol! I thought the premise of this was intriguing although I had to think about it for about a week after the end credits had rolled. On a technical note, I'm a little old-school (almost 48 and a half years old) so I was skeptical about the whole &#34;streaming content via wifi&#34; thing, but this movie played flawlessly thru my blu ray player. And the movie was fun, in a grim, dystopian society kinda way. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis were just fine. If you like this sort of thing, rent it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love beyond loved this book! I'd never read a Nicholas Sparks book before but I am familiar with his movie adaptations. I saw the movie but the book was way better than the movie (as it is in most cases.) I loved everything about this book and I totally recommend it :)
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I had to see this alone, 3D, in the theater. And I'm glad I bit the bullet and did. Because it's absolutely gorgeous. To me, it's the best use of visual effects to tell a story since the first &#34;Star Wars&#34; movie. But, I realized, I didn't totally get it. I watched it a second time after I bought the disc from Amazon, with my fiancée, who hadn't seen it, and she, er, explained some stuff to me. And I like it even more now.<br /><br />I didn't thing Ang Lee should've gotten the Oscar® for Best Director...but now I do. It's a superb film and I highly recommend it for those appreciate craftsmanship, non-linear storytelling and breathtaking visuals. Two subtle thumbs WAY up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was on my must read list and so I HAD to read it! I must say the twists and turns of this book was unreal! I'd never read a book like this before. I was a bit disappointed by the ending but the book as a whole was very good.
B0094K1YHK|4.0|I call this a &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; because I don't actually think it's a great movie. But I love the way it looks. And this blu ray transfer doesn't disappoint. The film was shot very diffused, so nothing is super-clear, whether DVD or blu ray. But the movie's innovative visual style – and visual effects – are so intriguing that I still thought it was worth owning on blu ray.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it was a little weak on plot and, truth be told, Gwyneth Paltrow's character was awfully annoying. But it was so cool looking that, again, weak plot and characters just didn't seem to matter. If you have any affection whatsoever for this film, buy this blu ray disc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is cool :-) I like it because you don't even need a real horse, all you need is this:-)  it has EVERYTHING:-)
B007NR9WBG|5.0|This was special effects guru Douglas Trumbull's (2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek: The Motion Picture) directorial debut and Natalie Wood's last film, and it was mostly dismissed by critics and the public alike. I'm not sure why because it features a top-notch cast: Christoper Walken, Louise Fletcher and Cliff Robertson. The visuals, for 1983, were pretty imaginative, and the premise was compelling. What if you could record people's experiences? Not dreams, but their actual feelings as well as their thoughts. Pretty cool.<br /><br />i've never owned this movie in any format, but I watched it again (for the umpteenth time) in HD on cable and loved it all over again. So I bought the blu ray disc thru Amazon. I haven't watched it yet, but barring any obvious defects (glitches, deleted content, faulty disc), I don't anticipate my opinion of the movie changing one iota. If you liked this film and haven't previously owned it, I recommend this blu ray, simply because it's the best version we're likely to get for a while.
0735619670|3.0|I can see why people love this book. It has good dev advice and would be a great help to developers who may not have formal training. But to someone like me who went through a four-year college program in computer science, there's not a lot of new material here.<br /><br />Edit (7/25/2014) - after reading the comments on my review, I feel the need to clarify my last sentence. If you have been properly taught the theories of software development, the pieces of a computer language, how things fit together, etc. and also have some experience working in an enterprise environment, you will learn almost nothing from this book. On the other hand, if you picked up C# by reading some pages on the Web and have done some hobby projects, this book will be invaluable.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Completely useless!  In principle this is a great product but in my case it did not even work at all.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I think one would more or less have to classify this as a noir, but it's more than that.  There's suspense and mystery here, too.  This is a classic film and some, this writer included, rate is as Gloria Swanson's best film ever. Portraying has-been film star Norma Desmond, Swanson was 51 years old when she made this film.  Her counterpart here, William Holden as unsuccessful screen writer Joe Gillis, was a mere lad of 32.  The film opens with Holden, seen from below, lying dead in a swimming pool, narrating the story.  Unique? You bet! And the film doesn't let up from that dramatic intro either.  I won't ruin the rest for you, it's just too much fun. Swanson is creepy, Holden a wisecracking smart ass, and Eric Von Stroheim as Swanson's bizarre chauffeur, Max, just plain weird.  I've seen this movie maybe 10 times and 10 times simply isn't enough.  Definitely a keep for your DVD stash.
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed hiked the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mojave Desert to the Bridge of the Gods in Cascade Locks, Oregon. She hiked over 1,100 miles alone carrying a pack called Monster.  While hiking she examined her life without her mother, who died at 50, her ex husband, her affairs, her use of drugs, and her place in the world.<br /><br />The hike is excruciating.<br /><br />\\"Miles weren't things that blazed dully past. There were long, intimate straggles of weeds and clumps of dirt, blades of grass and flowers that bent in the wind, trees that lumbered and screeched. They were the sound of my breath and my feet hitting the trail one step at a time and the click of my ski pole. The PCT had taught me what a mile was. I was humble before each and every one.\\"<br /><br />As I read her story, I was with her every step and didn't want the story to end at Cascade Locks even though my feet were grateful. The hike was more a pilgrimage and I yearn for my own hike on the Camino de Santiago in Spain, a hike of over 500 miles. The book is filled with some good advice about what to carry. More than that, it's a book about how to face your own fears, about never quitting and about forgiveness.<br /><br />Five stars for Portland resident Cheryl Strayed's \\"Wild.\\"
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Our 2, 4, and 6 year old girls are all wild for the My Little Pony franchise. We have the game installed on three of our Android devices. It's a wonderful time sink.<br /><br />First a few words of warning: Do not spend money you are not prepared to lose on this game. You will lose your progress from time to time and have to start again from the beginning.<br />GameLoft does a terrible job play-testing all of their games. They will crash and you will have to start over. The Customer Service is by email only, and they will send you in-game cash to compensate for your loss. When this happens, the process of getting your compensation is buggy. Stick with it and make them fulfill the compensation. I had to have the customer service tech send me compensation cash three different times before it stuck. However, you're pretty much on your own having to go through all the quests again to regain your XP.<br /><br />I actually see this life experience as a net positive for my children. We no longer put any cash into the game and use it as a tool to teach our older girls about patience, perseverance to reach a goal, and following the rules. It also teaches them in a non-permanent way that life is not perfect. Sometimes, projects will blow up but you can always make a new start.<br /><br />The Version Issue<br />This is the main reason for my review here on Amazon.<br />The Amazon App store version is 1.0.5. The version on Google Play is 1.0.7. We have the game installed on three different android devices. We had to use the Amazon AppStore to install the game on our NABI tablet due to Google Play not being compatible with the NABI 2. Since the Google Play version has a major new expansion (the Canterlot Wedding), and the Amazon version does not, Playing MLP on the NABI is not nearly as popular as on the other two Android devices.<br /><br />I hope Gameloft is not abandoning the Amazon AppStore version.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|If you want a mixture between a butcher knife and a machete then this is for you. If your looking for a camp/bushcraft knife keep looking. Wonderful craftsmanship but it's super wide and very very thick blade. I Honestly can't think of a decent use for this knife aside of using it for a hatchet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good. It was packed with emotion and twist and turns you don't see coming loved it and can't wait to read the second book.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I enjoyed the CD very much...song selection and performance great!<br />I have other Bocelli  CD 's and this one is as pure pleasure listening as the others.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I confess I didn't see this in the theatre since musicals aren't my favorite.  They still aren't, since when more than one person is singing I had a hard timr understanding them,.  However, this movie is heart -wrenchingly beautiful.  I knew Anne Hathaway & Hugh Jackman could sing, but whp knew Russell Crowe would be so good at it?!<br /><br />I'll need to watch it again!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent game! Really enjoyed this one. Played it twice. Would love to see a sequel. Visuals and puzzles were great. Worth the purchase.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|The series is wonderful!  The cast is superb, and the setting spectacular!  It's fascinating to have a glimpse of what life was like in the early 1900's, liking in a lovely castle with servants, etc.<br /><br />A bit &#34;soap opera&#34;y, but I guess that helps make it fun.
038541627X|5.0|I am not a literary critic, I just like to read.<br />I loved this book. It was the last item I could find by Asimov, and I enjoyed it as much as the first.<br />but like I said, I'm not a critic. If you like Asimov, you'll like this book; and if you don't, you wont.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This movie earned every award it got!<br /><br />The movie was realisticly done, and very believable.<br /><br />Since the movie is based on real-life events I knew how it all turned out.  Even knowing how it turned out, the movie was amazingly suspensful right up to the end.<br /><br />Argo is an excellent movie.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|not quite as good as hunger games although the existence of the supposedly destroyed district thirteen and its method of survival was interesting .  good surprise ending
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hotel Transylvania is a movie for the whole family.  It has two main themes:  one of letting your little &#34;girl&#34; grow up, and one of scceptance of &#34;monsters&#34; & humans alike.<br /><br />It is beautifully done, with quite a bit of fairly clean humor.  At only 91 minutes it's easy to watch and enjoy.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|good tight plot,following on from hunger games. well writen, imaginative use of competors supposed special skills to defeat their rivals
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|i thought i would pay for this app because i had the free app and it was ok.  i thought i would get something more for instance more/different words, time drawers have been waiitng, other feaures that could be added; instead i feel cheated out of money.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|bought this book on impluse, afer vague comments from grand children, well written with believeable situations and outcomes must buy the next book
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a great app to have, a dictionary handy. the dictionary will pronunce the word, if desired.  I would definate recommend this.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This was the first book I read on my new Kindle.  I really appreciated not having to lug the 1000+ page copy around with me!
B00139XTG4|3.0|Yes, not everything can be explained by the bell curve, but it doesn't take a whole book to make that point.
B000H8SFMK|2.0|Fairytale of New York was nothing close to what I expected, considering it's been the #1 Christmas song in Ireland for the last 25 years. The rest of the cd was ok for Irish Rock. I don't think I'd ever pay to see the Pogues..
0684857820|5.0|If you want to read an unusual story by an excellent writer, read this. Also read everything else by Sebold if you appreciate fine storytelling, unique stories, and well-written prose. If you like formulaic novels with shopworn plots written in wooden prose look elsewhere.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game it is fun but everytime I click on it it loads and then it goes back to my home screen and I click j. it again o does the same thing but overall it os a fun game but please fix the problem thank u
0345803493|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. This book along with the other two books in this series are definitely worth purchasing. Beware once you start reading this series you will not be able to put the book down.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|A bit wordy at times, found myself skipping many paragraphs. But the overall story is good. Just when I thought it was getting WAY too repetitive & circular, it takes a crazy turn that I never would have predicted.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think this app is useful because I go to school in the morning and I'm some times late and I'm the cutest boy ever in the world
B0054DFIGY|5.0|Great pressing, my LP is dead quiet and is a pleasure to listen to. I like pretty much everything that Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder has put out.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is the perfect gift for the Downton Abbey fan.  It includes the Christmas special besides season 1 and 2.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered one for my sister also.  It was delivered in a very timely manner.
B001B6PBBK|1.0|The acting in this movie is painful--and you're left feeling that they were so disappointed with Britney's inability to maintain a British accent that they had be open the movie with excuses for it!  The situations are painful and amazingly unrealistic, even though the dialogue in the movie has the characters talking about how the script for the movie (it's not even worth explaining out here since the movie is a sad excuse to put actors on a screen) should be more plausible.  Um, yeah...right.  Then they later say they had to wrap it up and give it a happy ending--unlike real life.  And yet they wrap up this movie and make the ending happy.  Confused?  It's not that they were trying to be clever, it's that this movie is THAT BAD that they had to come up with excuses for everything they attempt and failed to do with this movie.<br /><br />Not funny, well, I think there was ONE moment where I chuckled.  Not well acted.  It was mostly about naked moments that really didn't have anything to do with the plot.<br /><br />For me, this movie tanked.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book, very entertaining like all other Grisham legal thrillers. Grishams stories read like watching a suspenseful movie. Compared to many of his other books, the Racketeer is average. I didn't find the writing to be as good as others, such as the Bretheren or The firm, but the characters were interesting and the suspense kept me hooked.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This is very nice to have for the library even if you saw it in the theaters or on TV.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Loved it until I opened it today and can only get up to 56 pieces.  That is disappointing and takes away all the challenge.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Frames freeze from beginning, never got past first scene.  Video quality sucks!  This is the second movie we've had problems with.
B0028AQLYE|3.0|This is great for flip turns but it is really hard to get used to the air restriction.  I took it off after trying it for a day.  Will give it a try again but not sure I'm going to love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am very satisfied with the downloads I have chosen.  The games were chosen by my granddaughter and she loves to play them.  My husband is an avid Clive Cussler reader and he is thoroughly enjoying his book.  The Kindle guidebook had great information in it for novice kindle owners.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am enjoying following the next generation of characters from The Fall of Giants.  I am learning so much about world events and history, but in a very interesting and compelling way.  Very well written book.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case is awesome. Not onlly does it protect your blutooth, but you can charge it while it's inside and it holds the charge so all you have to do is place it in there when your blutooth battery is running low. Wish they had one like this back when I had my Voyager Pro.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is a wonderful way to learn or re-learn world history.  The characters are well formed and interesting.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great War story of compassion that is displayed by two opposing sides. Touching how many years later the two old enemies become life long friends. A most read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is sol much fun I always get really far. It is a fad game!!!! That's my report see ya.....
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This movie was full of fun, action and suspense! It is a good family movie to watch. I liked it.
B00BF123WG|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, it was worth seeing, I would not recommend it for young children though. Good, Good, Good
B00C4QWDYY|3.0|Seriously ?  A 44 min season finale episode. through out the season with the 44-45 min episodes it seems like 20 min because it goes by so fast. And yet they build it all up to the season finale and ... another 44 min episode. Could have gone out with a big bang like other shows like an hour and half or so finale. Just felt like watching another short episode on Sunday night.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|The game is really fun but it's hard if you don't no how to craft like on pc I would get it if you don't have minecraft
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was full of detail and kept me on the edge of my seat I strongly recommend this novel.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Part of the Alien Franchise, I've Been a long time follower of the Alien Series Since 1979, I was nine at the time. I always been wondering the origins of Alien, Well, What do you know, I enjoyed this movie & Knowing That Director Ridley Scott Who Filmed The very first Alien Directed Prometheus, You Know it will stay true to the Saga. Can't Wait For Prometheus 2 to add on in my DVD Collection.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Easy reading and entertainment for a few days.  I enjoyed escaping the everyday world and slipping into the story of this book.
0393345084|5.0|When I first studied economics in college in 1963, Paul Samuelson's textbook showed that John Maynard Keynes correctly explained the Great Depression as an example of inadequate demand and that it was finally cured by the massive government spending needed to prepare for WWII.  Thus I was surprised to learn from Krugman (page 93) that half of American economists have now &#34;unlearned&#34; this lesson by following William Buckley.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|An insiders look into the oval office. I enjoyed the book and walked away with a little more knowledge - enjoy
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is great. Nothing else. I was able to download movies to take on my trip without any hassle or complication.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|Good, but not great. Overall, kind of disappointing considering it won the Academy Award.  I expected better, and am a bit let down.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|A very moving abnd poignant story. something we can all learn from. I have seen it twice. Possibley one more time. I also sent it to a friend.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Although a very long book, it was a wonderful read. Covers the misery involved in life. I enjoyed it very much.
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down. The twists and turns throughout the book just keep you guessing. It really makes you wonder how people can be this twisted.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game my 10 yr old son loves it.  He has not stopped playing it since we bought it.  Money well spent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game. better than I expected. I'm not even really a fan of horses but its a realistic game and kind of makes me wish I had a real one.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|The eighth season has returned to focus on the relationship of Dean and Sam just as Jeremy Carver promised it would. The story arc of the tablets is the filler episodes and it is playing out over three years. Our brothers have struggled, but finally found one another again. That's the whole point of the season. It's well worth my time and money to watch this show/dvd's and judging by the ratings and the early renewal for a ninth season, I know I'm not alone. It's not every \\"little\\" show that can knock NBC out of the top slot...and Supernatural has.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun that I can not put it down when I. have to eat dinner I can not put it down even wheni have to play sports I do not went to put it down
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever purchased. There are a number of wonderful songs on it (the first 5 are all excellent) but there is one song on it that instantly made it to my \\"best 10 of all time\\" list: \\"Train Wreck\\".<br /><br />Listen to the words as well as the music, and tell me you don't wish that she was singing about you...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!!  Loved watching it on my ipad.  I could pause it and watch it when I wanted.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|First off, don't read the reviews that have one star. This is a great show. It will make a lot more sense if you start with the first season, [[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season]], and follow along with the second [[ASIN:B005LAJ23A The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray]]] and third seasons [[ASIN:B009NH6JRE The Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season [Blu-ray]]]. I wasn't completely sure about it the first time I watched, but it became addicting. Will be interesting to see what happens with the prison, Carl, and the Governor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome but it needs buckets and red stone things that would be awesome because who doesn't like red stone
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|when is the kindle getting the update for the new map and the engineer? I'm ready for it any day now please
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Great brand new in the box. Finally watch the first season of a series everyone is talking about but since I did not have HBO I was out of the loop. It was great & recommend but definitely not for kids. Some scenes were to sexy or gruesome & really is not for any child or young teen.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Like creamy semi-sweet chocolate, immersing yourself into the sounds of regional Americas.<br />How better to re-introduce yourself to the sounds that doesn't assault you with simplistic melody and notes lifted from here and there.<br />Worth the purchase, one of those that goes in for the road less travelled..
B005WMG51O|5.0|mesmerizing for the baby and me!!<br />it is a well made, well thought out mobile. I would recommend it highly
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|When a writer starts off by redefining a word (extractive) which already has a well-known meaning in the same context, I get suspicious.  Extractive economies are ones based on exploitation of natural resources (e.g. oil or diamonds).  He uses the term to refer to noncompetitive, non-free market economies.  He then discards in a few sentences the theories of Max Weber (the rise of Protestantism and Capitalism) and Jared Diamond (economic well-being and the environment).  He &#34;cherry-picks&#34; events, eras and locales, while ignoring those which might challenge his argument.  He ultimates admits that his theories have no predictive value - in which case they are not theories, although that is what he calls them.
0062082353|5.0|Excellent book, very well written. I really couldn't put it down. I would definitely read this one before &#34;Lone Survivor&#34;....just based on the way the information is presented.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This show is one of the best series on tv, it has it all, humor, suspense, horror, and more. It is well written, well acted, well produced and more. I highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for a great show to watch..
B0041KKYEM|5.0|***Warning: Contains Spoilers!<br /><br />I finally watched this on TV last night and I was impressed! I've never thought of Natalie Portman as a great actress and almost never watch movies featuring her, but this movie changed my mind.<br /><br />Let my say that I'm a guy who goes to exactly one ballet a year: The Nutcracker. But really, this movie isn't so much about ballet, it's more about aging in an occupation/sport that demands youth, beauty, and extreme thinness, and throws out those who have grown \\"old,\\" much like other professional sports. I can relate to this as a bicycle racer and runner, but fortunately, in the amateur ranks, we can race by age category into our 60's and even 70's.<br /><br />The way the character Nina devolves into madness and paranoia was masterful and disturbing at the same time. The part where she peels a large piece of skin off her finger made me cringe. Also the part where the character Beth stabs herself in the face while screaming \\"I'm not perfect!\\"<br /><br />Finally, watching scenes in the movie only to realize they only happened in Nina's mind worked well. Nina imagining she had stabbed her younger competition and her seeing her body turn black and feathered was brilliant.<br /><br />I will try to go see the Swan Lake ballet now after seeing this movie!<br /><br />5 Stars-Highly recommended!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time. Possibly ever? I read a lot of books. All types of books. None of them as good as this.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love this app!! It plays great music from all over and you choose the genre and radio station that you want to hear. It is far better than Pandora and Slacker and plays more variety than Songza! Thanks Amazon!!
0739365681|5.0|This book was one of the best.  Reacher was at his finest as were his team mates.  I first purchased the book and read it then purchased the audio book, gotta say, Dick Hill does a great job on these audio books.  This is a recommended one for sure.  Do not miss reading it.
0446563048|5.0|I read it twice and just purchased it to give to a friend.<br />Great example of developing company culture and a great customer experience.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|This movie was definitely worth the time on the couch. The back and forth from the past to present was a bit annoying at first but made the whole movie pull together in the end. Not what I was expecting which turned out to be a &#34;Good Thing&#34;.
B0064MGU98|4.0|love the show and glad amazon put it on so I could play catch-up. would recommend this to everyone. good job amazon!
0738727326|5.0|I think I've found my favorite deck of Tarot cards.  The artistry is second to none and the deck feel good in my hands.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Loved Evernote at the start, love it even more now. One notebook is my Inbox and when I see an email I'm going to act on I forward it there so it competes fairly  with everything else I want to do. When I search Google with Chrome, my Evernotes appear too. Every whiteboard photo is OCR'd and shows up in Google and Evernote searches. Sometimes I take notes in Evernote, sometimes on paper, they're all found in both searches. On a convention floor I just talk to Evernote and snap pictures of stuff, cards and people. So Evernote is now my personal Google. Everyone thinks I'm smarter because in meetings I find actual references instantly, I guess thanks to Evernote I actually am. How cool is that?
B002FQOI0A|4.0|This is a good easy book. And would recommend to people who like quick read. Over all it was a good book.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very enjoyable read. Good character development. Great moral to the story. Makes you think about the world we live in and how similar/dissimilar we are from Panem.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you are a fan on crime story and epic romances this is a book for you.  Enjoyable and easy to read, it provides a pleasant way to pass the time on a rainy afternoon.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could hardly put this book down.  Such a creative idea and carried out with much suspense and excitement.  Never thought I would so enjoy a  Stephen King book.  Great for suspense lovers as well as history buffs.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Spell binding, full of twists and turns, excellent characters all of what I expect from Tom Clancy.. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes a well written mystery.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Love this music era and am very impressed with the soundtrack:  very talented singers and fun to dance/rock out to.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Touching and heartfelt, a tribute to those in the story.  I recommend this author's books to anyone questioning death and/or spirituality.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use Calculator Plus for basic algebraic computations--- it works great for me! No glitches or operationg issues. just a smooth and easy use.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is a great CD from FUN. It includes all the latest hits from the band. If you loved 'Aim and Ignite', you will love 'Some Nights'
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Story line was okay.  Puzzles not bad. Lots of hidden objects but sometimes the objects were so tiny you can't see them and have to use a hint.  Hint recharges slowly.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This is great news for Bowie fans, young and old: An hour of great new songs, inspired by his brush with death, and his reflections on the twilight of life.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I have been playing this game for a while hoping it gets better, but stuff is getting worse! The price of the food, habitats and decoration are ridiculous. There is no way to buy everything needed with the little income you get from the dragons. Trying to expand your farm is horrible! You pay a huge amount of money to wait 12 hours for a piece of land that you can't even use because it's covered in trees and rocks that are too expensive to remove. Trying to move habitats and decorations around is a headache. Sometimes they won't move other times you manage to get it to move and it goes way off screen. This leads to trying to find your way back to where you were at or restarting because the game has frozen and all you can get is a blue screen.  The pop up messages drive me crazy, I don't need to see that girl standing there trying to get me to spend 500 gold pieces over and over when I am just trying to play the game. I would not recommend this game to anyone! Especially on the Kindle Fire!!!!!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I liked it a lot, and I mean, I REALLY liked it. Although Neil Gaiman's prose is not what you could call rich or even elegant, the way he structures the story is very compelling, its a perspective of America, a reflection on the power of ideas and the resilience of belief, and a story of self-discovery. The kind of book that draws your attention, keeps it and rewards it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great time killer. Absolutely the best city builting gamebi have played on the kindle yet. keep up the good work.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Great CD. What was a real surprise was that once I ordered the CD the songs were available to listen to, on the cloud, with my Amazon Prime account. That was a real plus!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Pretty good not a lot of points given but a really really really good game to play anywhere. Overall good
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Great CD.  What was a real surprise was that once I ordered the CD the songs were available to listen to, on the cloud, with my Amazon Prime account.  That was a real plus!
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|The film doesn't quite go anywhere or have a traditional story arc, but the performances are mesmerizing and the cinematography is stunning. The narrative is not so much about a master or cult figure as it is about two men in a psychological dance. It is not as satisfying as \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" but there is a lot at work to hold one's attention with some grip.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this movie.  But once I started watching it, I found it absolutely amazing. The acting is top notch and the story is excellent.  This movie is worth every cent you pay for it.  Very well done.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I do not have HBO-so I have to wailt till it comes out on dvd and it was well worth the-I can't wait till the next season!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus is amazing. Enjoyed it even more on a 2nd viewing. Excellent production docs too. Well put together package. See this if you love sci-fi, not if you think this is alien vs predator 3
B007N6NGYG|5.0|At first it's kinda easy, then it gets difficult...it's a lot of fun though and very addicting. Gotta gooooooo...  all aboard!
B007F8BPOU|2.0|The vanilla cupcake recipe was wonderful, they came out moist and light, but the buttercream icing was TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. Definitely an icing NOT to make because your cupcakes will look sad and unpresentable. Like the other reviewer, the icing pretty much tasted like watered down confectioner's sugar. After 6-8 cups it was still soft and wouldn't stay on the cupcakes!!! Martha Stewart's icing recipes were much better.<br /><br />Recipes kept repeating themselves, not enough pictures and you had to keep flipping pages, book was not well made, you might be better off googling copycat recipes off the internet. Or get Martha Stewart's Cupcakes book (lots of pictures+more variety than you can even turn into cake recipes).
B007ZXK08C|5.0|One of the best murder mystery plots ever! I loved the way Gillian Flynn writes - she get's your interest entirely
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. I could not put it down. I would highly recommended it. Cannot wait for book two.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game based on the movies. Hate the part where you have to use actual money for bucks. Warning; it can cause your kindle or device to act slow and be non-responsive as the parks increase in size.
1451695195|4.0|If you are questioning what happens after death, read Dr. Alexander's book. The fact that he is alive is an amazing story in its self. Parts of the book are technical and told to get the attention of scientists, but that is not the majority of the book. I read the book in preparation for his visit to my town and I am glad that I did. I find his story comforting and quite similar to other accounts of near death experiences. The book and his appearance leave lots of questions, but he is still writing and has a website. We will always have questions, but that is part of our journey on this earth. Proof of Heaven serves as a prompt/guidepost for my journey.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Not amazing, but I enjoyed playing. Worth trying it out since it is free, except for<br />extra upgrades and characters.
B0091REZMW|4.0|if you are a patient person you don't have to spend anything. but different objects to find would be nice.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|First time I purchased a video series and it worked great.  It is a great way to pickup on a Series you missed part of and the streaming worked perfectly.  I will be doing it again.
0062014536|2.0|I don't want to give this book two stars because I LOVED the first two books. I mean, they are favorites of mine. I thought they were absolutely wonderful, from the story to the characters - everything. Requiem started out much the same way. The love triangle was juicy and the revolution really seemed to be picking up steam. I really enjoyed seeing Hana's point of view as a cured person. Then, all of the sudden it was over. It may be harsh but I feel like it was a bit of a cop out to have a whole story about having the ability to love and then not resolving the love triangle. MAYBE I could understand if at least ONE part of the story had a resolution, but none did and it was completely unsatisfying for a series that I absolutely grew to love. In summary and maybe not the most eloquent words - The ending kind of sucked.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my child is really enjoying this game!  thanks for fun graphics, interesting obstacles, and free price helps too!  enjoyable from start to finish.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Great movie! I can't wait for the sequel! I've watched this more than a dozen times already. Great movie for the kid in all of us. I wish i woulda saw it in 3d in the theaters.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show, wonderful acting, and directing.  I enjoy edwardian period shows. I have to write nine more words to get my review through, this should do the job.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Can't wait for next season.  I liked the first season the best.  I didn't quite care for the alien theory in the second season.  It's too far out for me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was one of the best book I have  read in a long time I can't wait to read the next one<br />I highly recommend it.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Very intriguing and a good read. But the ending was abrupt. Perhaps a good beach read. 3 stars for me.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is graphic and violent, but I love it. You are a shark, and you swim through the ocean eating everything in your path, while avoiding things that can hurt you and trying to complete missions and find sunken treasures. Things that get eaten release clouds of blood. These include all types of fish, sea turtles, pelicans, other sharks, and people.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this Mumford and sons cd, all of the tracks on this cd are great, no skipping songs. Wonderful to listen to for long drives.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game reminds me of the 1990's video games like Sonic the Hedgehog where you explore and collect coins by jumping around and over things. So darn fun and remeniscent of those games. Cute graphis and fun challenges.
B000021Y7X|5.0|It was all that I expected and more....awesome...have been enjoying it since I received it...very entertaining...and will play it often...
B0086700CM|3.0|A great escape game, running from angry gorillas. Jump over roots and gaps and slide under vines and collect coins.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game isn't bad, but every time I get back on the game it, time hasn't changed so that kinda sucks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and enjoyed it, but the book was impossible to put down!!! So much more detail than the movie, and I feel the characters were more developed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful game. Any one who likes horses will love this game. Get this game. Get the game.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Nothing like any other cop show that I've ever seen.  &#34;Gritty&#34; can't even begin to describe how raw this show is.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is the first time a in long time that a series has kept my interest for so long. I cant wait for the next season!
0385342039|1.0|Having read and enjoyed \\"Remember Me?\\" I thought I would try another Kinsella book.  What a mistake!  Normally, if I am not enjoying a book I will try to finish, maybe learning something in the process.  Couldn't make it past Page 50.  Main character is so pathetic as to be unbelievable.  The rest of the characters are not even plausible, but the ghost did me in.  Sorry - but this is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.
0593070631|5.0|This book really makes you feel like the boys are actually talking to you and telling you their story. It literally brought me to tears and made me laugh throughout the entire book. They did such a great job with this book, I'm so proud! (:
B005D6O124|5.0|The same &#34;walking on a cloud&#34; comfort that Croc's sandals give. These are fantastically comfortable and light shoes. Easy to clean and wash. Great value!
B0072NWKEC|5.0|The writing is superb. Sentence structure is perfect and the thoughts and dialogue are remarkable. In a class with Conrad,silva,furst. Reminds me, in its eloquence, of Joseph Conrad.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|So much fun...using it on my kindle...easy to install ...very colorful game<br />I would recommend it for a great time!
B005DJREJS|1.0|No wonder the morals of our youth are on the decline when this mindless, crude humor is presented as the norm for our youth. What a waste of talent!
B000FSME1A|5.0|Purchased this as a gift.  The recepient was thrilled with the DVD and the complete package.  Excellent service arrived ahead of schedule.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I rèad all her books and they are very interesting. I have read all,of the kay Scarlett's books, and look for them
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So beautifully written.<br />So amazing in detail.<br />Perfect to read just having had the privilege of seeing Dr. Eben Alexander speak at Christ Church in Charlotte
B0043X88EK|5.0|After the Stooges eponymous debut, rock and roll would never be the same. And thank Iggy for that!  He and the Stooges injected a level of necessary peril that invigorates Rock and Roll to this day.
1475143389|4.0|i havent finish it but its quite a good reading, very interesting. I recomend it because everything that the autor wrote is true
B0012FB58I|5.0|With songs like Loose, TV Eye, and Dirt, the stooges proved they would not be one-hit wonders; rather, they upped the stakes, varied the song-writing, and ensured Rock and Roll would ALWAYS be something parents could wring their hands about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow I Love this game!!!  People,even know the game is expensive,<br />It is so worth it!! Once you get the game, you will think, Why didn't I get this game sooner!!!!!!  That's why the game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Love it,  I have followed Kelly Clarkson since American Idle.  Her music and voice are  great.  Great CD,.  Thank you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game!!!!! This game holds me over until i can buy a real horse. This game has a really great picture. Love it!!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|love this game.  Pac man is the best.<br />worth the download<br />totally additice and works perfectly.<br />Promist you won't regret it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was action packed and I couldn't stop reading. It was thrilling and I could picture every single thing .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great graphics and fun to play. fun for kids and adults.  seems easy to play but I'm still trying to figure some of it out. I recomend the game
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Thought it was very childish and I would not read the remaining books in the series.  Not impressed at all.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game scratches every itch I have for a space RPG. There's trading, missions, achievements, and many different ways to succeed. I've spent lots of hours chasing down pirates, exploring distant planets, and rising up in the ranks of various factions. I couldn't ask for more.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|A lot of co-workrs have been raving about this for a while now. Checked out S1E1 this week and now I can't get enough.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I mean like Lord of the Rings is better.<br />But this book is good to. I also need 5 more words.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hated this book because it gives you little words then the real words and does not tell a real meaning. It doesn't even Give one meaning in that book.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Maybe I was expecting too much from the fabulous JK Rowling. I struggled with the first half of the book trying to keep track of whos who & forcing myself to keep reading. The last half was better, but it read like a new version of &#34;Peyton Place&#34;.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This movie is everything I thought it was going to be and more, Clint Eastwood is amazing! Great cast overall!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has added another exception tale to his credit. A woman's story of abuse and what she has to do to escape the pain and humiliation. Add a wonderful man with a family, a small town setting, plenty of suspense and action and you won't be able to put it down.
1451696191|3.0|This was my book club selection for March and I could barely get through it.  Perhaps I didn't know what I was getting into, but the main character was impossible to relate to and I found the whole thing to be a real downer.  I may not be the target audience (I would think a teenager might enjoy it more than me, a 30 year old married woman).
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is awesome I meean its like so epic<br />its one of the best games I have ever.<br />played who ever is reading this download the game because it is a really fun cool and awsome
B002GYI9C4|4.0|It starts slowly - I spent the first third questioning the intellect and taste of the person who'd recommended it - and then suddenly, I couldn't put it down.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when we saw it in the theaters, I enjoyed it so much that I bought it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fast shipping!  Exactly as was described in description.. I would recomend for future purchases for other movies and like products.
1476733953|5.0|Wow...wow...wow...by far this is the best book I have read in a very long time.  I cannot wait to start on Shift next.  This is such a unique story and I was absolutely hooked from the first word.  I will be suggesting this book to every single person I know, what an amazing read.  Thank you Hugh!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is great! Ive had a couple problems with it freezing but the game is really fun! It teaches science while having a lot of fun! I'm 13 and I love it!!!!!!!!!
0547569653|5.0|I'm only half done with the book, but so far, I am loving Scott Jurek's amazing story.  I'm completely mesmerized and at awe at any ultra-marathoner's determination and steel resolve.  I've only completed a half marathon once in my life, and these guys do that on a daily basis almost, they are other-worldly creatures!  It's mind-blowing, but for an occasional runner like myself, or even a more seasoned runner, anyone can glean inspiration out of this amazing book.  Scott is such a likable person and though he is a legend, he doesn't come off as someone who has allowed success and renown get to his head.  This book has made me appreciate the fact that I ever got into running in the first place and maybe just maybe I'll enter a marathon in the future!  The vegan recipes are a nice touch as well.. memoir + cookbook in one?  What more could you ask for!
B0011Z3DK2|4.0|Awesome recording by one of the greatest bands of all time. Sound quality is impressive. Guitar riffs, percussion, bass, and, the voice.
B00742GBDM|3.0|I didn't particularly like the tho households, one portraying the filth that Fanny lived in the the other the plain estate of her cousins. I would be careful with young children watching this film as it contains as least 2 parts that are extremely sexually explicit.
030759565X|5.0|I follow Deb's blog, and I was so excited when she came out with a cookbook! Delicious recipes, beautiful pictures and book. Keep them coming, Deb! :)
B002APU580|3.0|Story lines moves to quickly. I keep comparing it to the bbc version and was very dissapointed. I'd rather watch the 6 hrs. version where you see the character develop. Besides, the Bennet household is portrayed as a pretty poor family which is not faithful to Jane Austen's novel.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a book I have looked forward to reading ever since I first heard about it.  I liked the book with one exception...you could tell it was written by a Doctor/Scholar.  There are times when simple laymens terms would have sufficed but he used his medical jargon to describe a situation.  That being said...I find his life changing experience fascinating...and am so proud he took the time to write about it. I  am a believer in Jesus Christ and heaven.  He did nothing but make my convictions stronger.  It's GREAT to FINALLY hear from a Doctor...regarding life after death.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I really enjoyed it, I am a big fan of Michael Jackson and I recommend it to any of him
B004QX07G4|5.0|The thing about reading this book is that I read it actually hearing Ellen's voice in my head!  I could envision her saying the things in this book...and understood where she was coming from as she said them.  I literally laughed out loud numerous times while reading this highly entertaining book.  I have read all of Ellen's books...and once again, she doesn't disappoint.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Special affects were good and there was a new twist to the story. I didn't think the acting by Kristen Stewart was as good as it should have been.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I rate Michael Connelly's books at a full 5 because to me they are that good.  They keep you in suspence.  It takes a while to reach a point where you understand why the book is named as it was. I liked them so well that I either bought or went through the library to get all of his books one right after the other after I read the first one
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I thought the acting was great! The story line took turns and twists. Johnny Depp is always a plus to any movie.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I was disappointed in this book because the stories were so short and it took me a while to understand the reason for them and what they were really about
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wasn't sure if it would be too much for a younger audience, but I loved it and couldn't put it down
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I am a fan. I will read any book this man writes. I find that many times I can't put it down and stay up very very late to finish the book because I can't stand to wait for the ending
B002WJI65S|5.0|same msj... thanks for everything, this baby came in perfect condition, my son was sooo happy, God bless you all forever, love
B000MRX2DI|4.0|My son, aged 3, really is into meerkats, and he loves this little guy. Big hit. Durable, realistic and cute.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Well written and very interesting. I've begun to think about my own habits and those of businesses and people around me.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I really liked this movie. A lot. I think this is a role that some actors might easily have overplayed. But Lewis did a masterful performance.<br /><br />I'm not good at movie reviews. I would have given it 4 and 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I've watched the show from the beginning and loved this just as much<br />The story was pretty on par with what I've seen with a few minor changes, still....it's awesome
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Knowing that my son-in-law was in the area when all of this went down made this movie very surreal for me even though he wasn't involved in the actual event. I really liked how dedicated Mya was & Jessica Chastain was perfect to portray her. It also gives you insight as to how our CIA operates & the amount of danger they are in. It captivates you from the very beginning and doesn't hold back in protraying what the torture was like.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like that there are fire fasteners.  I like that you can get like 3 originally.  I have fun playing this game.
B001TODCII|5.0|The dvd is in good shape & plays fine. It did not take very long to get it and the price was great.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Look forward to purchasing the second part of the trilogy, The girl on fire from the same author. I hope that it will be as good as The girls with the dragon tattoo.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|My husband and I both loved this movie. The tense relationship between father and daughter was really good. We know the movie had a lot to do with baseball but it is a good coming of age film.
B009O2XY12|5.0|very fun and very addicting. easy to use and play. very entertaining to me and my nephew.<br />completely love it!
B003U51D58|4.0|I ordered season 6 from Amazon. The quality was good, and picture and sound were fine. I enjoyed watching the final season on my own schedule, but could only give four stars, because I hated the ending. That's nothing against Amazon, which is not responsible for content, I know. As far as quality, season 6 was fine, I just think the writers ran out of good ideas by this season.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I can't get any gems at all except for now because of this review!I even tried the getting apps that are suppose to get me gems ( they didn't work by the way.)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app... lovely horses... easy to navigate... natural looking horses... Are you looking for hours of enjoyment; then look no further!!! :-)
B00ABMZRVO|3.0|... of heroine, over and over again.<br />I wanted to like this film, but ultimately, it just kindof circles around itself like a dog before taking a nap.<br />The lead actor is good, and is capable of levels that I think the script and director didn't quite allow for. The rest of the cast is decent, but noone gets any sort of proper character development, especially Paul, who I'm not sure whether we are supposed to like, hate, route for or against.<br /><br />The storyline is easy to follow, the events believable, if just the slightest bit too mundane to justify making into a movie.<br />I wouldn't call this a morality tale, nor neither would I say that this film glorifies promiscuity or drug-use, and in that, it's quite respectable for presenting the facts, and the relationships, and the consequences in a dreamlike, disconnected, though somehow compelling way.<br /><br />Overall, the conclusion is left open, which is something I generally like, though in this film it felt more like indecision, rather than artistic choice. If it were not for the performance of Thure Lindhardt, I might have clicked away from this movie about half way through. He holds it together well, but if I could go back and help remake the film, I might have tried for some higher highs and some lower lows, which is suprising to say about a movie involving drugs and sex.<br /><br />Definitely better than 85% of films out there with gay subject matter, but for me at least, it's not worthy of much note.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love the game. this game is good for kids any age<br />i play this game and my friends play this game alll the time
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A must-read before watching any of the movies! I don't often finish books quickly, but I read the trilogy in a few days only. Great for younger and older audiences.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am a fan of the Sherlock Holmes books, and some very good BBC series of the past.<br />However, to my surprise, this modern re-working is immensely watchable and easy to recommend.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm now on the fifth novel of this series. It is absolutely addictive! I fell in love with all the...well, with all the GOOD characters, which Gabaldon shows with more depth of character than I'm used to in any book.<br /><br />Voyager is the third book of the Outlander series, and by any measure, has each page packed with action in this exciting historical fiction. If you can imagine yourself transported back in time more than 200 years, and knowing some history of the place and time, you're constantly wondering if you can change some of the evils of that time. So far, you've become a part of history now, and know that your small part in this age could be significant in some way, or at least in some lives you've come to love. This may be the most engaging story I've ever read. Action, humor, thrills and love all have their day. I wish I had known about this series years ago when it was new, but I'm enjoying it even more now than I could have then!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hoping for another season and more!  After watching one episode, we have to really make ourselves not sit and watch all of them at once.
0618918248|1.0|This books isn't good at all. This guy is just trying to win some money selling crap. There are many fallacys, many illogical arguments etc, you can see some of the in the following video:    [...]
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Only rated two stars though... it could be a lot better. Will update as I go along.hope it lets me have some freedom to choose what to do later
B0094K1MH2|2.0|Didn't make it through this one.  Lovely animation but the story just didn't interest me.  Likely best suited for an established fan of the old Tin Tin books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is epic this is a must have game anyone who doesn't get it then Wow they do not know what they're missing
1616550414|5.0|If your a Zelda franchise fan you will like this.  Came in real fast and looked carefully for damage and found no issues.  Was real impressed with the art work.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Have not received this item yet.  BUT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A REVIEW AFTER I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY THE GAME.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Following in a style typical to Grishham this novel keeps the reader wanting more. It is not overly complex either, it would make a great summer read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for many ages. It's a good way to get a break from life for a while. All of my friends love this game as well.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|After seeing them live numerous times, this was great to see. The quality of the sound is amazing. These guys are still tight. You wont be dissapointed.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Best book I have read in a while, very inspiring book to read. I really like it being told from the dogs point of view.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love it. It super fast, and its free. Great way to talk to your friends, The only thing is i don't know how to delete friends so i end up just blocking everyone i don't want to have in my contacts

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. New idea. Opened your mind to different world. I plan to read more of Suzanne Collins writings. Mary
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Whenever you think musical the sounds of superb singers with booming voices usually come to mind. This version of Les Miserables falls flat on its face for the musical talent of the primary actors. Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe are certainly no strangers to the stage and I don't question their ability to act. They are both fine actors and have many good films between them. However, neither possess good vocal abiilites (I winced each time Jackman started singing). The savior of the film came in the form Anne Hathaway. Hathaway performed an incredibly moving rendition of \\"I dreamed a dream\\" that almost anyone should feel moved by. The rest of the movie seemed well done artistically. The stages and wardrobe were very well suited to the period. The only time it felt odd was down in the slums by the docks - it was very dark with an odd assortment of ship paraphernalia strewn about. Nonetheless, the story was conveyed about misery and suffering perfectly. If you're expecting a great musical this film will surely disappoint. However, if you're looking for a beautifully done movie in terms of scenery you'll be certain to enjoy this version.<br /><br />One last word - The computer generated scenes in the movie are very apparent. Special effects were apparently toward the bottom of the list for budget priorities.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|You just posted on my Facebook page that I was today's lucky winner.Well I didn't receive any prize.You make it to hard to redeem the prizes.WHY don't you just send them to us.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I am very pleased with this app. Organizes easily syncs everywhere. Xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
B003JTHXOK|3.0|this story has lots to deal with, A woman runs away from her husband because of abuse. When she is found She has found love and comfort with a whole new name. She has told the man she loves about her past and been very patient with her. In the End when her husband dies She doesn't return him to where he belongs and get closure. This is where there are questions that the Author hasn't answered. but all in all a good read!
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|The game is interesting and the way that it's laid out it's &quot;beatable&quot;. Control accuracy isn't perfect but it's fairly good.<br /><br />The problem with the game, and the reason I gave it only one star, is that it interferes with the strings of my phone and trashes my battery as a result.<br /><br />Upon exciting the game, my phone stays configured to &quot;not sleep&quot; (keeping the display on). This draws a significant extra load on the battery and also prevents my auto-lock security from engaging. Thus is completely unacceptable.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it to all. Little confusing at start, but loved it to the end.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I ordered 3 head phones mfr by Sony to find the best inexpensive headset.  This one is by far the best --- the other 2 Sony's were good but not near as good as this one.  In addition to this one I ordered a regular Sony head set and a noise canceling Sony head set --- this one is more comfortable to wear and the sound quality for my old ears is better.  I intend to order another one of these (for a spare) and give the other two away.
B005LAII08|4.0|As always, Pixar created a visually stunning film. I enjoyed the overall message of the story, yet the tone of the humor was a bit too juvenile for my grown-up taste. Still, it seems very entertaining for young kids and kids-at-heart.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie that shows a historical event that most of us were unaware of --- good acting --- good actors --- good story line.  This is a good suspense flick that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  One amazing point was the Canadians helped our people when the British and others refused.
B007REV4YI|4.0|... but I still prefer Casino Royale of all the Daniel Craig Bond films. The feel of this movie combines grit with glamour and some visually stunning scenery. The character played by Javier Bardem was a bit too cuckoo for me.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag to travel with one DSLR camera body, two lenses, a small tripod, other camer euip. (chords ect.), and other things for traveling such as: my iPod, a book, cell phone, and charging cables, because my other camera bag was too small. This bag performed above my expectations. The movable compartments let me fit everything I needed into the easy to carry pack. You don't have to worry about the safy of your camera in this bag too, everything fits and nothing moves around almost at all. All-in-all, this is a perfect traveling bag that also might take over as my permanent camera bag!
B00B99KJR0|3.0|The gameplay is decent for what kind of game it is, the ubiquitous match 3+ style. It is hard for me to get 3 stars on most levels besides the first couple, maybe I'm just not used to these kind of games. The later levels do institute different things to make it more difficult, so that is good. The music is really lame and repetitive so I shut it off, the SFX are fine though. I don't know if it's my phone (Droid DNA), but the storyline doesn't work at all, for the story pages the text doesn't show up at all. It does at the end of a level when you unlock an item however.<br />Overall, it's a decent time waster.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series i cannot wait for the 3rd book to come out, June cannot come soon enough. Hurry.

B00846REIS|5.0|I love this series i cannot wait for the 3rd book to come out, June cannot come soon enough. I love the passion and intensity between Gideon and EVA.
B008CUVOKK|1.0|As others have noted, there is no telling when or (or if) this series will ever finish.  I've read books 1 thru 4 (out of 5), and decided to quit reading any further until the series is complete.  At 72, I may not live that long, and who knows if the author will survive that long since he seems to take 4 or 5 years per book.  I recommend waiting until it actually happens.  That said, there is a lot to like in the books if the story line didn't drag out so slowly.  This would have been a great 4 or 5 book series, at 7 books it is just reader abuse.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written book about a small German town during WWII from a young girl's perspective. Absolutely fascinating narrative point of view!! Sad, sweet, even funny at times with very interesting characters.

B0042X9L6A|4.0|i got this flash to go with my new Nikon D7100 and my old D40. it works great on both!!! granted the newer camera has a lot more options and creative things you can do with it but this product works flawlessly on anything from the older D40 models to the pro level D4 and any camera in between. the flash recycles faster than the built in flash and provides a lot more versatility with your photography!!! recomend for any nikon slr
B000002KXV|5.0|I lost my copy when I moved a few years ago and just got around to buying a replacement. This may be one of the best jazz/pop albums of all time. Each track is superb.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting story, had some surprises, twists and turns that I didn't figure out right away. Just a little draggy in a couple of places. I definitely recommend this book.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|There is a lot of blood and gore, probably too much. Some people have said they watched Kill Bill 1 and then did not watch Kill Bill 2 and that makes no sense because there are scenes in Kill Bill 2, especially the ending, that is necessary to understand and care about why she wants to Kill Bill. Like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill is not boring, and there is a few of the most interesting scenes I have seen in movies. Sometimes flashbacks are a waste of time, however in Kill Bill the flashbacks serve an intense purpose and make the current scene powerfully impactful with what she is going through. Often in action movies people say they really did not care about the main character and that the movie was just a bunch of action, but the final scene of Kill Bill 2 makes the viewer have a connection with and care about all she had to struggle through and endure on her quest to Kill Bill.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Really makes you feel like you are there.  Definitely look forward to reading more of the series. Looking forward to the tv show to start session two.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Considering the topic and educational background this book is insightful , inspiring and we'll written.  My heart goes out to this family and their incredible journey.
1433502410|5.0|I just wish I had more time to actually sit and read it and explore the Bible. Before buying any Bible in English, I did some research to find out the best translation for easier understanding and getting all that I could, from the Bible, and this translation is one of the best. Rather than translating word for word, this version translates phrase by phrase, if you compare Russian to English.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|I'm so happy we finally get to learn a little bit about Ophelia. When we met her in Forever Girl, she was full of this mysterious past. But it's not mysterious anymore. ;)<br /><br />The plot was very carried out very quickly. Ophelia finds herself thrown into this world she doesn't completely believe is real. Ophelia comes to terms fast with what her mark means pretty fast. One day she's completely against it, and the next she's like \\"Let's do this.\\" My only complaint is her feelings toward Ethan were extremely strong even after they had just met. I do, however, like their loyalty to each other. Ethan will do whatever possible in order to make sure Ophelia completes her task.<br /><br />Also on Callista. I knew she was vindictive, but wow! I was glad we got that little snippet of who she really is. Just sayin'. I was not expecting that. This is a great novella in the Forever Girl series. It adds more knowledge, and I always think that's a great thing. Ophelia learns some truths to finally put her thoughts about her mother to rest.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|one of the best new albums so far this year.  i haven't taken it out of the cd player since we got it.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Major disappointment!  Terrible &#34;singing&#34;!  Absolute waste of money and time.  My wife and I could only make it through about 40 minutes, and she's a huge fan of musicals!
B005DJREGQ|1.0|I'm sorry, I watched the pilot and saw this young girl having sex with a popular guy in the janitor's closet and after they were through, it was so awkward. She never knew him and vice versa. It was just to be popular and desired by a popular guy.<br /><br />Maybe the story developed later on in the show and hence having more than just a pilot but I could not help feel saddened by how insecure young girls are to prove themselves and allow themselves to be used just to prove a point.  Years ago I admit I would not have been fased by this, but with 2 young daughters of my own, I cringed.
0141331976|5.0|My daughter loved all these books and just needed this for her collection. The price was good and book came in great condition.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game. Its easy to play and a welcome distraction from dad to day stresses. I like that my kids can play too.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy this game more than any played so far. It is artistically and visually appealing as well as addictive. With a few exceptions, an opportunity for satifying one's creative nature. Few areas needing improvement are: 1) shuts down frequently, 2) inability to exchange coins for gold, 3) complicated process for using gold gifted by neighbors. Try it and you are hooked.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Some might rate this game a bit lower than I did, perhaps because they are comparing the game to a more advanced PC-based adventure game.  And it's true that the navigation, and most of the puzzles, are not terribly difficult.  But my rating is based on exactly that -- players who are new to point-and-click adventure games (and, frankly, even some -- like myself -- who have been playing them for over 20 years) should find it very easy to get into the mode of logical thinking that is requred to navigate through the (fairly extensive) &#34;footprint&#34; of this game, locate objects required to solve puzzles, and then discover (and solve) the many puzzles contained in this game.<br /><br />In fact, I would rate this game as one of the highest &#34;puzzles-per-scene&#34; that I have played.  Every time I turned around, I was faced with another puzzle -- and I love that.  There is very little need to hunt and explore needlessly; patience is the key.  Understanding that not everything will happen 'all at once', but rather requires going through many levels first, is critical.<br /><br />Among other things, I loved the &#34;changing seasons&#34; aspect of the game.  You can visit virtually every scene in the game at any season of the year.  However, in the course of the game, the seasons change.  And some activities are only available in certain seasons.  You must plan carefully, so as to be &#34;in the right place at the right time&#34; throughout game play.<br /><br />Despite being a &#34;typical point-and-click adventure game&#34;, there are many features of the game that make &#34;The Lost City&#34; quite unique.  There are clearly the &#34;find-the-key-that-unlocks-this-lock&#34; searches.  But the discrete puzzles often are not obvious.  Yet after each one, I had that pleasant feeling of &#34;Hey, that was really a good puzzle!&#34; (rather than some games, where I may end up cursing the game for some of the oblique puzzles they create).<br /><br />I highly recommend &#34;The Lost City&#34; to anyone who would like to play a medium-difficulty adventure game on their mobile device.  (Full disclosure: I played the game on a 10.1&#34; Motorola Xoom tablet -- and loved the graphics.  Some scenes might have small &#34;hot spots&#34; on a 4&#34; phone screen, making it more difficult to play.  But I had no hardware or software problems running on the Xoom tablet, under Android 4.1.)d &#34;The Lost City&#34; to anyone who would like to play a medium-difficulty adventure game on their mobile device.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|I'm not too keen on books that are written in 2 different accounts of the story.<br />The ending was a disappointment.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book takes an important lesson we all need and eloquently schools the reader. The characters are endearing. You want to shake them and then hold them!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a wholesome family show. My husband and I have fallen in love with all the characters in this show.  I wish they the industry would offer more shows like this. This and Downton Abbey or great shows!  :)
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|So much better than #1. So addictive, I can't stop playing. I love the new characters. I'm definitely telling my friends to get this game
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This was not a great movie and could not be put aside by the industry, this is another ten star Spielberg movie.  Next to the<br />holocaust it rates high.  The only thing one should think about prior to watdhing it, are you emotionally prepared for the<br />graphic details of the movie.  This is pure history of a dark time in the history of the world  BJ

B003UHYSIK|5.0|This concert has the greatest performance on video by Slayer. My first exposure to Slayer Live video was the War at the Warfield dvd, and it was god awful. Tom's voice sounded like crap and the whole band did not seem into it. here on Live Intrusion, you get an amazing concert. Tom's voice is actually enjoyable! you can here his bass and he even gives some of those funny tom introductions to some of the songs! Something he never does anymore. Also notable here are Jeffs solos! For Slayer, Jeff's solos are incredible! I love his improvised off note mayhem this dvd. Kerry does a good job at being kerry, throwing solos back and forth with Jeff. Paul Bostaph's performance on drums is amazing! He has his own style different from Dave, that really brings this dvd to life! if you are a metal fan, looking for a good extreme metal DVD, you will love Live Intrusions! Some rare Slayer songs are played here that sound incredible live! underated metal classics like, \\"Killing Fields\\", \\"At Dawn They Sleep\\" and the Slayer epic \\"213\\"(they need to play this today!. Die hard Slayer fans and extreme metal fans in general will love this dvd. Best Slayer concert DVD by far!
1400069807|5.0|Very informative, rings so true. The writer Michael Moss is a Pulitzer Prize–winning investigative reporter at The New York Times. Doesn't get any better than that. Although we already know most of this mess they add in food this book puts it all together.

0553386794|1.0|... you like stories that end. (SPOILER ALERT!!!)  I, for one, like to read a book that wraps up loose ends.  I like to enjoy the story and feel good about it when it's over.  You can't do that with these books.  Have you ever read The Grapes of Wrath?  You get invested in the story and, all of a sudden, in the middle of the story, you're on the last page.  That's what this set of books is like.  You start to know the main characters and the author kills them.  Not just one or two.  He kills nearly ALL of them.  Bad guys, good guys, men women, children, animals... it doesn't matter.  It's not that I mind the actual killing, but not when it's virtually ALL the main characters.  Nobody you start to care about lives.  Only badly developed characters that deserve to die, live on.  Maybe it's too much like real life.  I started the first book and liked it so I ordered the rest of them.  Then I got to the end of Book 1 and was furious that I'd taken the time to read it!  Now I feel compelled to finish all of them just because I paid for them.  If I wanted stories with no ending, I'd watch the news and our idiot politicians.  If you like to read just to kill time, then by all means purchase these books.  If you want to read GOOD books, then steer clear of these!
0345529057|4.0|so much more than what the DVD's are able to give, but enjoyed both. Looking forward to seeing more in same genre.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Sometimes cards won't separate correctly so you<br /> can't play the correct one. Too many steps back to play next hand. Still entertaining.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|good 2nd season, looking forward to Season 3. Great way to spend any free time watching the episodes since I don't have HBO.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|From the standpoint of the product itself, both it and the packaging were in perfect condition.  The movie was what one would expect of a Breaking Dawn movie.  Good, but a bit sappy in parts.  I personally loved it, but this particular movie of the series was more for the gals than the guys.
B00BF11STU|3.0|i did not understand whats special about the movie. was it a bad movie? definitely no. but was it a 'great' movie, so that I wont forget it ever? No!. that sums it up.
B00006I53S|5.0|My main reason for buying this lens was the zoom range. 28mm is fair for getting a bit of wide angle and the 135mm gives good zoom. The lens construction is good but for some reason does not feel sturdy maybe because of the lens creep. This lens will extend when you have it facing down, even quicker when you have a lens filter and hood. Despite all these negatives this is still a awesome lens. Fast focusing and lightweight. Recommended.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is the greatest series , I am hooked, bought both seasons , waiting now for season three! Absolutely love this series!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis channels Lincoln and definitely deserved the Oscar.<br /><br />Sally Field and Daniel Day played off of each other beautfully.<br /><br />A wonderful creator study as well as one of the most important moments in our nations history.<br />&#34;Lincoln&#34; captured this time in such a manner that you feel as though you are there.<br /><br />A Must see!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have already made a comment on season one , I bought both seasons and I am waiting for season three to come out, I love love this series!

B002DQFHKM|5.0|Awesome nostalgia and awesome songs to re-live the '80's. And all this in a quick, easy download. What could be easier
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Once in a while a film has 2 leads both deserving of Oscars. In this one, Hoffman won and Cruise did not even get nominated, an example of the limitations of how such awards are decided. Both make convincing brothers, products of the same parents but with radically different limitations.<br />Hoffman is the older autistic brother that Cruise never knew because of his sibling's institutionalization. While the autistic is incapable of living independently despite extraoridinary savant powers, his younger brother purposely lives independently as a means of preying on every person and situation encountered.<br />Reunited after their father's death, the brothers teach each other lessons otherwise unobtainable. The development of Cruise's character moves the picture along as Hoffman's impersonation of an autistic man living in his own regimented world gives viewers an education on the condition. Won 4 Oscars for best actor, Hoffman; director, Barry Levinson; picture, Mark Johnson; and best original screenplay, Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks novels and this was no exception.  Makes me want to see the movie and see how it relates to the screen.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I think all families should watch this together.  The values and morals depicted here are sorely missing in this world we live in.  A very good movie for a role model.
B003MC5N28|3.0|I enjoyed the story and the writing, but it was a little young for me.  Of course it was recommended by my 15 year old grandson, so did I expect!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I got this so I could get up during the night and early in the morning (4 & 5 am) without bothering my husband. It has been perfect. I sometimes use it to go to my car in the early early mornings, instead of turning on the porch light.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|I choose this because it was a movie I wanted to see. Its a great story line with overcoming of fears and changing the minds of characters who have old belief of humans being bad. The music was good. There were songs I liked in it. I enjoy watching this so I gave it a love it.
B008P9M614|5.0|Let's face it, most of us, when buying an entire series, want it to be of high quality, reasonably priced, complete with all episodes and a minimum amount of extraneous &#34;additional&#34; features, i.e. pamphlets, photos and other stuff that may raise the cost of the purchase and which most of us don't want and won't read anyway. I mean, after all is said and done we just want to watch the programs.<br /><br />I have throughly enjoyed this set. The discs were all there when I opened the set (you'd be surprized how often a disc is missing or duplicated leaving the set incomplete) and there was a very brief synopsis of each episode within the DVD case.<br /><br />The subtitles were in English and Spanish and were &#34;almost&#34; verbatim to the dialog unlike some subtitles that I have experienced where the subtitle replaces whole phrases and words and really has nothing to do with what the actor had just said.<br /><br />Disc one of each Season also included &#34;Special Features&#34; for which I can't tell you what the features covered as I don't watch them. Just wanted to mention that they exist.<br /><br />Although there was a small pamphlet contained in the set it was not too burdensome to the reader. One part, &#34;House-isms,&#34; was very funny and I had heard them used, some of them many, many times, throughout the series. The main characters (House, Cuddy & Wilson) comment on their characters character and how they interact with each other. There is also a Season & Episode guide to help you find a special episode without having to open and search each DVD case. There is a section that addresses the ideas of how House was developed as well as how the characters were developed. There are also some quotes, from the famous and not-so-famous. The average time to read the pamphlet is about 20-30 minutes if you stop to think and consider what you've just read :-)<br /><br />Bottom line: House, The Complete Series is well put together and worth the cost. I have recommended this set to several of my friends and family who like this series as much as I do. BUT, I had an ulterior motive for recommending this set so strongly, I don't want to lend my set to ANYONE no matter if they were friend and/or family. To lend this set is just setting me up to have arguments due to a disc being returned with a scratch/scratches, being returned with one or more discs missing or other damage that can happen. So....rather than go through stressful arguments I ALWAYS recommend and  NEVER loan.<br /><br />Just in case I have been too subtle let me just say, BUY  House: The Complete Series!

B0016CP1QY|5.0|Terry Callier passed away last year still a rather obscure figure. Recording his debut album,a collection of folk standards done up in his style, for Prestige in 1968 he became more popular as a singer/songwriter in Europe than he did in the US let-let alone his native Chicago. When we went back there, he signed up with Cadet records and become involved with Charles Stepney: producer for the Ramsey Lewis Trio who in a few years from this point would strike gold on his work with Earth Wind & Fire.  Five years after his debut album Callier and Stepney came together along with backing vocals from Minnie Ripperton for this second album that at least gave his creative reputation a bit more of a leg up.<br /><br />  The album is tied together by \\"Go Ahead On\\",one folk blues number that's separated into five seques throughout the album but,from the sound of it represents a single song. There's also the Chicago soul shuffle of \\"Ordinary Joe\\" and \\"Sweet Edie-D\\". Full of rhythmic bounce and Stepney's hot piano work and Ripperton's backing vocals give these the flavor of excellent material for possible singles.  \\"Golden Circle\\",the title song,\\" Do You Finally Need A Friend\\"  and \\"Trance On Sedgewick Street\\" all showcase these beautifully expansive melodies layered in these rich orchestrations and more unexpected bursts of backing vocals from Ripperton.<br /><br />  \\"Blues For Marcus\\" and \\"Lean On Me\\" reflect a strong bluesier flavor to the songwriting. But whatever happens on this album, Callier's creative stamp is all over it. One of the elements of this is how he intentionally defies any attempt at musically belonging to one particular genre.  He is definitely a singer/songwriter/musician of the highest order-always placing emphasis on his material and highly stigmatic,poetic and almost Dylan-like stream of conscious lyrics.  On the other hand instrumentally the music finds this compelling middle ground between baroque styled folk,soul,blues and even some country-western influences. Can't say I ever heard an album quite like this and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in Callier's work as, based on what I've heard of him this likely represents his creative salad days.luences.

B001EIK7IC|5.0|The cadet debut of Terry Callier [[ASIN:B0016CP1QY Occasional Rain]] was a strong musical affair that reintroduced him more in the context of a folk/soul singer-songwriter. But one could tell his style would by nature reject any blatant attempt at labeling. On his second album for the label Callier decided to up the ante on his own musical ambitions and expand on his debut album to take some new and perhaps unexpected musical chances even for him. Accompanied by a large orchestral ensemble with horns and strings he bought in future Earth Wind & Fire members Louis Satterfield on bass and Don Myrick on sax for an album that is,in all honesty nothing short of musically captivating.<br /><br />  The opener \\"Dancing Girl\\",a nearly nine minute opus of cinematic folk/soul proportions along with the gentler toned title song play up the baroque influences of Callier's sound many fold-something like a Cat Steven's approach to blues/folk/soul from a highly African American perspective. \\"Your Goin' Miss Your Candyman\\" is the funkiest number here,with heavy percussion and bass line bubbling just under Callier's vocals similar to the approach of latter period Ramsey Lewis Trio. \\"Just As Long As We're In Love\\" takes full advantage of the orchestral element on a song with a very theatrical soul bent to it. \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" is again more a thoroughly folk number where the album ends with \\"You Don't Care\\"-a silky windy city soul (near) instrumental-featuring only backup vocals singing the song title.<br /><br />  It is \\"Ho Tsing Mee (A Song Of The Sun)\\",a cinematic folk/soul message song exemplifying perfectly what I call \\"people music\\" that defines the spirit of this album. It speaks philosophically about love-both romantically and within the human spirit. It also admits that he's heard love is the answer many times,and asks how we can change our hearts if we cannot even change our minds. The spirit of that concept resonates throughout the lyrics and music on every song on this album. In every possible sense this music is penetrating, probing and positively provocative.  A lot of \\"p\\" words I know. But this album goes maybe even beyond Terry Callier's original intentions and might very well be his very best album length statement.his album.

B00683JK9K|5.0|One of my current favorites. I play this one in the 216 piece setting, and each puzzle takes me about an hour. Beautiful pictures, great escapism. I wish there were more puzzles included, though.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I got this one because a friend sent me an invitation via Facebook. Its easy and addicting, but I don't think I will pay for lives. So when they run out, if friends haven't sent more, I will stop playing. Bright colors, easy concept to grasp, not a lot of brain work involved. Just a distraction for a few minutes.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Many people, in reviewing this movie at various forums (but not here for some reason) claimed to be \\"bored\\" and not \\"entertained\\" by Spielberg's Lincoln.<br /><br />But the film's \\"boring\\" pace is precisely its greatness. It should be compared to Terence Malick's WWII film \\"The Thin Red Line\\" which came out at the same time as Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"; many people, who considered themselves mainstream politically or conservative, disliked The Thin Red Line (and liked Ryan)) because like Lincoln, The Thin Red Line didn't pander to expectations; the exciting shots of landing craft racing towards the beach in the beginning of The Thin Red Line failed to be followed by a fight as expected. Interestingly, the audience in The Thin Red Line may be said to be ravening for the blood of images of men who could be their grandfathers while the men who could be their grandfathers are relieved that the Japanese have cleared the beach.<br /><br />Lincoln is \\"about\\" the last months of the war when it was at once necessary and Constitutional if containing some chicanery to get a 13th (antislavery) amendment passed before a Union victory. It was necessary to do so because if Lincoln had waited until peace, the reconstructed Southern congress could pass an anti-antislavery amendment which would be a serious violation of the \\"states' rights\\" of NORTHERN states who sought to ban all manifestations of slavery within their borders...including the site of slave \\"coffles\\": escaped slaves and even freedmen, who'd found sanctuary in a free state like Dred Scott, being sent, in chains, in a FREE state, back to their slave state. This itself shows that Southroners didn't give a damn about \\"states' rights\\" because they refused to acknowledge the right of Nothern states not to have to accommodate the slave coffles.<br /><br />Lincoln, having grown up in an Ohio valley where blacks lived in fear despite living in free states, was determined to effectively end slavery by passing a Constitutional amendment, revocable only by supermajorities, that would discourage a reconstructed Congress from trying to re-enable slavery through ordinary legislation, and the viewer of the movie, DVD or BluRay needs to understand this. Otherwise he or she will be \\"bored\\".
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm addicted! I love the puzzle mode, and trying to beat my own best time. The cube rotates effortlessly with my stylus (unlike a similar game that I gave up on out of frustration). Colors and bright and the difference in MOST of the patterns are distinctive enough to make easy matches without having to count stars. I keep going back to this game when I have a few minutes to kill.

B00280LYHS|4.0|So, there are some books in this series that just seem like a repeat of former books, but with different monsters to defeat.  Maybe I just wasn't paying as good of attention, but I don't actually remember who the last Olympian was or who he was fighting. This is still a great book, therefore the four stars, and one I would definitely recommend.
0061478784|4.0|Whether you've seen the Studio Ghibli rendition or not, Diana Wynne Jones' Howl's Moving Castle is an unconventional fairy tale that will enchant those willing enough to read it. It's a bit odd, the entire plot: a young girl is transfigured into a 90-year-old woman, runs away, and ends up finding employment of sorts in an ever-moving castle. A castle, by the way, that is controlled by a witty, grousing fire demon, attended to by a young, endearing apprentice, and owned by a moody, mysterious wizard.<br />Although rumors have run amok concerning the dietary habits of thisWizard Howl (namely, that he eats girls' hearts), he is not what one would expect from an evil wizard. Nor is Sophie Hatter-the girl-turned-old-woman-what one expects from a hero, either. Down many roads-bumpy and less so-Jones weaves a magical tale in a voice so reminiscent of soothing grandmotherly tones that anyone with an ear for fantasy will be charmed by.<br />Those who find all such tales laughable shouldn't waste their time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this after reading a Wall Street Journal article about the author and his journey from an unknown author to someone keeping his digital rights while selling the print version.  The story outline intrigued me.  I decided to get it and am very glad I did!  I read it in one day as I did not want to put it down.  The story pulls you in and reading this first then makes the following books more meaningful.  I am looking forward to more of his works.

B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This is a great exploration  of human psychology that leaves the reader torn over whether to adopt the narrator's point of view, or that of a character with whom she seems continually at odds. I am left wondering if it is possible that some people are just born evil, or if it is life experiences and influences that create that evil. Perhaps a greater question still, and the question with which the reader is finally left, is whether true reform is possible.<br />The format of the book - letters to the narrator's husband- is strange at first, but it's purpose is easy enough to decipher once you get a little farther into the story. Overall, it was a great read ... and full of great SAT & GRE words if you are looking to enhance your vocabulary.

B0088W4YTK|4.0|Catchy dialogue and plenty of action. The science takes a lot to swallow; not realistic but better than most. Dr. McKay is one of my<br />favorite characters.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|'Intouchabes' is a moving story of characters from all walks who perceive life in certain ways, convincing themselves into believing they are principles. From the rich invalid who accepts his limitations and even unnecessarily imposing more of the same on himself, he has settled into even the most vicarious of relationships, an epistolary one with a woman unseen.<br />Along comes Driss, so full of convictions: he is unemployable, will not put on another's support stockings, all attractive women find him irresistible, hang gliding is insane and certainly would not consider taking care of an invalid's most personal, basic needs.<br />All of this understandable. We get into life's routines which are most comfortable and focus on directing our activities to emphasize them. Then life throws people into circumstances which break down those barriers, some of the strongest with surprising ease. The foundation of the relationship between the two characters is established and once the trust is established, they proceed to explore what other limitations can and need to be eliminated. Laughter begins to fill the mansion, sacred bonds are examined like Phillipe's relationship with his adopted daughter.<br />Life begins anew for both. Little things are symbolic like stuffy opera and classical music contrasted with dancing to Earth, Wind and Fire at a birthday party. Driss is fearless in all aspects of life until he encounters hang gliding. Having singularly described himself as 'pragmatic' in an interview, accepting some semi parachute float him far from where his feet are firmly on the ground is forbidden territory. With Nina Simone helping out, his fears turn to exhilaration as expressed by \\"I'm having a blast\\".<br />We would not expect a stuffy, rich invalid to smoke dope and find it opens new perspectives, yet it does physically and spiritually as now he can truly breathe and laugh.<br />But then the compromise Driss makes to work to the point where this had become a new 'principle' is shattered by his family life. Always a priority for him, his family has had been sacrificed in order to fulfill these obligations, but in the end so as to take care of them it is recognized and accepted he has to be with them.<br />In route, Driss finds out why the hot red head he has been pining for has resisted his most earnest affections. Phillipe has to give up Driss and again compromise by accepting a inadequate substitute caregiver, as useless and inane as the resumes of the rest.<br />The invalid finally meets his literary companion to close out that limiting aspect of his life - due to no small effort by Driss who by now does not work for him but is driven to see the relationship have a chance.<br />As we relive replaying the car ride from the beginning, there is an underlying uneasiness about its purpose and how it will end. Again we are reminded: this story is about living life and leaving the alternatives behind. That will not be compromised.<br />Enjoyable movie that forces the viewer to suspend credulity but discard disbelief because in the end it works. The movie requires faith up until the point where we want this relationship to work and in the end our faith in the human spirit is renewed.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This little scanner was delivered on time and in excellent packaging. After using it for a week, in which more than 400 images were transferred from slides and negatives, I'm very satisfied with its performance. Nothing could be simpler than this stand alone system. Picture quality depends on the material being scanned. Well preserved slides or negatives required little or no digital processing. I scanned dozens of faded slides, as old as 60 years. Many were also affected by mildew. In almost every case, the scanner provided enough information to make digital restoration acceptable.<br /><br />Most impressive is the ease and speed with which material can be transferred. Just find a space for your scanner and film material, insert a SD card, turn on the scanner and set it up for the job at hand. Setup takes about 5 minutes. After that, it is just a matter of changing slides or negatives and pressing a couple of buttons. Since slides vary slightly in size, I recommend having a tweezer available for removing oversized ones from the slot,

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game great graphics and many challenging levels I enjoyed playing it a few times using the different levels. And the extras made it a challenge each time
B005GIS1SY|4.0|One scary character, but not too bad for the 3 year old.  Great jokes for adults.  Good story for the kids too.  This movie surpsassed my expectations.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Excellent.  Just what I came for, action and adventure. Keep the books coming and I'll be back for more .
B00BF11STU|4.0|Production values in the first half were haphazzard.  The second half was tight & skillfully executed.  No music, only the totally realistic sound of brass shell casings hitting cement.  WOW!  Argo awards were a pity party for Ben Afflick.  0DT DESERVES all the awards
B0052VUNHC|5.0|In honor of Travis' birthday and in anticipation of the next book I had to read...for the third time.  Each time gets better and better. I'm sure I will revisit these two again and again.
B00008L3NK|5.0|As always, the high technical quality and smooth artistry of these annual New Year's Day concerts from Vienna are impeccable entertainment with special features (dance and scenic accompaniments) that even the original audience did not benefit from. Get his DVD while they last!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have been in the world of Miss. Steele and Mr. Grey for about a week. I was so mad at myself for not purchasing these book earlier after I heard reviews. I love these books because it is a carnal start and ends into the meaning of love bears all things and keep no score. I wouldn't,t mind a book from Christian,s point of view to show his transformation which would cover those two months of and the continuation of the destruction to rebirth of Mr. Christian Grey CEO. It would be a readers dream come true if EL James and Zane collaborated on a book.
0446585041|4.0|Expected more from ellen...she is so funny on t.v., but this book fell short of what I expected to hear from Ellen
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is one of the best games of alltime you should get it I am the appcritic so if you want a good app here it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After not using my Kindle for some time, I found that the cord sheath was crumbling when I did finally take it out to use.  A call to Amazon, Kindle customer service, resulted in the cord being replaced as No Charge.  This cord is much better material and works fine.  Fast service.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old loves helping all of the animals feel better!  Lots of fun and very easy for toddlers.  Well worth the money spent on this one.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I love the new look and feel of the latest version.  The widget is great.  For some reason the animated map will not load.  The still images load fine but when I select a location to zoom in and animate, the screen blanks.  I've always liked the map feature but its failed me at the worst time. Five stars if you can fix this.<br /><br />Update: Repeated notes to the developer have not fixed this problem.  Downgrading from 3 to 2 stars.
B00838HRP2|1.0|How can you Amazon let a company like MovieMars sell DVD's that won't play in DVD players, I tried in 2 different players. had to return it to them hoping I get my money back plus all the postage.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|I'm enjoying watching Twin Peaks.  I missed it when it first aired back in the early 90's, but remember all the buzz about it.  I'm now seeing why. Although there are parts that are a bit dated, it's still very entertaining.  It's set in small town America, but filled with a variety of wacky characters and bizarre, sometimes shocking, activities so rarely a dull moment.  It's also entertaining to watch the stuff going on in the background.  It's often never addressed, nor does it have anything to do with the storyline. The streaming has been very reliable without a lot of jumpiness or sound lags.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|Just finished watching this movie via Amazon Prime. My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. I don't have anything to add to the other 4 and 5 star reviews. Just thought this was an entertaining movie that kept us guessing and trying to figure out what was happening.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|right on time, and no dents dings or scuffs I pay good money and I expect my items to arrive in perfect condition, and I get what im paying for.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old...she loves it!  Keeps her busy, teaches her about cooking on her level.  Highly recommend for toddlers.  It's easy for them to figure out on their own.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|I like the album a lot. I first heard The XX on a local station doing indi rock on Sunday nights. The sone they were playing was a remix of Florence and the Machine by The XX. I loved that song and checked them out some more and liked what I heard.<br /><br />The only issue with this LP is the cover. The XX is cut out of the cover and when you try to return the LP into the cover it keeps snagging. A real PITA. Something for the cover artists to keep in mind.
B001R0O9K4|5.0|I love this film and getting to watch it using Amazon instant video was Great! I hope this becomes available for Android soon so I can watch more videos while on the go.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This is one of those movies that no matter what someone says about it, they're right.  The concept is interesting and well-worth seeing for fans of the musical.  But, for those who haven't seen the stage musical, this could be one of the longest movies they've ever seen.  The movie is shorter than the musical, and the cuts have made the transitions difficult at times.  And, because things that work with the staging of a musical don't work the same way for movies, there are odd parts that might be flat out annoying for some people.<br /><br />I thought the approach to the music was interesting.  The actors are definitely acting WHILE singing, which gives a new perspective to many of the songs.  If this were my only exposure to \\"Les Miserables,\\" I think I'd be disappointed.  But I've seen it a few times, so I liked seeing a different adaptation.  But, stage purists may hate this version.<br /><br />The music was mixed.  I had heard so much about Russell Crowe's singing that I was prepared to be appalled, but Russell Crowe CAN sing--he just isn't Broadway material.  He hits all his notes, though I've heard much better versions of the songs.  But I'll bet he's quite good singing pop songs or oldies.  Hugh Jackman is a very talented man, though I'm afraid Colm Wilkinson has so completely set the bar for Jean Valjean for me that no one has ever quite lived up to the original for me.  Still, I enjoyed seeing Jackman's take on the part and he's certainly no slouch.  I thought Anne Hathaway was wonderful as Fantine, though so many of the cuts involved her story that I think her story might be the most confusing part for anyone who hasn't seen the stage version.  I didn't care for Amanda Seyfried's singing, but that's just personal preference.  She's quite talented and certainly others will enjoy her performance.  The only true complaint I had was the Thenardiers.  I love Helena Bonham Carter as an actress, but if one has a well-trained ear, it's obvious she's missing some ofher notes.  I'd have much rather seen her in something else as a major character as an actress than a small part in a musical.  As she was also cast in \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" it seems that her acting ability is strong enough to carry singing parts by Hollywood standards, but at least in dvds one can skip over scenes one doesn't want to watch.<br /><br />I think it's well worth seeing, but some people are definitely going to hate this movie.  Perhaps that's the mark of truly taking a new approach to material--they chose not to take a \\"safe\\" route and I think it's worth seeing for that alone.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Watched this via Amazon Prime. My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. Very cool movie. Characters were well developed. Loved the music (score and soundtrack). Loved Matthew McConaughey in this movie. I can't imagine any other actor portraying the lawyer in this film.

B00683JK9K|5.0|I got this for may wife and she really enjoys the app on her Kindle.  The only problem she reports is it gets too adictive.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|I just love this album. Excellent in every respect.<br /><br />In addition to the music being great this is also some great vinyl. The album comes on two discs. The discs are of exceptional quality being about twice the thickness of standard LP's.<br /><br />Great music on great vinyl!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is fun  and keeps you playing to make the next level.  Have recommended to a lot of friends.  Good job,.
B008220DGE|5.0|This film is one of most important movies in the last 40 years....It is a masterwork of film making, camera use, color, and , most importantly, acting. And the message and meaning is too important for all lovers of films to miss.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and wow is it full of twists and turns! It kept me on the edge of my seat. Nothing is ever as it seems! Good read.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|We were really looking forward to watching Lincoln.  Unfortunately, the movie would only stream for 1 to 2 minutes and then stop, making the movie un-watchable.  We tried watching it on two separate nights with the same results.  We watched a different movie through Amazon with no issues.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Jeff Kinney has done it again with Cabin Fever kids love this amazing series  by the wonderful author great job
B004A1NMRS|5.0|If you like the Pixies this is a great album. If you never heard of them this is a great place to start. I have lots of Pixies on CD's from over the years but decided to buy this on vinyl. A nice choice as it covers a lot of their best stuff.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I really enjoy blasting monkeys in this one. I have played the first one and Seasons and I am having just as much fun with this one.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always wanted a horse. Now I have one. Thank you for this lovely app! I'm thirty, and I think it's just great. I love all the amazing graphics, and its free. You can't go wrong with free! The great thing is it actually looks like it shouldn't be. Totally worth getting. Played on Kindle HD.
B009NCM248|5.0|I am enjoying listeneng to this one. Excellent guitar and lyrics. A must have for any and all Stone Sour fans.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As one of millions who now love Downton Abbey, I, of course, highly recommend this series! Everything was done so well and the writing/filming really draws you into the lives of all of the characters. I pretty much sat down and watched the whole thing within a week! Very addicting and sooo enjoyable!! VERY highly recommend!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|\\"Quiet\\" by Susan Cain is a book written by an introvert to introverts who want to know how to handle their own introversion. The book also helps readers deal with their children's introversion, how to interact better in a world with introverts in it, and how to deal with those pesky extroverts. The great part about this book is that it gives extroverts, introverts, and people who are uncertain, a chance to better understand the world around them.<br /><br />Lastly, the greatest value of this book to both myself and to future readers is the in-depth insight into introverts. It was shocking to me to find out that being introverted is not a negative quality, but quite a positive one! Introversion is something not often discussed in classes, friends, family, or coworkers but it is something that we run into on a daily basis. Being able to better understand 1/3 of our population is something we should be taught at an earlier age. Also, we could all do with learning some of the positive aspects, like taking a calm approach to crises, of introversion and incorporating it into our daily lives.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I really enjoyed the format of this book (the way the author examined different aspects of habits) using stories mixed with details on research.  Well written and even entertaining (which is a good trait for books like this).
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was really hard for me to get into. The first third was slow as you got to know all of the characters but once you knew all of them ( there are many) the pace picked up and I enjoyed the story.
B005IGZUTC|4.0|Easy to read, funny book. Perfect bedtime read after a long stressful day at work. Makes me want to visit Vegas.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a very fun game. Easy to pick up. Don't have to babysit it either.  The dragons are very fun.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|The plot goes nowhere unexpected. I kept reading and waiting to get interesting, for a surprise. Unfortunately none.<br />The author repeats himself constantly and frequently loses the main character supposedly unique point of view, that of a dog. And it's here that the illusion is lost.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|If and when Martin finishes the story and the people that be have time to make a production worthy of the books, a la Lord of the Rings, the series will do.
B00B6KJ0AE|4.0|If you like acdc youll like this album. Most all of the tracks are good. Good workout album, it rocks.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I had been playing regular jewel and thought that was fun.This game got me hooked right away. I still haven't. figured out. all the tricks but it does. make time go by
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so awesome. I really hope that the new update gives out at least Redstone wiring and stuff like that.anyway it is so awesome.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I already had the regular collection of the Godfather.  Since it came out in Blue-ray, I wanted it since this was one of my favorite movies.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was great.
B005LAIIGC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie; loved the animation/graphics. I think anyone who enjoys animation would like this movie. The hopping eggs gave me a laugh.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is great!!.......when it works. I love temple run 2, however,  the kindle fire app does not let me open this app. it works sometimes, but only on rare occasions.
B00BLDD3A4|2.0|theres not a lot of daves voice in the album. stevie nicks track and your wife is calling are the only tracks i would buy.
B00005NGAK|5.0|Love this Feet of Flames Riverdance DVD. I previously owned Lord of the Dance on VHS. Feet of Flames has pretty much everything from LOTD but even more. This is my favorite from my Riverdance collection. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Michael Flatley and Riverdance.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|(SPOILER ALERT) The last episode was amazing, they finally killed that annoying girl Andrea. They partially got rid of the governor, although as I am quite sick of him I would like to see him dead and gone. But they have defiantly got my stoked for season 4, I can't wait to see what they do with all the new characters and how they finally get rid of the governor as he is obviously going to come back for one last epic battle. Over all 10/10 I love it.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I like the fact that i can pick and choose specific body areas to work on, or if I have the time...do the complete work out...No excuses now....if I can't make it to the gym, or the weather is not cooperating...I can still work out at home.....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|great little movie the grandkids love it and we grand parents loved it to.o o o oo o o o
B004UNX1LS|2.0|Everytime I click on the app, within 1 minute it exits out. I love Vevo, but I hate this app!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Nice album. Lots of variety worth purchasing album vs tracks. Very high production value on this album. Nice variety of styles.
B000L43AN4|5.0|This was a great CD at a great price.  this was purchased as a gift and it arrived very quickly.  thanks
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I enjoyed this series so much, I was not able to just watch one episode. All the episodes were exciting from beginning to end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Just like the arcades....fun and addicting....A nice change, no pun intended, in apps available, and its free! Can't ask for much more than that!
1400069807|5.0|\\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" is a food history of how processed food is made and marketed. It included interviews with the people that developed these products and information on the science behind processed food. The book is highly readable, and I found it extremely interesting.<br /><br />The overall focus of the three main sections was sugar, fat, and salt. Within each section, we learned about studies done on how these ingredients effect us, on what forms we most enjoy consuming, on consumption patterns (what is our \\"bliss point\\" for sugar, and do we consume more fat if the food doesn't look fatty), and on how this has effect the nation's health. We learned how various products were first developed and the marketing strategies that lead to the success of instant pudding, processed cheese, Coca-Cola, Kool-Aid, Lunchables, and many other convenience foods.<br /><br />I thought I was a good food label reader, but I learned that some healthy-sounding ingredients actually aren't--they're simply used to trick health-conscious consumers into buying their product. I learned that the food companies will slowly change the ingredients in a product without telling people, so you need to read the labels of foods that you buy regularly.<br /><br />There's a lot of useful and enlightening information in this book, and I'd highly recommend it.<br /><br />I received this as an egalley review copy from the publisher through NetGalley.
0545265355|5.0|Daughter really enjoyed these books. It came fast and in good shape.  Thanks, and we will definetly buy more from there.
B00BS4PF0C|3.0|its a okay album, just not the kind youre going to listen to all the tracks. His greatest hits is a better buy.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I received this item very quickly.  It was a great procduct with a great price and it is great music
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A well written, engaging novella with a heroine that you will love. Left me wanting more.  Brandon never fails to deliver!
B005M5OSBK|3.0|I do not believe that the discs are mixed appropriately.  The volume on the music is too loud and the voices are overpowered.
B008EKON56|2.0|I ordered this to improve the audio quality of my iPad while feeding an external headphone amplifier. I hooked it up and noted a distortion on the left channel, even with the USB cord unplugged. Switching the same cord back to the headphone jack eliminated the distortion, and I've also found that a [[ASIN:B003UCESP8 FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] does does not display the distortion with the same exact amplifier setup. The distortion is only audible on relatively quiet pieces of music (like piano solos) so most users might not ever notice. I ordered a replacement, which did the same thing, both fulfilled by Amazon. I verified both authenticity codes at FiiO's website to ensure I wasn't getting counterfit gooods.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is a fast paced game.  Makes waiting in line fun!  I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a distraction.
B008NNNF7G|2.0|i really like the other albums, but this one is not very good. Not really any outstanding tracks. Definetely sample tracks before you buy.
B000002GY9|5.0|This was a great CD at a great price.  this was purchased as a gift and it arrived  very quickly.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A great sequel and a must read for fans of Fifty Shades of Grey. Can't wait to read the next installment
B0024O0VVS|1.0|The DVD is of no value to me as I don't speak Italian or Spanish and cannot translate the spoken words or the subtitles
B002SRQ214|3.0|Tried it in three different machines, all with stated compatibility and it gave bios errors each time. I'm sure it was just a single defective unit and when I have time I'll get back around to ordering another one and give it another go.
0394806220|5.0|The book is exactly what the seller stated - brand new.  I just wish I looked at the details (I got so excited when I saw it I just instantly bought it) - I was looking for the type of book with all cardboard pages.  Regardless, very happy with what I received!  I got exactly what the seller said I would and it arrived on my doorstep quickly!
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Cant go wrong with this album if you like new country. Almost all the tracks are great. Interesting take on stay track.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was going to find a series for less than 60 dollars it is really awesome series that does not have the original music
B004FN1T3A|3.0|I thought this book was informative but I wish there were more details . I will reread again and highlight more notes
B0058YZITQ|5.0|My son loves this running shoe.  Looks great with shorts and jeans and fits his feet very well.  They did not need to be broken in.  We would definitely recommend.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Great movie based on real life events.  Could have placed a bit more emphasis on Canadian's role in the rescue.
B0015AARJI|5.0|If you buy or have a PS3, this is the controller to have.<br />Good battery life, its form is solid and a good fit in the hand.
B0013UZHS6|5.0|Legos, not duplos.  Says so on the box.  Why would they give a bad review because they are too ignorant to read?
B003BLPTB0|2.0|I was given this pair of Crocs 3 days ago. Loved them initially. And then yesterday while out walking the right strap rivet broke! It was either defective or just poorly engineered. So I went online a bit ago and did the \\"chat\\" thing. I asked if I could buy a few of the rivets to repair the shoe and have one or more on hand as this is likely to happen again. I was told \\"No\\" they don't sell the rivets!!!!<br /><br />As a sidebar, a little web searching revels you can repair these for under a $1 with \\"chicage bolts\\" and a washer.<br /><br />Sorry Crocs....... never again. You've got companies that stand behind their product out there as competition.<br />\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids got me into this game. I find it very enjoyable to play. When I need to relax I start ups game and play.
B00000F214|5.0|Excellent ending....can see why it is his favorite. Excellent plot and worth viewing several times to catch it all. Great for your library.
B00005YW4H|5.0|One of the finest albums in my collection-bar none!She has a style and a sound that is truly unique and has performed world wide with some of music's best!
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Zero stars.  Negative 100 stars.  The worst movie I can ever recall seeing.  No tunes for the most part, just rambling toneless chants with an incoherent instrumental background.  Two hours of extreme closeups looking into the actors' nostrils.  I like musicals.  I even like opera occasionally.  Could not finish this.  Couldn't even fall asleep.  Simply horrid. Did I mention that it's really BAD?  You won't need popcorn but you will need Pepto and aspirin.  Can't understand how anybody likes it.  I must be in an entirely different universe.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I heard a few downloaded tracks and I have to say it is the best CD I have heard in a long time. Great comeback! The lead singer can deliver. Wonderful voice. You must get it. I WILL for sure
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Kinda boring, not very challenging. Would be ok for smaller children. Other than that, not much else to say about it.
B006TSTK4Y|1.0|Now I know where Justin Bieber (or however you spell his name) got the disgusting habit of grabbing his crotch.  If I could have just listened to the music I  might have been ok, but instead, I burned it so no one else would be influenced by such garbage
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Like his song writing plus his abilities as a guitarist.  Finally he is a good family man so far.  Like him on American Idol.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I am obsessed with the movie and couldn't wait to get this soundtrack. I listen to it all the time but do wish more of the songs were on it, like &#34;Who Am I?&#34; and &#34;Do You Hear The People Sing?&#34; Still, great soundtrack and great movie!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first - which I completely loved.  The book has the same feel as the movie although the story is a little different.  Would highly recommend both the book and the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really enjoy this game. the only thing I don't like is the ploy for cash! wish there were other options as far as having to pay out of pocket.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Hard for me to get into the book will try after I watch the movie which I have recently purchased
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was awesome. That ending really got me. I was shocked! At first I thought it would be just any other romance novel, but the ending was a really good twist.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|The 3D work they did on this is every bit as good as what was done for Titanic 3D. It is surprising how much more immersive the aerial scenes are and in general the 3D effect is subtle but effective. The 6.1 MA soundtrack was also very well done.<br /><br />Top Gun has always been a fun film and the 3D remastering only adds to the fun.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Amazing, couldn't stop reading greatest book I've ever read, high intensity of action Ernest cline has mad heaven in a book for gamers , loved it
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I think this album will be one of the best,it has great songs, great music, great band, DEPECHE MODE forever!!!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|this album takes you trough a magical mental adventure that plays with all your senses its great. if you do not have it get it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the calculator plus for free. Never any need to go looking for one, I just use this on my Kindle, when I need one.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|DVD is playing fine, but when I opened it; the DVD had  been handled with visible smudges and bottom up in case. It was advertised as new.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really liked this game. I was lazy and only did casual mode so it was a little easy. I really liked the concept and story. Very imaginative. My only complaint was the voice of the detective. I know &hellip;petty but she was so dramatic but in a librarian way. Anyway I would definitely recommend this for those who aren't too serious about their game playing.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|Cute movie that brings new kids into the video game world and reminds us &#34;old kids&#34; about our days of Atari and Nintendo. Just love it so much.
0143116738|5.0|Ken Robinson makes the compelling case how \\"finding the element in yourself is essential to discovering what you can really do and who you really are.\\"  Ken uses personal stories of many famous people - usually highly creative types - who did not do well in school, but succeeded spectacularly on their own when they were given more freedom to follow their passion or \\"find their element.\\"  In addition, he tells how important it is to \\"find your tribe\\" when finding the element.<br /><br />Ken also makes some pointed criticisms on how the current school systems stifle creativity and unlike many educational reformers gives ideas on how the education system be \\"transformed\\" (hint: he does not bash teachers).  The Element is relatively fun to read due to the anecdotes and inspirational when talking about honoring an individual's talent and changing the face of education.
0316212261|5.0|This is a great series. I love the Victorian setting and her incorporation of supernaturals into London society.  I love that vampires are responsible for those Victorian fashions and manners and werewolves are responsible for the Empire's expansion and militarism.  I especially love Victorian &#34;Science&#34;, especially the ornithopter!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and wish I didn't have to work. I could stay at home and do all the things I pin. Or at least more of them!
1590171993|5.0|I began this book reluctantly, unsure of the premise and whether the novel would speak to me.  But within pages, I was gripped by this tale of an ordinary, rather unremarkable man.  John Williams delivers a novel that is straightforward and prosaic, yet somehow beautiful.<br /><br />John Williams begins the novel by describing William Stoner as a man whose colleagues \\"held him in no particular esteem\\" and one whose students failed to \\"remember him with any sharpness.\\"  Born of poor Missouri farmers, Stoner is sent to the University of Missouri to study agricultural science but becomes captivated by English literature.  At the urging of a professor, he seeks and achieves his Ph.D. in English.  A shy, inhibited man, Stoner makes few friends and earns no more than cursory recognition in his career.  His initial captivation with his young wife soon fades, as he realizes that she is cold and indifferent to his advances.  Stoner's life soon becomes a dreary trudge through university obligations, steady work toward his writing goals, awkward attempts to connect with his wife and child, and one brief, passionate affair.<br /><br />Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the undistinguished life of the protagonist, this novel is gripping.  Most of us will never influence those beyond our own small spheres of family and work, yet we live quiet, determined.  Stoner is a fascinating protagonist because he is such a dull, unremarkable man.  John Williams makes his ordinary life come alive, with all of its (minor) successes and (often large) failures.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this novel.  It is unlike anything I have read before.  I was unsure whether I would like it based on the jacket descriptions, but I'm glad I took a chance on Stoner.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I was just the right amount of everything. Not too Creepy. Not so challenging as to be frustrating. Excellent graphics even when you zoom and a creative story line. I hope to find more like this one!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a classic. Glad I can watch it anywhere I want and at any time I want. First move downloaded to my Kindle.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I was totally blown away by this movie, the story line was superbly written with the perfect actor to play the Pi's. The cinematography was absolutely incredible- I felt completely captured by it's splendor. 5 stars!!
B008PUXMP2|5.0|This CD is amazing. I was never really an Amy Winehouse fan based on what I saw in the media until, I bought her music...Wow, what a talent!! As a result, I now own everything she's done. This CD is fantastic and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy blues and pop. Most important you'll understand while listening to her lyrics the pain she must have been feeling all along. A star who clearly fell far too soon.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Don't listen to the haters. I'm a college educated middle class woman in her 30's but I found this book to be excellent and relateable. In fact Sheryl has inspired me to not sell myself short. Check out the references in the back of the book they are also very informative.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It's one of my favorite shows right now. I can't wait to buy the whole dvd collection. It's very addictive.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I have watched nearly all the movies already. Great picture and sound quality. Would reccommend to anyone. Great movies with good packaging.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I really wish it were possible to get a refund on a digital product such as this one. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I watched and waited for something, anything interesting to happen. It didn't. The movie consists of a tiresome series of brief, insubstantial, disconnected, and uninteresting dramatic moments. There is no plot and almost no humor. The movie doesn't quite qualify as a drama, and certainly is not a comedy.<br /><br />I rarely leave reviews, but this time I felt totally ripped-off. The actors in this movie are really pretty good actors, but the script with which they had to work is horrible.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this one.
B0090SI44M|5.0|Blu-ray is crisp and clear.  Lets the Grandkids stand 3 feet from the screen and watch. (Until Grandma see's them)
B0074MZSWW|5.0|The more I listen to this CD, the more I enjoy it. If you enjoy listening to the blues, this is a must have to your collection. The singers voice is amazing and her lyrics are incredible. Buy it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great, fast read.  Entertaining, funny, and eye opening.  Really made me think of mental health issues differently and what you see isn't always what you get.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Bought this with several other DVDs for my daughter's DVD collection and it's a cute movie. I bought it because it was cheap to be honest.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My friend told me to buy this, and it is so good! You make or buy a dragon and you can get neighbors to be  your friend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You'll fall in love with the characters - it's the kind of book that will enchant you. By the end, you'll feel as if you're saying goodbye to new friends.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great page turner, love the twists and complex plot - although the ending is very frustrating! Would recommend to others.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Litterally, a sleeper, I fell asleep throughout the movie and I tried watching it twice.  Good acting, but drink a lot of coffee before you settle in to watch it.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I just cant get enough of this series. the acting, the dialogue, excellent entertainment. i have a love for the genre. there are a few series in this genre but, this one keeps me watching for hours.
B00866JL96|4.0|realistic good story.I liked it so much I invited some friends over and we all cried at the end. Hits close to home for most of us.
B008YI91HS|5.0|It's a great way to get students and young children interested in the concept of genetic engineering. As modern science moves towards great genetic achievements, it is absolutely critical that students have some understanding of DNA. Although pure Hollywood fiction, it is still a great movie
0399226907|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my great granddaughter and she loves it.  Good pictures and easy to understand text.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book talks to each reader individually. Whatever place you are in your life, this book will reach out to you. This is a very interesting, very unique book.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|The is a perfect movie for the whole family! My kids love it, and I enjoy it too!! We received this right on time!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the way the series is as mirror image for that time period as possible. the acting/actors are very convincing and knowledgeable of their places in their roles.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Unlike the default fb that comes with a kindle fire this opens up an actual app.  Others have complained about their being messed up or gone ruined?  I had no such issues with anything.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|The first time I read these books were in college. Now as an adult I have purchased again to reread. Anne uses a combination of literary creative genious and historical research to make these novels dark and compelling. She draws you into the vampire world and keeps you wanting more. Her detail and imagery is like no, other. My next conquest will be her erotica series. I am looking forward to the surprises.
0920668372|5.0|This was a gift for one of my twin great granddaughters.  They enjoy reading good books that are well illustrated.  This one fits that description just fine.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Kept me entertained and interested. I'm a fan of his work. I recommend it to historical fiction lovers, who also enjoy mild thrillers.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I'm a retired math teacher and this game/program is an excellent simulation of equation balancing without letting on that you are actually balancing equations and learning a significant element of algebra.  One style of teaching math is called discovery learning and DragonBox does that in spades.  I would highly recommend this program to parents with children (or in my case, grandchildren) who want to extend typical rote level learning to true understanding.  Interestingly, I know a number of adults with little or no interest in math who also find the program thought provoking and even entertaining.
0132350882|5.0|My friends and I debated for days after each reading this book. Was an amazing convo starter. It got us all commenting better and creating easier understandable/editable code.
0345525558|5.0|This appealed to my sense of history and gardening.<br />The foster care issues visited show how poorly we serve our children.

1451696205|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It also happens to be a GREAT book.  A lot of people have seen the movie, but the book is a must!
0525953728|5.0|I recently heard that this book, \\"No Easy Day:  The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden\\" by Mark Owen (not his real name), is the most accurate of the reports out there about the mission to capture or kill Bin Laden, and there are at least a few different versions of it that I've seen on the news.  The training that the Navy SEALS go through to prepare them for a dangerous and secretive career and then the missions like this one that they carry out indeed makes for no easy days.<br /><br />The things that I liked most about this book are the stories of missions that show the dedication that these men have to their country and to each other.  It is always uppermost in their minds to protect team members and to do what they have been called to do.  The SEALS practiced for weeks before they got word from the White House that the mission to go for Bin Laden was approved.  A replica of bin Laden's compound was built where they practiced, and they used that to get the helicopters' landing places right and then the entry into the house itself.  Only the exterior of the compound was known, but nothing was known about the interior arrangement.<br /><br />When they went into the bin Laden house, they had to be extremely quiet and careful, but they knew through intelligence pretty well who was in the house.  Osama bin Laden's house was three storeys high, and different people lived on each level, so the team had to clear each floor before they got to the third level where bin Laden lived.<br /><br />There were two or three things that disturbed me while reading \\"No Easy Day.\\"  At first the plan was discussed to bomb the bin Laden compound, and the government thought that there were about a dozen children in the house plus their mothers.  There were other homes on the same street in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and other people could have been outside or nearby. The idea of \\"collateral damage\\" has never sat well with me, especially with drones in a sovereign country. Osama was killed in front of several of his children and two of his five wives, but I understand why the team had to kill him when they did.  It was either shoot then or risk being shot, because they didn't know if bin Laden was armed since he had just stuck his head out of the bedroom doorway and was shot at that point.  The women and children were taken on a balcony to calm down and to be removed from a gruesome scene.  Earlier in the book, the team was told that the government and CIA preferred that bin Laden be captured rather than killed, but no more was said about that.  He was just killed at first sight of him.  Bombing might have ruined any chance of collecting DNA evidence.<br /><br />I found the book to be very interesting and informative about the Navy SEALS and general facts about their missions and how they carry them out.  So much of what they do is classified that the information in the book is really just a sketch.  The book goes very fast and reads like a novel at times because of the tension and suspense as this mission is described and the book is well-written.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers who like military history.
B001NLKT60|4.0|More of a part one with the third book being part two of this one. Very entertaining and.  Good fast read.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|I down loaded. This is much better than streaming. The sound was great. The series is fast moving and superior type of hero.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did keep wanting to read right until the end. This book definitely captures the reader and is so well written that every character has an important and recurring role. I didn't enjoy the ending that much but that didn't change my rating. A definite page turner and well written storyline.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is the most important thing that you will ever have in your life. This app for the Bible really helps you keep track of where you are.

This app is tops blooby!!!!!

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Battery changes on the MM drove me nuts! This thing so far has been awesome; sits there and charges - green LED makes me feel good - always works when I turn it on... the cover goes on and it's a little tight, but with a little love it snaps into place and doesn't feel flimsy at all (it's a plastic battery housing).
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've only had this watch for two days, but I'm in love.  This is one of the cheapest automatic watches you can buy.  Needless to say, I wasn't expecting great accuracy - Was expecting 1 or two minutes per day loss.  What I got was less than 15 seconds per day, straight out of the box.  The black band is a bit thicker than I was hoping, but thats not a problem, I have a NATO style strap coming in the mail to replace it.  The entire watch screams a higher price range than what it actually cost.  I was considering purchasing a similar styled (face, larger size) LACO type B - I may have to not purchase that since this watch more than scratches the itch I had.<br /><br />Pro:  Cheap automatic, high quality, looks great, small watch for small wrists, lume is bright, 5 ticks a sec is sexy!<br /><br />Con: not as accurate as higher priced automatics, watch band is a bit stiff, setting date/day is a bit unintuitive but after a few tries you'll get it - read the instructions.  no really.  read it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose the reading because I figured I'd like to see the movie so why not read before.  I had heard that I wasn't a very good read but I loved it. The steamy moments got a little bit to much to handle at some points but E.L James did a good job at not losing the plot. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Not since the first UNDERWORLD has Kate kicked behind more eloquently and more thoroughly. Sure, we all wish it were longer and they dropped that sorry old &#34;Michael&#34; obsession - but who cares when there's Kate as a super vamp! Awesome action sequences and a cute (but scary) girl hybrid to boot. Nice to see vets Rea and Dance happily chew the scenery (literally). There may not be another one, but the gorgeous Miss Beckinsale does not disappoint, showing she is still the queen of female action heroines in cinema!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Wonderful 'who done it', well written with exceptional performances from the entire cast.  Smart and clever, the clues actually make sense.  You can believe an investigator with Sherlock's skill could really solve these mysteries.  No cheap tricks - zooming in on the clues that only Sherlock can see - or silly red herrings.<br /><br />Sherlock is a multi-dimensional and unique. His genius takes center stage and he can be abrupt and arrogant, but they have gone against TV stereotype of the genius jerk and given Sherlock a heart.  He is fascinated by the puzzle, but shows real compassion for the victims.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this app is easy to use, fun to play, stimulating and challenging, as well as presenting great graphics and soundtrack for the person playing it.  great game . . .

B009AMANBA|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" seems to be a slow start but rapidly picks up momentum of a man trying to end the bloodshed of a Civil War and add a 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution before the South surrenders and is readmitted to the Union. Does President Lincoln negotiate their surrender now, saving countless lives, but also guaranteeing that a represented South will surely kill any chances of the passage of the amendment, an amendment that abolishes slavery? What President Abraham Lincoln doesn't know is that he is in a race against time because this film takes place in the last few months of his life.<br /><br />In order to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, the president must get the votes. We witness horse-trading, deceit and intrigues at its finest or ugliest, to get the two thirds majority required for the next step in the process.<br /><br />Daniel-Day Louis is in the title role and wins an Oscar for his performance. He offers us the same high voice that Abraham Lincoln was reported to have. He frequently reverts to his folksy charm during serious or heated discussions with a story or anecdote. He is an adoring father to both his sons, but especially the younger Tad who in real life had a cleft palate that was so bad his food had to be specially prepared so he could chew it.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg gave us many more superb performances from Sally Field as the bi-polar Mary Todd Lincoln, the 16th president's wife. Often seen but still under-rated David Strathairn plays his politically-savvy Secretary of State William Seward. Bruce McGill plays Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, and has one of the most memorable lines in the film: \\"No, you, you're not going to tell another story,\\" as he stalks off out of earshot of a Lincoln yarn. This ensemble cast continued with Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a staunch abolitionist from Pennsylvania. Hal Holbrook plays a Republican politico who tries to end the war.<br /><br />What you get from Steven Spielberg's direction is attention to detail, right down to the White House wallpaper. You also get extra, perhaps too much extra. Critics say that the film's ending would have been better if we just saw Lincoln walking down the hall, on his way to Ford's Theater. If that had been it, we wouldn't have seen Todd Lincoln scream when a man announces to the audience that the president was shot. The final scene of revisiting Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address added little to the film.<br /><br />Still, you get the two most important events that make a great story, a taut, intelligent script delivered by unparalleled acting.<br /><br />P.S. This movie is history which always drives me to find more, and my focus was on Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones' character), representative from Pennsylvania.  He was living with his black housekeeper for a number of years. He adopted her sons, and offered her a choice of $5,000 in one lump sum, or $500 a year for ten years in his Will. When he died his body was placed in the Capitol Rotunda where he had a black honor guard. 40,000 mourners came to pay their respects; 20,000 were black. He chose to be buried in a cemetery that would not discriminate against the souls buried there.m Steven Spielberg's direction is attention to detail, right down to the White House wallpaper.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I first became acquainted with Cain via TED talks and an article she wrote on this topic.  I like that the book is a measured evaluation of what it means to be an introvert in today's world.  As an introvert I found it vindicating in many ways.  I have passed it on to my extrovert friends and colleagues.  While not perfect, the book presents the information in an accessible manner and the arguments are supported by excellent research.  It also drove me to consider different methods of getting my students to more fully participate in classroom discussions - taking into account that they may also be introverted.  A colleague who read the book said it made him realize that the more quiet students aren't necessarily quiet because they have nothing to contribute.  It's a good book for teachers to read before stepping into the classroom - whether K-12 or university.

B0038ZITHK|4.0|This is a very unappreciated film that I have always enjoyed myself. As a film, I would give it 4.5 stars.  That said, I do not provided summaries of plots and acting opinions which have been written by so many others here so I will avoid being redundant.  This will just be a short review of the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The video transfer is really quite good with strong details in the darker scenes and a very realistic color grading.  Color resolution is spot on.  There is a softer focus and, as a result ,there is a touch of film grain throughout, but nothing that is in any way disturbing or distracting.  I do have this film on Standard Def and, in comparison, there is a bit more contrast.  The Mbps rate ranges from the mid twenties to the mid thirties which cleans up the imaging.  At no point did I notice any aliasing or artifacts in the film so, in my opinion, the transfer to Blu Ray is a pretty decent one. 4 stars for the video<br /><br />The audio is a lossless DTS MA 5.1 and while clear and transparent to the ear, nicely balanced volumes so no roller coasting of your remote is necessary, the audio does disappoint.  While most films rely on their center channel for almost all dialogue, this film does provide for many scenes where your surround system could and should be utilized with pans, foley effects for front and rear channels and some sub work.  The audio transfer fails on that account as there is almost no use of any of the system other than the center channel.  There is some ambience audio from the front left and right sound stage and a nice spread of the soundtrack on the front stage, but the levels are so low as to be almost non existent and, even then, no discreet channeling.  The volume of the music track,however, was just fine.  I noticed in someone else's review that they experienced an audio synching issue.  I cannot confirm that as all the audio seemed perfectly synched to me.  Never the less, I was disappointed by the lack of serious audio editing that could have been a part of this transfer. 2.5 stars for the audio.<br /><br />If you do not have Carlito's Way on disc, certainly the Blu Ray is the one to get.  However, should you already have it in Standard Definition, I do not believe that you will see a night and day difference. Yes, the Blu Ray is an improvement but is not an epiphany of video and audio discovery.  Then again, for the current inexpensive price, you might want to jump at adding it to your collection.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so hope they can assist you as well.<br />I do hope this brief review of the Blu Ray's transfer of 'Carlito's Way' has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thanksinted by the lack of serious audio editing that could have been a part of this transfer. 2.5 stars for the audio.<br /><br />If you do not have Carlito's Way on disc, certainly the Blu Ray is the one to get.

B009AMANBA|5.0|This is NOT a documentary.  It is a dramatic movie based on Lincoln.  There are many nay-sayers griping because it isn't 100% accurate.  Don't be dissuaded and enjoy it for what it is.  I was captivated.  The emotion, argument, and strong points of view between the politicians hasn't changed much in all of these years.  I found it to be a very powerful story.  There are some that complained because it was 'dark'.  Well--yes.  It wasn't Mary Poppins but really isn't that a silly critique?  It is a long movie which is why I rented it.  I have Roku and Amazon Prime and had absolutely no issues with the quality.
