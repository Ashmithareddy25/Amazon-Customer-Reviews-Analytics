0060872675|5.0|this is a wonderful turn of a children's story into adult mischief. Should appeal to those children who know more then might make them comfortable and will appreciate an opportunity for an adult reader to share that unique perspective.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is great but it is not as good as the book.  It is missing a lot if the details found in the book.

B0010OIN90|5.0|I was very happy to find this item which is  a Christmas gift my 6 year old grandson who is quite a lover ( and talented builder) of Lego. Blocks.  Did show the watch to my son (his father) who checked it out and we both believe this is going to be a much liked Christmas gift.  This past summer he did learn how to tell time on a watch and am certain he is going to like this very much.  Thank you also for your care and rapidly sending me this item.

0765325950|5.0|It was a phenomenally great book, from my favorite author, in my favorite series, in my favorite genre which leaves me tickled pink.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I really liked this movie, but you really need to concentrate because it is all over the place.  The story involves going back and forth with the characters, and with the different times that each story takes place in.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have to agree with all the other reviews that the 3rd book sucks. It's all over the place. All Sylvia Day had to do was write about Gideon & Eva...that's all!  I don't care about Megumi, that stupid reporter Deanna, the whole Russian connection to Nathan's story, Eva's Mom and Dad gettin' down or even Eva's boss. WE DON'T CARE!!! However, it's OK to leave Brett & Corrine because they do spice things up and give Gideon & Eva a reason to fight and make up. But don't string me along with all these other possible twists because all that means is book #4 will be even more fluff building me up for book #5 which really, SHOULD HAVE BEEN BOOK #3!!!!!<br />I'm sick of Cary too.  He's turning out to be boring and immature and I'd like to meet that model girlfriend of his in a back alley and open a can of whoop a$$ on her.<br /><br />I actually don't mind that Sylvia Day is extending to 5 books because I LOOOOOVE reading about Gideon & Eva.  (I think EL James was a FOOL for shutting down 50 Shades so early and leaving all that money on the table.) I don't care about a bracelet, Russians, the red head at the last charity event,etc. Focus on tightening up G & E's story.  And for god's sake please DO NOT end the series with a pregnancy!!!! Can you promise me that???? Please try to be more orignial!!! UUUGGGHHHH I am so sick of that. Leave the babies out of my fantasies...PLEASE!!!!!

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|It is difficult to believe that this recording was made in 1982, over thirty years ago, and it still remains one of the most cherished versions of Richard Strauss' inimitable `Vier letzte Lieder' as sung by the incomparable Jessye Norman with the warmly supportive Kurt Masur conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Leipzig.<br /><br />What makes this so perfect is Norman's luminous vocal production, her seemingly endless phrasing, and her ability to both soar above the orchestra and at other moments dissolve in the whisper of the orchestra. She brings out the poetry as if it were the first time we have heard it and allows us to feel both the passion and the sense of ending that the music conveys.<br /><br />But though many will purchase (or own) this recording for the Four Last Songs (perhaps remembering the sense of sadness as they were used in the film version of `The Hours'), but that is not to say that Norman is as exquisite in the other Orchesterlieder.<br /><br />The Four Last Songs are placed first in this recital: Fr&uuml;hling, September, Beim Schlafengehen , and Im Abendrot . But then the songs with orchestra follow:<br /><br />Caecilie<br />Morgen<br />Wiegenlied<br />Ruhe, meine Seele<br />Meinem Kinde<br />Zueignung<br /><br />Jessye Norman lifts us up to her level and then leaves us there, the richer for having experienced her way with Strauss. Grady Harp, June 13

B007HUD6OS|5.0|Each book in this series gets better and better I started it the car on a trip for my Grandson and liked it so much I've read all! He's only read the first one so he's got some catching up to do this summer when he comes to visit.

He doesn't so much write as weave the story, creating a tapestry of words.  At the end, I wept.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Very funny show.  Very light story line that keeps it interesting and addicting, but each episode is funny all on its own as well.

B005PK1G76|5.0|We bought this for our Joovy stroller and it has worked great so far!  I really like the adjustable velcro straps because you can change how high or low the organizer sits on the handlebars.  We have found they are quite sturdy as well, supporting two 32 oz water bottles.  The material feels very durable and strong.  Great purchase, especially for the Joovy Caboose.

0060512806|3.0|I am taking this book down after 360 pages or so. Yes, the writing is very smart, Stephenson seems to be a true genious and the book is full of interestinf geeky details. However, it's relatively dense and after reading 1/3 of the book, it doesn't yet seem to be clear where it is going. Three stories are running in paralell, but there's no punch, no suspense, no... nothing.<br /><br />I might take it back later. But life's too short. I can't spend another month trying to read this endless story.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because it's a very smart book. But read it only if you have patience (or time!).
B003L77G06|5.0|This show has brilliant writing & spot on comedic acting. I could watch this show all day. Oh wait, I did!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|This game is very cool and easy to get a hang of but the only thing I don't like is that it takes up a lot of memory on my Kindle. Other than that it's a cool game. I recommend it to all those Spiderman fans:)
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Who doesn't love Toy Story? Granted, I think the first one beats the second and third. The second one is better than the third as well. It's definitely a fun movie for boys and girls alike. So grab some popcorn and have a family night with your children. I know they would appreciate it :)
B002KS1IJC|3.0|Weak on story line but mildly fun to watch. I was surprised by the lack of quality effects. I give it an ok
B009NY43NY|2.0|I started this series before Trueblood started on HBO (which I'm unsure if I like the direction the show us going), and I am left with a mix of feelings. I do like how it seems Sookie is finally happy with someone who won't use her for ulterior motives. I am sad that her and Eric ended their relationship without really talking about it before he just left. I guess overall my curiosity with the characters is still wanting it tied up better.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting first part until one finds out where the story is really going. Very fast paced from then on, makes you root for the main man
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Mulan is a great example to little girls as to working hard for something and always putting family first and helping when help is needed.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Les Miz is my favorite musical of all time and this version is absolutely riveting. Incredible to see it come to life in movie form. Hugh Jackman was a brilliant Jean Valjean, and I will even forgive his ever so slightly strained delivery of \\"Bring Him Home\\" simply because it is such a difficult song to pull off and because he did so well on all the others, particularly \\"Suddenly\\" which made my heart sigh. I wasnt happy at first to learn they had added a song that was not part of the original score, but it turned out to be a new favorite. Other highlights: Anne Hathaway's heart wrenching \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" Enjolras, Cosette, Gavroche, Eponine. Some minuses: Russell Crowe wasnt a bad Javert but he wasnt great. I wasnt nuts about Eddie Redmayne as Marius. And I took off one star for changing the Marius/Eponine storyline. That was disappointing. Didnt care for Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Thenardier either or the way they shortened/changed some of the songs, especially the most poignant lines of \\"A Little Fall of Rain.\\" Back to the good though, casting Colm Wilkinson as the bishop was sheer poetry. Four stars for this absorbing masterpiece.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I felt like the book sacrificed storyline for a quick wrap up for all the characters. Sookie moved on from Eric like he had been a one-night stand.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|I found the book very informative.  It was an excellent corrective to the generally written histories (such as Tuchman's Guns of August).  The truth appears to be that WW I had a full array of culprits from nearly every country involved.  Certainly the old story of German or Austria Hungary as the primary culprit is set aside in this more complete discussion -- Russia, Serbia, France, the UK and Italy all have roles here.<br /><br />One weakness in the book is that because of the multiple players (countries and individuals within countries) the reading can get a bit complicated.  This problem is added to by the author's inclination to move back and forth in time -- sometimes within the same paragraph -- so it can be a bit confusing keeping a time line in one's mind.<br /><br />Also, this work is heavily footnoted -- the final 30% (on a Kindle) is footnotes.
0756666937|5.0|It's informative and interesting. The child we bought the book for absolutely loves it. I apologize I cannot give more of a detailed review but I am not even close to being a Lego fan
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love post apocalypse type stories. What sets Hugh apart is his ability to gradually unvail the story with relevant teasers to hold your suspense.  I particularly love how the chapters alternate between scenes so you're always wanting more.  I've just ordered the prequal to learn how things got to this point in the first place.  Highly recommended!  I read this instead of watching TV at night.. Thanks Hugh!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is a great album.  I think anyone who likes Van Morrison will like this one and consider it more typical of his usual style.  Lots of great songs and a lot of variation, but this is the Van Morrison we grew up on.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A taste of \\"Dandelion Wine\\", some intrigue stolen from Dan Brown, mysticism snatched from \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\", and Austen romanticism all wrapped up together. A fine read.

B009K6DKTS|4.0|I his last book of the trilogy, Mr Taleb highlights the deadly risks associated to the illusion of &#34;safe jobs and safe decisions&#34;, in opposition to those free individuals who makes the daily uncertainty a source of energy and not a risk to be avoided.<br /><br />In a world dominated by increasing regulations and interconnectivity, the unpredicatble risks rise everyday: hence the need of antifragile behaviour to life.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game was well made and reminds me of a facebook game titled Dragon City. The only difference is that this game had more thought put into it. Exhibit A: In the tutorial for this game it tells you to use gems, but unlike Dragon City it gives you the gems whereas Dragon City makes you use your gems.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Awesome CD. Crank it up, I did. The performances are fantastic. The music is great. You won't go wrong purchasing this CD.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This is a great country rock album starting with the Foo Fighters on track 1 and leaning more to the country side after that with Keith Urban, Zac Brown Band and Brad Paisley to name just three. The reworked Credence songs are done well, there are two new songs and the solo songs were new to me as Revival is the only solo CD of his I own. Overall it one of the best 2013 albums I have bought this year.

B0040I09RM|3.0|Parts were pretty gory..Over all deceit movie.  younger people would probable enjoy it.  Not really for me. probably an age thing.
030758836X|4.0|I finished reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn two days ago, and since have thought long and hard just how to rate this book. Here is the thing, I both LOVED and HATED this book. This was the first Gillian Flynn novel I'd ever read, and if it is indicative of her work, I will read more, but with more caution. I thought I was picking up a crime thriller that would have me at the edge of my seat. What I got was a psychological thriller that, at times, had me at the edge of my sanity.<br /><br />When I read I like to identify with a character, I like to have at least one character I love and root for. If that is what you want, also, then beware of this book. Gone Girl is not told from a cop's point of view, as is usual with crime thrillers.  Instead it is told alternately by Amy and Nick Dunne, the wife that is missing and the husband accused of murdering her.  Every time I thought I had a handle on what was going on another curve ball was thrown at me.  There is no loveable character in this book.  Both of the main characters are damaged beyond repair, and we are taken deep into their warped and twisted minds.<br /><br />Flynn wrote these two,  each of their own strange perspectives, so well that there were times that I actually rooted for them, even knowing they were innately flawed beyond redemption.  That was another thing that bothered me.  There was no redemption for either of these characters.  Neither of them grew, came to an understanding of themselves and resolved to move beyond it.  No, their strange narcissistic co-dependence actually gets stronger.<br /><br />And all of those things I hate, are exactly what I loved.  Gillian Flynn delved so far into the human mind, into the truth that some damage can never be fixed, or even recognized by the inflicted.  There truly are functioning sociopaths like Amy and Nick Dunne out there, living their perfect looking lives, inflicting untold harm on each other, others, and the children they raise.  Flynn did such a good job at depicting this flawed marriage, that while reading I actually found myself, several times, analyzing my own marriage and wondering whether or not we treat each other the way Amy and Nick treat each other.  I actually feel a little traumatized after reading this book, and I wonder how Gillian Flynn was able to delve deep into these characters and come out sane.<br /><br />So, for the flawless writing, I would give Gone Girl 5 stars, but then I feel like I just have to knock one off for the mental anguish the ending made me suffer.  No one, and I do mean NO ONE, wins in the end.job at depicting this flawed marriage, that while reading I actually found myself, several times, analyzing my own marriage and wondering whether or not we treat each other the way Amy and Nick treat each other.

B00CBLQCO4|5.0|John Le Carre is the Charles Dickens of the espionage novel. Like Dickens once did, Le Carre exposes and intreprets contemporary society and transcends genre, He is a brilliant story teller whose work reads like literature. In the case of A Delicate Truth, he is whistle-blower, revealing the Orwellian conspiracies of New Labour and global (read American) security corporations. But beyond the 'behind the wall&#34; revelations, Le Carre writes in a style that appears so casual, yet masterfully switches time and place without pause or confusion. He reveals his class-conscious British characters as human, (mostly) likeable and understandable, his plotting is sure, and he leaves the reader with new insight -- with even the possibility of that one person can create change. Think Bradley Manning or Edward Snowdon.
B00BQHA06A|4.0|HIM's eigth studio album is, quite frankly, a very difficult album to review. Supposedly, HIM were going 'back to their roots' with album,  which is a very misleading statement when you compare it to the album itself. Be warned - if you're expecting Tears On Tape to bear some resemblance to their debut and best album, and Gothic Metal classic, Great Lovesongs Vol. 666, then you are going to be disappointed.<br /><br />If truth be told, the style of the album is quite similar to HIM's previous studio album, Screamworks, except with downtuned guitars leading the way with low riffs, which often sound too much like Venus Doom leftovers, replacing the Burton's diverse and interesting keyboard riffs and backings that really took albums like Darklight and Screamworks to another level musically. In fact, keyboards seem to be almost completely absent from half of the full-length tracks on the album, and the weakests tracks on the album (and weak tracks they are) - I Will Be The End Of You and Drawn & Quartered - sorely miss that little something to give them something even remotely memorable.<br /><br />That being said, this is by no means a bad album. It starts out very well, with Unleash The Red proving a haunting, eerie, an ultimately well-executed opening. Then the album opens properly with the excellent All Lips Go Blue, easily up there among HIM's greatest songs (and apparently Ville Valo's favourite from the album) and surely the one this album will primarily be remembered for. Love Without Tears is also a very good song, which wouldn't have sounded out of place on Razorblade Romance. However, from there on the album seems to take a step backwards. I Will Be The End Of You just sounds like a hastily-conceived B-side or filler track, and from that the album never fully recovers. Into The Night was all too obviously a song written to appease HIM's irritating, persistent 15-year old female fans who are hopelessly in love with Ville Valo. Songs such as Hearts At War, No Love, W.L.S.T.D., and the title track do enough, at varying degrees of success, to give the album some quality, but where Valo and co.  really missed an opportunity was with the cool, eerie instrumental interludes. The rest of the album simply doesn't build around them well enough.<br /><br />Ultimately, Tears On Tape is a pretty good album, but lacks the consistency and solidity of HIM's previous albums (except for the rubbish Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights). It starts out very well, but fades fast and never fully recovers. There are no real surprises here, and you get the impression that HIM need to take break and really think of something new to come up with for their eventual next album. There was potential, but it wasn't completely realized. Unlike Greatest Lovesongs and Venus Doom, not enough of the songs on Tears On Tape are good enough to make up for a relatively low number of songs (there are only nine full-length songs here).<br /><br />I'd say around 7/10 applies (Amazong SERIOUSLY need to employ half-stars in their rating system). Good, enjoyable, but not great and could have been better.<br /><br />Standout tracks - All Lips Go Blue; Love Without Tears; Unleash The Red

145210655X|5.0|Jeffrey Brown is an amazing author, he's a master of making the mundane seem interesting, and an amazing artist as well! His autobiographical stories will make you giggle, leave you uncomfortable, sad, happy, worried... He's a master of capturing emotion in the graphic novel format. I've had the pleasure of knowing the man, and I will say that he's as humble as his stories and good people all the way around.  And when the stories come from a good place, the output is always that much better! Enjoy this and all of his work!
B0068XQYN0|1.0|Save your money. I bought this collection because the free versions of Jane Austen's novels have typos and missing text but, lo and behold, the same errors are in this version. I only read \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" but it was missing all the text from the letters written between the characters that provide key information to the plot. I think there were maybe 4-5 letters in the novel and none of the letters are in this Kindle edition. I have a hardcover book of the novels as well as the audiobooks so I was able to fill in the missing pieces. The title of this Kindle book says \\"The Complete Novels of Jane Austen,\\" but this collection in far from complete. A major disappointment because the stories themselves are great.
0062515675|5.0|An easy reading book . It will give you the  guidance  you are looking for to achieve success . Before you star your journey in life  you need to have a predetermined goal. Once you  choose your goal you need a road map, that map is inside this book. Remember, same as in the business world, you can hire advisors that will advice you  how to succeed  making money, but they won't do it for you. Is for the business owner to choose the best advice, put it to work  and make it happen.<br /><br />This book is like those business advisors, the book will guide you but is up to you to implement and execute your plan.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I forgive the predictability of what is supposed to be a mystery/thriller because the characters are compelling and three dimensional, and the writing is really great. This lady can set a scene, and can introduce somebody in a manner that makes people and place familiar, but without boring the reader with endless, extraneous detail. She's a good editor I'm guessing.<br /><br />I'm slightly less impressed with the storytelling. When characters are so fully realized, I wish the story arc was more realistic, and the reveal less obvious. I'm sure virtually any reader of this genre will figure it out very early in the book. What kept me hooked is the people and the place, just like Gone Girl.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Great download quality however the content is predictable and boring. I would recommend trying something elese to waste a couple hours on.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|This is a well thought-out script that freshens up the Apes story nicely.  Good intentions meet greed, and the result is disaster.  Andy Serkis steals the show as Caesar.  This was a second viewing and I was not disappointed.

Feedly has a great user interface and has no problem getting the feeds I had and I can easily organized organizers and others. I would recommend this one as one of the best free RSS reader apps,if you need one.<br />The Feedly app via Amazon has color code feature for the categories which is a great way to organize your feeds.  Great app with good performance.
1781162646|4.0|I couldn't wait to get my hands on King's new novel. The subject matter as long with the cover really drew me into it. The book isn't bad but it flexshes out the character, Dev, a little too much & the crime is a minor back story. The book talks about the haunted funhouse but then goes into Dev's life into great detail for pages before talking about the crime. I enjoyed it but be fore warned, it's more about the life of this man with a little mystery thrown in.

B002FRNCG0|5.0|Brand New Eyes is a grown-up \\"Riot!\\". Every band member gives their most extraordinary effort -- Hayley's vocals are always bananas, but her lyrical content matches strength with strength. Zac Farro is so good he gets us sentimental over Travis Barker, Tre Cool, and Adrian Young. Josh Farro is as ingenious as any guitarist in the scene.<br /><br />Brand New Eyes was the final album with founders Josh and Zac Farro, Josh being credited as writer or composer in all songs. Tensions within the band were very high during the process of this album, from shows cancelled due to band meltdowns to Josh and Hayley briefly dating. The final product killed Paramore as we know it, but we got one of the most crucial albums in this young pop-punk-ska-emo genre.<br /><br />If you want your heart broken, watch the official video for \\"Careful\\".

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Stories of alcoholics and other addicts have been a fertile ground for melodrama in cinema for a long time. The success of a film that relies on the protagonist's addiction for its conflict rests on two key elements: the characterization of the addict and the believably of the accompanying melodrama. Flight succeeds brilliantly in the characterization of Whip Whitaker's struggle. Denzel Washington gives one of the best and most varied performances of his career, and the writers and director deserve tremendous credit for creating a complicated character that gave Washington so many opportunities to exercise his craft. Unfortunately, the characters surrounding Whitaker are barely drawn. An extremely talented supporting cast struggles to give them life, only Bruce Greenwood, playing Whitaker's old Navy buddy and union representative, manages to present a character with any depth. While this would usually be a large problem, this is Whitaker's story and Washington's presence in nearly every scene keeps the movie compelling. While ultimately falling short of delivering the definitive film on addiction, Washington and the writers may delivered the screen's most fully realized addict.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Addicting...great game to pass time with. One of my favorite games to play.  I like the different levels, some very challenging.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it grabbed me,  pulled me in, and held on to me for the entire ride.  It's the first book in several years that I did not want to put down. The colorful characters and swift pacing were spot on. The story was filled with such a great combination of elements that I fell in love with it. Hey, I lived the 80's, and the way Cline filled his story with recognizable references to that time period was stellar. Well written and FUN!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I play quite a bit.  I just wish I could conquer levels more quickly,  great game everyone should try it!

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Okay, so, how to begin - my previous mouse was a Razer Naga which started malfunctioning only after about a year of use. So I bought this mouse over any other gaming mouse because:<br /><br />Price - 40 bucks (that's what it's supposed to be, don't let Amazon fool you into thinking it's on sale) is great for a gaming mouse.<br />Buttons - plenty of them. The thumb buttons are easy to hit. There's a button, by default, that can change your DPI to a different setting based on your presets, which is great.<br />Customization - every single button on this thing can be reassigned. Even the left and right buttons. Also, you can change the color of the light inside the mouse - I love this, because I'm shallow. Also, adjustable weight - personally, I threw every weight into the mouse and it feels pretty good. While I'm on this - the program for customizing this mouse is easy to use and clean.<br /><br />Now onto what I don't like:<br /><br />Glossy plastic sides. I don't really know why they're there. Sure it looks nice, but they get dirty really easily.<br />The thumb buttons seem to jiggle a bit, like they don't quite fit snugly into the frame of the mouse.<br /><br />That's about it. It's a solid mouse. I miss my thumb grid, but the Anker mouse has enough buttons (that I can assign to anything I want) for my purposes.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So, I was bored with nothing to do, and decided I would buy this book to read. Now, I am SO HOOKED! Absolutely amazing! It is unlike anything I have ever previously read! You'll want to keep reading until you reach the absolute end of the last book of the series! I highly recommend it!

0757302661|3.0|While some of the principles are good and make logical sense, I would like her to site her sources of information. For instance, her history of childbirth, and also her anatomy and chemistry lessons. Sometimes she's too simplistic... and idealistic also. For someone going to go through labor for the first time, I want to know how it's really going to be, not how ideally it could go.
0763644765|5.0|My two year old loves the simple imagery and story in this book. We only read it a few times and he memorized it. It has given him the vocabulary to start communicating about using the potty. He really likes the parts where the dog and cat use their potties ( a tree and a litter box) and also the picture of the undies at the end.
0142427837|5.0|Each year 100 teenage boys compete in the Long Walk.  On May 1st the boys gather in northern Maine, and at precisely 9 o'clock AM they begin walking south.  There are only two rules to follow: 1) you must continue walking at all times at no less than 4 miles per hour, and 2) you may not interfere with other walkers.  The object of the competition is simply to be the last person still walking.  The winner gets anything he wants for the rest of his life, and will never have to worry about anything ever again.  The 99 losers will never have to worry about anything either, but for a very different reason.  If you break either of the two rules, you get a warning from one of the soldiers that accompany the walkers.  After your third warning, the soldiers pull out their rifles.  For 99 of the competing boys, this will be the last walk they ever take.<br /><br />The Long Walk is a pretty disturbing tale.  Imagine a society where teenagers would feel like they have nothing to lose by entering a competition like this.  Not so hard to imagine really since it is very much like the society we live in today.  Most disturbing of all are the spectators.  Hordes of people, everything from picnicking families to marching bands, line the road, watching, placing bets, cheering, hoping to see the soldiers pull out their rifles.  Again, not very different than the reality we live in.  Richard Bachman has exposed the darker side of humanity, upturning the rock to uncover the white, squirming reality beneath.  Pretty damned disturbing indeed.<br /><br />I've been a pretty big fan of Stephen King books for a long time now, but I have never really delved into his Bachman books.  I read one many years ago and didn't care for it, so I always stuck to the books King put his own name on.  I came across The Long Walk in Blackstone Audio's online catalog however, and it sounded like it was worth a try.  I'm glad I did, because I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br /><br />At the beginning of the audio recording, the narrator reads what you might call an essay written by Stephen King, titled The Importance of Being Bachman.  It was not written specifically for this book, but it's a fitting addition since it explains some of the reasons behind King's adoption of the Bachman persona.  In it, King says that Bachman has his own style, or his own voice if you will.  I found that to be true all those years ago when I read The Regulators, and that's why I never picked up another Bachman book until now.  As I listened to The Long Walk however, I was hard pressed to tell the difference.  It sounded like the same old Stephen King that I know and love.  I even noticed a couple of what I consider to be trademark King-isms.  The first was the blue chambray work shirt.  I don't know what King's deal with blue chambray work shirts is, but several of his novels include a character that wears one, including The Long Walk.  The other thing is a particular style of phrasing that King uses at certain times.  You or I might say something like, \\"They walked at 4 or 5 miles per hour,\\" but King always phrases it like, \\"They walked at 4 miles per hour, 5 at the most.\\"  I bet there's not a single Stephen King novel that doesn't have a phrase like that, and for me it's a dead giveaway.<br /><br />That's all just semantics though.  Apparently it doesn't matter whose name he puts on the book, it's probably worth a read.  I'll assume The Regulators was an aberration.  Incidentally, there are a few books with the name Stephen King on them that I don't like as well.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me a little in The Long Walk, was that Richard Bachman never really explained much about the world these boys live in.  Clearly it's very much like our own, but who came up with the idea of the Walk, and why is the army involved.  The author also never satisfied my curiosity about the mysterious Major who seems to be in charge of the whole thing.  People everywhere seemingly idolize him as somekind of hero, but by the end of the book he looks more like a sadistic psychopath.  Only to us though, the people in the book, with the exception of the walkers, still worship him.  The only thing Bachman really tells us about the world-at-large is that people who speak out against the government are executed.  Not very satisfying that; it only made me want to know more.<br /><br />I'm always curious about the thought processes that go into creating a work of fiction.  The author had to see or hear or read something that sparked an idea in his mind that made him stop and think, \\"That would make an interesting story.\\"  To me, The Long Walk bears a striking resemblance to the Bataan Death March, an actual event that occurred during World War II where some American P.O.W.'s were literally marched to death, and I have to wonder if that is what created the spark in Richard Bachman's mind.  I can also see some similarities to the theme of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, and in fact Bachman mentions a short story by Shirley Jackson in his narrative, although he does not name the story.  If you flip it around and look at it the other way, in other words look at later stories that may have been influenced by The Long Walk, I can see some definite similarities in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games, which is also about a bunch of teenagers thrown into a life and death competition.  Maybe the Long Walk caught Collins' attention in some special way.<br /><br />Narrator Kirby Heyborne is okay in my book.  I was skeptical at first, but he grew on me quickly.  The boys in this book experience a very wide range of emotions as the hours turn into days, and the miles continue to roll by.  Heyborne handled the gamut of feelings very well, matching his voice to each situation that arose.  Sometimes the amount of feeling he expressed in his voice was pretty impressive.kind of hero, but by the end of the book he looks more like a sadistic psychopath.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Expect the unexpected. Martin writes a roller coaster story that will have you excited and anxious for the next page one moment, and then screw with your emotions by killing one of your favorite characters. If you're looking for a &#34;feel good&#34; read, skip this book and shop the romance section. If what you want is drama, action, unexpected events and emotion... read this series. Please George, I need the next book. I'm totally addicted.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I was surprise at the quality of this software. I am pleased that I made the purchase. Enjoy using it.

B00007KWI9|4.0|Truly not what I expected from Yes, but it is their first album after all and as the liner notes mention, they were truly clueless in the studio. It shows, but it's such a piece of Yes history it's still offers some fun to have a listen. &#34;Survival&#34; is the best track on the record. I also like some of the bonus cuts. Normally I don't like bonus tracks but these were actually cool.
B00947N6D8|5.0|ok Im a kid at heart so I love animated cartoons. But the first time I watched this I got it off Netflix, and had to watch it twice. As soon as I sent it back I wanted it and got it from here. This movie brings out the kid in you and all the magic and wonder from the holidays. I absolutely LOVE this show and can't wait to share it with my kids! excellent  job!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good but the graphics could be better. Also you should be able to unlock the characters easyer and play different world at the touch of a button. :P

B00007KWHO|5.0|Wow! I liked this album when I got it as a kid of 16 and it's great to have it again to listen to. This is definitely the proto-Yes we fans would come to love with albums such as &#34;Fragile&#34;, &#34;Close to the Edge&#34;, &#34;Tales from Topographic Oceans&#34; and &#34;Relayer&#34; later on. Good stuff.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 1 of Suits introduced us to the staff of Pearson Hardman. Season 2 continues the excitement with more ups, downs, challenges, successes, and failures. The characters play off of each other better than any show out there. Season 2 introduces us to Daniel Hardman, who was notably absent from the first season.<br /><br />The show isn't called Suits for no reason. Whether it's Harvey Specter with his Tom Ford peak lapel suits or Mike Ross with his Zegna trim cut suits, the characters are always looking the part.<br /><br />USA Network has another winner! Take some time and check out Suits, you won't be disappointed!

B009LGO88E|4.0|I purchased my Circle Pad Pro from Nintendo.  With shipping, the Amazon $27.99 Prime price comes to about the same as Nintendo's $19.99 price with shipping.  If you really want to get a CCP, and have Amazon Prime, just go with this one, since the price should come out to be about a dollar more.<br /><br />As for the product itself, I tried Monster Hunter 3 with and without the CCP.  The game feels a lot more natural with the CCP.  That said, the CCP makes the 3DS XL a lot more bulky and adds a considerable amount of weight. But I probably won't notice it too much and will likely get used to it.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves every Dr. Panda game, she can't get enough of them. So I am always excited when a new one is released and I can surprise her with more Dr. Panda.<br /><br />This game is great, there aren't that many houses (only about 5) and they seem to repeat in the same order (not randomly like previous Dr. Panda games) but my daughter doesn't mind that at all, in fact I think she enjoys the repetitive game play and predictability, it allows her to get better and better at the games. She loves collecting the virtual stickers for her sticker collection (something that has been lacking in Dr. Panda games since the Hospital game). I love how the Dr. Panda games really allow my daughter to be creative and artistic while also honing her motor skills and getting her familiar with a touchscreen device.<br /><br />Now for a few complaints. All of my complaints are of a technical/programming nature. My daughter is playing this game on an HP Touchpad running Android ICS. First, after certain mini-games Dr. Panda will hold his hand up for a high-five, except during certain mini-games he will flicker during his animation and be invisible while expecting a high-five. The game will not progress until you tap his hand, you have to tap where his hand should be and the game continues, however some children might not be able to figure out that they need to high-five a Dr. Panda that they can not see. Second issue is the broken door mini-game. When we first downloaded the game, the door fixing mini-game would bot show any of the rest of the house whenever the hammer hit the door, everything except for the door and the hammer would turn a dark navy blue for a second while the animation of the piece of door falling would play. However during our second time loading the game, and every time since, as soon as the hammer is about to hit the door the game crashes and closes. I have tried force stopping the app and even rebooting my device, but no matter what we can no longer play that mini-game, so now we have to simply skip the house with the broken door and leaky shower. The only thing I haven't tried is uninstalling and re-installing the app, but my daughter doesn't want to lose her collected stickers. So for the time being we'll have to skip fixing that house.<br /><br />In short, I love the game and the Dr. Panda series as a whole, but I wish some of the technical problems in this game were resolved. I'm not sure if it is simply my device, or a result of poor programming, but perhaps an update/patch could be released to address these issues in the future.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|So, I just finished reading [[ASIN:B00CIX1PDI The Boys From Manchester]], which is written in a first person, present tense narrative (which I really like, because everything is happening while you're reading it, and that always makes it more exciting for me), and it's also a really cool story about teens with superpowers and it has a kick-ass climax. So now I'm all hyped up and looking for something to read that won't let me down after having just experienced such an awesome book, right?<br /><br />Then a friend of mine, who also read The Boys From Manchester, asks me if I've read The Hunger Games yet and believe it or not, I haven't even seen the movie. It just seemed a little too hyped up, and I'm not really into following the crowd. But my friend says, \\"You HAVE to read this book.\\" He tells me that it is also written in the first person, present tense narrative and that it will really pull me in. I will admit that I was skeptical going in, but this book is fantastic! Katniss is a great narrator and she takes the time to develop details of the story before the games begin, which I really liked. The action scenes are intense and the quiet moments in between are genuinely moving (my favorite is the scene where Katniss and Peta are in the cave and she's feeding the soup, it was very sweet and tender).<br /><br />All in all, a great read. It had me hooked from page one. I will definitely be reading [[ASIN:0545586178 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] and [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]!

B00C1BUYX4|3.0|this movie did not meet my expectations.  A very slow rendition of a great American icon - I would have liked to see a lo more about Lincoln.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool<br /><br />From the first few words of this \\"book\\" (series of short stories I've been told) I was drawn right in, which is always the sign of a great book, this is a great book. The characters either start out mesmerizing, as was the case with Holston, instant appeal. Jahns took a while, but as more of her background spilled out, the more I felt her becoming real. The same went for the other assortment of characters that followed in the books, either they caught me right away or \\"charmed\\" me after a while.<br /><br />Howey to me felt a little between Robert Jordan and George RR Martin. Not that he ripped off any details or anything like that but there was the basic fruits. For Jordan? A little bit of fluff in the description, retreading some things (I know it could be just me) I didn't care to retread again. Could be because this was several short stories mashed together so he was catching the reader up again. It wasn't a huge thing I just did what I did with Jordan, skim for a paragraph or two, then fall back into the story again. For Martin? People are going to die, no spoilers, but you're going to like them and they are going to die. But it makes this Sci Fi story a lot more real, a lot greater.<br /><br />This story kept me guessing all the way through, I could piece together small parts, but the vast majority of the plot was NOT predictable. That's a big thing for me. 4 out of 5 for sure.

B001NOQI3U|5.0|In the Jewish culture of that time and location, girls could not be taught the Torah and associated subjects. They were limited to learning how to be a good wife and mother. Yentyl's father understood her need to learn Torah and with windows closed and covered so no one could know, he taught Yentyl until his early death. Now how could Yentyl learn under some other household's father? The rest of the movie is concerned with her disguise and enrollment in the school for young men learning advanced Torah.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|This was the worst adaptation of a book I have ever watched. Rick Riordan must be extremely unhappy with the way this authorship was crushed under foot by fine minds of hollywood. After all THEY know storytelling best... don't they? This movie was a waist of time! DO NOT RENT!!!

B005PWPUW6|5.0|You have to understand that this product still needs an amplifier for your headset to work. It takes the toslink signal, optical, and converts it to the 3.5, headphone jack that the new LEDs don't have. I used a pair of computer speakers with a subwoofer. The headphones plug into the analog volume control from the computer speakers. The best thing is you don't ever have to unplug the headphones if you don't want because the tv volume control will not affect the headphone volume and vice versa. If you require quiet at night and your wife doesn't, you can always turn the tv volume to zero and listen to the headphones. Another mention is,  if you get a decent pair of computer speakers with a sub, you can unplug the headphones and get better sound than most tvs can reproduce. This may be my second review but folks are buying this stuff without realizing that you have to amplify the signal from the FiiO D3 digital to analog converter and computer speakers are the least expensive go around. Good luck
0446580848|4.0|This time John Corey, man of action, moves very slowly to capture THE PANTHER.  This tale is set in Yemen and is far from my favorite, possibly the worst of the series.  So little action and more than I wanted to know about Yemen and the war of terrorism.  It just wasn't as good as THE LION.  Series recommneded.  Three and a half stars for this one.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Book one in the Max Larkin Detective series is a remarkable debut that will prompt fans of Criminal Minds and NCIS to read more and watch less television. This gripping thriller is quite terrifying and not for the faint of heart. A slaughtered family cues two young detectives, Max and Jesse who just became partners to unearth a murderer. Little do they know that they will be attempting to track down a gruesome serial killer. In this frightening murder mystery, Thiede grants the reader access to the killer's warped mind where we get to witness the horrid slayings described vividly and graphically. The disturbing storyline with several plot twists and turns flows with ease throughout, and Max and Jesse possess ample personality and are an admirable duo of characters. Although some of the dialogue was unrealistic, almost forced at times, it won't stop book lovers from anticipating the next installment in this new, bizarre series.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was very late to the Breaking Bad party, but finally got there.  I had hear so much (positive) about this series, but never really gave it chance.  I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone other than Bryan Cranston playing Walter White.  He does an amazing job of portraying a &#34;regular guy&#34; that turns to the drug world to provide for his family.<br /><br />I'm not overly impressed by the Walt's wife (the character), she seems too indecisive and when she finally does make a decision to speak up, she doesn't have much to say.  Maybe her character will develop as the series moves forward.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent series!

Great characterizations by all allow you to see how these people came about their respective foibles. The movie is a bit long, but it is enjoyable and you realize two hours have passed while enjoying the movie.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read and loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I was anxiously anticipating his next novel, hoping that it would evoke the connection and emotion of his first two.  I was disappointed with And the Mountains Echoed.  I never felt connected or emotionally involved.  I kept hoping that he would tie everything together at the end, and that really didn't happen for me.  The book was very disjointed, going places that didn't make much sense for the plot.  I would not tell people that it is a must read.  I hope that his next novel more closely resembles the first two.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|If you are buying this knife, you know a thing or two already (or should, given the price). My review is moot at this point. It does everything it should. It sharpens easily, keeps an edge, withstands typical abuse. I've batoned and chopped with it. Fug, I whittle with it and it works just fine for that as well. It's not great for cleaning a fish, obviously, but it gets the job done. It's a good knife. The handle is quite fine, great grip, though a bit thin.<br /><br />Some things to know:<br />1. It is hollow ground, which has not been a deficiency for me, but I'm not Grizzly Adams. I don't have to chop serious wood on a regular basis with it; I live in AZ, so I usually forgo a fire altogether. If the grind is an issue for you, you probably already know what you are looking for. It's obviously about as resilient as a hollow ground knife can be.<br />2. The handle is a little thin. I don't have a great big paw, so it is comfortable for me. If you do have a great big paw, it might not be so bad. It has a handle like most hand tools. The material is tacky enough (and more) that I doubt it would make a difference. !!!Big handed folk: Try it before you buy it.<br />3. The center of mass is a good bit into the blade. This makes it good for chopping. Not ideal for finer tasks (cleaning fish), but with a careful hand (which I am sure we all have), it will suffice (given how sharp you can get it and how long it will hold an edge).<br />4. You can really choke up on the blade and quite comfortably so, given the 3/16 inch thickness of the blade. This makes it particularly nice, given point 3 (see above).<br />5. I haven't gotten a spot of rust in a year, but I live in Arizona (pretty dry here).<br />6. The handle is fantastic. Very tacky, great grip in all conditions. I could see it breaking down. I have had it for a year and have used it pretty well with no complaints so far. If it lasted five years and I had to rehandle it, I would still consider it a great buy overall.<br/>7. The size is fantastic (6 inch blade) for what I do on a regular basis. I spend time in Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and Montana. If I was spending the majority of my time in colder climes like Montana and Canada, I might opt for something bigger (Trailmaster or Recon Scout) for processing more wood quicker.<br /><br />I don't know why I'm writing this review. It's a fantastic knife and you know it. If you spend this much money on a knife, I'd hope that you know what to look for already. There are some cute videos of people using it on the Cold Steel website and on YouTube. Check them out.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you're thinking about getting a SOG seal pup or some shit like that, you should really consider paying the extra buck for something like this. I've heard that Fallkniven products are superior, but this hasn't let me down. Again, I'm not Grizzly Goddumn Adams, but I've performed most mundane tasks (batoning, chopping, cutting callouses, cleaning fish, etc.) with this knife and haven't had a problem yet. Something like a SOG seal pup, however, is a definite step down, given how thin the blade is, and the unnecessary curves and (don't do it) unnecessary serrations. This guy is zen simple.

B002PEP4C8|3.0|First, I think it is extremely important to emphasis how grateful I am that Ms. Sebold was willing to share this horrible and violent attack with the world.  I truly believe her account will help countless other rape victims.<br /><br />Also, I am thankful that our justice system did work in this instance and the evil man responsible for the attack was sentence to prison.<br /><br />After she described her attack, I did find the book a bit too graphic with too much profanity.  I also had difficulty understanding her particular style of writing.  I found myself having to reread many of her statements in an effort to figure out the chronology of events and what she was trying to convey.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for men and women alike, but I would caution them about the dark tone and the graphic language.

This highly regarded legal text now published in a new sixth edition by Jordans, provides the practitioner with the answers to this and any number of other relevant questions that can and do arise from own share acquisition, including the fiscal consequences.<br /><br />The expert authors remind us that it was the Companies Act 2006 that effected significant changes within this area of English company law, thus making it easier for a limited company to purchase its own shares. Gift, purchase and forfeiture, say the authors in the Introduction, are the three main ways in which a company today may acquire its own shares. All three are examined in detail in this volume.<br /><br />The point is also made that own share purchase `is but one species of own share acquisition, although perhaps the most important species.'  The book, however, covers the whole area of own share acquisition, providing practical advice and clarifying a formidably wide range of difficult and sometimes confusing issues.<br /><br />This completely revised and updated new edition, examines all new developments pertaining to own share acquisition, including the key changes made by the Companies Act 2006, the taxation issues and other key commercial considerations.<br /><br />Those wishing to pursue further research will appreciate the lengthy section containing tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, EC materials and other materials, as well as a useful table of abbreviations.  For added convenience and ease of use there's a detailed table of contents and a comprehensive index.  Also note the invaluable inclusion of Appendices A to J, which contain the most important forms and precedents that you as a professional will need in your day to day practice.<br /><br />Whether you are a  company lawyer, barrister, accountant or tax adviser, this book - also available as an eBook -- will enhance your understanding of this complex area, while providing a ready reference to, in the words of the authors, `the law relating to own share acquisitions, from the perspective of both company law and tax law'.<br /><br />The law is stated as at 1st February 2013, including the expected effect of the Finance Act 2013 - and prior to, you will notice, the replacement of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) by the Financial Conduct Authority in April 2013.as a professional will need in your day to day practice.<br /><br />Whether you are a  company lawyer, barrister, accountant or tax adviser, this book - also available as an eBook -- will enhance your understanding of this complex area, while providing a ready reference to, in the words of the authors, `the law relating to own share acquisitions, from the perspective of both company law and tax law'.<br /><br />The law is stated as at 1st February 2013, including the expected effect of the Finance Act 2013 - and prior to, you will notice, the replacement of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) by the Financial Conduct Authority in April 2013.

As the New Law Journal has described, `every conceivable aspect' of a CVA is described in this book, including the disadvantages as well as the benefits.<br /><br />Recently published by Jordans, this book will certainly help insolvency practitioners -- whether barristers, solicitors, or accountants - to refine their judgment as to whether, in particular cases, CVAs meet the requirements of clients facing insolvency, not to mention the problems faced by their creditors.<br /><br />As the authors explain, a CVA is, to put it simply, `a deal between a company and its creditors.'  The term `company' includes partnerships, limited liability partnerships and building societies and (in some instances) companies incorporated outside the UK.<br />All too often, say the authors, the CVA is not perceived as the preferred option in cases of insolvency, which is surprising considering the advantages.<br /><br />A major benefit of the CVA is that it `should be cheaper than other procedures', in that the directors retain day to day control of the company, thus avoiding `the detailed involvement of insolvency practitioners and their staff as would be required in an administration'.<br /><br />Other problems of administration are also avoided.  The company can maintain trading relationships and contracts through a CVA and need not relinquish goodwill and other assets. Nor does the CVA procedure require any reporting under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.<br /><br />The fact that this book has now gone into a third edition is ample evidence of its usefulness and popularity with informed practitioners.  In succinct, yet detailed and readable form, it covers the full spectrum of issues pertaining to the CVA in all its facets, including the procedure itself, the proposal, costs, creditors, the creditors' meeting, taxation and pre-pack administration ... and here we cite only a few examples.  Also, there are eleven appendices which provide sample correspondence, proposals, forms and reports.<br /><br />Essential for the practitioner seeking to keep up to date with current developments, this new edition reflects recent activity by Parliament and the courts regarding CVAs, including the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010 and the relevant new case law.  The Insolvency Practice Direction 2012, together with numerous decisions by the courts which have also been included.<br /><br />Academics and researchers as well as practitioners will appreciate the almost twenty-eight pages of tables of cases, statutes, and statutory instruments, as well as the detailed table of contents and index at the back.  All those who practice professionally in this often sensitive area of law will benefit from the practical approach and the authoritative advice and information contained in this book.

It is fair to say, however, that the greater the value of the assets left behind to fight over, the bigger the tax burden and it is here that wills and taxation issues obviously overlap. This highly regarded work of reference therefore, is just as relevant and useful for tax advisers as it is for practitioners specialising in the administration of estates and the drafting of wills.<br /><br />According to the authors Christopher Whitehouse and Professor Lesley King, this new edition, published by Jordans, has ballooned in size by some forty percent compared with the first edition of 2010. This, they say, can be blamed on `the torrent of recent case law, statutory changes in the law and the deluge of consultation papers.'  They also mention the enactment of yet more anti-avoidance legislation which obviously emerges as a further obstacle to devising a tax avoidance scheme.<br /><br />The book therefore contains much new material which reflects changes in legislation, notably those incorporated in the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010, plus new case law.  In particular there are four new chapters which include notes for the will draftsman and the latest advice on, for example, gifts to charity and the reduced IHT rate... obtaining the Grant... and constituting and administering the will. In view of these numerous and recent developments, we would say that it is virtually imperative for practitioners charged with the tax-efficient drafting of wills, as well as other aspects of estate planning, to acquire this book.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections A, B and C which, respectively, cover the background law... drafting the will... and finally, administering the Estate (including establishing and running will trusts). Within these broad categories, an astounding range of issues is examined, as you'll note from the minutely detailed table of contents.<br /><br />As the title indicates, the book is full of useful precedents, carefully chosen to supplement the narrative commentary and to meet those client needs that most commonly occur in everyday practice.  The accompanying CD ROM gives lets practitioners download and adapt each document for individual client requirements. Reassuringly, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes, and statutory instruments, a table of abbreviations and two appendices which include interest rates payable on funds in court.<br /><br />Here then, is a solidly reliable and readable work of reference that should be kept readily to hand by every professional involved in this technically challenging and fast changing area of law.finally, administering the Estate (including establishing and running will trusts).

Recently published by Jordans in a new fourth edition, the content of this authoritative and highly regarded book has been completely updated and revised, with the main issues affecting restrictive covenants dealt with extensively and in detail.<br /><br />Distinguished by its clarity and practical approach, the book is a boon to practitioners needing to steer their clients through the pitfalls of property investment.  Certainly property buying is problematic enough in the UK without the usually unexpected problem of a restrictive covenant raising its head.  This book therefore, is purpose designed to guide the practitioner and in turn, the client, around the dreaded difficulties presented by this form of complication,<br /><br />This new edition deals with a number of developments that have emerged since the previous edition was published in 2009.  To cite just one example, the book refers to the running of both the benefits and the burdens of restrictive covenants by reference to the most recent cases on the subject, bearing in mind that almost any restrictive covenant will impose a burden on one party while conferring a benefit on another.<br /><br />The author, Andrew Francis, also refers to a number of frequently asked questions concerning covenants. What, for example, do these covenants mean?  Can they be enforced, or possibly removed, particularly in cases of infilling or `back land' development?  In these and any number of similar cases, the book functions as a guide to the rights and obligations attending these issues and the ways in which to deal with them.<br /><br />The importance of this book - now an established title with inbuilt authority - looms even larger when one considers at least one of the statistics mentioned in the book's introduction, namely, that the Land Registry figures produced for the Law Commission in 2005 revealed that out of almost 16.5 million registered freehold titles, 79 per cent (over 13 million) were subject to restrictive covenants!  Astounding or what?<br /><br />We have little doubt that practitioners involved in advising clients on property issues will positively pounce on this new edition of this definitive work - especially now that it comes with a handy accompanying CD ROM.<br /><br />Those doing further research will also appreciate the copious footnoting and the more than thirty pages containing tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments.  And for the practitioner under pressure, the finely detailed table of contents, extensive index and seven appendices make it much easier to look things up.<br /><br />Definitely this is a legal text every practitioner involved in property transactions should acquire.  Francis has endeavoured to state the law as of 8 February 2013.rtance of this book - now an established title with inbuilt authority - looms even larger when one considers at least one of the statistics mentioned in the book's introduction, namely, that the Land Registry figures produced for the Law Commission in 2005 revealed that out of almost 16.5 million registered freehold titles, 79 per cent (over 13 million) were subject to restrictive covenants!

You could have had her almost slip to show how hard it was to resist, but hold out in the end. Male writers had to have decided to put in that angle.

All that includes children, little children doing sick stuff. That's what that book all about. How world is a shitty place, fool of little monsters, who just want to cut you to pieces.

Sort of a one-stop shop if you're looking for something that celebrates our beautiful Earth, its geography, and the remarkable creatures that live on it.  Very informative and well done.<br /><br />With regard to the seller, the set itself came in perfect condition at a great price and arrived quickly.  All around it was a good buy, and I would recommend both the product and the seller.
1579128149|5.0|I had been oogling this book at the local bookseller for a while, but as it was hardcover I couldn't justify it. Then I came into a little money, and justify I did. It's BEAUTIFUL. I love it, my kids love it. It gives us all a visual cue as to what each element is, and triggered in my children (8 & 9) the urge to do some science. I would buy this many times over if I could.
0316069884|5.0|This book challenges and exposes, is down to earth and philosophical.  I highly recommend it for those willing to question and think deeply.
0345529057|5.0|Excellent!! The whole family is passing the books around! These will keep us occupied until season four comes out next year..
B0034G4P94|4.0|The movie was well done, acting was good, but unfortunately, a bit heavy on the language.<br />Spoiler: The cover of the box gives away the ending. The designers should have used a different image. I wasn't surprised by the ending.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I found 'Thor' to be an entertaining movie with a good story line and plenty of action.  I am a fan of Norse mythology so I did raise an eyebrow a few times with some of the liberties taken with said mythology but even so I did enjoy the movie.  It certainly lacked a lot of vivid and gratuitous violence and I also enjoyed the relative dearth of foul language.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|It so amazing if you don't buy it you will regret it!! No joke<br />I live every song in this album!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was different than book one The Hunger Games, but equally as good! I quickly found myself absorbed in the book with the familiar characters, and the new characters...and the new games! Full of suspense, action, and plenty of mind boggling twists and turns! A very well written book, a very creative and imaginative plot...and definitely a surprise ending! I recommend Cathing Fire as highly as I recommend The Hunger Games...now for The Mockingjay!!!!
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I had no expectations before watching this movie. It seems a lot of reviewers did not enjoy this movie. I thought it was fine. The computer graphics was well done. Maybe a different actor other than Ryan Reynolds would have helped.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It is a great game and I love evolving my shark.  The problem was that, when I had unlocked the great white and was saving up to buy it, all the sharks became blind and the map was weird.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|This is the first album of VW all of there albums are different fell to the but they are all amazing you should definitely buy this album!!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Very good movie.  Worth the money. I should have bought it instead of renting it on amazon. I would recommend.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when we first checked it out and had to purchase it. Unfortunately, that's the way America was during that time. Prayerfully, things will continue to get better through the years. A lot of progress has been made, but there will always be those few that hang on to old thoughts and prejudices. we just need to keep them in prayer and ask God to open their eyes.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Could be me but the app doesn't open or transfer my dropbox contents to kindle.  Hate the word minimum for kindle review.  Don't expect many more
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I admit that the premise of this book did not initially appeal to me, but boy was I wrong. I couldn't get enough of the characters in this book.  Another winner for Sophie Kinsella!
B007FH9GA6|2.0|This movie has a good story to it, but there are some real problems.  The first is the length.  Too much time was wasted with scenes of the protagonists sitting on a train, crossing the bridge, and gratuitous sex scenes.  Cut these out, and the whole thing could have run in about 130 minutes.  We get the idea--the hero is traveling.  There is a bridge to cross to the island where the main action occurred.<br />D0o we need to see it every time the protagonist goes back and forth?  While I realize sex sells, these scenes added nothing to the plot, and how many times do we need to be shown the female protagonist's less than spectacular breasts bouncing around?  Let's get back to the plot--remember plot?<br />  Another problem is that this movie has the typical, European acting.  It is so under acted as to be dead.  A character may be saying \\"I just won the lottery,\\" or \\"My dog died,\\" but you cannot tell by tone of voice.  The only tone of voice available is terminal depression.  There is no joy, no excitement, no color at all, except dull, gray, flatline.<br />  Speaking of color,  that is something else lacking from this movie--at least I think it is lacking.  The lighting is so bad, so dark, that it is hard to tell.  I didn't care for film noir fifty years ago, and I don't cqare for it, now.  Even outdoor, daylight shots are dull, dreary, and gray.  There is no lightening of mood because there is no lighting.  Indoor scenes with Christopher Plummer made me wonder, \\"if he's supposed to be so rich, how come he can't pay the light bill.\\"<br />  Finally, the plot was rather obvious.  If, by the time the final family member is interviewed, there is anyone who has not read the book, but does not know how this will play out, that person needs to go back to Blues Clues.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is so very funny! Its perfect for children and adults alike! My whole family loves how funny it is!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|delete tune in radio and then install it again im not sure if your music will still be there but the update will work
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I know- everyone says this is a classic.  I liked the book, but I enjoy more of the modern day fiction then the old-English stories.  However, I certainly would recommend this over Emily Dickenson's assigned reading that the high school students have to do.<br />This book at least moved a well fleshed out story, and I enjoyed the ending.
B004UHL9EK|3.0|It is reliable and there are plenty of choices in alarm sounds. My only issue with it is if I have Pandora playing or my cover for my tablet closed it has trouble coming on. Also I have yet to understand why I cannot get personal voice alarms to go off. Overall though I am satisfied.
B005LAII0I|5.0|My whole family loved watching this movie. It is very well done and great for family night movie. Its romantic and funny
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third book of his I have read.  He never disappoints.  You begin to feel like you know the characters and their culture.  Just love this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is fun. You can build whatever you want. I would only recommend this to people who like to create. Other than that its my favorite app!!!
B009LGO88E|5.0|The circle pad pro xl makes games that support it 10x more enjoyable. Id highly reccomend it to any 3dsxl user playing monster hunter 3 ultimate or resident evil revelations.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I absolutely love Star Wars!! I have been waiting til they go on sale and finally bought them! Cant wait to watch them
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It is a sad story that most people may not want to read but I think details are important that way we can try more to keep this from happening by tougher laws and the system learning what it did wrong in not catching it sooner, also the power of prayer to pray for those who are currently enduring this and past nightmares like this anyone may have.
1878424319|5.0|This book is probably the BEST book I have ever read.  This fits with who I would like to become. Very easy read and it is a book you will read over and over
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Un album fantastico come tutti gli altri...i THIRTY SECONDS TO MARS non deludono mai... :)<br />E speriamo che venga fatto un altro album :)
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie so much lol! Its so funny and sweet! I highly recommend this movie to anyone in the market for a family film
B0050DIWFC|3.0|its a nicely paced book and well written, but i did feel the fathers unwavering opinion against mounting evidence a bit of a stretch.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I thought it wouldd be about Lincoln's life, but it is only about the his dealings with the 14th amendment. Very disappointing, but Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job portraying Lincoln.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|The first half of the movie set in Paris Island Marine recruit training base is great and has an awesome performance by R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Heartman.  The second half is based in Vietnam during the war and is just OK. Matthew Modine, &#34;joker&#34; is very good throughout.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Thank you so very much. I love this dvd!Les Miserables has got to be my  favorite musical of all time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cannot wait for the next book! This one leaves us on the wanting more! Thank you Sylvia Day for the wonderful imagination!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A good read. Not as good as the television show, but I will read more of Richard Castle. Good Heat!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft, but I do NOT like the last update! Is there anyway I can delete just the update?
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Takes you into the twists and turns of local politics. The corrupt mayor and his business cronies were profiting at the detriment of the people of new York. what's chilling is that they crushed everyone that stood in their way
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Strap yourself in for this one, because it is one nailbiting ride! Meet Astronaut Mark Watney, botanist, mechanical engineer, and lone human on Mars after the Ares 2 mission is scrubbed and he is left for dead. Ever resourceful against mounting odds, he bootstraps his way through one disaster after another. You will lose sleep in the pages of this brilliant and often hilarious book. Every character in the book (Watney, NASA staff and Hermes crew) are richly developed and wonderfully complex. Don't know when I've enjoyed a book more. Plenty of sci fi gizmo stuff for the nerds and lots of suspense as well as laugh out loud dialogue (and monologue) for the rest of us. Write more please, Andy Weir!
0553593544|3.0|I must admit I have read the book however it did take me a long time to finish, I wasn't really as excited about the book as I was after viewing the movie. I'm not saying its not a well written book its just that I didn't feel as engaged with this book as I have with other authors.
0575081406|5.0|Name of the Wind is an awesome book with great characters, smooth flow, and beautiful prose. I read this book in a single night and I had to call in sick to work because I was exhausted after reading it. After I was done, I started to read it again to pick up more information that I might have missed the first time. Man, this book is awesome.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I liked this movie and I never rooted for two people to get together more than I did in this movie but I feel that it fell short of all the hype. Yes, it was a unique take on a romantic comedy but it was still just a romantic comedy. It didn't stray too far from the typical Hollywood formula. I do think that Bradley Cooper and Robert Deniro gave spectacular performances. I thought the woman who played his mother was great too. I was shocked, however, at how flat Jennifer Lawrence's acting was. She was the main reason I wanted to see the movie. I guess it just shows how unseasoned she actually is when put up against greats like Deniro.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is life changing. I recommend this book to every person with a pulse. It will teach you how to turn your penny into a dollar with little cost to you. This will definitely be a book that I use as a reference point and I plan to re-read it again.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My friend introduced me to Arctic Silver 5, and I've never looked back. The other products all differ by only 1-3C, and the results are usually inconsistent. So I will just stick to my guns and continue using this product until one comes out that completely beats this out.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Well atleast kimble charghes with new cord but battery charged time is short. I think I may be spending money on a lost cauise
0385349947|4.0|I appreciated much of what Sandberg says here as a professional woman from the South who struggles with leaning into uncomfortable places of power. I saw myself in a number of the examples she gave and walked away knowing that if I wanted to accomplish more, I would have to dare to lean in more ... It is not an easy thing to do, but with more of us encouraging one another, I do accept her premise that change is possible over the long haul. We have a responsibility to lean in....not to shrink away and lean out.<br /><br />But my concern is for the minimum wage worker who is working multiple jobs to raise her family. How does she lean in? Will we be aware of them in our conversations at the boardroom table? They need our empathy and the flexibility those in higher positions can often demand for themselves. Leaning in to that conversation could make a difference, but I believe it is much more difficult to affect change for these people, who are so often women.<br /><br />Still, it's worth the read and I'm glad she's saying it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved it is fun getting high scores my brother thinks this is a dumb app but he  is my brother so I don't care what he thinks
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I did not like this series as much as I liked Criminal Minds and NCIS because it seemed that practically everyone was involved in the cult following and therefore it was not surprising to learn that yet another person was involved. Having said that, I should make clear that I only watched the first two episodes. Maybe the story becomes more subtle and/or realistic in future ones.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This Cd blew me away, the more I listened the more I enjoyed it. I wasn't sure about the group when I first bought it but it turned out much better than I had hoped for, can't wait for more music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app a very fun to play. There is everything you can do with a real horse. If you love horses you will love this game.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|This is essentially a short story with the Jack Reacher character.  The first 90% is classic, enjoyable Lee Child writing: building a basis for a story; introducing characters; setting the stage, etc.  Ultimately, the whole story is then brought to an abrupt resolution in the last couple of pages, leaving me thinking &#34;Huh! How did that happen.&#34;  .
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Loved it!  It was fun and I could relate to all of the little secrets.  It even made me laugh out loud a few time.
B00A757EFW|5.0|we all loved the original.why not get this its the same thing its fun only thing is that it only has 2 lifes
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I purchased this game for my girls Ipods a few weeks ago, and they love playing this game along with their friends.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|A good movie with a message (doesn't matter how tough your situation you can change it through dedication and a helping hand) worth watching.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and myself enjoyed playing Catan. It's interesting, fun and enjoyable game. We love playing Catan. We would encourage our friends too.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|We watched this movie on the tour bus on the way to Auschwitz...the students and myself just silent on the bus in Poland. If you want a movie to show a group of young people to help them understand the Holocaust, this is on the list of greats. It won't disappoint.
1451696191|3.0|I read this book at the urging of my daughter, who will be 13 at the end of July. It was, um, interesting.<br /><br />I didn't have any problems with the epistolary format of the book (although I finally figured out that Charlie is writing to a complete stranger, why I'm not sure). But the characters just left me shaking my head. There isn't one admirable character in the bunch. And before you say, \\"Well, you're just past the target demographic,\\" I have to say that I never understood Catcher in the Rye, or the Outsiders, or any of the other \\"coming of age\\" books either.<br /><br />My daughter thought this book was excellent. When I asked her why, all she could say was \\"it's so sad\\" and that she \\"felt sorry\\" for Charlie. But she had a tough time explaining why. No doubt, Charlie is messed up. He's messed up when the book starts, and doesn't get any better as it progresses. He starts drinking, smoking (first cigarettes, then pot), kisses another boy, and stops just short of fooling around with a girl. Oh, and spends way more time crying than any 16-year old boy I know.<br /><br />For most of the book, honestly, I just want to slap him. I also want to slap the adults - not one of whom provided a \\"safe haven\\" or source of refuge for this kid, who is clearly hurting on so many levels. Why is it that these coming of age classics are totally devoid of decent adult figures? It doesn't have to be a parent; some parents just aren't very good. But someone, anyone - a neighbor, a teacher, another relative. Someone. And that is probably what frustrated me the most - here are all these messed up kids and not one of them has a touchstone adult in his/her life to whom they can go for guidance.<br /><br />You do find out at then end about why (presumably) Charlie is so messed up, and it does end on a quasi-hopeful note (\\"things are good with me).<br /><br />But it was kind of painful getting there. I wish someone could write a book that covers all the same confusion of adolescence (drugs, sex, drinking, etc.) without the descent into depravity. In fact, that descent has become so expected of these stories, that I wonder if it's lost its significance.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is one of the true classics about WWI.  Based (loosely) on a true story, it delves into the psyche of prisoners and their commander attenotubg ti maintain discipline.  And going too far.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I love historical movies, as I teach history. This is a great movie to show to a class studying the slave trade. Students love it, and it won't get me in any trouble. :)
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This connection kit is extremely easy to use.  I use it to connect my DSLR camera or memory card to my ipad.<br />All you have to do is just stick the connector into your ipad/iphone and everything you have taken on your camera and NOT loaded yet will ask you if you want to upload it... super quick and simple!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The afterlife fascinates all of us - does it really exist?  The book makes a strong statement for the pro side.  Very interesting details of the Doctor's illness and amazing recovery.
0470913029|5.0|A great summary and easy way to have the basics of the Paleo diet! I really think this was a good price for all the information this book provided. I am very happy with this.
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|Bought this for my dad for fathers day. He thinks its so funny and that's funnier than the movie itself. Great one liners. Everyone can relate to at least one part.
B004Q3RDUW|5.0|I loved this book. I have read The Kite Runner and thought it was good, this is better. I couldn't put it down, although it was disturbing because it is hard to believe they lived like this, although I know they do.<br />Would highly recommend this book.
0061122416|5.0|I have been ordering this book since 2000 - i use it for B day gift , etc.. One of the most amazing messages
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is just what I wanted. Works great on my Kindle HD Fire. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B005C0DHEY|2.0|After watching this the only take away I can give is the narrator's voice is so overtly dramatic and annoying I couldn't make it the entire way through.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Thought is was great. as a fan who read all the books long b4 they came out as movies, I liked this prequel. kept my interest up and filled in a lot of blanks for others who did not know this part of the Lord of the Rings stories/books
1596912863|2.0|I enjoy chick-lit. Something Borrowed, novels by Sophie Kinsella, you know the kind. I picked this up because the premise was fun.<br /><br />I almost put it down every page, for the first 40 pages. It reads like a fourteen-year-old's first foray into fan fiction. Seriously. And someone actually published that. I even caught two sigificant typos - the character of Carolyn was twice called Caroline... by the main character.<br /><br />It's incredibly-poorly written - the main character is so blah and her problems are trivial (and that's saying something - all chick lit problems are trivial). She's not at all likeable, her goals flip and back forth so many times it's a distraction, and she seemingly falls in love with any man who looks at her. Seriously. It's written that way.<br /><br />There are some funny moments, but I should have known what I was getting into when I saw how very short the novel was. No room for any character development.<br /><br />I finished it becuase I had nothing else to read, and in the end it was sweet, though the ending was undeserved. She gets the man, but she certainly doesn't deserve him.<br /><br />Get it from the library, if you must. And be prepared to suspend a lot of disbelief.
B0091REZMW|4.0|As long as you don't blow through your diamonds too quickly this game is long lasting and entertaining. I kept coming back everytime my energy got restored.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|another one of the fun angry bird games. challenging and fun to play. recommend it to all angry bird friends.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I felt like it was a bit choppy in the beginning, but overall, wa very good movie. I enjoyed all of the characters and each roll was well acted. The dark and whimsical portrayal of the story was very appealing.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child keeps you turning the page with his Jack Reacher adventures. The story lines are fast and fun to read. I am a huge fan. Never boring.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|great fun, easy to use.. kept my interest. would recommend it for anyone who likes to play the angry birds games.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love playing virtual playground. My daughter and I plan out the city and watch it grow together. It's great on a rainy day. Need to make it easier to get othe things tho
1616550414|4.0|The book is much bigger than I tought it would be!<br />The illustrations are fantastic, there's a lot of material and reference on it, really a beautiful book!
B0057O6IDW|2.0|If I had something better to do... I would have turned it off and done it. While there's pleny of budget gore with fake bright red blood... there's way too many long drawn out pauses, supposedly to bring in drama, but they just drag. The best thing about the Blu-Ray is the cover. Pretty good quality Blu-Ray picture though.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This game is great. Great game play, graphics, and combat. It's like TF2 but on kindle. I'd prefer if you didn't need a Wi-Fi connection to do single player missions.
0307950689|2.0|The physical aspect of the book didn't meet the descriptions offered by the seller. Really bad conditions. The writer is great and the lost symbol is a very good story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The stories are so full of wonderful characters whose lives are intertwined and connected in unexpected and special ways. I loved the book!
B00BI745AA|5.0|I have never watched an opera before either live or on television.  This is indeed a masterpiece bringing the viewer with it through so many different emotions.  Hugh Jackman was absolutely incredible in his portrayal of Jean Valjean.  This is a brilliant production and I did shed tears several times.  I may not have all the words and be able to quote the movie as others have - but I do highly recommend seeing this movie.
B00BVYJG18|5.0|I have been following killswitch for a longtime. This is definetly one of their better albums since alive or just breathing.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|From what I have read about this film, it either works perfectly or not good at all.  I ordered this for my grandma who has a hard time working a digital camera and was really bummed out when Polaroid stopped producing 600 film.  She has two 600 series cameras.  We have only tried this film in one of them (I only bought one pack) and the pictures came out very orange-ish and hardly any color at all.  It is very hard to see what it going on in the photo.  We took pictures using different camera settings and none of them came out satisfactory.  I might order one more pack to try in her much older Polaroid 600 camera. (the one I thought took better pictures anyway)<br /><br />I think she might just bite the bullet and stock up on some of the old stock Polaroid brand film, as expensive as it is right now.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I love movie score soundtracks and how the tracks on the album can bring back scenes in the movie.  Tron Legacy's soundtrack is no different.  The tracks coincide with the scenes in the movie seamlessly. Definitely love all the tracks, especially Rinzler, The Game has Changed, Derezzed, and Outlands.
1401937519|5.0|Gave great insight to the challenges many women face breaking out of the mold.  When some do and get sick...the next challenge, daring to be yourself wholeheartedly...presents itself.  Miracles happen.
1401307787|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of self-help books, but the simplicity of writing and ideas in this book made reading it feel like meditation. I'm planning to read it again.  And maybe again. Whenever I need to remind myself to relax.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's been great having kindle on my wireless devices because I don't have to carry an extra load.  Thanks Amazon!
0345529057|4.0|We have gotten into the shows, and have just started reading the books.<br />Fun to get that extra level of detail you don't get in the show
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|The wallflowers while they don't rewrite themselves with every cd, they just keep getting better. and that is really saying something becouse they have been exalent from their first albam. Each song is diffrent, they arnt one of the stamp bands where you hear one song you hear them all, but you know its wallflowers the moment you hear them. No group has a better sound so consistantly.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I purchased this entire album for the song Sail. I like other songs on the album, but Sail is so beautiful!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|rented video for one night watching and it was played three additional times, kids were entranced by the story line, characters and the digital visualization...highly recommended.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Gregory at her (usual) best. Detailed characters, fascinating look at history, whether it's entirely factual is irrelevant to the enjoyment factor, which is high.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book knocks it out of the park!  This should be required reading in any software organization today -- the ideas are simple, intuitive, and absolutely essential.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow, steamy to say the least. Definitely did not disappoint on the sexy. Of course was hoping to see how things were tied up for Gideon and Eva but definitely will be looking forward to the next book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the Kindle App for Android and iPad.  I can now read my books on all my devices, not only the Kindle.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|My heart went out to this one hundred year old man... and what an interesting life he lead.<br />A good read, fun and short history reviews included.<br />Loved the way all the characters came together and became a family.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen was a favorite growing up and I still can go back and enjoy..that is what makes a classic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is the best because you got keys and those little things that be in the grass and stuff ans you get lined time characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome graphics it looks so real I would definitely recommend downloading this game<br />I wish the horses didn't cost so many gems besides that, I love it
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great movie! My friend made me watch it , I loved it so now I have been telling all of my friends ! =)
B00413QB5A|5.0|A great book, a lot of humour and a very creative plot. Good reading for the summer holidays  x x
0770437400|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of vampires, zombies, etc.  I don't think they're scary.  To me, scary is anything that could happen in real life, like your house being broken into.  I don't watch vampire/zombie movies, shows, read their books (although I did end up reading the Twilight series and loved SK's Salem's Lot, but I didn't know it was about vampires before I picked it up).<br /><br />And I've never read anything about zombies, either.  Until now.  World War Z by Max Brooks seems to be THE zombie book, so if I was going to pick one up (and possibly see the upcoming movie with Brad Pitt) then I should just do it already.<br /><br />World War Z is an oral history of the time when there was a zombie outbreak on our planet.  The book reads like a government paper, not like a fictional text, with historical (well, fictional historical) accounts of individual's journeys/participations in the zombie war.<br /><br />The book felt real, was raw, and not cheesy as I guess I kind of expected with the zombie stuff.  If you're not a traditional zombie fan, this would be a good book to read, because, as I said, it's not like a story, more of a historical account.<br /><br />Does this mean I'll be reading more zombie books?<br /><br />Don't count on it!<br /><br />What are your thoughts on the zombie/vampire trend?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book

1781162646|4.0|You'll notice a few things when looking at the cover of this novel. First, the large, contrasting yellow writing that says STEPHEN KING in all caps. His name throws a lot of weight and credibility with all sorts of reading circles, and if anything, that will make you think this book is paranormal. Second, you'll see the little yellow ribbon in the corner with a gun and something about \\"Hard Crime\\", leading you to believe this is a crime thriller novel. Then you see the shocked broad in the green dress with a camera... and you're not really sure what to make of it.<br /><br />Joyland, by Stephen King, is one of the most well-rounded novels I have read in years. That works both to its advantage and its disadvantage. At its best, Joyland borrows awesome elements from all sorts of genres: thriller, mystery, horror, coming of age, etc. At its worst, Joyland passes itself of as a mediocre collage of the previous genres, never quite succeeding in living up to the heights those genres can soar to.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is deceptively simple, something that starts out without pomp and circumstance: twenty-one year old virgin Devin Jones finds himself working at a North Carolina Amusement park for the summer. As he goes into work for more days, he meets some friends, learns about a ghost in one of the rides, and gets his fortune told by the resident Psychic. These three different things are then skillfully braided together until the exciting finale.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a good read. It did have some wordy/pacing issues, but those aren't significant, and are really just indicative of Stephen King's style in general (see [[ASIN:0451169522 Misery]], where King spends pages describing the same room over and over again. It's all fascinating, just a little slow to read). The only complaint I could have about the plot in this book would be the ending, as I saw the big reveal of the killer way too soon.<br /><br />But even though I can't say anything negative about the plot, I can't say too much great about it either. It was a great quick read and I really enjoyed it, but this book won't be staying with me for any long period of time. It won't keep me up at night. I enjoyed my stay at Joyland, but honestly, I might save up a little more and spend next summer at Disney or Universal, with soem bigger blockbuster.<br /><br />That being said, I, like a lot of other people, feel that King has really been telephoning in the majority of the novels he's written since the car accident. This is definitely a break in that pattern, and hopefully sugestive of a new future in writing for King, as he is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated authors of the modern literary world. Definitely pick this one up, especially because it's cheap.about the plot, I can't say too much great about it either.

Now I know why.  I haven't overclocked it but it was a great buy for what I paid.  Paired it with a Gigabyte mobo and a ssd  and this thing really makes things fly.  7.6 on WEI compared to my i3 2100 7.1 with the upgraded ability of gen 3 pci-e and graphics 4000 I can say i'm pretty dang happy with it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There is no words to describe this book. I hated it when for was over. its such a cliff hanger at the end. definitely the best book I've read. I need to read the second one.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is awesome and sucky cuz it is. It is pretty cool though, but it also sucks. It's not that good but it is
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Although I don't really care for Kanye \\"Yeezy\\" West, I am a big fan of him artistically. I decided to approach this album with an open mind and was pretty shocked by the album as a whole. I feel that given the time, Yeezus will become Kanye's In Utero or Kid A. It's pretty unorthodox, industrial and sonic-sounding--and dare I say--ahead of it's time.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is fun however it is a little slow.. it is also hard to complete tasks when it's not free like the pearls it takes along time to save those up or even get them.
193700788X|4.0|I really loved Sookie final book. Of course I think it could be more pages, after all we are talking about the last one, but, though I was Erick's team, I really think Charlaine conducted the story like Sookie was at the beggining. She is a a fighter at all, with no parents, with a difficult brother and a lot of enimies! Why she would want add a lack of sun in her life. Of course the ending romance could be a little bit longer, but I am really really happy with the solution and now feeling a little bit orphan. For sure I still reading BDB, but.. I need something new!
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Not just one of the best westerns ever made, one of the best movies ever made. So many aspects of the human condition are explored here; anger, love, fear, devotion, doubt, resolve, cowardice, honor. Just excellent.

B00065MDRW|5.0|well i was tired of always going to youtube to hear this album. had it on vinyl, but lacking a record player i got the cd. perfect condition, speedy delivery and i am very happy to shop at Amazon.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie was a great prequel to The Wizard of Oz, and had appeal for my whole family.  Action, music, plot, romance; something for all ages.  I was afraid it might be too intense for my grandchildren, but found that it wasn't, and we all loved watching it as a 3-generation family.
B000P0J09M|5.0|of course this film is one for the library...i found it here on amamzon for the BEST price ive seen. so nice to watch it again, it is in perfect condition and it was a gift that was greatly appreciated... Thank you Amazon.com!
B0075KT3C4|3.0|4 stars for the book, but 1 star for the narration. After seeing the first two parts as a series on TV, I found it very hard to understand who is who in the book and I felt that all characters have aged about 20-40 years and that they are covered in about 20 more layers of dirt.<br /><br />Anyone who watched `The Golden Compass' and listened to the Philip Pullmans full cast audiobook trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" would tell you that the characters in the film and in the audiobook sounded very much alike, which really helped with the continuity of the story. It was very easy to imagine the role of Miss Coulter's still being narrated by Nicole Kidman, Lord Asriel's as Daniel Craig and Lyra's as Dakota Blue Richards.<br /><br />Having watched the \\"Game of Thrones' as a series I see a huge clash between the characters in the book and the series and I find it impossible to imagine any of the characters from the series when listening to the voice of Roy Dotrice.<br /><br />Also, not being a native English speaker and not really being familiar with the UK regional accents, I find it hard to distinguish and understand the accents and differences in voices other than `more old, less old, more slurring, more whiny' etc.<br />Perhaps UK listeners don't have this problem, but again.. isn't it a bit inconsiderate of the word wide audience?<br /><br />All in all I find the audiobook to be a huge let down and I would really love to see it being published again with consideration for the voices of the characters played in the series.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 and downloaded this app to keep track of things when I don't have pen and paper around. And it's better than pen and paper for me too because searching for little sticky notes in my purse can be a pain...so much easier to pull it up on my phone. To be honest, I don't know if there is a 'note' app already on the phone, but I absolutely love this!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool intriguing. It will have you questioning your mental ability. Challenging if you can figure out the next step.  Try it and see
B00821OX98|4.0|I don't often watch series' on TV because I never know when I am not going to be home to catch the next episode!  I love being able to watch an entire season of shows if I record the new season.  This way I have previous seasons fresh in my memory.  I liked the story line and characters in this series.

0385474547|5.0|Starts slowly as is consistent with the culture of the people of the lower Niger delta region.  The numerous references utilizing the Ibo language are also difficult to follow initially.  However as one gets familiar with the main characters it picks up and has you eager to read. Provides good insight to the methodology utilized to subjugate the people and colonize the region of West Africa by the British.  Indeed similar strategy is utilized to this day to divide and destabilize/conquer a people.  As a man, I was drawn into and able to relate to Okonkwo.  An excellent read.

0345535421|5.0|There's 400 pages in the middle that are all about character development, and can get slow. I highly recommend reading it at a pace slightly ahead of the TV show.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|A good replacement for Google Reader - I also tried Old Reader and like this much better - easy to preview, easy to organize, and it pulls in all the feeds I want (Old Reader didn't)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game as I have other g5 games. I wish the zoom to enlarge would enlarge more than it does. Good story line.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Can't say enough about how great this app is. I use it every night. I have many combinations of sounds. I love the timer functionality (it dims the sound as it nears turn off so as not to be too abrubt a change and wake you). The extra sounds are totally worth the premium price.
B004PGO25O|5.0|The success or failure of this book rests on how many people read it, take what Steven P says and then takes control over their demons and finishes the Task. I am of the former.<br /><br />This was the tonic I needed. Just to know that others had faced the exact same personal challenges and blocks as myself, gave me the much needed extra belief and courage I now possess to 'Ship It' (read it & you'll understand)<br /><br />And besides the in-your-face approach, there is a lovely literalism to this short read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|My family is using the kindle fire, two kindle fire hd's and a nexus, all of these units are accessing the battery hd with no issues.  We really like the battery hd to keep track of the percentage of usage that is still available.  Great product!

This is not the case!<br />The characters are truly well depicted.<br />The psychological depth of this husband and wife duet is a masterpiece.<br />The plot is so unpredictable that will keep you guessing to the last page.<br /><br />Just read it!
B001BR5F4C|5.0|In all due respect, they gave Tarantino the oscar for his Django.  But Django did not deserve it.  The gave it because they know he deserved it for the KILL BILL series.  Kill Bill should have won the oscar or at least nominated.

0689835604|4.0|My great nephew likes the book. I think the flaps are a little too big, on some pages it takes up the entire page...making it difficult to find the flap.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I have been hearing so many things about this album & i admit it is not for everybody but it is very artistic, some great creative tracks in my opinion. Ye did not release ANY vidoes or official singles for the album because he knew overall it would be received negativly by close minded people, but at the end of the day you have artistic beats & classic Kanye lyrics which in my opinion makes this a hit
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Very bright and a good way to pass time.. easy to play helps kids learn colors and to connect the dots..over all I would recommend this game to others..
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The fact that it was short wasn't the issue. It was the fact that the book seemed to be hastily written - it has been mentioned before that many a time a similar adjective would be used in succession giving the book a lackluster impression and makes me feel like I was reading an amateur piece of work.

B00BI73CVI|2.0|I rented this for $0.99 and was glad I spent so little - I just couldn't watch more than half of this and was super disappointed.  I give it a couple of stars for high production value and Anne H. does a credible job singing, but it is so OTT and bodice-ripping and chewing up the scenery.  The acting overall just isn't there and did not pull me in at all.
0449000729|5.0|Anyone interested in English history will love this book. Good characters and storylines carry you through the centuries on a grand trip back in time and back almost to the future.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|Doona Bae really stood out in this film -- felt like she was the star.  Loved how the movie jumped between the past, present and future with intertwining plot lines and overarching stories and how the same actors appeared in multiple roles and as various races and nationalities.  Kind of reminded me of The Matrix, which was funny because Hugo Weaving, played multiple villains in this movie.<br /><br />Very impressed with how this film covers such big topics as slavery, women's rights, homophobia, etc., without being overly preachy.<br /><br />Favorite line: \\"What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\\" Beautiful!<br /><br />P.S.  Not seeing any problem with the fact that several White actors played roles as Asians, or that Doona Bae played the role of a White Southerner.  People not being fixed to time or race is the whole point of this movie.

B00CISC2DA|5.0|From the opening horns of \\"Gemini\\" to the fading strands of album closer \\"Semena Mertvykh\\" there isn't a moment on Boards of Canada's Tomorrow's Harvest where you wonder whose album this is. There has been a veritable silence from the direction of Scottish brothers Marcus Eoin and Mike Sandison since 2006s Trans Canada Highway ep. The silence has ended and we are all the better for it.<br /><br />Tomorrow's Harvest isn't a rebuild from the ground up;  nor is it a retread of past glories. This is an album showing artists being true to themselves and not being anything but what they've always been.  What's that? Purveyors of the past and sound tweakers of the future. For a lot of folks the feeling you get listening to a Boards of Canada album is nostalgia. It's the sound of Juno Synths, Yamaha DX-7s, distorted breakbeats, and a childhood set to repeat play on a Quasar Hi-Fi VCR. With masterpieces Music Has The Right To Children, Geogaddi, and The Campfire Headphase, Boards of Canada had a mainline into childhood.  Not a Disney childhood, or an ABC Afterschool Special childhood. A Latchkey kid childhood.  A darkened living room with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a can of  New Coke, watching something you shouldn't on The Movie Channel because your mom forgot to lock the channel. It's a childhood of wonder but dark spots that could lead to something darker. Tomorrow's Harvest is the soundtrack to a Choose Your Own Adventures book, a walk home from the city park late at night, or a car ride to the roller skating rink.<br /><br />\\"Telepath\\" is a perfect example of what Boards of Canada do so well. The sound of a man talking and counting would be harmless enough, but what they do to it.  They process it, taint it, make it into almost something Orwellian and create something dark out of it. Synths float in the background as the counting becomes more drawn out and more unintelligible. They lead us right into \\"Cold Earth\\" with a swath of warm keys and a big beat that brings to mind some sort of futuristic scene. The soundtrack to a new Ice Age, perhaps. Lead singe \\"Reach For The Dead\\" permeates with a menace. An analog hiss as if a record needs to be flipped. Then a theme emerges through the noise. Something resembling a past life soaking in through the present one. It took a few listens, but this song is nearly transcendent in how it works its magic on you. \\"New Seeds\\" brings a pep in Boards of Canada's step not heard in earlier tracks. There seems to be less of the media clips from earlier albums and more of Marcus and Mike's own magic used to create those lonely days of childhood where you were left to fend for yourself. \\"Come To Dust\\" is a sci fi dream, floating in the ether.<br /><br />I've had to sit with this album for a week before I could attempt to put my feelings about it into words. Even now, I'm not sure I can do this album justice. Tomorrow's Harvest doesn't change up or replicate Boards of Canada's past. What it does is refine their sound to its essence.  They make the synthetic seem organic. That's been their gift since the beginning. Tomorrow's Harvest ranks as one of their finest achievements, and one of the best albums of the year so far. Good to be back in Boards of Canada's headspace;  or headphase.brings to mind some sort of futuristic scene. The soundtrack to a new Ice Age, perhaps.

B000I3UMKM|3.0|This movie was filmed in the 1960's so it was fun to watch for the old phones, cars, and equipment.  It is very slow moving.  We had to fast forward several times, but did want to see how it finished.  Maybe Mickey Rooney's role would be a little insulting to some.

B00COWOXGE|5.0|This review is regarding the 20th Anniversary Edition of \\"The Fugitive\\".  I have been wondering if Warner Bros. forgot about \\"The Fugitive\\" and how amazing it is.  I can finally look forward to a REAL High Definition Blu Ray of this movie!  This release, as I have seen on blu-ray dot com, has a DTS-HD 5.1 sound mix AND it is REMASTERED in 1080p!  The other thing I am stoked about is that it will be in the ORIGINAL ASPECT  RATIO that it was filmed in at 1.85:1.  The previous blu ray release was a JOKE.  It was Dolby Digital, Aspect Ratio was 1.77:1, and it was NOT remastered into High Definition.  blu-ray dot com states \\"I haven't seen a Blu-ray transfer this bad since Young Guns. Even my non-techie wife noticed this one was subpar. The quality definitely picks up a bit as the movie wears on, but it's still rather dull and flat, and detail is moderate at best. There is a definite lack of definition and attention to fine detail evident throughout. Kimble's hair, especially after the train wreck, often looks like a glob of color rather than fine, individual strands of hair. Black levels are moderately good at best, and dark scenes are plagued by extreme amounts of grain. Some bad compression is present throughout, noted primarily on straight, shiny objects (especially on chrome-colored lines on cars), looking blocky and chunky rather than straight and natural. Granted, director Andrew Davis, director of Under Siege, has employed a similar style in both that film and this one, a bleak, muted, and \\"grainy\\" look, a look that definitely doesn't lend itself very well to a \\"pretty picture.\\" Still, there's nothing to be excited about with this transfer. The experience is best described as resulting in a downer, saddened that such a wonderful movie appears as such a poor looking transfer on Blu-ray, no matter how much of it is intentional on the part of director Andrew Davis and how much is the result of a bad disc (and I believe the latter to be the main culprit).\\"<br /><br />I am VERY excited that Warner Bros. finally decided to give \\"The Fugitive\\" the treatment it deserves.  I will own this one when it comes out.>I am VERY excited that Warner Bros. finally decided to give \\"The Fugitive\\" the treatment it deserves.  I will own this one when it comes out.

The first month on this lifestyle change my PMS disappeared...and I was considering having surgery to correct the problem.  I love bread, pasta, sugary stuff and mexican food so....whatever I crave the most over the course of a week I allow myself to have on Saturdays from sun up to sun down.  I have to tell you though what I want to eat and what I actually eat are two different things b/c I cannot physically eat whatever I want b/c it makes me feel lousy.  I find that having a little of each thing I want is more than enough and very satisfying.  I eat fruit, lean protein, and tons of vegetables.  I have lovely Cesar dressing and parmesean crumbles with fish or chicken.  This is my lifestyle now and I know it will take every bit of a year to get off all of the weight but I am in no hurry I know it will come off with this way of eating.  I made a committment to weigh myself quarterly so I do not become obsessed with the scale and that is one of the best things I have done for myself.  I will leave you with my favorite recipe.  Take a trimmed chicken breast and pound it flat with a meat tenderizer...salt and pepper generously, core a jalapeno pepper and fill with a mixture of cream cheese and cheddar cheese...roll up in chicken breast and secure with a toothpick or cooking twine, then wrap it with bacon and bake until bacon is golden brown on 350...delish...of course I give the bacon to my husband but it leaves a great flavor on the meat and keeps it moist.  Also, tacos in romaine lettuce leaves....fantastic.  good luck peeps.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I feel this one warrants it.  I read the first two books 3 times each, I loved them so much.  I know the characters so well... well, I know the characters in the first two books well at least.  I am thoroughly and completely disappointed in this book and how this author has used her readers.  This was a terrible approach to the story and I agree with another reviewer who proclaimed they were rooting for a break-up.  Me too.  I think in this book, Sylvia made Eva a dumb blonde naivete and Gideon impossibly unreachable, weakened, and overly mysterious.  The extra stories were far from satisfying and the extra drama in the couple's relationship was downright annoying.  I feel that Day changed the essence of the main characters, and it didn't go in their favor.<br /><br />The ending was abrupt and far from captivating.  Once I found out this is a 5-book trilogy, I vowed I would never read another Sylvia Day book again.<br /><br />I hope you're reading this Ms. Day, because I think you lost a lot of supporters with this trash.  If someone advised you on this story and counseled you to draw it out like this, you should fire them.  I would have rather waited longer for a better story that actually finished the trilogy.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|works just like the full PC version great product. Use the full version on my home PC and never have an issue.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I wanted to read this book because a person I knew and was very close to was operated on by Dr. Alexander over 10 years ago.  Having personally met Dr. Alexander I somehow felt that if there were any truth to eternity, he would be someone whose story I would believe.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|It took my phone some time to actually use it, but once it used it, I was able to do stuff on the big screen. It did drain my battery rather quickly. I still cannot find the charging cable that goes to the slimport device. Any help on finding the charging cable to the SlimPort Device? Thanks!!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book, couldn't put it down. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for giving us more Gideon! I can’t wait to read the next books. I don't understand why everyone is so mad; I want more of this story. There are still too many things going on to rush to a finish. I would rather read 5 books and have a complete story than 3 and be unhappy with all the unanswered questions.
B004SIPA0A|5.0|This is a classic of it's genre.  eggsolent performances.  Wonderful directing. Anything by Robert Rodriguez is good, fer sure, so there.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Sadly disappointment.  The stunts were too far fetched and the humor, in my opinion, could have been incorporated a little better.  Thought it was kind of cheesy the addition of the son chucking the bad guy off of the roof.  A cheesy method to incorporate the original Die Hard into this one, which was a terrible effort.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I've finished the book and loved it through and through... i did find it a tad annoying however, that he is so fixated on this one bird, but i guess thats his prerogative. I'm sure if i knew him I'd talk some sense into him.<br /><br />Now what is funny is i've started finding other books similar to this and went as far as to play Skyrim on PS3 to capture the same excitement i.e. start out as a novice and then go to college and go out and gain reputation fighting knights and mages etc
014241493X|2.0|I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about John Green. I have yet to read The Fault In Our Stars, which is rumored to be the best, but I read Looking for Alaska, a book better than Paper Towns, but Paper Towns itself was downright painful. This book seemed to have been one where the author decided to sit down and just throw words out onto the paper. The plot does not seem cohesive, and the girl that the book is supposed to be focused on is hardly in it at all. What I have found in connection between Looking For Alaska and Paper Towns is a constant theme of unreality. The humor does not seem pure, it seems dry and textbook. The popular people in real life don't just drop their status and become friends with the losers. People don't just ditch their graduation and run off in a mini-van to New York. If you want to save yourself some time, read the first 50 pages and the last 10. All the pages in between are entirely irrelevant. The clues the boys are given do not seem intelligent or clever, not at all like the pure genius represented by J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter books. To me, this seemed like a book an author was forced to write to gain some bucks. Save your $10, this book is not worth it. What a waste of a day. I did not feel at all connected to the characters, and let's face it, teenage girls cannot just run off across the country when they never had a job. This book was crap.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|DO NOT waste ANY time getting this app I LOVE IT!!!!!!! ITS AWSOME!!!! definately a boredom buster!!!!!! for kids of all ages!!!! I have a four year old sister and she LOVES IT!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend this app!!!!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It was a very moving story.  It was tastefully done.  The horror of the tsunami brought chills and goose bumps to my skin.  What a miracle that they all survived.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It was kind of a busy movie since it brought together so many characters, but it is my favorite movie with enough action and drama at the right balance. It also has a bunch of comedy, which adds a whole star to my review.
B008BM9L72|2.0|after about a quarter way thru the first book it gets rather repetitive. Poor storyline, runs like something from a mills and boon. disappointed - i was expecting more with all the hype - didn't bother to finish.
1423140605|3.0|This wasn't as good as the other books in the series, and certainly not as great as the Percy Jackson series, but it sets up for the next book and leaves a cliff hanger which hooks the fans. It also has tons of creativity.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|just as good as the first book, i found it hard to put down. I'm looking fwd to the third in the series.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The movie with Gerard Butler was amazing and stays true to the musical. I know all of the songs by heart, and know more about the musical than most other people. If you buy this, you will become addicted, and you will be sucked into obsession for this movie.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Interested but sometimes I had to skim CBS it was too much boring detail. Like the characters & where the story may lead:)
0345803507|3.0|I wasn't able to buy most of what was happening in the story, but I still felt like I was there. I loved the ending, and I felt it was written better than the second book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I had to retread the last page twice because I couldn't believe it would end like that. Comparable to ending a book mid sentence/ thought:( very disappointed !!
B000WZAE1I|3.0|With a star filled cast, you'd think that the movie would be great, but not so much. The plot is great, but I just wasn't in love with the chemistry from the actors nor the way the movie was written. The two main characters start out hating each other, but then after a magical boat ride from the eccentric Robert DeNiro, they are madly in love. I just couldn't get into it. And the main character just magically happens to be part of the royal family. But I loved the ending, and there was a lot that redeemed the movie, such as Rober DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer's acting.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I missed this when I was a youth, but the material still hold and it was good read. Can't wait to have my boys read this.
0345803493|3.0|The story is just ok, and I wasn't sure whether I like the writing style or not, but the feeling of the characters came across, and I ended up liking it in the end.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This a very good book. I couldn't put it down. It was only slightly predictable and the ending had a great twist. One of the best books I've read in awhile!
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I was expecting a sequel to Phantom of the Opera, but this was more of a fanfic. It takes place a little longer after the first story as is believable, but it was still great with amazing songs, and a heartwrenching ending.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I like the music. I think the puzzles are interesting and absorbing and I find myself using this game to kill time whenever I have a wifi connection. The only thing I don't like about it is that I need a wifi connection to play the game.
B00B23O96A|1.0|its sad when a group of talented musicians with so much clout and cred come  together and release such a bunch of lazy crap with the full expectation that we all will\\"just gota have it\\"because we just know\\"it's gota be great\\".guess what..it's lazy pretentious dribble.safe your money and your ears and give this a pass.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|The physics of this game are quite realistic. The car moves and bounces and rolls just like I imagine a car would with the same things happening to it. I bet it would get easier if I get the hang of the controls... I certainly can park a real car quite well!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story can't wait to read the whole trilogy<br />I feel like i was in the hunger games with Katniss!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Blue rays are great and I picked it up for 30 bucks. The picture quality for the movies are all great, and the sound was defiantly re-mastered since I have all the movies on DVD and can compare side by side.  Packaging is a little hooky since its just a booklet with the movies in slots. But I've taken them all out dozens of times to watch and haven't scratched them yet like some other reviewers have stated. And I haven't had any trouble playing any of the movies.

B001DHXT1G|3.0|Hulk smash, banner run, general hunt, girl gets caught in the middle. The best part about this iteration of The Hulk is that he fights the abomination.  Its a decent movie otherwise.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Quick shipping! Addicting to watch. Just wish the third season didn't cost so much, but will complete my collection some day.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|If you are a die hard fan of the original Thing, you'll probably always be disappointed with any prequel or remake. However, if you a fan of the original movie, the prequel is defiantly a decent nod to the latter.  Sure, there are parts that could be better, but this movie completely explains the mystery from the first movie, and it does it in a generally good way.  The best part is the last 5 minutes of the movie, and its almost freaky how accurately it was ended.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Quick shipping! Addicting to watch. Just wish the third season didn't cost so much, but will complete my collection some day.
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Some listeners want a single, definitive, recording. Others are collectors who enjoy comparisons for a greater enjoyment and insight into the music. For collectors Della Casa must rank with Janowitz (von Karajan) and Schwartzkopf (Szell) as must have recordings. Each very different. There are a dozen more to pick from: choose your vocal and orchestral preference...<br />Te Kanawa/Davis, Jessie Norman, Pop has a great voice but seems to me not always well served by her orchestras and directors...Plenty of others...But, I think, avoid Solti... He wants to strip away the idle sentiment and superfluous emotionality...but then is left with raw bone...not suitable for the poetry....Not beautiful at all...<br /><br />For me what is special about Della Casa is her ability, when necessary, to project a sense of hesitancy (facing the mystery of death)with a sublime high, clear voice. Hers was the first recording, and so the sound quality is not perfect by today's standards. But the engineers have done a very good job, and  everything comes through clearly enough to get the impact of her poetic reading and sublime voice. (orchestra a bit muted and cloudy.)  Schwartzkopf has her mannerisms and vocal tricks. ( A bit like watching Lawrence Olivier Shakespeare films.) That's how it was done in those days and Schwartzkopf (and Olivier) were the absolute best at it. Once you get past the mannerisms to her reading and ability to extract every ounce of poetic meaning from the text, this recording is extraordinary. I guess you could extend the simile and say Janowitz is the Marlon Brando equivalent. It is all so natural!!! No distractions. Just a clear understanding of the meaning of the text. A great balance between her lovely high, clear, voice and the richly dense texture of the orchestra. von Karajan is not one of my favorite directors. But here it feels he got it right...<br /><br />Another way to characterize these three performances is to say that Schwartzkopf's technical bravura makes you pay attention; Janowitz simply enfolds you into the heart of the poetry; and Della Casa reaches out to penetrate through the listener's distractions....<br /><br />These three recordings are beyond a five star rating. Buy more than one of these, and look for outstanding recent recordings too. But do listen to the Della Casa...
B005SAZI9A|4.0|not perfect but a great break from the formula crap of the usual offerings. I strongly recommend it even if it has few flaws. If you liked Harold and Maude or King of Hearts you will like this movie.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|I realize this movie only appeals to some people, but it's perfect for our family. My dad somehow knows a lot about birds and no of the rest of us do. This movie kinda got me looking a little more closely when I see birds.

It was that poor.<br /><br />The way she tried to tie everything up in a package but it just was not well done nor did it work out.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I read the Secret a few years ago when it first came out and came across this book by the same author.  This book is about how you can live a 'magical' life by being grateful for everything in all areas of your life.  In purchasing this book which takes you on a 28 day gratitude journeyI suggest that you buy a journal or you can create an on line journal to keep/track your daily record of things for which you are truly grateful. In reading this book it made me realize that we take so much for granted and that when we show gratitude for what we have, we attract more to our life - like attracts like.  The book is filled with a crock full of suggestions that guide you on how to see things that you should be grateful.<br /><br />When you first start the book it may feel as though it is asking for a lot of your time through the reflection and recording 10 things that you are grateful for daily, but please stick with it and through effective time management you will find that it is worth your while. Great book for self discovery also.<br /><br />All in all great read!
B005HJAOLY|5.0|King has found his inner child and is keeping a tight grip.  His young characters are very believable, but perhaps a little older in the mind than their actual age.  He picks the things that scare us and manages to make us believe we are kids again.  So good!

B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I downloaded this to primarily to work on my company's page, but wasn't able to find a way to do so. Perhaps it's an oversight on my part and I'll figure that out later. Otherwise, if you post to your personal account -- or just have to keep up on your Kindle -- it works fine. However, I'd use a smartphone app if you really need minute-by-minute push notifications. The advantage of the Kindle version is that it's much easier to type and post from it than a phone's smaller keyboard. Haven't checked its ability to upload images, though.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This movie was not what I expected , Tom Cruise did an awesome job .. I will definitely be adding this to my home collection . He is phenomenal in his prime, he keeps on getting better

B00008WT49|2.0|SACD version via B&K seperates, B&W CM9s, analog source.<br /><br />In my opinion, I dont think the musicality, musicianship, vocal performance is that good. So, i am not a fan, and this album didnt change that. I did not enjoy the performance. I find it boring and dull. I thought the engineering was just ok. I didnt like the seperation, and I think it lacked imaging. As if the the paino, or certian instruments where kept distant and hidden, mutled in the mix, because they knew it was nothing special. So, it all comes together as nothing special. I will likely never listen to the album again.

B0061PEAUY|5.0|As a first read of this author and having watched Bones as the tv series I was not disappointed. The plot moved along at a fast pace and the characters did not reveal any quirks that would have made the ending easy to determine who was the guilty party.
1416955070|4.0|My only true complaint about this book is that you never knew who the story was coming from. It wasn't from her perspective or anyone's in the book. It was also a little slow getting to anything to actually happen.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Good action movie with the latest 2012 happenings  --  drone attacks, government agencies violating the Constitution with its citizens, outsourcing pharma manufacturing to the Philippines, etc. so we can fight our enemies, both foreign and domestic, more effectively.  As another reviewer said, Aaron Cross has a \\"pathetic\\" beginning but he is now confident and enhanced by some blue pharma pills so he can think and fight better and endure pain, enabled by an amoral research MD/PhD serving the country who knows Aaron Cross as \\"Number 5\\" after drawing blood and checking his vitals 12 times over 12+ months (my Chinese take-out place calls me \\"Mr. XXX\\" via caller ID after my 2nd order) . . .  the Rachel Weisz character is very bad with names, I suppose.<br />Now, Cross needs the pills several times day . . . will he be raiding the Philippines plant every 6 months or so . . .  can he handle Outcome II \\"assets\\" taking green pills in hand-to-hand combat when they're sent to \\"close down\\" the operation, now that the CIA knows Cross can hear drones launching TV guided missiles . . . stay tune for Bourne Legacy Penultimate - the Cross Strikes Back.

B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I love this DVD...I've already watched about 5-6 times. The sound is great and the setlist is a dream for Priest fans. Especially, the deep tracks like \\"Starbreaker\\" \\"Night Crawler\\" \\"The Sentinel\\" and \\"Blood Red Skies\\"<br /><br />...and what better way to open the show than Rapid Fire and Metal Gods! For some reason, much better this time around than the British Steel tour.<br /><br />Rob Halford's voice is in fine form on this tour as he nails some amazing high notes during Night Crawler, Blood Red Skies, and Victim of Changes. His only weakness is changing outfits between every song. One thing I love about a HALFORD show is he sticks to jeans and t-shirt.<br /><br />KK Downing is greatly missed, but Richie Falkner really delivers the goods. I especially like his intro to \\"the Sentinel\\" with Glenn.<br /><br />The editing on the DVD is a bit fast, however the cuts are not just completely random. For example it will go from wide shot of the stage to a medium close up of Glenn to a close up of Glenn's face to an extreme close up of his fingers on the guitar.<br /><br />One major weakness of this DVD is lack of crowd shots. They keep cutting back to this generic master shot of the crowd from the side, but there are very few close ups of any fans. If you were at this show, don't expect to find yourself! It's almost like they didn't have permission to film the crowd or something?! Compare this with the Electric Eye 1986 concert in Dallas where the fans are a major part of the concert.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to attend the Epitaph show in Denver and this London DVD is almost identical. One minor detail that I miss is the cool as heck Epitaph/Legacy banner during Blood Red Skies. At least all the pyro is still being used.<br /><br />Anyway, if you saw Priest on the Epitaph tour this is a great souvenir to pick up and relive the excitement. The massive setlist should please all types of Priest fans.<br /><br />Please note the setlist on the Amazon production information is way out of order.  Never fear, the actual DVD has the real setlist in the order it was played during the tour.on is way out of order.  Never fear, the actual DVD has the real setlist in the order it was played during the tour.

1885167776|5.0|The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan is an excellent self help book which explains how to prioritize tasks when there are an avalanche of things to get done in the near term. The book shows how people quickly lose focus and accomplish little or nothing in an attempt to get too many things done on an immediate basis.<br /><br />The authors advise people to stick to one thing or a few things until completion before taking on other tasks. This translates to narrowing focus. A corollary is that one thing at a time advances the world. In addition, do the most important thing first when everything seems to matter. A related concept is to choose to do the right things correctly.<br /><br />The authors discuss the behavioral dimensions of getting<br />things done too. Once a new behavior becomes a habit,<br />less discipline is required to maintain the new way of<br />doing things. Habits are important because these instilled<br />behaviors help to determine our future success.<br /><br />The book discusses analysis paralysis and the stultifying<br />effect this has on getting anything done. In essence, the<br />new rule is to get ahead by getting started. Mark Twain<br />warns people of internalized biases in the popular phrase:<br />\\"What you know for sure that just ain't so.\\"<br /><br />The One Thing is a wonderful book which addresses the dangers of analysis paralysis and the lack of focus in trying to wade through too many items on the agenda. The authors make it clear how to set priorities to begin getting the right things done the right way. This book will benefit management at virtually every level in an organization.<br /><br />First Published on Blogcritics

B00AMBH70S|3.0|Bourne Legacy is a pretty good spy thriller. Renner is great and Ed Norton and most of the supporting cast is solid. Pacing and production values including photography are up to Hollywood standard. The director did an awful job with Rachel, who is a fine actress. He directed her like she's some halfwit sniveling emotional infant whining and whinging in every scene.<br />This is hardly credible since her character is supposed to be a PHD in Chemistry and Science with a heavy security clearance working on top secret defense projects.<br />She's directed to behave like double digit IQ employee at Wal Mart. Aside from that, the film is watchable.
B001NI24OI|2.0|The TV series was better. How did this movie get any traction? Billy Bob Thornton, as much as I love his deadpan, was so out of place without his usual aura of irony and self-loathing. The movie lacked the depth of character so alluring with the series. Ah, well, nice to know I can still be surprised (or disappointed).

Is this the parent hook? Young kids will keep watching just to hear the next ribald phrase uttered by the heroic siblings. Oh, let's not even talk about the seduction of Hansel by a naked &#34;good&#34; witch. Writing 101: Who's your audience?
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This was one of those rare movies that is pure enjoyment. Great story, good acting, great ending. A must see.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This movie was billed as something completely different than a thriller. I polled my friends and they agreed. Having said that, I could not discuss the movie with anybody because they had not seen it and, being a true friend, I could/would not reveal any spoilers. Good story, well told.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire HD, give me access to my dropbox account and allows me to keep movies and video's with easy access without using up all the storage on my Kindle.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Why? Characterization. I cared about the characters. And I didn't have to have a poli-sci degree or a minor in Middle Eastern studies to understand what the flack (pun intended) was going on. This movie has a sense of irony and critical insight into what we are sending our young people into the Middle East to do. At the end of the day, it's a really good story.
1781162646|5.0|This was a great book to read on our recent beach vacation, not too long, paperback, and a page turner.  In addition to the story, I loved the NC connection (where we live) and the memories it brought back of going to coastal amusement parks as a child.  It's not a horror book like some other SK books, though it does have some creepy elements.  Looking forward to his next book!
0345529057|5.0|George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire<br />Winter is Coming<br /> A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) is an \\"epic fantasy\\" by George R. R. Martin, a writer who has transcended traditional fantasy. The story is currently planned to consist of seven volumes, with five already published. Unlike most fantasy, the characters are vulnerable. The avenging son does not necessary get the chance to redeem his father. Good does not always come out on top against evil and the heroes are not guaranteed to triumph, let alone live through the story. This keeps the reader in suspense. Readers grow attached to characters that are suddenly and brutally removed from the narrative. Martin's story is set in a fictional medieval world similar to Britain's dark ages. His aim throughout the story is to show conflict and build the characters storylines until everything comes together in the final volume. The story is broken down into three major storylines; the war of five kings and aftermath, Daenerys Targaryen reclaiming the Iron Throne, and The Wall.<br /> In the second volume of this epic, the war of the five kings begins. When the king of Westeros dies during a hunting trip, five people proclaim that they are now king. This leads to all-out war between one time allies and families, friends and foes. The aftermath of the war stretches the remaining current volumes. We see families switch sides multiple times during the war, favoring one king over another out of ambition. We see kings rise and fall as betrayal and ambition set in.<br /> Daenerys Targaryen is the last Targaryen, a once dominate family in Westeros, of royal blood. Hers is a story of reclamation. She struggles as a timid child being sold, by her now deceased brother, to a horde of barbarians. We see her grow up as she is threatened by the king of Westeros, sees her husband die, and becomes the mother of dragons. We see her evolution through the series into a courageous and proud queen. A rival for any army or power. Shefeels her duty now is to now reclaim the Iron Throne and set right the mistakes of the people of Westeros. She stamps out slavery when she encounters it and gives the people hope for a better way of life.<br /> The Wall at the northern tip of Westeros, is an intriguing part of the story. The Wall is manned by the unwanted, the criminal, and the brave. It is a 700 foot wall of ice that protects the seven kingdoms from the monsters on the other side. The stories of the nightmares that lurk beyond the wall are forgotten by the people in power during the majority of the story. While the war rages on, the hundred or so men standing watch at The Wall must deal with the fact that \\"Winter is Coming,\\" a saying of the now shattered Stark family of the north.<br /> Throughout the five volumes currently available, we see these major storylines beginning to come together. Martin does a fantastic job of taking the happiness out of fantasy and using real historical brutality of the times. A vivid world that has the readers on the edge of our seats, ASOIAF is truly an epic rivaling even that of Tolken. At some point in the near future, we will hopefully see the culmination of Martin's work.<br />References:<br />Martin, George R. R. (1996). A Game of Thrones.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have read all of the Millennium Trilogy and all three were great. The last book of the series, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest, was the best of the series. It was one of those books that I regretted getting to the end of. I wanted it to go on and on. Not that the story left me questioning the outcome, I just enjoyed it so much, I didn't want it to end.

1885167776|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:1481217976 Buy House Rent House Repeat until Rich]]I know that success comes from great focus. However knowing what to focus on can be the difference between success and failure. In the book Gary talks about 6 Lies or Myths which hold us back, I really related to a couple of them. First \\"Everything Matters Equally\\" so everything is a #1 priority! that is a big mistake and one that leads to no focus at all. I could really relate to the term \\"Multitasking\\" until I read this book I was very proud of the fact that I could do so many things at one time, but after some great thought during the process of reading the book I discover that I did many things poorly at the same time. So much for Multitasking. The One Big Thing I got out of this book was the answer to a problem I was having with my business and I just did not know how to solve it until Gary asked this one question. \\"WHATS THE ONE THING I CAN DO SUCH THAT BY DOING IT EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE EASIER OR UNNECESSARY?\\" This question got me to think about the problem in a whole new way. That one thing from the book was the best advice and worth more than the price of the book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their work their relationships and their life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was sad but real I cried so many times I don't know how their are more books but I intend to read them
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This is a cute hidden object adventure.  It worked reasonably well on my Kindle Fire although sometimes it was slow. Puzzles are easy but if you do get stuck there are hints.  easy and fun
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I have to admit it has been a long time since I have played a game like this.  I found it to be challenging yet not overly frustrating.  I did use the hints to help clarify a few steps but they were solid hints without completely solving the puzzles.  I look forward to more of the Room.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I was blown away by this book and how in-depth it got into the life in North Korea especially in the 1990s. I had no idea just how bad it was. The book follows six people and you really get a feel for them, and through them see how life was different for different social groups. A very complete and enjoyable read.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book! It is a story about the trials and tribulations of a mother-daughter relationship, and a lost love rekindled by the death of a mutual friend... but at the wrong time. I won't say much more because it would give away the twists and turns to potential readers. It was sweet, as are many of Sparks' books! I wish there were more writers like him! I love the settings of all of his books, along the Outer Banks, as I've been able to go there on several vacations.

B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is the Eminem of the 21st Century, if you ask me. Great instrumentation, great lyrics, overall great album. Expected more of the radio-friendly tracks (&#34;Thift Shop&#34;, &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34;), but was pleasantly surprised to find more intelligent, meaningful, well crafted songs. Looking forward to seeing if these guys can keep it up in the long run.
0525952926|1.0|This is my first-ever review.  Normally I read the reviews of others, read the book, then move on.  I enjoyed \\"Fall of Giants\\" - the plot lines were solid and the character development was well constructed.  So, after reading \\"Fall of Giants\\" I was really looking forward the arrival of \\"Winter of the World.\\"<br /><br />I have to tell you I was terribly disappointed.  Maybe the book was rushed to market before it was ready?  It seemed more like a book from a new writer rather than an accomplished author like Ken Follett. In the process of trying to wrap every possible historical event from 1933 - 1949 into a single book, he created a series of plot lines so shallow and improbable, as to be almost laughable. The characters were poorly developed caricatures.  Their emotions and relationships were obvious stereotypes intended to convey whatever political or moral message happened to suit the author at that moment.<br /><br />Incidentally, my review isn't blistering because I disagreed with him ... his messages were all fine.  I disliked the book simply because it was so poorly written.  I love it when a book pulls me in, leaving me anxious to pick it up the next day.  I never felt that emotion with this book.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't buy this book.  Let's hope he does a better job on Book Three of the Trilogy.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Surprises abound..though if you know your wizard of oz stuff..you kinda see it coming...i love the rich colors and people

0470901071|2.0|this book was riddled with mistakes question labs don't match the question numbers not added right and i'm only up to chapter five. Im very frustrated there are times when the book explains things but I find when it comes to diagrams in the book you waste alot of time trying to figure out what is happening should be broken down easier this i can forgive but the mistakes no... this is hard enough without that i don't know if other books of this topic are the same but this is i know that!
B00BF123WG|2.0|My issue is with the video quality during the last 30 minutes of the stream.<br />There were scenes with anywhere from  50% to 95% of the picture completely crushed out.<br />Really disappointing.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was horrible. Long and horrible. Plot didn't make any sense and it went on forever. We watched because it was supposed to be the #2 movie of 2012. Nope. Terrible
B0042KA4VO|5.0|if you like vampires, werewolves, witches; then this is the show for you.  It can be a bit campy at times, but the baddies are really bad and the good guys always make you root to them.  The physical dvds were received in excellent condition.

0385342071|4.0|When Poppy Wyatt loses her engagement ring, an antique, three-generation-old emerald and diamond ring given to her by her fiance, Magnus Tavish, in a hotel fire drill, her life as she knows it is over. Just when she thinks things couldn't get any worse, Poppy's mobile phone is stolen, immediately rendering the emergency contact number she distributed to the hotel staff in case they located the ring useless. Her luck begins to look up, however, when she discovers an abandoned mobile phone in a litter bin. Following the universal law of finders keepers, Poppy pockets the phone and immediately begins using it as her own, with hilarious, and often unexpected, results. Little does Poppy know that what she found was actually a company phone that formerly belonged to Violet Russell, the personal assistant to Sam Roxton, a brusque, no-nonsense public relations executive. Sam and Poppy eventually come up with a rather unusual phone-sharing arrangement, in which Poppy keeps the phone in order to intercept any calls about her missing ring, with the condition that she forward all pertinent emails and other work-related information to Sam. As their lives (and texts) become increasingly intertwined and Poppy becomes unintentionally immersed in the mercenary business practices at the White Globe Consulting Group, Sam and Poppy's lives will never be the same again.<br /><br />I have a very dysfunctional relationship with Sophie Kinsella. I adored both Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan and continued to dutifully read the followup novels in the Shopaholic series in spite of a rapidly waning interest. Despite this, I was still interested in reading Kinsella's other work and began delving into her standalone novels. After being thoroughly underwhelmed by The Undomestic Goddess and Can You Keep A Secret? and actively disliking Remember Me?, you can imagine my reluctance to explore any of her newer standalone releases. But I am, if nothing else, a glutton for punishment with an innate curiosity, and I couldn't resist when I saw one of her newer releases for 40% off at Target. Thankfully, I am happy to report that my Sophie Kinsella standalone curse seems to have ended with her 2012 release I've Got Your Number.<br /><br />Poppy Wyatt is a classic Kinsella heroine in the same vein as Confessions of a Shopaholic`s Rebecca Bloomwood. Like Becky, Poppy is spunky, flighty and a little insecure, as well as harboring a secret that has the potential to change her life forever. Unlike Becky, however, Poppy is a much more nuanced character with a backstory and personal growth that had me crying and applauding in turn. Poppy is undeniably a people-pleaser and a bit of a doormat, too intimidated to assert herself lest anyone be the least bit offended or put out. Always thinking of other people's feelings first, Poppy invariably puts herself last. At times it was difficult to watch the more unscrupulous characters take advantage of her generous nature. Poppy is also a physiotherapist. Although she is passionate about her work and proud of the fact that it enables her to help an innumerable number of people, Poppy's occupation is simultaneously a source of shame and embarrassment when it comes to Magnus' family. Surrounded by a group of academics and intellectuals who are more interested in being published in academic journals than in the feelings of those around them, Poppy is intimidated by their intelligence and inevitably feels inferior when she's unable to keep up during particularly combative games of Scrabble or in conversations about the latest publications on the fourth-century virtues and the stoics. Poppy continually struggles to find acceptance and belonging within a group of people from whom she couldn't be more different.<br /><br />Sam Roxton is an absolutely charming love interest that stole my heart right along with Poppy's. Sam isn't an unrepentant `bad boy' or womanizer waiting to be saved by the love of a good woman.He isn't an angel with a heart of gold with a savior complex who wishes to rescue or help every woman who crosses his path. He is simply a good man. Hard working, intelligent, capable and not without a rather unique sense of humour, Sam Roxton is a man that any woman would be lucky to have in her life. Now, that isn't to say that Sam isn't without his fair share of flaws. He can be impatient and quick to temper. His curt, no-nonsense demeanor can often be interpreted as cold and distant. But this does not make him unlikeable in any respect. Rather, all these flaws and attributes coalesce to make a character that is undeniably real. Kinsella breathed new life into the often hackneyed, cliche romance-genre hero and instead crafted a character that was easy to root for and even easier to love.<br /><br />It is during Sam's increasingly frequent interactions with Poppy that his character truly begins to shine. Sam and Poppy are equals, and he treats her as such. He values and appreciates her and doesn't hide this fact. He is complimentary and thankful when she helps him at work. Perhaps most importantly of all, Sam challenges Poppy to be the best version of herself. Isn't that what we ideally strive for in all of our relationships, be they romantic or otherwise? Sam is supportive and empowers Poppy to demand what she rightfully deserves in her life, rather than settling for the sake of keeping the peace or to avoid being difficult.<br /><br />If there was one aspect of the story that felt a little lackluster, it would have to be the secondary characters. Lucinda and Willow are archetypal villains, utterly unscrupulous and, more often than not, patently ridiculous. Poppy's friends were relatively amorphous apart from a scant couple of identifying characteristics. Ruby is unfailingly nice while Annalise is an unapologetic trouble-maker and coquette who apparently has no qualms about flirting with her friend's fiance right in front of her (Remind me: Why was Poppy friends with this person, again?) If there was one instance where the secondary cast shone, it was in Kinsella's creation of Wanda, Magnus' mother and Poppy's prospective mother-in-law. Although she is initially portrayed as a formulaic antagonist, I was pleasantly surprised by the direction Kinsella eventually took with her character. She provided some much-needed insight into Magnus and I was fascinated by the twists and turns Wanda's relationship with Poppy eventually took.<br /><br />I've Got Your Number is Sophie Kinsella at her finest. Irreverently funny (There was a particular scene featuring Beyonce's `Single Ladies' that had me laughing aloud, much to the confusion of those around me) and achingly heart-warming, this is one novel that shouldn't be missed! I've Got Your Number is an utterly engrossing thrill ride from which one never wants to get off. How engrossing, you ask? Well, I was so absorbed in Poppy's story, I was awake until after 4:00am one morning because I couldn't bear to put this book down for an instant until I knew how it all would end! I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed in the slightest and wound up going to sleep with a smile on my face a mile long. I highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for a quick pick-me-up.

B00BQXLG1C|3.0|This is the perfect group of games for introducing children to English in a fun way! There are so many games that even if they get bored of some there are plenty of others to play. For ten dollars, though, I am very disappointed that not all of the games function properly, for instance in the game with falling numbers nothing happens at all besides background music. If the few problems were fixed this would get five stars for sure, but until then don't waste your money.
0800141660|5.0|A dark, heart-wrenching tragedy cleverly disguised as a wry comedy of manners. One of Jane Austen's best novels has been converted into one of the best movies ever made. From the brilliant screenwriting to the fabulous cast, it never skips a beat.

B00005M989|5.0|I bought this for my sister in Afghanistan, she is deployed there.  The delivery was a little slow, but condition was great.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a really good app for the kendle fire, iPhones, IPods, iPads, and androids. I honestly think this app is better than regular texting because it is faster and u can have fun profile pics. I'm in fifth grade and I'm pretty sure this app is good for ages 8+.
B008Y78M60|5.0|I found the movie very interesting and historically close to the truth. I would recommend it highly. A good picture .
B005MMYEF8|5.0|This is a prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand.<br /><br />The episode was well thought out and gives real insight into the beginnings of some characters within' the show from the first season. I was definitely not disappointed with another great season.<br /><br />It's very well done! Being set into the same society and places we were presented in Blood and Sand, but taking place a few years just before Spartacus's epic. Most of the cast from the previous show is back, the produces did fairly well making them look somewhat younger. seeing some familiar faces just years before Spartacus is good, gives us a bit more connection and more in depth to the characters themselves.<br /><br />Featuring more of Batiatus, he brings the show to life with his role.<br /><br />You definitely don't want to give this season a pass!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked the book, but it is really also a reach--Unusual to say the least, but a must read, Flynn is very good.  Read some of her earlier works, I think she's written some better things than this one, but this one just took off. I think the ending confused and disappointed a lot of people after such a complicated,involved story.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|loved the characters and the underlying &#34;language&#34; of flowers. I will be more judicious in my flower gift giving in the future.
B0011I9L8W|5.0|How can humble me make a rate or attempt to comment on Oscar Wilde?  It is Oscar Wilde what else is to be said? Brilliant? Delightful? Amusing? Insightful?Troubled? Always relevant.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Whether you're a 'Floyd fan or just curious, this is a wonderful way to experience the Pink Floyd live show as fantastic as they always were. We'll most likely never be able to see another live Floyd show and this is a great pair of discs recorded at the height of there heyday without Roger Waters, but, it's  still great folks!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read this AFTER the much acclaimed Gone Girl Gone and found it to be much much better!  I usually follow up on writers after I've once read something I liked, like Gone Girl, and really thik this one is much much better.  Read it Flynn has become a favorite.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Awesome action packed movie. One of the best yet. This  movie kept you at the edge of your seat and every second was filled with action and thrills. This is truly a must see and Bruce is like fine wine he just keeps getting better with age.
B00B5AP7NY|1.0|This movie is a complete joke.  If you have played the game you have seen this movie.  If you want to watch the movie just turn on the game and watch all the cut scenes.  This movie is the game cut scenes stitched together into a movie and boxed with a Lego character so you will be willing to pay $15 for something you already own.  Warner home video should be embarrassed to treat there fans so poorly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good search and escape game for kindle app. wish there were more levels. hope they get some soon. waiting patiently
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|My son purchased the DVD for me. It said I can watch it Digitally. I put in the code and it brought it up on to Amazon to put it on my Kindle Fire. So I did it. You charged me $4.95. WHY??????? I tried to take this off. I don't want to pay a rental charge on a DVD that I own. What is going on???&#62;&#62;&#62;
B0002IQNAG|5.0|this is an amazing tribute to an awesome movie. I don't think i've seen many movies get as well treated as this release except maybe the patlabor special editions or the alien multi disk set.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The exact day that I got my kindle this was the first game I got. After loving the pc and Xbox versions, my friend Thomas told me to get this version. And it's now my second favorite kindle fire game of all time. Although it loses half a star because it updates slower than the Apple version. So please Mojang, update it faster and then it'll have 5 stars.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Seriously, I hope that Judas Priest are far from done! But, this is an excellent way to go out video wise. The sound and mix are excellent! I didn't mind Ritchie interacting with the audience. He's no KK, but he's a great guitarist. Check out his solos in 'Victim Of Changes', Another thing Coming', & 'Beyond The Realms Of Death'. JP must have tried out thousands of guitarists.<br />  The drums and bass are fantastic in this mix! Everything is good in this mix! The song selection is also really good. The only low point for me is the choice of an Acoustic version of 'Diamonds and Rust.' I prefer the metal version! I prefer the metal version on all songs! This and Vengeance '82 are must have DVD's of Priest! Let The Metal Rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0812984412|3.0|I saw the movie when it was in the theaters then thought I would buy the book and enjoy more details of the story line - especially the last when the people go \\"off world\\" to escape the future earth's pollution.  Well, worked my way through the book and the ending did not include any \\"off world\\" escape, just sailed off to Maui to escape the bad people of the big island.  What a let down!<br /><br />Got to say this is the first time I liked the screen play and movie much better than the book!
B005XI9456|5.0|Great Christmas CD.  It was a lot better and a good break from the run of the mill carols and songs that make the Christmas season sometimes unbearable.

B0084IRC88|4.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides a very interesting perspective on history and helps explain why the West has come to dominate the world.  However, in the process he strains to avoid including the impact of anything possibly \\"racist\\" - eg. differences in culture or physiology.<br /><br />Diamond's main point is that ability to cultivate crops and tend herds (determined by geography and available native species) allows setting aside resources for innovation and war.  Germs acquired from domestic animals then played decisive roles in the European conquests of Native Americans, Australians, South Africans, and Pacific Islanders.  Animal-based means of transporting food surpluses were also a pre-requisite for development of technologically innovative societies.<br /><br />Factors Encouraging Farming:  Declining availability of wild foods, development of methods to harvest (eg. flint blades attached to handles, for harvesting; baskets; mortars and pestles to remove husks).  Cereals were a first crop.  The best area for this at the time was the Fertile Crescent.<br /><br />Factors in Domesticating Animals:  Carnivores are too inefficient, want a fast growth rate (rules out monkeys, apes, elephants), easy breeding (rules out vicunas), good disposition (rules out African buffalo, hippos, zebras), limited panic tendency (rules out gazelles), herdable (rules out antelope - males fight when confined).<br /><br />Another key Diamond point is that domesticated plants spread faster across Europe-Asia because of the long distances at similar latitudes.  Conversely, Africa and the America's longest distances are primarily north-south, posing greater difficulty because of the great climate differences.  In addition, the dry Texas area acted as a barrier between the SE and SW U.S. for transmitting crop-growing lessons.<br /><br />Diamond then concludes that the long East-West axis across Europe-Asia helped spread the development of the wheel for transporting crops, and writing (helped in trade).  Meanwhile, the prehistoric Mexico's wheel and early writing systems never made it to the Andes.<br /><br />Some areas (eg. Australia, and the Western U.S.) did not have readily domesticatable crops.<br /><br />Major killers of humanity throughout recent history - smallpox, flu, TB, malaria, plague, measles, and cholera - are infectious diseases evolved from diseases of animals, according to Diamond.  Until WWII, more victims of war died of war-borne microbes than battle wounds.  Diamond goes on to assert that agriculture led to greater disease because of higher population densities, use of feces as fertilizer, disease transmitting rodents attracted by stored food, and transmission along resulting trade routes.<br /><br />Smallpox gave the Spaniards in America a decisive advantage - from 1520 to 1618 Mexico's population fell from about 20 million to about 1.6 million.  For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the two centuries post-Columbus was about 95%.  Indians did not have diseases to transmit back to Europe because they had much fewer animals, did not drink their milk, and did not keep them indoors.  (Eurasia had 13 species of big domestic mammals - some also useful for cultivation, and the Americas just one very local species - the llama, confined to a small area in South America.)  However, tropical Asia, Africa, Indonesia, and New Guinea had cholera and yellow fever - making those areas much more difficult to colonize.<br /><br />Acceptance of change is another important factor - Islam, until about 1350 led Europe, until its religion began holding it back.  (Diamond also mentions later that inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent undid their agricultural advantage by cutting down trees, allowing the sandy soil to become a major enemy.)  Similarly, China formerly led the world in technology and ship-building, but then regressed under subsequent inward-focused leadership.<br /><br />Food production increases population size andalso acts to make societies more complex.  For example, Diamond believes that a large society that leaves conflict resolution to members is guaranteed to blow up.  A second reason involves economic and welfare considerations - goods in excess of an individual's needs must be transferred to a centralized authority, which then redistributes these to individuals with deficits.<br /><br />Overall, Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" provides interesting insights into early world history; however, I strongly suspect Diamond's efforts to be politically correct limited his insights.also acts to make societies more complex.

B006ZZAMWK|5.0|When I first heard One Direction on the radio, I didn't think much of them.  I believed that they were just another one hit wonder band that was going to fade as fast as it rose.  I'm glad I was wrong.  They keep on coming out with new songs and I am always looking forward to hearing them again.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|My husband and I are big Andrea Bocelli fans. I have watched his PBS special, Love In Portofino at least 5 times. I had to have the music. This CD is so soothing and romantic!  I cannot wait until the DVD comes out on Amazon so I can watch the concert any time I feel in the mood.
B003BYYDXW|4.0|I like the CD.  I was just disappointed that I accidentally bought this on Prime even though I already had it on the disc.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Worth the hype! Though this was a great movie! Love Bradley Cooper...and Jennifer Lawrence was wonderful!! Good date night movie!
B00012QM8G|5.0|This film got a 5-star due to its story and theme.  Though the story is grim, the message is that we all can make a difference if we have the courage to take a stand.
0439023513|5.0|My kids and I love these books.  They are creative and enjoyable.  A great escape from our world into another.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It can be very frustrating.  You think that you have everything lined up and then you have no more moves and have to get new deal and the cards that you get ruins everything that you have done previously.
1781162646|3.0|May contain SPOILERS:  The title of my review refers to the feeling I had throughout this book. From very early on, the mystery here reminded me of one of those old Scooby-Doo cartoons: Which of the apparently nice guys in the story would turn out to be the killer ? (The only thing missing was the bad guy taking off his rubber mask at the end).<br />  There were so many clues to the killer's identity sprinkled throughout the book that I thought for sure Mr. King was setting us all up for a big twist that would reveal a killer the reader never suspected. But, that never happened. The killer was who I thought it was the whole time. (I'm not bragging, by the way -- I think it was pretty obvious from very early on in the story.) So, the mystery aspect of the story was lacking some suspense in that regard.<br />  The part of the story that I found most disappointing, however, was the ghost story that never really got off the ground. Again, I thought at some point there would be a classic King moment with the main character (Devin) finally encountering the ghost of the girl that haunts the park. Never happened. In fact, Devin never even sees her.<br />  Still, I gave the book 3 stars because, despite the lack of suspense and virtually no memorable horror / supernatural moments, it is an OK old fashioned \\"who-dunnit\\". And, after all, I always did like Scooby-Doo.<br /><br />  P.S.- Before anyone slams me for expecting this to be more of a horror / thriller, they should read the back cover of the book where it says \\"Joyland is at once a mystery, a horror story, and a bittersweet coming-of-age novel....\\"<br /><br />Follow Up: *SPOILERS*  In the days since my original post I have seen many reviewers mention how moved they were concerning the boy's fate ( A tear jerker ?? Really ??) Personally, that whole subplot did nothing for me. Just like some of the other points I made in my previous review, I felt it was predictable and lacked any emotional impact.<br />The more I look back on \\"Joyland\\" now, the less I like it. It lacked suspense, mystery, and action. And, at it worst, simply tried to be too \\"cute\\". (All of the \\"wearing the fur and dancing with the kids\\" stories gave me cavities.) So, go on and do the next Hokey Pokey by yourselves. I'll sit this one out.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I haven't been so captivated and engaged by a novel since momma by Terri McMillan. I was 21 when I read that book. I am now 39. I have been held captive; prisoner to her words. Picturing every sentence and phrase in my mind. Thank you!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Story confusing, did not know who was what character throughout movie....I only gave it a three star because of sets, costumes, and acting were good.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Before the new update I really loved this app.  I checked it all the time.  Now everthing is so small &amp; very blah.  Please go back to the original version or atleast give the option to those who want it.  In the meantime I'll try to find a different weather app.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|there are more songs on the album than I got with mp3 download.i got screwed out of 4 songs,should have bought album
B0063GORYU|2.0|Can't stand the ads.  I would rather have a choice to pay something rather than have those ads in your face screens.  Game is excellent, however.  I have the same game on my iPad but have a choice of no ads, and that would rate 5 stars for me.
B005LAIGP0|2.0|I found it to be a lot of nonsense, done mostly in the dark. I would not bother to watch it a second time or suggest it to any of my friends. To my enemies, maybe.
0446554995|5.0|This book provided a perfect ending to the four book set that began with Brimstone. There were some great plot twists, as well as more development/ back story of the Pendergast characters. I would definitely recommend this book to friends.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i love it, it makes me feel like im ironman myself, such a great game. two thumbs up . .
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Being a Merlin fan, I have enjoyed the entire series.  However, I believe series 5 is the last one(correct me if I'm wrong).<br />The final season is excellent but the final episode is not one I would have ever expected.<br />Actually quite surprising and shocking!  For all you Merlin fans out there it is definitely one you should not miss.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a fun puzzles to do.  But it needs more puzzles and more categories.  Like the # of pieces option.

1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan's Cooked is a masterpiece that you must read if you love to cook and want to explore the origins of grilling, brazing, bread baking, or fermentation. Michael's curiosity and pursuit of these origins goes to his disciplined hands-on approach to doing everything. It may be more than you want to know but it will never be less than a thorough introduction to how to do what the experts do in everything from whole animal grilling to making cheese and beer. Michael loves people and appreciates their expertise and accomplishments. His attitude reflects what a Korean kimchi teacher told him and it explains why I can't make good bread when I'm angry: \\"Hand taste [as opposed to tongue taste], however, involves something greater than mere flavor. It is the infinitely more complex experience of food that bears the unmistakable signature of the individual who made it--the care and thought and idiosyncrasy that that person has put into the work of preparing it. Hand taste cannot be faked. Hyeon Hee insisted, that hand taste is the reason we go to all this trouble, massaging the individual leaves of each cabbage and then folding them and packing them in the urn just so. What hand taste is, I understood all at once, is the taste of love.\\"<br /><br />Jerry Woolpy
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I legitly could not see the last 30 minutes of the movie because I was squalling and crying like a baby! Heartbreaking movie and by far the Number one most traumatizing movies I have ever seen! I even knew what all was going to happen and still cried!
B005RUV0NY|4.0|It moves at a snails pace but not your average zombie show. I can't wait for the show to start back up again.    EDIT Dec 2014 - The show is still great and still moves at a snails pace. If you haven't started watching it yet, I would suggest waiting till the show runs its course and binge watching all the seasons. Waiting for a new episode each week and waiting for the mid-season to start back up in Feb is misery!
140123769X|5.0|This series is constantly evolving and I love the new storyline with the cubs. This volume was a little depressing but I definitely enjoyed it!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|T he movie for this book looked way better. They didn't have Holley in here at all. I was looking forward to this book after seeing the movie, but wasn't what I expected. Some ways good some bad.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|My wife and I love the show. It has great understated humor and pulls you in so that you are cheering for the good guys.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This movie was so bad that I barely made it through the first 20 min. I rented it bc I like Jeremy Renner but I couldn't keep watching it even for him. Just a really bad plot, nasty witches, blood and guts spewing everywhere. Maybe a middle school boy would like it though my middle school boy wouldn't be allowed. Don't waste your money. I wish I could get my $3.99 back from amazon!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I know and have loved all the other Die Hard movies but this one was just bad.  McClane (willis) is not so stupid that he couldnt figure out his son was obviously some sort of agent after seeing how he was driving.  And the driving... I know Mercedes are built tough but after you see that tank pushing cars around like they're made of cardboard, how can you believe a Mercedes SUV can derail it?!? After that I just started getting angry from the bad acting (worst acting I have ever seen Willis do and the action was just pathetic. 1 star is probably 10 too high but thats what I have to give it. I just hope the next one can (if anyone will even fund it) gets back to the way of the originals.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Love history and historical novels. I live in an Indiana town that has Quaker and underground railroad history. Some local towns were mentioned.
B001QL5MAA|3.0|i gave this book only a three star due to many spelling mistakes and at some times its hard to follow because what should have been two separate paragraphs often run together.<br />the sci-fi was pretty good though very descriptive.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|The movie is nothing like the book. It was awful to watch and I still have not finished watching the entire film.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|i was bored one day and wanted to watch a movie, it was good, there's not much wrong with it. it was entertaining to say the least, at least it was better than the previous one. i think the franchise should now follow McClain's (sp?)son, Bruce is just getting too old to do action movies. i felt the action in the movie had to slow down so Bruce could keep up.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great kids movie funny for adults too. It was just a quick pick for the kids that ended up good for us to watch too.
B007Z9R69M|4.0|i was bored one day and wanted to watch a movie, it was good, there's not much wrong with it. it was entertaining to say the least. i did like the fight scenes, well done.

B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Hours of fun trying to beat times. You can see scores for other players which seems like a competition. Recommended
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Very amusing. Laugh out loud at moments, grimace and relive something my own mother has said at moments, blush and feel embarrassed at moments as well as heartfelt tender moments.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is probably most complicated puzzle game I have ever played. Graphics are amazing. Lots of fun and expertly conceived
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Didn't buy through Amazon but bought directly from the seller who participates here in Amazon. It's been a week since i got it, first couple of days it was about 10 seconds ahead, since then it is ahead only by 2 seconds and seems to be consistent in that state. When it slows down i just give it a shake, take it off my wrist and lay it in the table dial up. It gains back the lost second that way. Read about this somewhere and seems to be working for me. So in effect it stays just 2 seconds ahead of atomic clock and when it slows down goes on par until i speed it up again using the method i mentioned earlier. I've a Citizen Eco-Drive that doesn't come close to this watch's accuracy, in spite of adjusting it goes fast by 1-5 seconds. For the prize, this watch has been amazing so far. It's just a week so time will tell (or rather this watch will tell) how it'll hold up over longer period of time. If you go with beige color you might be restricted by the different color straps that you can use, with black/blue dials you might have more choices, not the case with beige though. But that's the least of concerns anyway.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Wonderful graphics and hours of fun. Does not give any clues or hints without a search on another page.not always clear on what one should be looking for.
0345529057|5.0|I bought these books because my boyfriend and I loved the show. A friend recommended reading the books, so we decided to get it. At this price, it is well worth it. I am still on Book 1, but it is much much better than the show. Definitely read the books if you are a big fan of the show.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|I really love this watch. Not so big, not that small. Will order another Invicta watch soon. Very professional packaging.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I would like to have the history of Mahjong included in this game.<br />There is a great deal of information about this game on the internet.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|After enjoying almost every minute of the Die Hard series up to this point, although taking out the helicopter with a car was a little over the top even for John McClane, this movie was just stupid.  The plot is very weak, the character interaction was weak and forced, and I'm completely disgusted with what they have done to an otherwise great series.  Leave it to Hollywood to screw up yet another action series.  Seriously, I want my money back.  Actually, keep the money and give me back the time I wasted watching this movie.  From the cheesy action sequences, the movie makers look to need the money worse than I do.  Come on Bruce, you can do better than this right?  If not, please retire and let your fans remember the good movies you made.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very addictive game, love expanding the park and finding the amber.  So far I have only spent about 7 dollars on this game.

B005LAII80|5.0|Gratuitous violence and constant Urban-scowling. Thoroughly entertaining but rather gory. This isn't a romantic or family night move - unless your family is hardcore badass. Also, Anderson's hair is cute!

B0034G4OYA|4.0|The story is somewhat predictable, young girl wants to be independant of her protective father, yet the characters make the movie entertaining for kids. The father's heart is in the right place, but his daughter's heart is drawn toward a human and vampires don't have a good history with humans. Stereotyping judgments are re-examined in light of giving individuals the opportunity to prove their own character. I did get a hoot out of the skeleton couple and his reactions.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My 11 year old and I love this game. This is the first one i have played over again. The puzzles are challenging without being impossible. Better than any of the other games. The only thing I didn't like is the sound but we muted it and that fixed it.

B003IKMR0U|4.0|This game is loads of fun. It's easy to learn, fast-paced, and people love it. I wouldn't really consider it a good kids game since it involves zombies and shotguns, but it's great for young adults to adults. My only complaint is that the cardboard tube the game comes packaged in isn't all that durable.  It's only moderately thicker than a toilet paper roll.  If they had made the tube out of plastic like Yahtzee or something, it would probably be a little more durable and transportable.  This game is worth it, give it a try!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This phenomenal soundtrack contains almost every second from the movie. It is almost as good as actually watching the movie. I am absolutely in love with everything about Les Miserables, and this is no different.<br /><br />addition: when i tried to download from my cloud onto my phone, the cloud insists on putting the songs in a random order which makes it not as enjoyable. if anyone knows how to fix this, that would be appreciated.

B00C7KYXHW|5.0|SO, here's the summary - great acting, fantastic storyline - well worth watching BUT be careful as you get more into this series - let's just say that you need to remember that Hannibal eats his victims, this is set before the movies, this Hannibal is cold and calculating, there is nothing really bad to see (gory scenes are run of the mill crime scenes showing the bodies with different organs removed - kidneys, heart, lungs, intestines, liver) and this Hannibal is a GREAT cook who serves meals to his guests every week - - - especailly good when he prepares his specialities - Braised liver, sausages, mixed non-meat courses and of course, kidney in a unique sauce!)<br /><br />Get it??????<br /><br />Nuff said!

0345803507|5.0|There are not even words that can come to mind on how wonderful this book was. I don't know what people think about saying this book is not good It is beyond good beyond awesome. They just don't know good reading. E L James has out done herself with writing the finale chapter of this Trilogy and I am actually sad to see it come to an end.<br /><br />The book starts with Christian and one of his nightmares just like the second book. However, Ana is there this time and they are now Married. Christian is a wonderful husband even if he is still controlling. It is one reason I love him so much as a character. He is wearing cut off jeans on the beach while on his honeymoon and boy does E L describe him well.<br /><br />In this book almost two has past since the end of book two and they waited a month to get married plus the time they been on their honeymoon. He has shown her so many places including London. I loved the part with the on the boat when she took off on the Jet Ski. I though Christian was going to have a heart attack. Ana was sneaky not telling him she was going to take it.<br /><br />Not everything is hearts and flowers as Ana says. They do have fights still, but the most biggest thing in this book is dealing with the 'unsub' as Sawyer calls him. Ana has a need for speed while they are out running a person in a Dodge chasing after them at hundred MPH. Boy the after scene of that chase was just as hot.<br /><br />The first 'unsub' is given away rather early in the book however, the second one is not. I was rather shocked on who the second was, but I love being surprised.<br /><br />There was one point in the book I wanted to actually scream at both of them. However, it was Christian more because of something. He comes around though and I was moved on what it took for him to realize (finally) that Ana is never going to leave him. She'd risk her own life to save not only him, but his sister.<br /><br />The emails are here again which I enjoyed. I wished E L hadwritten out more of one scene based on one of the emails. However, she did a great job as always. I wish there were more book in this Trilogy and showed them having some fun after their surprise.<br /><br />Christian's first Xmas in the Grey's house was wonderful. I enjoyed that little part into his past. I loved his side of the first and second meetings with Ana in his office then in Clayton's. I was glad that he finally told Ana about how him and 'Mrs. Robinson' started out. It helped them both when he opened up to her. I know this is one Trilogy I will be rereading for years to come.

0553801473|5.0|George RR Martin is an excellent writer and is so skilled at making chapter after chapter compelling, even as character POVs shift rapidly.  His writing is very detailed and personal, while providing a constant stream of information from past events that slowly weave their way into the plot.  This is not a series for those who want rapid resolution or a clean outcome in 7 books or less.  Rather, this A Song of Fire and Ice is a hugely ambitious narrative of life struggle past, present, and future.  Relax and savor the tale.<br />It is difficult to rate A Dance of Dragons as a stand alone book, simply because it is book 5 of a huge story with few clean tidy break points.  To me the most compelling chapters are those taking place in the North (Jon, Bran, Theon).  The battle with the Others is slowly taking shape.  Jon attempts to prepare the Wall for the struggle with winter while attempting to end the distinction between &#34;wildings&#34; and the rest of the kingdom the Night's Watch is charged with protecting.  Bran finally is trained in using his special gifts by the mysterious Brynden, and we learn the details behind the importance of the weirwoods.  The children of the forest enter the picture finally too.  Ramsay Bolton is a great villain along with his father Roose Bolton.  Theon Greyjoy transforms into an entirely different character and the reader has a great amount of sympathy for him as his suffering unfolds.  I also like that Mance Rayder plays an important role.  Melisandre remains a bit of a mystery although it becomes increasingly clear that she has Stannis confused with Jon in her prophecies.  Jon's assasination is an important step to moving him closer to his role in the conflict with the Others.  Why did Hardhome burn 600 years earlier?  The Arya chapters have had a harder time fitting into the big scheme of the series, but she is clearly being trained to kill some bad folks in future books.  I was also  pleased to see Tyrion reemerge and his plot line was key to understanding the motives of Illyrio Mopatis and Varys.  Tyrion's chapters are always amongst the most entertaining, and tagging him along with Mormont was a great idea.  The young prince Targaryen and his decision to take an army to Westeros without Daenerys leads to an interesting quandry for the aged Prince of Dorne.  I did find the chapters taking place in Mereen to be a bit tedious as times with the constant fretting by Daenerys (teenage angst).  The reentry of Drogon helped move things along.  Back in the South of Westeros we follow Jamie wrapping up loose ends from A Storm of Swords and Brienne is back from the noose.  Cersei is freed and the scheming resumes.  I had enough of Cersei in A Feast of Crows to be honest, so not reading about her for 700+ pages was a nice break.  The Iron Fleet arrives at Mereen to play their part.  Time to pack up the characters and go to Westeros.  Overall, the story evolved substantially but my guess is that 4 more books are needed to wrap up the series (20 more years of writing should do it).

Can I just say how awesome it is to be reading the book, and have to go somewhere and be able to switch to the audible version from the point I stopped reading while I drive to my appointment and then switch back to the book which will have updated to the point that the audible version stopped at when I got out of the car. EXCELLENT! The story itself was of course also lovely and poignant and completely worth reading. The movie is very much like the book, which makes sense as it was written and directed by the original author.  He did a lovely job with both the book and the movie.

0062238868|5.0|American Sniper, The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History was written by the late Navy Seal Chris Kyle.  Because of my military background I found the book extremely interesting but I also believe it would be enjoyed by civilians having never served.  Chris was an ordinary guy.  He grew up of a middle class, Christian family in Texas.  He went to high school, tried college and did some time as a real cowboy working on a ranch.  He went on to join the military and become a Seal, a feat in itself considering that only 10% of the sailors who enter the rigorous training program go on to complete it.  He continued on to be one of the best Seal snipers in history.  Writing was not one of Chris's fortes though.  His book is written in plain language and can be rough at times.  I found that down to earth, every day, brutally honest, not sugar coated approach very appealing.  Others, who are looking for a great literary piece may not.<br />American Sniper is not all blood and guts, as many war stories are.  It is heartfelt.  It has some graphic details but it also shows emotion, good and bad.  Chris talks of his loves; God, Country and Family, even telling of the trouble he sometimes had with the order of Country and Family.  It includes sections written by Chris's wife Taya that show the emotion the military family waiting at home experiences.  My wife read the book and loved it. Having been a military spouse for many years and very politically involved she had heard Chris's story on the news, bought and read his book and recommended it to me.  She could relate to many of the stories, having heard me tell similar ones.  I served as a Seabee, performing some of the tasks for the Seals that Chris discusses.  Our paths may have crossed somewhere in Kuwait or Iraq but I didn't know him personally.  However, reading his story made me feel like I did.  It is rare for someone with his experiences to relay them to others, especially the world in a book and especially to do it so well.<br />After a short introduction, the book chronicles Chris's life.  It starts with his childhood in Texas, goes through his teenage years and on to college.  He writes very candidly about the things he did and mistakes he made.  He appears to have had a bit of a wild streak, getting into an occasional fight, riding bulls and then broncos in the rodeo before getting hurt, eventually giving up college to become a cowboy then joining the military.  He tells of wanting to be in the action, not in a military job on sidelines.  He details boot camp and then on to BUDS (Seal training).  Chris is extremely patriotic and truly believed in his mission of defending our country.  He takes the reader through each deployment, including the enemy, kills he made, his comrades, injuries he and others received, working with the Marines, the Seabees, the Polish Grom (special forces) and even the heartbreak of loosing friends to the war.  Toward the end of the story he tells of the difficult decision he faced in leaving his career and his brothers in arms for his beloved family.  Chris's story has action, emotion, patriotism, sacrifice and most of all the sense of a very humble man doing a job most could never even imagine.  From where I served, supporting missions of men like Chris, I may have a little better understanding of the things he's done and experienced, but his story, told not in a format for military but for civilians truly gives the reader insight into the heart of warriors like Chris and many who serve our country.  With chapter titles like; \\"The Devil of Ramadi\\", \\"Man Down\\", \\"The Punisher\\", \\"Family Conflicts\\", \\"Down in the Shit\\", \\"Dealing Death\\", \\"Mortality\\" and \\"Home and Out\\", it is evident that this is much more than a war story.  I highly recommend it for everyone. It educates readers on what our military members do for our country and I hope gives them a greater appreciation for their sacrifice.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game nothing needs to be changed. If I could  I would Change the cost of upgrades and levels costs.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|I wouldn't have thought that 1992's \\"Universal Soldier\\" needed another sequel.  1999's \\"Universal Soldier: The Return\\" and the two made-for-tv flicks that preceded it had done enough damage already.  Luckily, someone took one of the few intelligent aspects of \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006) and made another film in a series that ignores most of the other ones.  In this case, only the original film is taken into consideration and, even then, ushers in a welcome change of tone, theme, and an interesting handful of conflicting yet somewhat mutually sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Jean Claude Van Damme returns to the role of Luc Deveraux, a U.S. Army sergeant originally killed in Vietnam before being reanimated by the government as a cyborg/soldier known as a UniSol.  As one of the very first members of that experiment, he is now part of a new one: to see if he can be returned to a normal life (if that includes reading People and watching American Idol, count me out). While he's busy playing progress/regress, a paramilitary group has seized the old Chernobyl nuclear plant and kidnapped the two children of the Ukrainian Prime Minister.  If their demands to release political prisoners are not met, they will detonate an explosive to release the remaining radiation at the plant, and probably off that one dude's kids.  As an additional security measure, the group has hired the mini-megalomaniacal American scientist, who developed the latest UniSol technology, and is supplying them with quite the new specimen (UFC fighter Andrei Arlovski).  If the U.S. military's deployment of 4 of their own UniSols fails to subdue the terrorist threat, they may just have to call Deveraux back from retirement.<br /><br />As silly as this sounds it's given a serious treatment by a competent cast & crew, mostly via the watchful eye of director John Hyams (Dragon Eyes).  Not much of a budget either yet this is much more entertaining than so many theatrically released films of the past decade.  I liked this movie a lot.  I am not a huge fan of the original \\"Universal Soldier\\" or Van Damme (though they both have their moments) and I still totally dug this.  Some people feel that it's a rare feat for a sequel to best its predecessor but this does exactly that.  I'm saying that I loved a direct-to-video sequel to a theatrically-released original that I thought was just okay.<br /><br />I knew this would not be a martial arts film but, like the 1st one, I was expecting there to be some martial arts in it. And while there is, it wasn't really what I was expecting or even what I'd normally prefer... but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  However, I can rarely get through a movie review without some obligatory gripes about the fight scenes (excepting maybe The Raid) and here it would be the all-too-obvious use of stunt doubles during a couple of the more ambitious brawls.  I can live with the fact that some of these cats are getting pretty old and can't physically do what they used to but it pulls the viewer out of the fantasy when the white guy from Antwerp is suddenly black from specific angles.<br /><br />Other than that, most of the complaints I've heard about the film seem to be from people who had specific expectations that were not met.  Like the aforementioned change in tone or, perhaps, the limited presence of Dolph Lundgren (Red Scorpion).  While it is deceptive to have him all over the cover, rest assured, he makes the most of what little screen time he has.  I have also heard gripes about the use of locations like abandoned warehouses.  Part of overcoming a low budget is use of cheap location but Hyams doesn't take the easy way out there, either.  These places are dressed and filmed with sort of an open-yet-claustrophobic, hive-like feel, accentuated by the vaguely wintry season and the eerie retro-futuristic score.  This film heavily utilizes influences that the original did not, specifically Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" & \\"Blade Runner\\".<br /><br />The DVD from Foresight Unlimited/Sony has a great 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture.  Language & subtitles only available in English (5.1 Dolby digital & SDH, respectively).  Special features include a \\"making of\\" featurette and commentary by the director and Dolph Lundgren.  To the open-minded action junkie who still counts patience as a virtue, this comes highly recommended.<br /><br />2009ight Unlimited/Sony has a great 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture.

1591845556|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Josh. I bought this one largely because the Portable MBA book was so well done. First, let me say I'm not completely through reading this book. That being said, Josh has a positive and informal style that makes it easy to follow along. He breaks things down in such a way that I can easily understand.<br /><br />As a software developer of over 25 years, I have had to learn and relearn many things over the years. I was interested in seeing how Josh's suggested approach mimicked my own approach in attaining new skills. Needless to say, I probably could have saved much time by adding a few of his suggested steps to my own approach.<br /><br />I found the sections on learning Ruby particularly fascinating as it is closely related to what I do. Just one comment though. I believe Josh's reasons for abandoning WordPress and learning Ruby, while salient then, no longer actually apply. WordPress itself, available plugins, and hosting have matured to the point that some of the top 10 most trafficked sites in the world now run on WordPress. But it is a tradeoff on what one is willing to pay for scalability. By now, even Ruby sites are being overtaken and rewritten in new languages because of language advances from places like Google. However, Josh's approach in learning programming is timeless.<br /><br />The explanation of learning Go was so intriguing, that I have resolved to learn it myself now. I am just about to teach my children touch typing this summer, so the section on relearning touch-typing using the Colemak keyboard was both very timely and highly useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

B00633W614|4.0|I've always enjoyed books by Jeffrey Archer. The 1st book in this series was enthralling, I couldn't put it down. The main characters were strong and independent and the twists and turns as the story played out was very good. Mr. Archer ability to move from one character to another as still hold the story is very well done. This book had a good start but, as i find with all 2nd books in a series, I felt this one waned slightly after Emma completed her sleuthing to find Harry. Although i am looking forward to reading the 3rd book, there is not the same type of anticipation I felt after finishing the 1st one.

You guys really do need to make the two versions noticeably different. But, other than ethics, you would not have any motivation to improve the platinum version. Guess &quot;caveat emptor&quot; is alive and well among meteorologists. :-(  If anyone were to ask if they should purchase the platinum, I would recommend against it.

The overall feel of North Borders gives homage to it's predecessor Black Sands, however this album furthers groove explorations with a more modern and hip direction in production whilst sustaining Bonobos unique moods and down-tempo rhythm.

1781162646|5.0|Afraid he is losing his girlfriend (rightly so as it turns out), New Hampshire college student Devin Jones took a summer job at Joyland Amusement Park in North Carolina. Devin, soon to be known as Jonesy by the carnival staff, quickly fits right in especially when \\"wearing the fur\\". While he quickly adjusts to his job it takes him time to adjust to the loss of his girlfriend. But soon he has other things to occupy him - Mike, a very ill child, and Mike's beautiful mother Annie. And then there is the murder mystery surrounding Joyland, a mystery Devin soon finds himself involved in. Devin needs to be careful or he may be the next victim.<br /><br />Stephen King has long been known as the King of Horror which is a shame because, while he has written his share of horror, his storytelling ability is often overlooked. \\"Joyland\\" features Kingss storytelling at its best and even non-horror fans should like it. The book is a mixture of several things: a mystery, love story, coming-of-age story, and yes a bit of the paranormal. The book is written in the first person from Devin's point of view - Devin is in his 60s and looking back to when he was 21. King quickly brings readers into Dev's character and as King does so well I felt like I was sitting right next to Dev as he told his story. I admit that I was nervous when I heard that King was setting this book in an amusement park because I was afraid he would take the cheap easy way out but to my relief he didn't. Yes, the amusement park is an important part of the book and does have some supernatural aspects, but King never goes for the cheap thrills. I also like the fact that King has added a nice juicy murder plotline to the book - it is not something he usually does but he does it extremely well in this book. The book isn't quite perfect - as with many mysteries the plot relies on a few convenient twists, in this case a well-placed phone call. I also would like to know a bit more about Dev's life now but this may be deliberate as the book is about his past not his present. Those quibbles aside, this is a classic Stephen King book and overall well done.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" was one of those rare books that I wanted to reread the second I finished reading it and it still lingers with me.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I guess if your a dysfunctional pot-head people can empathize with you these days. I suppose if your a nice guy with arrested development, you qualify a  lead character in todays cinema. Sadly, people don't care if your being laughed at or laughed with they are moved by personality not character. If your the type that likes to load a bong and wait on the couch for your government subsidies, you'll like this movie more than I did. I'm tired of simple minded, pathetic humor. Enjoy flyboy!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent utility app for showing battery status on Kindle Fire HD that provides information about available time left for all functions
B001BZF9UY|5.0|This soundtrack is easily one of my top ten movie soundtracks of all time.  The emotion, power, tension, and mood of the entire soundtrack is awesome.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's not a perfect show but it's still entertaining enough for me to look forward to it weekly, so that gets it 5 stars. It's different than Sherlock, more like House with a drug-addicted flawed genius - it gets a bit obvious at times (what TV show doesn't?) but generally keeps my wife and I loving it.
B002C949KE|5.0|I think a lot of &#34;behavioral economics&#34; and a lot of what the author describes in this book as being contrary to traditional economic thought can actually be explained by the effects of imperfect information. No, humans don't always know exactly what their preferences are. Yes, humans sometimes make strange decisions when they don't have all of the information necessary to make those decisions. Another large chunk of this book's attack on traditional economic thought can also be explained by recognizing that a traditional economic cost/benefit analysis is not conducted by using monetary value alone. There are non-monetary benefits and costs to almost every transaction we engage in.<br /><br />That all being said (and I feel like I had to say it in defense of traditional economic theory, which was my major as an undergrad), I really liked this book a lot. What is interesting is how we almost all react the same way to a lack of information or assign the same non-monetary cost or benefit to particular transactions. I also really liked the ingenious experiments the author came up with to test and highlight the clashes between &#34;behavioral economics&#34; and traditional economic thought. The last few chapters on cheating and trust were very insightful. I had never thought of trust as a public good that can be looted, and thus, subject to a &#34;tragedy of the commons&#34; type analysis. Ariely is one clever, engaging man.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I played this when I had company over, and everyone really enjoyed it. I love his voice and plan on getting more of his music.
B009O07NDY|4.0|This is a decent album, and I listen to it with some frequency, but (much like the movie itself) the soundtrack is not quite as magical or moving as the soundtracks for the three original LOTR films.  Somehow, the music seems repetitive, even though there aren't that many &#34;themes.&#34;  There is a stretch of tracks on the second disk that I skip over almost every time that I listen to the CD because they sound very similar and I can take only so much of the tension-filled strings and percussion.
B008JFC6F0|4.0|I purchased it for the 'Elephant' song alone, but the rest of the album is pretty good. I would recommend it.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|I bought this knowing I was going to change it. I've changed the grind, I've completely removed the button strap and replaced it with an elastic band, and I removed the finish from the entire blade - tang and all. My point is that the price of this knife gives you the ability to try things that you wouldn't with a $300 knife. Hopefully you wouldn't have to change anything about a $300 knife. Anyway, I love working with it. It truly is bombproof. Get this knife.

B00915G6MG|5.0|I have watched every episode of all ten seasons and many repeats of each show.  I never tire of watching NCIS.  The characters are great and the actors who play them are superb.  I hated to see Kate go or Mike Franks but Ziva is great. I can hardly wait to see what they come up with for the fall with the cliff hangar from Season 10.  I hope they go on for another ten seasons.  I don't think I will ever tire of the show and the actors.

1623360277|5.0|I took him the book and had him see the Forks over Knives video-  He got a preview of the book; was no longer depressed; and knew that the book could help him overcome and remove cancer from his body.  Other's within the book had had cancer - changed their way of eating and the cancer departed.<br /><br />An excellent book; has features on all of the diseases from heart disease, diabetics, cancer, diseases of the brains that had been overcome by switching from the American Diet to the diet of the world; planet earth where the poor eat a diet similar to what Jesus ate.  The book tells the stories of those who try to take shortcuts and fails.<br /><br />Bruce
B000001OAA|5.0|Still the best album ever!  Still my favorite and stands the test of time!  No wonder it's still selling so many copies!
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Unfortunately this review isn't even about the app or how it worked as it never downloaded after buying it 5 days ago. It would stop downloading and it never advanced past 13%. All of my other apps have downloaded fine. Be very guarded of downloading this on a kindle fire. It's a shame it won't download as my 7 year old played it on a kindle fire at the store the week before. She loved it and so I tried to download it when we returned home, but she's not happy since it never loaded completely. Talked with tech support and it seems the only fix is to de-register my Kindle Fire and start all over. Not sure about that! We will see??
0062215507|5.0|This book goes beyond my expectations as it is so well-designed and put together! I do not consider myself as a  hardcore Harry Potter fan but i enjoyed most of the books and films and I reaaly believe that this book is objectively perfect!!!

B007KZY1YY|5.0|Having not been much of a romantic reader in the past, this different tale and development of the two main characters is quite intriguing. There are many parallels with real life yet just enough romance and unrealistic story telling to make this second part a good tale.  It made me want to read the third part of the trilogy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was the best read ever! I enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. Thanks Dr. Alexander for giving us more glimpses of heaven!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|After much agonising and angst between the two main characters as well as many love scenes, they finally get their act together after a real drama which involved their intertwined lives.  The end is a little disjointed and seems to have been written in a hurry to finish the trilogy.  It could have been better constructed to match the previous two parts.  It was still an enjoyable tale.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|If you enjoy psychological thrillers that surprise and keep you guessing, you will probably like Side Effects.  The story line is novel: a new anti-depression medicine causes people to sleep walk and do things they don't remember...including some really bad things.  Yet things are not as they appear....something else is going on.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Side Effects, it did not grab me the way some of my all time favorite psychological thrillers did (Misery, Sixth Sense, Cape Fear, Silence of the Lambs, Death Trap, etc)

B004GJVI5C|4.0|Good casting and some good writing are what make this film enjoyable through multiple viewings. But it would be hard to sit through even once if it weren't for the lush backdrops of Charlestown and Boston. This is one of the rare caper flicks that have a sense of place. The scenes are not shot in back-alleys in Toronto posing as Chicago, or Vancouver posing as Anytown USA. Even though the streets look a little too chocolate-boxy, like they just had the cleaning people in and took away all the scaffolding and rubbish tips to make it nice for the conventioneers and tourists, it's pleasant to have some verifiable reality up there on the screen.<br /><br />The best things, beside the location sets, are Jon Hamm being an overbearing FBI jerk, the rubberized zombie-nun disguises, and the grotesque Fergie character talking about gelding a horse (Pete Postlethwaite's last role). Rebecca Hall is nice too. She is English but really has the proper general-American intonation down, neither faux-Boston nor incongruously Midwestern nor that awful crass combination of Brooklyn-Jew and California-zonker that so many Brit and Australian actors come up with when playing Americans (Peter Sellers in 'Lolita,' Rachel Griffiths in 'Blow'). She is pretty and brings off a difficult and rather thankless role of being, well, pretty. And a victim.<br /><br />Bad things are those elements that beggar belief: Ben Affleck's ridiculous fake tattoos, which seem to have been applied the day before and have all the trite multicolored-dragon elements that will be regrettable in ten years. Jem, the character with the stupid leprechaun tattoo-decal on the back of his neck, would have not been wearing a gold cross on a chain (what is he, Sicilian?), and if he ever acquired that green tattoo, it's a pretty good bet that his associates would make him get it lasered off, if only for the reason that it becomes a minor plot-element in the movie.<br /><br />I found much of the low-life social atmosphere repellent too. The Affleck character would not have been moving in those circles--how much has his character made by now? two million dollars? Fergie, the English-Irish capo, would have had a different self-presentation too. He's supposed to be a florist in a yuppified neighborhood, but he looks and behaves like the assistant fight-trainer in an old boxing movie.<br /><br />My husband would easily give this a 5, but the sordid and incredible aspects knock it down a notch for me. Still, I've seen it a dozen times, and rented it on Amazon instant only because we recently lent out the DVD I bought!lent too.

B004132HZS|5.0|One of my favorite shows--I can't wait until the third season starts in November! This disc consists of three feature-long episodes.
0316023744|3.0|If I had written this book I would give it five stars. But I expect a little more from Anthony Beevor.<br /><br />Beevor excels at panoptical and episodic histories, such as the Paris book he did with Duff Cooper's daughter. In this book he's very good at describing difficult personalities and social discomfort--Ike's dud presentation and panic at the Casablanca Conference is superb, as are Monty's recurrent bouts of hysteria.<br /><br />Another Beevor touch is the lurid detail of carnage, atrocities, and 'Mondo Cane'-style exotica. We keep hearing about soldiers who lose a hand but keep loading their howitzer or whatever with the bleeding stump. Then they die or shoot themselves. Russian soldiers who lose limbs kill themselves so they won't become \\"samovars,\\" as amputees are crudely known. Beevor mercifully leaves out the explanation that a samovar just sits there, taking in water at the top and voiding hot tea through a cock at the bottom.<br /><br />Lots of rapes in Koenigsberg and Berlin, oh boy what horrible rapes! Meantime, off in the Pacific theatre, Japanese soldiers are eating the natives. They also eat American prisoners, finally they eat each other.<br /><br />These grotesqueries add new zip to a tale that has too often gone boggy from retelling. If Quentin Tarantino ever wants to film a darkly satirical history of the Second World War, this could be the basic source-text.<br /><br />Alas, good storytelling is not always good history, and Beevor is a far-from-reliable narrator. He's catty. He puts words into mouths and heads, based on little or no documentation. He plumps up the roles of minor and middling characters, such as Count Palewski and General Alan Brooke, simply because he has a social connection to them or other personal involvement.  He makes outrageous errors--getting names and locations wrong, and factual boners and stretches (I wasn't keeping score, but other reviewers have covered these in detail). Beevor even drags in the old canard that the Nazis were making soap out of concentration-camp victims. This was a propaganda story from the 1914-18 war, revived again for its reprise, and completely unfounded both times. It might be possible to make a bar of soap using human fat, but it would not be cost-effective; moreover there is just no evidence that this ever happened in either war. Beevor lingers too long on such frauds and unlikely occurrences.<br /><br />I'm going to plow through the rest of the Beevor corpus anyway. This book brought to my attention a few books I hadn't seen.the Nazis were making soap out of concentration-camp victims.

B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Another excellent short story by Brandon Sanderson. I love the concept, new and interesting. I feel like I detect some similarities to Warbreaker in the way the human soul is characterised.<br /><br />An excellent read. Definitely worth it.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland<br /><br />Joyland is Stephen King at his best. If you are a long time reader of King you can see how his style has changed over the years from all out horror to more of a great story with some horror elements. Even if you have never read a Stephen King book, this is a great book to jump in with. Joyland is set back in 1973 in an amusement park. It starts with 3 college kids getting a summer job at the park. King gives a lot of back story to the character of Devin Jones. Dev, for short, has plans for him and his girlfriend that involve marriage and living happily ever after. He separates from her for the summer and has a tough time adjusting. While working at Joyland, Dev learns of a murder that was unsolved and spends the remainder of the summer and beyond trying to figure it out. While I don't want to divulge too much spoiler info, the book gives subtle clues throughout. In a way only Stephen King is able to do, I found myself emotionally attached to the 3 college kids.<br /><br />For readers who don't like gratuitous violence and gory horror scenes, you will be fine with this book. King is able to scare without having to resort to cheap tactics. I highly recommend this book to long time fans and new readers. Due to language, it's not recommended for children.
1401937519|5.0|Fascinating to say the least.  I have always been a believer in life after death, and Moorjani's story simply solififies my beliefs.<br />The question and answer section at the end is very interesting and informative.  An excellent book, well written, & believable.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much! The book moved from one character to another and each voice/person added more to the story! I am now reading with my 9 year old. He wants to jump in every page or so and say what he would or wouldn't do. I am going to donate a copy to my kid's school.  Read. You will not be disappointed.

B00C5W3SBE|5.0|First of all, for all those having a hissy fit about there not being a 3D combo pack, when you buy this 2D bluray/DVD/digital copy pack, you have the option of ordering a 3D copy for $5.99.  It tells you how on the inside of the package.  Now quit whining like children.<br /><br />The movie was amazing and beautiful.  I am a lifetime OZ fan and they did a great job with this movie.  Those complaining about the addition of characters like the china doll need to read the OZ books.<br /><br />Yes, there was a lot of CGI, but it was well done.  Was the wizard lovable from the beginning?  No, but it's not from bad acting.  I don't think we were supposed to like him at first.  He was kind of a jerk, but then grew.  It was the point of the movie.  The story of the witches was enthralling, and the transformations were great!  The movie had fun and enchantment and action and magic.  It did the land of OZ justice.  I know I'll enjoy viewing this over and over again, just as I do the 1939 Oz.

I watched the whole thing instead of stopping because there's no method to get a credit or refund for a bad product.

Our perfectionism and ideas need to be questioned and relaxed.  I am a big advocate of nursing and the african women have it the best....less conflicts with work and culture and more time in a relaxed setting.  I also believe in interaction with animals and dirt to help prevent allergies and kick in the immune system.  All 4 babies had access to animals that enriched their lives.
0061978078|4.0|Here is a snippet from my Goodreads review:<br /><br />\\"Lauren Oliver is back with Lena's story in Pandemonium. The story moves in staccato rhythm and this lends well to the plot but may aggravate the reader, however the story is still pretty good and a surprising ending which is only the beginning.<br /><br />Lena is now living in the Wilds and she learns the ways of the people: how to hunt and gather food, make do with nothing, and form bonds with those who are different and who may ultimately leave you. Since Alex has been gone, she dreams of him and the freedom she was given because of his sacrifice, but now times are harsher- moving from homestead to homestead and facing imminent death every day pulls on her psyche. People will die. Some have.\\"[From Goodreads]<br /><br />Venturing in the Wilds take strength and courage and the new Lena has that. She still dreams about Alex and misses her mother, Grace, and Hana- but in the Wilds, you must keep pressing forward. Some readers may hate the forbidden love thing that seems to have been building up at this point, but the main message of the book seems to be love(er, Deliria) never dies.<br /><br />The book took some time to get through because it is broken down into Then and Now chapters- the Now is more captivating to me, however lends well to the plot and sets the stage for Requiem. Can't wait!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yet another amazing book by Sylvia Day!  Can't wait for the next one.  Characters are so real and you want them to make it!
0425263924|4.0|I was going to rate this book at 3 but I loved it so much more than that. This was the very first time I ever pre-ordered a book so the months going by waiting for it to come out were horrible, that being said I checked her website like everyday for two weeks before the release so I knew there going to be two more additions to the series. Coming on amazon and reading the reviews had me scared but when I finally got the book and read it I loved it. I am a crazy fan when it comes to this series. Sylvia Day is an amazing writer and I don't say that loosely because I'm am constantly reading books. The book is very well written and also has great character analysis.<br /><br />I realized after reading the book that people are just upset because of the price or the time having to wait for the next book. Some people are in to trilogies but not me. I was ecstatic when I found out there would be more. Eva and Gideon's relationship is full of love and passion, also complexity. They are not your usual 'dominant male vs. submissive female' they have the issues of the same that they work together to get better and make their relationship better. Normally the man was abused or had something traumatic that happened to they for them to want to release the way they do on the women they associate as their subs. I loved Fifty Shade until I read this series.<br /><br />Everyone is so upset over how she added in more things to say about Eva's friends but what people don't understand is that was the point of the book. This book starts off right were the last book ends. In 'Reflected in You' Eva and Gideon start out still with bad trust issues and the psychiatrist tells the back off each other and they simply don't do that which makes it worst then when Gideon puts space between them and that's when Eva realizes that the doctor was right which is how their trust is so tight in each other. Now in this book the decide to hide their relationship because their current situation so Eva is forced to live her life single in order to keep Gideon. With that being said I understand why there was a need to have more said about the other characters since Eva is around them more and not all the way up Gideon's a**.  I feel like this was a filler book because book 2 was sooooo good and I'm expecting the next to be just as good.<br /><br />The only reason I was upset with this book was because of the pushed back date and that Eva and Gideon got married. Don't get me wrong I love that they got married but I just wish it was in one of the books to come. Day gives us this 'possible' love triangle which brought a little more sizzle to the book but it ends just chapters later with them eloping. I don't know about you but I love to see a jealous Gideon. Love him!!! I recommend this book to everyone that read the first two, the Fifty Shades series, as well as the Breathless series. But just keep in mind the Crossfire series was way better written than those of the other.<br /><br />This book= ineffable (left me speechless with joy)

In the end, it will leave you with an enlightenment of what is going on all over the world with all of our businesses; not just our food and you will be doing that &#34;connect-a dot&#34; ... with all aspects of our society today. To BIG to fail.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|I remember superman being a lot tougher than this, instead that made him like a wussie, and tight clothing that is not appropriate for kids. More like a girls outfit. And the film is very unrealistic.

B0082SU98U|4.0|It is a great book. It is a little sad at the end. I am a very picky reader and I love this book! I think that everyone has to read this book.
B00A8307BG|4.0|some stinging guitar work as Robin tears through some old blues standards and some newly written stuff from one of the legends of the strat. Putting his own touch on the old stuff is the best feature of this disc not just some rehashed samp that some blues artist blow through. Robin takes over as a vocalist, his singing , is from the heart... adequate which would be the only down side to this disc.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good book that kept my interest.  There is a good balance with giving the details with the child's murder and not being too graphic.  However, I typically don't read these types of books so it was a bit unsettling to visualize or think about the murder (I'm a mother).  Nonetheless, it was a decent read while trying to expand my horizon.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|It starts off fairly strong. Due to the device they use to start the series, you don't have this feeling like the crew isn't believable. Since they are going out into the unknown and even their immediate surroundings are unknown. The cast does tie together nicely by the end of the first series, they start to become a complete unit.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great movie. No matter how old I get or how many times I've seen it, I can always watch it again.

B000ID1J5E|1.0|I thought with the quality of actors this would be pretty good. It was definitely a B movie. I wouldn't recommend it.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel has nailed this kind of role - where the audience is rooting for a very flawed character. His acting is great.<br /><br />Both John Goodman's character and the romance plot are forced. While overall heavy handed in its themes, the movie is a great study of addiction.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's an all ages game for relaxing. Good graphics for the vehicle. The money system is and so is the level.

B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Oscar Diggs is a turn-of-the-century circus magician, conman and ladies' man with dreams of doing great things like his hero, Thomas Edison, but a feeling that he might not be a good enough person to achieve such greatness. When a stop in Kansas results in Oscar being transported, via a twister (presumably several years prior to Dorothy's), to the magical land of Oz, his fortune changes immediately. He first meets  the good witch Theadora, a naïve and emotional young woman who believes Oscar to be the prophesized wizard who would come to save their land from the evil witch plaguing it. As they travel towards the Emerald City, where Oscar will be made the new king and receive a treasure room overflowing with gold, Theadora's obsession with the prophesy and Oscar's charms lead her to fall in love with him, or infatuation at least. They also pick up a new companion along the way, a winged monkey named Finley who swears a life debt to Oscar after he saves the little monkey from a seemingly fierce lion. Through the means of his parlor tricks, Oscar manages to keep his new friends mesmerized until they reach the palace and encounter the distrusting Evanora. Here Oscar learns that in order to take the throne, he first must rid the land of the wicked witch, so Oscar sets out to attempt just that, meeting even more new friends along the way, and ultimately having to prove himself a truly great wizard to have any hope of beating the challenges he is soon to face.<br /><br />Taking on the job of making an original prequel to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" would be a challenging task for anyone, and director Sam Raimi (of the Spider-Man and Evil Dead trilogies) seems as good a man for the job as any. Amazingly, he pulled it off with great success! Financial success, at least. To Disney, the company who produced this project, that must mean a lot, since their 1985 attempt at an Oz sequel, \\"Return to Oz\\" (arguably a better film in many ways) was a financial failure and often panned for being too dark for its target audience (even though a huge amount of 80's kids love that movie to this day, making it a cult classic at this point).<br /><br />Of course, there's more to a film than money, so, despite the fact that \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" earned back more than twice its HUGE budget, is it really a good movie? Well, honestly, it is not perfect, and some of the flaws are pretty huge, but it IS a really enjoyable experience, at least to this huge fan of the 1939 Oz film as well as Return to Oz and various other adaptations.<br /><br />The problems that the movie has are as follows (spoilers ahead, though you probably know this much already): Most significantly, Mila Kunis, cast in role of Theadora, also becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Now, one of the things I love about this film is that it tries to be very true to the MGM classic as much as possible, though not always, but more on that later. However, whether they were trying to do that or not, if you are going to include the Wicked Witch of the West in your Oz movie, you need to try to capture Margaret Hamilton as closely as you can. Let's face it, Mayim Bialik would have made far more sense in this role than Mila Kunis, a young actress best known for her beauty. Mila has some good comedic chops in That 70's Show, and I've liked her in a few other things, and she definitely gives this role her all, even though a lot of the acting in this film is just okay (another issue one might have with it), but, even with an elaborate makeup job, it is... difficult to get into this version of the Wicked Witch. Mila's voice is just too distinctive, and I'd say that is the main problem. Her voice simply does not work as the Wicked Witch of the West. And, speaking of that makeup job... This is a bit sad to say, but here's another place where Raimi just made a bad decision. He likes a lot of makeup on his witches, but this would have worked a lot better with the first concept, a prosthetic nose and chin, and green makeup. Basically putting an entire mask on Mila just didn't look good. She looked like the sister of Jim Carrey IN \\"The Mask\\". So, basically, despite some very cool qualities to match it up with the classic movie, which is what every Oz film is held up to, the biggest problem with this one is the Wicked Witch of the West, particularly her voice and her makeup. Besides that, I mentioned the acting a bit. It was serviceable, and the performers have a certain level of charm that you, as a viewer, may be willing to make allowances for. However, I hope you can do that for another character too. There is a character called \\"China Girl\\" who is basically a living porcelain doll. Sounds creepy, but she is actually very beautiful and sweet, and one of the most sympathetic characters you'll ever see. Yet, shortly after a powerful scene, she is, if briefly, turned into a typically annoying, sassy kid sidekick character. The annoying part doesn't last long, but why do that at all? There were some instances like that, where the modern sensibilities, especially in regards to kid-movie humor, took the film down a notch when it otherwise could have been deemed quite timeless.<br /><br />Still, that's about all I can say that is noteworthy on the subject of flaws. And, even when discussing the acting, especially choosing James Franco to star in the film as Oscar Diggs, well, though Robert Downey Jr. is rumored to have been desired for the role, I'm kinda glad this went to someone like Franco. I love Downey, but I think he could have been too much for this film. I think there is a lot to enjoy in \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\", and even if I didn't love the casting of Kunis, I think the other characters are part of that (Rachel Weisz really steals the show as Evanora), and, it is hard to explain, but I feel like Downey's personality is so big that it would have taken away too much from everything and everyone else in this picture. Anyway, can you imagine Downey becoming the bumbling, embarrassed \\"man behind the curtain\\" of the classic MGM film? I can't, but I can see that character coming from Franco's less enormous personality. So, I'm good with that.<br /><br />Now, as for what's awesome about this movie, where do I start? I mean, visually, it's amazing, but yes, it's a lot of CGI. It kinda works here though. I mean, this film is heavily influenced by the MGM classic, it makes no attempt at hiding that, and that is really what I love most about this movie. And, how did they do the sets in the MGM film? They were clearly right there on a set. They were often performing in front of painted backgrounds. There was just something so beautiful about it that you didn't even notice it much as a kid, or it didn't bother you. And, in some scenes in \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\", it almost seems like they are on the same sets! Some of the Yellow Brick Road scenes, for example, and some of the Emerald City scenes. For fans of the classic film, this SHOULD be quite pleasing. It is nothing like Return to Oz, which was fantastic in its own way, intending to be much closer to the books, and much darker. Like the `39 film, this movie is bright, and colorful, and only a few times can you tell that either they had to change something for legal reasons or they wanted to be truer to the book (probably the first one), such as with Glinda being the Good Witch of the South here instead of the North, and Oscar not coming from the Omaha State Fair here, but in an unmarked balloon from a traveling circus. One can assume that if the famous slippers are mentioned in any sequels, they will probably be silver, like in the book (which would be disappointing; they shelled out a lot of dough to make them ruby slippers in Return to Oz, and that movie wasn't anything like the MGM movie that invented the ruby versions). This movie is FULL of references to the `39 film, and most are quite beautifully and loyally done. As I said, this is a great highlight of the movie! it's why this movie is great! But what really sealed the deal for me was the third act. Remember how amazing the third act of Star Wars Episode 3 was? It set everything up for the classic film we know and love. It was the closest the Star Wars prequels got to the original classics. Well, the third act of \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is that same kind of amazing. We get to see a fantastically written setup, if very Army of Darkness-like, of how Oscar Diggs became the Wizard of Oz in the way we best knew him from the `39 \\"Wizard of Oz\\" film. It's fantastic, even with the awkwardness of Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch. Also, as I mentioned before, Rachel Weisz is just amazing in this. No matter what I might be able to think of to complain about in this film, that final act would make nearly anything worth sitting through. I LOVED that part of this film. But, I liked a lot about the rest of it.<br /><br />Now, before I wrap this up, I don't want to forget to address something. I've seen some of the online reviews. There are those on some video review sites I quite enjoy, who have ranted about how terrible one aspect of this film is, and that's the section, kind of something carried through the film as a plot point, in which Theadora falls in love with Oscar. I've heard ranting about how ridiculous this was, because it happened so fast. These two had just met, and she was immediately in love with him. I'm a bit baffled that net critics I respect would see it this way. It is quite clear, to me anyway, that Theodora was infatuated with Oscar. She believed she was in love with him, but what she loved was the idea of him and the idea of being with him, as he was the man from the prophecy she'd grown up waiting for. She was probably in love with him long before he ever showed up in Oz. She clearly wasn't truly in love with him, anyway, as she quickly turned to hating him. Yes, this was partly due to a curse that destroyed her heart, but it was also because her feelings for him were never truly real. She was like a girl who falls in love with The Beatles or Justin Beiber. She was innocent and not to bright, and she had a great potential for wickedness in her. She was actually very much like Anakin Skywalker, the more I think about it. They're a couple of idiots, really.<br /><br />Anyway, that's the movie, and overall, I really love this one, even with its flaws. All I really wish is that someone else had been cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, or at the very least, that they didn't use full-on face prosthetics. Nevertheless, I recommend this movie very highly.<br /><br />Now, as for the Blu-Ray release, I own the combo pack with DVD and digital copy, and though it stinks when something like this doesn't come with a commentary, I do love the extras that are included. We get fun bloopers, we get a James Franco helmed featurette of interviews with the cast and even director Raimi, and we get a fantastic collection of behind the scenes featurettes. Besides that, we get the great \\"Walt Disney and the Road to Oz\\", which gives us a look at Walt and his company's history with the Oz books and the attempts to turn them into movies. I'm glad they didn't do it in the style of \\"Babes in Toyland\\", as originally planned, though I do wish they'd done an Oz film in the Mary Poppins style, as probably would have happened if Wald hadn't passed away not long after. Another bonus feature is Disney's Second Screen, which I nearly forgot to mention, probably because I have no use for this. It's kinda like making DVD-Rom only extras. I'm just not going to bother with them.<br /><br />And, that's about it! Oz the Great and Powerful, it's got issues, but it's a really great film! I'm so happy to finally own my own copy to watch again and again, and I look forward to the sequels. All the merits of this film make dealing with Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West worthwhile. Take a look at this one if you can, and if you like it, be sure to also see the original classic, not to mention \\"Return to Oz\\" and the animated \\"Journey Back to Oz\\" and \\"Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz\\". And, you also might want to catch James Franco in \\"This Is the End,\\" currently in theaters (though it's NOT a family film like this one). Now, I just wish the ABC Saturday Morning Wizard of Oz cartoon, based specifically on the `39 film, would get a DVD release soon too! I loved that one!s movie is great! But what really sealed the deal for me was the third act. Remember how amazing the third act of Star Wars Episode 3 was? It set everything up for the classic film we know and love.

B00BR5KBU6|1.0|There is so little available on North Korea, and it is an incredibly secretive society.  This offering does not inform the reader.  Nor does it entertain one looking for a good adventure story.  The people of North Korea deserve better.<br /><br />The Koreas will be at the top of our news at some point.  If a reader expected to be better informed by this book, so sorry.  The writer instead chooses to create cartoon characters and situations.  The writer grabs real world events and throws them at paper in with little regard to truth, logic or plot.  He bends truth beyond belief.<br /><br />Jumping about in time and using silly public address announcements that do little to inform the reader.  It reads herky-jerky more like a comic book.  Perhaps the author is attempting to portray the duplicity of North Korean society and leadership.  I don't know.<br /><br />If one wants to be informed on the nation, \\"Escape from Camp 14\\", \\"Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea\\", and \\"The Ginseng Hunter\\" would be much better use of one's time.

1457514508|4.0|Posted First as Book Review: The Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead on Blogcritics.<br /><br />Small towns attract a variety of people for a varied number of reasons. The slow pace and quiet nature of Suburbia is not always the enchanted life of fairytales. Often beneath the demure and polite exterior of hometown events, feelings and petty jealousies rage unabated.<br /><br />A sense of belonging is often why groups are drawn together. In The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club by Duncan Whitehead, we follow an eccentric group of women drawn together by their frequent dog walking activities. Having been friends now for some time, Cindy, Carla and Heidi are true connoisseurs of the culture of the town of Gordonston.  Part of their belonging to the group, of which they are charter members, wine is a prerequisite.  Following the activities as it spirals around them, they revel in the companionship and gossip as any true small town aficionado would.  As they discuss the illness of a dear friend, they alternate between sympathy and moving forward. Each has an agenda that is secret to the other, a vital reason for being.<br /><br />Several young couples find their lives impacted by their own activities, ones they do not realize have an impact that sends ripples through the ether of time. As the friend of the women in the dog walking club dies and her own husband tries to come to terms with her passing, callousness and greed come close to the surface. Will Gordonston remain the charming place it has always been, or will the murky darkness of past exploits and memories tear the veil of innocence.<br /><br />Whitehead has brought us a strangely suspenseful tale that takes you on a journey of history. Delving into the memories of his eclectic cast of characters we are taken to a deep and surprising journey. Red herrings and twisted theories keep you guessing, as you try to remove the masks surrounding the events and people.  As you begin to find yourself drawn to the characters, be prepared to find that not all is what it seems on the surface.<br /><br />If you enjoy romance and suspense you will find this a delightful read. A love of dogs surrounds the character of the story, and a deepening dread will find its way into your mind as you slowly unwind the personalities of the people.  If you enjoy reading about real life and petty jealousies as well as enjoying a good solid mystery, this is the work for you.<br /><br />A great read for a reading group, the events will contain discussion material for some time to come.  This is a fun find for your library.<br /><br />This book was received from the author.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The latest entry in the franchise was D.O.A., just pull the plug. The plot was ridiculous and badly developed. They apparently were aware of this when they made it, and decided that 97 minutes was long enough. They really should have stopped with the third installment. However, the fourth was entertaining for nostalgic purposes, but this one has no reason or soul to it at all.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This CD was all that I expected.  It was nice having him write his own words and music instead of singing others music.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|Ive listened to Black Sabbath ever since i was a toddler and i have to say this album brings me back to the good ol days of music. Keep it comin Sabbath \m/ \m/
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome pretty good graphics the upgrades are cool you can collect gems to save yourself from falling
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I really loved this movie, I was surprised at how good Jamie Foxx was in the title role, but for me the star of the film was the guy who played the bounty hunter.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really enjoyed the game and how much you have to think about what you are doing.  My biggest complaint?  Way too short!  Hope the next room lasts longer than this one.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|My friend loved this movie. She was so excited when she got it for a gift.  Would purchase again.  ok
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy the game it is a lot of fun. The best part is you don't really have to pay to get the cool dragons you can create them instead of paying loads of money. I always look at the reviews as a source so I think this game is great.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The reviews I had read about this movie led me to believe it was a downer.. instead you will find two people who face life's challenges and not let them beat them.. for those who suffer from depression as I have, you will love this movie.  Fantastic!
1444737112|5.0|Absolutely delightful to read-<br />if you love cats, this is a wonderful story about Man and his feline friend.<br />Wishing James Bowen all the best<br />and will probably by all of his books about BOB now!
B004HWT6DO|5.0|Social Network is almost an historical piece about the times we live in of young tech entrepreneurs and Silicon Valley start-ups. Excellent writing, acting, and directing.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|God can move people to do great things. This movie highlights the efforts of William Wilberforce to end the slave trade in England. It is well done and carries the message that there is great cost in doing what is right without the guarantee of reward or success, though Wilberforce does persevere and accomplished his goal. I would recommend this movie for ages 12 and up. Understanding the ideas in the movie requires a mature mind and is not really for younger children (my opinion).
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I thought it was a little hard to follow regarding what you were supposed be after. Found it a bit hard to try and find bonus items.

B0058VW36U|5.0|My 7 & 5 year old grandchildren play this all the time.  Great game and good for eye hand coordination.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Having the Kindle version of Grisham is the only way to go.  You can read it anytime--anyplace.  A book is clumsy to mess with once you've read this way.  I am totally addicted to John Grisham stories and this one again is over the top good.  He is totally contemporary--and I don't have to wade through a bunch of dirty language and filth.
B00A89ITZG|3.0|To the point with good overview of the key drills to focus on. Very straightforward and action oriented. Don't expect much elaboration or review of other opinions. Nutrition section is a somewhat disappointing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow!  I haven't read a John Grisham yet that I didn't love.  What is it about the way he tells these stories?!  They tell the story and reveal the characters so simply and yet come across so intense.  I can hardly put them down.  This one is no exception!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I am loving this guy the more I hear from him, this is a really great album and a good mix of songs, you will not be dissapointed
B003B02O0A|5.0|Another addictive story--I can't put my Kindle down.  I tend to ignore some other books I've downloaded when I get a Grisham.
B0000AQS6R|1.0|I ordered the movie Christmas Vacation and it was suppose to be in very good shape for a used DVD. Well, it has so many scratches on it when I put it in the DVD player it keeps ejecting. I guess I can't complain to much since I only spent 4 dollars on it but when your told it was in very good condition you would think it would at least play. Oh well, live and learn from this mistake.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This was the worst choice in movies I made this year.<br />What a hodgepodge of silly themes. The trailer was the best.
193700788X|1.0|I loved this C. Harris series so much, I recommended it to many of my friends, and to have it end this way was a HUGE disappointment. I didn't really care who she ended up with, that's NOT why I'm so down, but it was the how and why that left me stunned. The plot was mediocre, and there were glaring inconsistencies with canon from previous books. I started this series well before I had even heard of the show, and I enjoyed the humor, and they way she could bring her characters to life. I laughed, loved and grieved with Sookie. In the end, I felt like Sookie hadn't truly grown. What hurt the most was I felt like Sookie was put aside without a fight, like she wasn't the one making the decisions. And Sookie just didn't care. It reeked with apathy, and I can only assume that is because that is how Harris has come to feel about this series.<br /><br />I have read every book C. Harris had published up to Dead Ever After. Now I just don't think I can ever bring myself to read another one again.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|My three grand kids(1, 3 and 5) love it and it is the perfect size for them. Pool could be a little longer where the slide ends but still enjoyed thoroughly by the grand kids.
B00008NRI7|3.0|This is not a top shelf movie by far for it's writing, but well cast to make it one you'll enjoy. Not heavy on the romance or drama, just good clean movie time.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I love Ellen DeGeneres and watch her show every day. I didn't feel like her humor transferred well to the book. She is extremely entertaining and it didn't come across that way in her book. I feel that writing is a whole different genre and not everyone can write a book and be successful at it. She gets and A for effort but needs to stick to what she does best...her talk show.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 4 times,and while I have been known to watch movies more than once, never have I purchased one after the 3rd viewing. It's funny, it's quaint, the scenery is fantastic (even though it isn't really Alaska).  The Indian dance is one of many favorite scenes. Highly recommend this one as a top shelf for your collection!
B00B0TNV5Q|4.0|Definitely not meant to be watched this children as it is full of violence and explicit sexual scenes.  This show is wonderfully written (most of the time) and expertly acted- which is so rare unfortunately for tv that it's popularity has soared just as the expertly written and performed Downton Abbey is.  You would think the popularity of such productions would get producers to see that talent in the writing room and in front of the camera is the thing audiences starve for most, but alas- for every one good show there seems to be a hundred that are terrible.<br /><br />I do love season two, but it moves a little slower than season 1 did.  There are even a couple of episodes where- dare I say it?- things get a little bit boring because there is long stretches of not much story moving along.  But even those episodes aren't bad and the acting remains great.  The full frontal nudity that seems to be required of every female actress on the show becomes a bit comical because there is no real point to it most of the time.  In all the sex scenes the women are completely naked (the young and pretty ones that is) while all the men seem to magically be able to screw with their pants and shoes on. Showing blatant inequality between what is expected of the male actors and what is expected of the female ones.  There is one very brief scene with full frontal male nudity, but it is not sexual and only done once. Also espite this being set in an age where women are expected to stay celibate until marriage (except for the prostitutes), all the unmarried women who are not prostitutes too often show to have no problem having pre-marital sex and quickly succumb when asked. It has gotten so that it's obvious the nudity is just the director and writers wanting to see a new actress's goodies so it takes you out of the production a bit. Perhaps a professional critic said it best QUOTE:  \\"\\"Sometimes Game of Thrones uses sexual scenes to shed light on character. But quite often, it shows naked women because it can. At times, the show appears to be trying to cover up clunky exposition with naked flesh, and at other moments, the vibe comes off as, 'Hey! It's HBO! Here are some boobs!'\\" end quote.<br /><br />But here's the interesting thing... despite all of these distractions from the story, the dialogue is often so good and acted so well that it still remains an amazing show.
B00133KHCY|5.0|The best movie ever made if you appreciate music at all for it's ethereal appeal! This is soon to be a classic...I think the casting director gets an A for this one, too.
B000002LE6|4.0|This has some of Princes most beautiful songs, I wish U heaven being my all time favourite Prince song! Glam Slam,  When 2 are in love, it all just works. Only issue is, weirdly enough, Prince has them all lumped into one song. He obviously wants you to listen to the songs in that order, but kinda annoying if you only want to cherry pick from the album. Regardless, it works. Around the World in a Day is his other album that, IMO, is this album's equal.
0307476073|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Cheryl Strayed's honest, unpretentious writing was a joy to read. She's someone I'd want to be friends with. Her attitude toward life is unusual - she says \\"yes\\" to every opportunity and invitation - sometimes to her own detriment.Yet on balance, her attitude pays off for her. She's also incredibly persistent (how else to accomplish that walk?). But the book is about much more than a long hike with destroyed feet - it's about her relationships. The chapter about her mother's death had me sobbing. I am going to read her first book now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this is the best game I like how it changes places.It gets really competitive I love it when I'm off gymnastics I'm on here best app ever!!!!!!!!!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I've read a few reviews stating that the music is dark and not Zimmer's best work. This is not true. The music is filled with passion, zeal, strength, and is non stop. Like any good soundtrack, it helps the audience envision what is happening during the movie. To me, any piece of music that helps tell the story is A+ in my book. There are only a few composers that can do this well and Hans Zimmer is on that list. Buy this deluxe edition and be happy! I'm certainly glad I pick it up. If you understand the importance of a good musical score is to a great movie, then you will not be disappointed.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!! I love how the battery symbol gives you notifications on how much battery life you have!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I really like Daft Punk and I was excited when I heard that they were coming out with a new album. I wondered what it would sound like as each album is different for the most part. This album is different and I'd put it closer to Discovery than the other albums, but not the same by any stretch of the imagination. Since I purchased this album (pre-order, day of release delivery) I have not taken it out of my car. Amazon provided the MP3s so I could listen at home or at work and so I could keep the disc in my car. I listen to it constantly while driving and unlike other albums of theirs or other artists, I do not get tired of listening to it. Each song is different enough from the last and none of the songs are too repetitive or grating at times. I'm sure that I'll get tired of it eventually, but I have not yet. It may not be an album that everyone likes, but I certainly maintain my love of Daft Punk's music and their ability to do something different.<br /><br />TL:DR - I love it. Can't stop listening to it.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|It does't work like it is suppose to.My battery was almost red and it said it had 9hrs. left.So I suggest you to not waste your money!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the first app I install whenever I get a new device. It has become an extension of my memory. Very easy to use and sync.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A little clumsy getting in to get each individual episode to work.  If the navigation was simpler this would easily be a 5.
B009X01C64|5.0|I chose this case because my son got one for his Kindle Fire and liked it very much.  I like being able to sit it up on a table and read or look at videos.  Or I can fold it back to hold it in my hand while surfing the web or write emails.<br />It is leather and always looks great.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Not only are the graphix cool,  but I like all the info this app gives you. It's  always  good to have data on how your system is working.
B006TVQTHW|4.0|I've had a couple Antec cases over the years, and continue to purchase them for their value. In this case, I was looking for something to hide in the closet as a media server.<br />The Antec Three Hundred Two seemed to fit the bill. Lots of slots for disk drives, and plenty of vents for cooling, including fan mounts in front for blowing across the several hard drives. Adding those fans alone dropped the temps of my drives ~5C.<br />The provided fans on the rear and top are quiet enough on low, but can get a little noisy when notched up to high.<br />I liked the bottom mount space for an SSD, I always thought it was a waste to use up an entire drive slot for a little drive like that.<br /><br />My only complaint is pretty small, but the case does not fit tightly together. Light leaks out the crack between the plastic front panel and the top panel. It seems that this is a common trait for Antec, as my last case (Fusion Silver) did the same thing.<br />Installation was also a process as nothing except the hard drives is tool-less.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend the case as a generic, no-frills case. The price is decent and it gets the job done without any fuss.
B004J09ONG|5.0|i never saw the movie before and it was wonderful the whole story line and it being a true story just was the best good for family of all ages.  glad I saw it finally

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved how the author uses multiple points of view. I felt like I was watching the interviews. But, for all the people who gained star, especially the person who claimed to have \\"extensive knowledge about the civil war\\" should know:<br />1. That MANY things have changed in 150 years.<br />2.you should have paid attention/reread parts that you didn't get.<br />3. PAY ATTENTION TO THE STORY.<br />Good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I like that it take as you different places in the game . I also like the fact that some of the characters are female
B000Y90VO2|5.0|As a foreigner, I saw it many times in Spanish, but in English is even better.<br />My children saw it as well, and although some jokes were either not appropiate or over their heads, they enjoyed most of it as well.<br />Best scene: the entering the Sweden book store. A CLASSIC

B0060MBJCK|5.0|After watching the movie I knew I had to ready this book. Well I finally did, and I am so happy I did. This review won't tell anything useful or new, to be honest, I just can't say anything other than &#34;read this!&#34;

B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|As a hip hop fan and from a hip hop perspective, this album is terrible. I give it a 3 out of 10.<br /><br />New Slaves is packed with a clear message and flows well over the beat. Whether one agrees with the message or not doesn't matter, the record is ambitious.<br /><br />The song Bound feat Charlie Wilson is the only track that is reminiscent of the Kanye sound his fans came to love. It features a classic sample but infuses a new sound as well, plus Ye raps in his typical catchy, funny, and soulful way.<br /><br />On Sight was a good intro to the album and suggested Kanye might revisit the style he displayed on Graduation but that thought vanishes throughout the rest of the album.<br /><br />I don't know enough about rock, alternative, metal, or whatever other genres of music Ye went for on this album to say whether he did his typical \\"genius work\\" on it but I know it didn't connect with me as a listener. Disappointed is an understatement but I have to acknowledge that Mr. West has never been afraid of going in his own direction creatively. I just fear that in an attempt to show how different and \\"god like\\" he claims to be to the rest of the hip hop world, he will end of leaving hip hop altogether for a permanent destination called planet Weirdo, population 1.<br /><br />Let's hope he's saving the good stuff for a Cruel Winter album.<br /><br />P.S.<br />And I'm a HUGE Kanye fan btw.<br /><br />▶ Show quoted text

B004P12SSW|5.0|I don't usually like movies with singing/dancing performances but I loved these two together.  It was pretty well written, and if you are a Cher fan you will fall in love with Christina too.  Awesome songs and performance.
B0064MGU98|3.0|i watch a program for entertainment. After watching most of season one of 'The Good Wife', I was rudely reminded of the entertainment industry's attempt to bring out their left-wing views in the guise of entertainment. Case in point; when a ballistics expert was introduced, a picture of Mrs. Clinton was on the desk behind the character played by Ms Baranski. Upon a visit to the expert's home, there was a picture of the ballistics expert with Sarah Palin. And so the lines are drawn. So far, no problem. That is until Ms Baranski's character said later in the episode referring to Mrs. Palin, quote, \\"She is the devil incarnate.\\", unquote. How absolutely unbelievable that this blatant bias should raise its ugly head in the middle of \\"entertainment\\". Needless to say, Mrs. Clinton came away unscathed.<br /><br />Although now seeing the series through a different, skewed lens, I decided to watch another episode. Again, I saw the ugly head of bias begin to rise this time regarding a cartoon in a newspaper. I stopped watching it. As of today, I will watch no further episodes of 'The Good Wife' just as I have decided to watch fewer and fewer movies whose actors have chosen their access to a microphone as a means of sharing their political views. Surprise! They are all far left of center.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|I admit, I purchased this after her appearance on Dancing with the Stars. It is in a genre of it's own, different, sometimes quirky and lots of fun.  She is a very talented musician with a mind uniquely pushing the edges of the conventional box.
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|This greatly anticipated movie falls very far from the hype that was originally presented to the public.  As a whole the actors try their best to sustain some very chopped up writing.  The story is understandable however I found that it was boring in places with much ado about nothing in other places.  In spots there are nods to the 1939 version however even those a few and several are missed completely.  The bad witches are ok with bit more evil intensions would have been better for the wicked witch.  The Glinda character is way to wishy-washy and sugary.  The 1939 version, Glinda, was a gentle person who would kick arse if needed.  This version is the poor beat upon who cares character.<br />All in all I found this movie missing in many places Giving me the feeling that many interlocking scenes were left on the cutting room floor.  In my opinion if a movie like Harry Potter can run for nearly 4 hours and not be destroyed by cutting then this movie could have run another 20 min. and left in connecting scenes.<br />For the OZ fan, its okay, not great, but is only an appetizer for a Greater \\"OZ Great\\"

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great read!  This story reminded me of myself.  I loved the way Tuck invited them into his life and cared for them as his own.  He saw in them what he had with his Clara for so many years.
006114665X|5.0|This is a top-notch book about a very involved and convoluted subject.  Clark has gone deeply into the various and varying thoughts, communications and actions taken among the governances of Russia, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, and Great Britain (to say nothing of Pasic and the Serbians) and has analyzed the effects of all of them.  Because of all the intertwined political, diplomatic and quasi-military results of the many actions, reactions, and near-actions taken, a horrifying continental war was brought about by governmental leaders on all sides who did not wish to produce such results.  Clark has demonstrated with a fine hand how this all occurred. Particularly useful was the early part of the book describing in considerable and valuable detail the Serbian story that eventually led to the ultimate catastrophe. A great book, and a very entertaining and informative read.

0385535147|5.0|Not every author can pull off a story from first-person, but John Grisham did in this one.  I also liked the way it ended, not leaving you hanging or wondering why it ended that way.  This is another one of his books that should be made into a movie, which has not been done in a while; I would definitely go to the theatre and see it, not wait six months for it to be on pay-for-view.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great value for one of our favorite shows.  Who wouldn't fall in love with these madcap geeks?  Cannot beat the price!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Totally not worth the 5 dollar rental fee... If I could do it again I wouldn't pay the dollar for redbox either... The plot was just a repeat of the same principles over and over with one or two lame jokes in between and the lead actress whining... I appreciate that they wanted to go more in depth with these characters but It would have been nice if the writers themselves hadn't fallen asleep while writing their plot twists and dialogue...

B00336G7HI|5.0|I was concerned after reading some of the reviews about the imposters but this one is genuine.  I have used it and it is just as good as the original that came with my camcorder.  I wanted a backup and this one works well.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great horror story! Each episode is like a horror movie! I could not wait to find out what was going to happen next! It ia a great horror story for those who love old fashion horror with a modern twist!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book so much and have read it at least 5 times! It is a must read for everyone!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I love the story of Les Miserables, however, this was not my favorite telling of the story. Although the words are easy to understand even though sung, I found the music tiresome after awhile. Love Hugh Jackman!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game to pass some time.  Some of the items were difficult to find. G5 games are priced good and they release quite a few.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Many of the issues stated for women can also be stated for minorities. I hope that we all can encourage each other to lean in and actively rebut biases that are damaging and stereotypical.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Really worth the read....makes one appreciate what one has and find oneself in awe of the strength of others.  Funnily enough what should be a sad story leaves one with an envy for the heightened spiritual and emotional growth that others have attained due to strife they have had to endure.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I got this app and used it a few times it is ok but I use my cell phone more.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I really loved this book. It is Well written with a great story line. I have read all Khaled Hosseini's books and this one is my favourite.
1885167776|5.0|It's been a while since I picked up  and read a business book that just made so much sense.  I sent a copy to my nephew who is in his second professional role and finding himself with a lot of questions about how he should spend his time and energies.  I would highly recommend for business and life management in general.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|How long has it been since I saw this movie?  Amazing how many of the lines in this picture are part of our culture today.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.
B003FL4O9E|3.0|Wont be the best best movie ever, but included lots of slap stick comedy and a 2 minute intro paying homage to the great NY Pizza.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Ok I will try to be a little positive , I love the crossfire books series , Gideon and Ava amazing characters book 1 WOW book 2 double WOW. Book 3 WHAT THE HELL.<br />I don't want to be mean but why would you leave us hanging like that, really it made it look like you just got tired and gave up, ok there is more then add more chapters condense it a little make it a 500 page book but don't please don't promise a trilogy and kill the buzz on the 3 rd no nonsense book,<br />I am so sorry especially the price we payed for the let down, to me it's not the 9.99 that is bothering me , it's the wait for something awesome to come just like the 2 previous books , The ending was so horrible I was stunned, speechless , not angry just not expected of this Author SYLVIA WHAT HAPPEN  DID YOU LOOSE THE STORY AND COULD NOT FOCUS???  Because you killed more than 2000 FANS .....
1603425381|5.0|i love all the color photos.  This book was very easy to read. I have already finished the border on a blanket.  I turned out great.
0812993357|5.0|The characters are rather loosely printed which makes the book big.<br />I like the tone of Grace, she sounds humorous and honest.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game has you thinking. I was able to complete the game. It did have me thinking. I cant wait for an update.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|Been waiting for a long time for their new album. Several songs that I personally prefer to others. Love it anyway~
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have had this stylus for a month now and love using it on my Fire HD and original Fire that nephew now uses.  My sisters like to use my stylus on their Kindles too but they will have to get their own.
B00BZF7REQ|5.0|I saw the short film at Met and then decided to purchase this. Quite a collection of great photographs with different editors. I'm really glad to have it. Btw it's so much cheaper than in any stores I've been to:)
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is great as I have to rotate the HD to use it when I am receiving my monthly RA injection.  At first it is hard to turn but once it is broken in it is easier to turn one handed.  I would recommend this case to others as it is a great protective cover and  stand for the 7&#34;Fire HD.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm reading this book series because I found out there are movies being made. The plot is kind of confusing so I accept the cause for certain events as author's choice. Time to read the final installment.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although it is very heartbreaking, this book is worth the pain. The Fault in Our Stars will keep your eyes glued to the pages with every addicting word.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Pc is Much beater, because u have villages and stuff, strong holds,dungeons,mushroom islands,,and u can use presents and it is beater, but this is pretty cool.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Even though this season is not as good as the first 2, it is still an amazingly creative show.  I am always amazed at the creative disgusting things that happen.  I think to myself....who thought of that?  A sick mind really.  And I love it.
044024238X|4.0|If you don't like housework and want a break from serious lit-er-a-ture, you might try this book on for size.  You will sympathize with formerly employed lawyer Samantha Sweeting who just got fired, hopped a train to who-cares-where, and ends up on the doorstep of a somewhat insufferable couple who think she's their new housekeeper.<br /><br />Samantha has to fake cleaning and cooking while she bides her time trying to figure out what to do next with her life.  Fortunately there's an attractive gardener who can help her out.  This is a great summer read and pure escapism.  If you want some silly fun, and want to feel better about not being a domestic goddess, this book should cheer you up.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Can't imagine what they went through, the recreation was amazing!  Very inspiring movie, so nice to know it was a true story and actually had a miracle for an ending.  Enjoyed it very much.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Ezra Miller is mesmerizing.  Every movie he has made has you wondering... who is this kid?  He is a truly talented actor with a lot of charisma.  Emma Watson proves she can be someone else other than Hermione Granger.  The main character, Logan Lerman does a great job of playing the subdued, tortured kid and will have you looking for his name in other movies.  But again, nobody is as awesome as Erza!  Hands down, this movie is great.
B00A44HRG2|5.0|Let's you see other country s or even your own. Really cool, some of the cameras are sketchy . I found surveillance cams for a printing shop and a guy was working xD
0143038583|5.0|The book came very quickly as I ordered a 2 day shipping. I needed it for class. But on the quality of the book it was great and totally worth it. Would highly recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|Good book I am sure, his previous one were very good..  I have not read it yet. Looking forward to reading it when time arises!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|A friend asked me to read the book so we could discuss it.  She said that &#34;everyone&#34; was reading it.  So I did.  The first part of the book seemed rather cliche to me and ordinary, but I read on assuming that it must have an unusual ending for my friend to have recommended it to me.  I suppose that was the author's ploy to have us begin by thinking this was a routine murder case of some kind, but I kept wondering what would turn this mundane story into something better.  Instead it turned into something worse.  I could not appreciate the vulgar language that was used at times.  I don't know whether the author offers us insight into the way some people think or not, but on the whole I didn't really like the book and won't be picking up books by this author again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy to learn. Really keeps your attention. Good for those that don't consider themselves tech savvy. Sound can be nerve wracking but you can always turn that off.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Easy to follow. I love the story l line. Even my husband stood behind me wondering what is going to happen next. This is my first time playing a game like this. I'm glad this is the one I chose. My husband wants to play it next.
1480054542|3.0|This is a story about a young woman who has lived a difficult life and who is relocating to a new town. It's a good story, with detailed and well written characters, with only a few content/technical errors. Unfortunately, the characters failed to draw me into the story. I didn't feel compelled to continue reading to find out what, if anything, was going to happen. I don't usually read romance novels because I find myself waiting for something exciting to happen and it doesn't, unless you're interested in sexual encounters, which are exciting by nature, but not necessarily interesting and don't help to move the story along in a meaningful way.<br /><br />When something exciting did happen which ended up being very predictable, it wasn't until the very end and, after reading the entire novel, it was too little too late to a be satisfying conclusion.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Not just a boring match three.I like how you help build tree of life.if you are looking for a game that will make you want to try one more level this is one of those.you will get moneys worth.now I have to get back to the game.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Good acting, interesting story line full of secrets. Definitely a different take on the supernatural movies and shows of late.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Maybe not the best action movie ever made. Fast paced, action packed & funny. Worth it just for John Malkovich.
B003HARV98|5.0|Why isn't this band better known? It's a great CD has fantastic songs from beginning to end. Check it out I promise it won't disappoint!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Definitely not the greatest. But, wonderful to see actions stars in one movie. Far fetched plot, but who cares I liked it.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|Kind of an expensive app to not keep updated. I sure do hope I can eventually play beyond the tutorial.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Awesome book.. Loved it.  Being from the Boston area, nice to read the book set in Newton.  I wish I could find another book like this one.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It is a well-made movie. Good acting. Provides a good picture of Los Angeles during gang wars of early 1900's.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like the daily reading plan and  I also like the ease which with one can read different versions. It is  very easy to use this version.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Both my five year old son and I enjoy playing this game! The challenges are fun and we both like hidden picture puzzles - plus it's free and will never be &#34;over&#34; so we can play it any time and not worry about getting to the end!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like everybody else, I was a bit ticked off by the long wait, and after reading a few of the negative reviews, I was really not looking forward to read it, but I loved it! Ms. Day - you did it again! Not sure where all the negative reviews come from! I love the fact that the other characters were developed some more! Love the twists! Most of the character developments have been eluded to in the second book - we all knew that her parents were going to hook up after that encounter! Not sure how she is going to work in the Russian Mob angle, but I am looking forward to finding out (hopefully there won't be a year long wait). Loved it! Excited for more!!!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|It is what it is, just OK except for one or two cuts, which were better.<br />Just not all that impressed.
030746363X|5.0|Tim digs deep to replace conventional assumptions with better ones. With time management and focus on the important aspects of life, we should be able to get a lot more done in a normal week.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A staple of science fiction, I relish each opportunity to return to this insightful comment on intelligence and the struggles of character development.
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|This has been very enjoyable to read to my grandson and we will be reading more. Again he is seven years old and is visiting for 4 weeks and we read every night.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the kindle app. The feature of having my kindle books right on my phone with me even without my kindle is great.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Whether 15 or 50 this book is simply necessary. It's about breaking out, reframing and transforming - and oh yes it starts with self! The read is a toughie if you are looking for the fairy godmother 'out there' somewhere - but at the same time pretty liberating - the rules really have changed and so must we.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|love jewel games. I like this one so far the best. I haven't purchased any jewel games, but for a free game this one is the best.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I knew I would love this, but I didn't know how much. I loved the raw emotion all the way through this movie. They all did such a wonderful job of ripping the emotions from me as well. Anne Hathaway, even though she had such a relatively short part in the movie, had the most powerfully-emotional song, I Dreamed a Dream. I could just feel everything she was saying. This is so much more than a musical. The acting was great. After watching this, I can't imagine anyone else in these roles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because it is just like temple run and it just has a different background and it should exercise the kids brain
B0002YLC24|4.0|In ancitipation of going to see \\"Before Midnight\\" in the next day or so, I wanted to watch \\"Before Sunset\\" again. I hadn't seen it since I saw it in the theatres back in 2004.<br /><br />In \\"Before Subset\\" (2004 release; 80 min.), Jessie (Ethan Hawke) is on a book tour in Paris, and Celine (Julie Delpy) comes to the book store where Jessie is speaking. After the event, Jessie has about 90 min. before he needs to go to the airport to catch his plan back to New York (the movie is brought in real time, a rarity these days). Jessie and Celine decide to go take a walk in Paris, get a coffee, and catch up on the last nine years since their one night in Vienna (\\"Before Sunrise\\").<br /><br />Several comments: this movie has held up very well. I liked it better than \\"Before Sunrise\\" when I first saw it, and I still feel that way today. The script is co-written by director Richard Linklater and the co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. In my opinion, there is one thing in the movie that does not resonate with me: these 2 people have not seen each other for 9 years and are catching up on everything. hence does it seem normal or logical to you that it takes 40 min. into the movie before Celine asks Jessie about his personal life (\\"so I read you are married and have a kid\\")? Not to me. Under those circumstances, it would probably be one of the first questions people would ask of each other. But aside that, the script is pretty much perfect. The movie shines in the last 20 min. as all of the emotions are released. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Celine finally gives in to Jessie's request to sing a song. She picks up her guitar and brings \\"Let Me Sing You a Walz\\". Bottom line: this movie is a rarity in US cinema: strictly a talk movie, where literally NOTHING happens, other than two people talking with each other for the entire movie. And not only that, but you care about these characters and are invested in them so much that you don't want it to end. I am SO looking forward to seeing \\"Before Midnight\\". Meanwhile, \\"Before Sunset\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!forward to seeing \\"Before Midnight\\". Meanwhile, \\"Before Sunset\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|When I want to shut off my monkey brain and mindlessly match 3, I play this game. I play in the untimed mode for added zen. This game is pretty and when I'm playing it, I'm only focused on patterns and matching 3 items, which I find mentally soothing. Also: it has fairies that build houses in the trees. They're adorable. And the tree has sparkly things in it. I'm not made of stone, people. :)
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The first half of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is fun, compelling, and quite well written. The mystery of what happened to the protagonist's grandfather, first in the refugee home where as a young man he had spent the early years of WWII, then in the final days of his life, and how these are connected, drives the reader through chapter after chapter. It's most very well written, with some novel and excellent turns of phrase (comparing a beautiful morning to a sample desktop picture on a new computer, for example). And the mostly subtle but totally valid parallels between the experiences of Jews in Germany before and during the war, with the experiences of the mysterious creatures our protagonist Jacob finds in the present day. It's better written and more sophisticated than, say The Passage, or The Hunger Games, or Harry Potter.<br /><br />So why not five stars? The photos were gimmicky to my taste, and the story became much more predictable and conventional towards the end. That said, the book ends in a cliffhanger, and I enjoyed it enough that I expect to read the sequel when it is released.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I play Scribblenauts with my 7-year-old son, and I love that it reinforces spelling while teaching children to creatively use adjectives. My son and I love reading and writing, and this is an excellent game for building both skills in kids, as well as teaching problem solving skills as you try to help the main character figure out solutions and achieve his goals to earn the &#34;starite&#34; and move up to the next level. I can't recommend this cute game enough.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br /><br />I like games that you need go figure out how to make things work - this one came through as not too difficult and not frustrating although it was way too short and I hope they do update it to add more levels. Definately recommend this game!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I downloaded this game because my 7-year-old son used to play it online before the Ninja Kiwi website gave our desktop computer a virus that destroyed it. A computer technician was able to salvage my son's baby pictures off the hard drive, and then we had to throw the computer away. Mean virus. In short: Warning for parents: Don't let your kids play games on the Ninja Kiwi website! The website also led my young son to some YouTube videos of teenaged boys teaching kids how to play certain video games... while using a full range of curse words like mother-eff-blank, which I found disturbing.<br /><br />Because of my negative experiences with the Ninja Kiwi website (ad and virus-ridden, content safe for teens only), I was happy to find a safe version of this game my son loves to play. It's a cute game that involves popping balloons, and he often chooses it during the one hour of screen time per day we allow him.
B0038TWHP6|4.0|This is a wonderful, historical take on the Irish struggle for independence.  Only one thing that bothered me... If I'm not mistaken, the character &#34;Kitty&#34; was made up/fictional?
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great user interface and I love all the different options for download including as MP3 so u can import it to your music library.
0062238868|5.0|Everything arrived quickly and was as described.  We have been using it as much as possible and will continue to do so.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I bought three of these, two like this and one of the micro-SD only version. Wow. I now can take all my cards with me whenever I travel, and I have each card's contents annotated on the back of the DiMeCard. It couldn't be easier or more convenient, and these replace the plastic bag I carried previously.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|For me, this app is very useful because often I make purchases on Amazon and through her I have easy access from my various appliances (often bought on Amazon) for various news and recommendations for new purchases.<br />for me, this app is OK.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am absolutely ADDICTED to this series, and it's related HBO show.  Book Two is brilliantly written in colorful prose that immerses you in the tormented world of Westeros.  His style of focusing on one primary character per chapter does take a bit of getting used to; once you realize these chapters may cover hours, or days, weeks and months of the characters lives - AND that things in your current chapter are happening concurrently with events in others - you start to really enjoy the storytelling.  They're more akin to short vignettes, then a pause with a &#34;Meanwhile, back in King's Landing, Sansa...&#34;<br /><br />Love it! Onto Book Three!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love any thing that is a logic type of puzzle. Really hoping that they will add more levels to this game.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Judy Dench, Maggie Smith and the rest of the cast give an unforgettable performance as retirees who are enticed to spend their &#34;golden&#34; years in India.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|On my kindle fire it wont like let me swipe. I just die. Its WAY more complicated than temple run.Yeah I really wanted a second TR and it was what I wanted for my list of new games after minecraft TU12 and BO2. Too hard If I had to echoes 1 or 2, id chose 1
B00ADS90EQ|3.0|Kind of fun. It's like a typical teen drama, but with better writing and great music. If you like Glee, you'll probably like this too.
B004GYY714|5.0|Excellent app, very surprising listing of stations something like 70K I believe. The clarity of stations is superb, and I've not encountered any interference/noise. Another excellent freebie app.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game itself is interesting enough. The mini games are really entertaining as well. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys easy and mindless fun!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I read this book as a child and I loved it.  Re-reading it as an adult and I still love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I put off reading this book for a while. Everyone was talking about it. Finally broke down and decided give it a try. Loved the book. I could re-read the entire series.
B003O5MO2A|5.0|This is one of the best live albums easily for rock and roll. Saw them in 76,77 at the long beach arena , ca. They put on back then spectacular shows with the worlds largest laser light show on top of that. Every song on this album is fantastic. Real musicians for a change.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of the books.  After reading this book I wanted to read the series all over again.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|the movie was real good the shows game of thrones is out of this word and i cant wait tell thew next one comes out. the show the borgia,s is realy good as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love all three books!  I enjoyed reading as the character Grey develops within the series. I could re-read these books any time.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|Similar storyline as the first one, but if you liked that, you'll like Hangover 2. \\"Bangkok has got him now!\\"
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am a pinterst fanatic. The app allows me to browse and pin whatever is appealing.  A lot of spare time used up!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Awesome game I love it =]. Have no problems with the game I like the game a lot. A must get!<br />Enjoy playing.
B00CW665VI|4.0|We've all read the story about the \\"good girl\\" who, against her better judgement, falls for the \\"bad boy\\". The man-whore. The one guy that she knows will probably break her heart in the end, but she still hopes that somehow, someway, he'll realize that all he needs to complete his life is her and they'll live happily ever after.<br /><br />This is that story, straight from the man-whore's mouth.<br /><br />Drew Evans is the ultimate playboy. He's got the looks, the money, the killer apartment, and all the women he could ever want falling at his feet. In fact, he makes a point to never see the same chick twice. His attitude: been there, done that (literally). All of that changes when he meets Kate Brooks, he just doesn't know it yet.<br /><br />This book was hilarious. Everything that Drew said, be it out loud or in his head, had me cracking up. He was cocky, arrogant, and a bit of a douche, but the dude was a freaking riot. And as much as I couldn't help but like him, I have to admit that it was kind of awesome to watch him get knocked off of his high horse. What is it that they say? The bigger they are, the harder they fall? Yeah, well, as far as egos go, you won't find one much bigger than Drew Evans'.  Can anyone say \\"Timber!\\"?<br /><br />And I really liked that Kate was a strong female character. She was intelligent and strong-willed, and she could dish it out as well as she could take it. At one point she and Drew have this knock down, drag out, War of the Roses-type epic battle of wits that is absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />If you're looking for something light to read this summer, this is your book. Tangled was a quick, fun read. It wasn't complex or particularly deep, but it was extremely entertaining.<br /><br />Originally posted on brilliantlynovel.wordpress.com
B0045LSIRM|5.0|...or Bryan Adams for that matter you'll love this album. Sure songs are similar to the unplugged and live! Live! Live! Album but I still regret I didn't take the time to see him in concert when he was in the area after hearing this disc. You'll also get some new songs and a few jokes with the audience that makes this album so nice even if the songs are recorded from different venues (but you can't tell unless you look at the booklet). PS: Amazon's autorip for this CD let's you enjoy the songs before the disc arrives days later which is a great way to buy CD's !
B00BDSRISA|5.0|This album has so much energy and great music.  It should win Academy awards.  I'm now a huge fan of Phoenix!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like the game a lot, the gyro controls are kinda touchy if your not holding your device just the to right way
B004GYY714|5.0|Was using Pandora when I found this app.  So easy to use, and LOTS of radio stations; I did not realize there were so many local radio stations.  I have not explored all the options, but it does look like you can find radio stations from all over the world.  Highly recommneded for anyone who has a favorite radio station they want to listen to while they are 'on the go'.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I had seen this movie on our laptop during a recent road trip. I loved it. Although I did not entirely believe how Bradley Cooper's character went from being &#34;crazy&#34; over his cheating wife to walking away after talking to her at the dance contest. I wish we could have seen into his mind when he knew he was falling in love with ....whatever the name of his co star is. I am terrible when it comes to names of characters in shows or movies.
